Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, a new 1500 m, approximately 40,000 year old ice core will be recovered from South Pole during the current 2014-2015 austral summer season (to ~ 700 m) and next 2015-2016 austral summer season (~ 700 m to 1500 m) using the new U.S. Intermediate Depth Drill. The combination of low temperature, relatively high accumulation rate, and low impurity concentrations at South Pole will yield a detailed record of atmospheric trace gases. The South Pole ice core will also provide a record of the climate history of a unique area of the East Antarctic plateau that is partly influenced by weather systems that cross the West Antarctic ice sheet. The South Pole ice core site is at a flank site where the ice flows at approximately 10 m/yr. The ice core recovered originated as snow at progressively greater distances from the coring site. New ground-penetrating radar collected over the drill site location shows no anthropogenic influence over the past ~50 years or upper 15 m. In this submission, we describe the climate and glaciologic setting of the South Pole, and the details of the ultimate coring site.",

            "abstract": "Wildfires are one of the primary sources of combustion-derived, polycondensed aromatic molecules known as black carbon (BC) in the environment. BC can be mobilized from soils and char in fire-affected aquatic systems, potentially impacting downstream water quality. The High Park Fire burned over 87,000 acres of the Cache La Poudre River watershed in Larimer County, Colorado during June of 2012. Since the Cache La Poudre River serves as one of the main sources of drinking water for the city of Fort Collins, the implications of pyrogenic organic matter inputs to such waterways must be assessed. The export of BC in both the dissolved (DBC) and particulate (PBC) phases from the Cache La Poudre River was measured biweekly at two downstream fire-affected sites and one upstream unburned reference site during the year following the High Park Fire. Both DBC and DOC concentrations were low during base flow and increased with spring melt and increasing water discharge. Seasonal changes in DBC composition indicated a shift in hydrology and associated DOM source between base and peak flow conditions. However, there was little difference observed in overall DBC or DOC concentration between the burned and reference sites. This suggested that most dissolved organic matter within the river is sourced upstream. Although the mobilization of DBC did not notably increase with recent fire activity, PBC export was substantially greater at fire affected sites when compared with the unburned site. This indicates that BC export in riverine ecosystems occurs mainly in the particulate phase during the years immediately following a significant wildfire event, while the mobilization of the DBC may be uncoupled from the PBC due to mobilization processes acting on different time scales.",

            "abstract": "Most studies of shear-wave splitting identify one dominant fast direction. Two directions of splitting were observed for events in the 2005 Alpha, Idaho earthquake swarm. This tectonic sequence was particularly shallow (most depths < 4 km). S-wave recordings are unusually complex. Identification of S-wave onsets is usually very difficult, even at distances less than 6 km.\nThe shear-wave window for observing S-wave splitting from shallow events is very short, but at least one station was usually within that distance. Horizontal hodograms indicate that two non-orthogonal directions of splitting exist. Comparison with local topography, mapped faults, earthquake T-axes, and local surface joint azimuths leads to two potential correlations. One direction of splitting may correspond to an older stress direction matching local topography and one peak in joint azimuths. The other may be aligned with the current stress direction, nearby Tertiary faults, and another peak in joint azimuths. The two directions differ by about 45 degrees, in approximate agreement with the hodograms.\nThe two splitting directions qualitatively support the seismogram complexity. Each leads to a fast and a slow S-wave pulse. The shallowness of the sources is already likely to result in seismograms rich in reflections, and two splitting directions will double the number of S arrivals. At short distances the energy distribution among increased numbers of arrivals is likely to decrease peak ground motions derived from simple models that do not take anisotropy into account.",

During the second campaign in January 2014 Solar Energetic Proton (SEP) events were detected in the BARREL payloads as they produced atmospheric x-rays, γ-rays, and directly injected protons observed by the scintillator on the BARREL payloads. A total of 6 payloads were up during the event beginning 7 January with an X-class flare at 1832 UT, spread across a wide range of L and MLT. Payload 2I was on open field lines for the entire event while 2T (2W) crossed from open (closed) to closed (open) field lines over the course of the three day event. Payloads 2K and 2L were moving from the inner magnetosphere (L ~ 4) to higher field lines (L>6) while 2X stayed within the inner magnetosphere (L<6) for the entire event. Throughout this time, there were multiple conjunctions with the Van Allen Probes and good agreement with when (UT) and where (L-values) the energetic protons were observed, both in situ and at the balloons. In this poster we consider the transport of the protons from the sun and through the magnetosphere and eventual precipitation observed by the BARREL balloons.",

            "abstract": "Global change processes are significantly altering key ecosystem processes in arid ecosystems. Such phenomena are also likely to influence the functional behaviors of resident soil microbial communities, and the magnitude of biogeochemical processes, including, soil organic matter turnover, soil nutrient cycling and soil carbon storage. To assess the aggregate influences of tree mortality, woody plant encroachment, fire, and drought, on soil microbial community activity and functionality, we collected soil samples from beneath plant canopies, and from adjacent bare soils. We sampled from two different piñon-juniper woodland sites. One had many dead piñons, while the other did not, a burned and an unburned grassland, a shrub site, a shrub/grass ecotone, and a juniper savannah. We analyzed eleven soil physicochemical properties, none of which showed any significant trends across our different sampling locations, fungal biomass, and the activities of alanine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, β-D-glucosidase, and β-N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAGase). One-wayANOVA results showed that enzyme activity patterns were largely consistent across field sites, while multivariate analyses showed a variety of interactive responses by individual enzymes,with respect to disturbance events. For example, at the burned grassland, all four enzymes activities were strongly correlated, while at the unburned grassland, relationships between peptidase:NAGase and peptidase:β-D-glucosidase were weak, with both R2 ≤ 0.08. Additionally in the shrub-grass ecotone, the correlation among enzyme activities and soil nutrient availabilities were up to 8x stronger than those observed at either grassland site. These results show that disturbance alters the number of functional dimensions needed to describe enzymatic C, N and P acquisition, which may be an indication of shifts in microbial community organization.",

            "abstract": "Injection of CO2 into low permeability shale formations leads to additional gas recovery and reduces the flux of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus combining a strong economic incentive with a permanent storage option for CO2. Reduced formation transmissivity due to clay swelling is a concern in CO2-enhanced gas production. Clay minerals partly determine the physical (i.e. permeability, brittleness) and certain chemical properties (i.e. wetting ability, gas adsorption) of shales, and montmorillonites are of particular interest because they swell by the uptake of species in their interlayer. In this study, the hydration and expansion of a Na-saturated montmorillonite (Na-SWy-2) in high-pressure (90 bar) and moderate temperature (50 °C) methane and mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide were investigated using in situ IR spectroscopic titrations and in situ XRD. The goals were to (1) determine if the hydration/expansion behavior of the clay in supercritical methane is different than in supercritical CO2, (2) determine if methane intercalates the clay, and (3) probe the effects of increasing CO2 concentrations. IR spectra were collected as Na-SWy-2 was titrated with water under several fluid exposures: pure methane, 25, 50, and 75 mole% CO2 in methane, and pure CO2. Complementary in situ XRD experiments were conducted in the same fluids at discrete dissolved water concentrations to measure the d001 values of the clay and thus its volume change on hydration and CH4 and/or CO2 intercalation. In pure methane, no direct evidence of CH4 intercalation was detected in CH bending or stretching regions of the IR spectra. Similarly, in situ XRD indicated the montmorillonite structure was stable in the presence of CH4 and no measurable changes to the basal spacing were observed. However, under low water conditions where the montmorillonite structure was partially expanded (~sub 1W), the IR data indicated a rapid intercalation of CO2 into the interlayer, even with fluid mixtures containing the lowest concentrations of CO2. Likewise, in situ XRD showed indirect evidence of CO2 intercalation from an increase in the basal spacing from 11.8 to 12.3 Å under identical conditions. These findings demonstrate that water and CO2 intercalation processes could lead to permeability changes that directly impact methane transmissivity in shales.",

            "abstract": "Increased accuracy of snowpack measurements can potentially greatly improve planning for rest-of-year water allocations, particularly when coupled with improvements in hydrologic modeling skill. In California, the degree to which investments in improved hydrologic information systems, such as wireless sensor networks, is worth the cost remains poorly quantified. We conducted a numerical study to assess the value of improvements in snowpack measurements and hydrologic prediction for a single representative hydropower system in the Sierra Nevada considering different measurement and prediction accuracy levels and prediction intervals. Additionally, we examined the value of these improvements for a range of different infrastructure, operational, and hydrologic characteristics, such as reservoir capacity, hydropower capacity, electricity demand, instream flow requirements, and hydrologic regime. Operations were represented with a linear programming model using hydrologic information inaccuracy mimicked by perturbing assumed known hydrologic conditions. Results demonstrate that under current system physical and operational characteristics, improved snowpack estimation and hydrologic prediction generally improve optimal hydropower management compared to current estimation capabilities, particularly in drier years. However, improvements vary by infrastructure characteristics, as well as by management and hydrologic assumptions, such as energy demand and hydrologic stationarity. This approach and the specific results presented will help resource managers understand where investments in hydrologic sensor network and prediction systems will be most beneficial.",

            "abstract": "Here we present noise mitigation techniques developed as part of an adaptive controller for a very compact Compositional InfraRed Interferometric Spectrometer (CIRIS) implemented on a stand-alone field programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture with emphasis on space applications in high radiation environments such as Europa. CIRIS is a novel take on traditional Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS) and replaces linearly moving mirrors (characteristic of Michelson interferometers) with a constant-velocity rotating refractor to variably phase shift and alter the path length of incoming light. The design eschews a monochromatic reference laser typically used for sampling clock generation and instead utilizes constant time-sampling via internally generated clocks. This allows for a compact and robust device, making it ideal for spaceborne measurements in the near-IR to thermal-IR band (2-12 µm) on planetary exploration missions. The instrument’s embedded microcontroller is implemented on a VIRTEX-5 FPGA and a PowerPC with the aim of sampling the instrument’s detector and optical rotary encoder in order to construct interferograms. Subsequent onboard signal processing provides spectral immunity from the noise effects introduced by the compact design’s removal of a reference laser and by the radiation encountered during space flight to destinations such as Europa. A variety of signal processing techniques including resampling, radiation peak removal, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), spectral feature alignment, dispersion correction and calibration processes are applied to compose the sample spectrum in real-time with signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) performance comparable to laser-based FTS designs in radiation-free environments. The instrument's FPGA controller is demonstrated with the FTS to characterize its noise mitigation techniques and highlight its suitability for implementation in space systems.",

Previous works have investigated differences in performance among melt approaches of various complexity and concluded that models that are only dependent on air temperature might be oversensitive to temperature fluctuations compared to models with a stronger physical basis. However, the validity of those analyses has been restricted to the point-scale and to few seasons. We therefore investigate the performance of five distributed glacier melt models over a multi-decadal period in order to assess their ability to model long-term and future glacier response. The models range from a simple degree-day model based solely on air temperature to more sophisticated models including the full shortwave radiation balance. In addition to the empirical models, the performance of a physically-based energy-balance model (EB) is examined. The melt models are coupled to an accumulation and a surface evolution model and applied in a distributed manner to Rhonegletscher (Switzerland). The models are run for the period 1929-2012 and forced with hourly data from a nearby weather station. For calibration, seasonal mass balance measurements covering the period 2006-2012 are used. Decadal ice volume changes for six periods in the years 1929-2012 serve for model validation. Over the period 2006-2012, almost no differences in performance among the models are evident except for EB, which is less consistent with observations likely due to lack of meteorological in-situ input data. However, simulations over the long-term (1929-2012) reveal that models which include a separate term for shortwave radiation agree best with the observed ice volume changes, indicating that their melt relationships are robust in time and thus most appropriate for long-term modelling. In contrast, more empirical approaches considerably overestimate the observed changes and are only able to reproduce the ice volume changes of the most recent subperiods with sufficient accuracy. This seems to confirm their oversensitivity to temperature variations and indicates that care should be used when choosing surface melt approaches for long-term simulations and studies of glacier response to climate.",

            "abstract": "Catchment hydrogeochemists have long been puzzled by the ‘chemostatic’ behavior of rivers: solute concentrations remain nearly invariant while discharge fluctuates several orders of magnitude. Past studies have tended to focus on stream chemistry measurements. Little attention has been paid to source waters (i.e. groundwater). In this study, we simultaneously monitored water chemistry of stream and groundwater at 1-3 days intervals for four years in the Elder Creek catchment, the Eel Critical Zone Observatory, California. At our study site, all runoff occurs as groundwater flow. During the winter high-flow regime, cation (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Ba and Sr) concentrations in stream and groundwater were remarkably similar throughout the study period and were 5-100 times higher than that of throughfall. In contrast, during the low-flow regime, the cation concentrations in groundwater were higher than that in stream, and concentration differences varied by element. We propose that during the high-flow regime, rainwater rapidly increases solute concentrations by cation exchange reactions enhanced by pCO2 in the vadose zone, recharging groundwater and draining into the stream. During the dry season, groundwater reaches thermodynamic equilibrium with the argillite, particularly with carbonates, at high pCO2. As this groundwater enters the stream, CO2 degasses and consequently carbonates precipitate, decreasing Ca, Mg, Sr and Ba concentrations at the hillslope-stream interface. These cation concentrations are further decreased as carbonates likely mediated by biology-induced processes. These observations suggest that the apparent chemostatic behavior of Elder Creek does not arise from the failure of high flows to progressively dilute, as concentration in the creek and in the source groundwater are quite similar. Rather at progressively lower flow, stream concentration does not increase to match the low flow concentration in the groundwater. Instead as groundwater emerges, degassing and precipitation causes concentrations to drop and depress concentration increase with decreasing flow in the creek. This process can only be assessed by direct measurement of source groundwater: even emergent spring water will have already degassed and loss solutes to precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The modern Southern Ocean is a key area for the global ocean circulation as wind-driven mixing, upwelling and redistribution of water masses in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) all have a significant impact on the properties and flow patterns of global water masses. It has been suggested that the Southern Ocean plays a critical role in oceanographic and climatic changes observed on glacial-interglacial timescales, in particular with respect to carbon sequestration between the deep ocean and the atmosphere.\nFor the purpose of unravelling Southern Ocean water mass composition at intermediate depth during the past 30 kyrs, we here utilise the Nd isotopic composition of the aragonitic skeletons of solitary deep-sea corals. These corals were collected from two locations, the Drake Passage and the area south of Tasmania, and from water depths between 300 and 1750 m. Modern coral specimen were calibrated against nearby seawater.\nNeodymium was collected from the wash fraction of the anion-exchange column, which represents the first step in preparing samples for precise U-series dating. Subsequent Nd separation utilised a two-stage ion chromatography (RE-spec/cation exchange and Ln-spec resins). Isotopic analyses were performed as NdO+ on a Triton TIMS using a TaF5 activator on W filaments yielding 2σ external reproducibilities of ~20 ppm.\n(Sub-) millenial scale deep-sea coral neodymium isotope results from the Drake Passage suggest that the modern homogenous ACC neodymium isotopic composition of εNd≈ -8 is a very recent feature. During the past 30 kyrs Nd isotope variability on the order of two epsilon units are observed at intermediate water depths as well as repeated changes in water column stratification. We will discuss our new results in the context of other Southern Ocean records, as well as preliminary Nd isotope data from glacial to deglacial deep-sea corals from south of Tasmania in order to constrain the last glacial to deglacial circum-Antarctic Nd isotope evolution.",

            "abstract": "We simulate electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, which were observed during June 9, 2001 by Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) spacecraft. First we use a ring current simulation with a plasmasphere model to model the particle populations that give rise to the instability. Then, using two different models for the cold ion composition, we do a full scale hybrid code simulation in dipole coordinates of the EMIC waves on a meridional plane at MLT = 18 and at 1900 UT within a range of L shell from L = 4.9 to 6.7. While an exact comparison between observed and simulated spectra is not possible here, we do find significant similarities between the two, at least in certain regions. We simulate the EMIC wave growth and evolution within three regions, the plasmasphere (or plasmaspheric plume), the plasmapause, and the low density plasmatrough outside the plasmapause. We find that the plasmapause is not a preferred region for EMIC wave growth, though waves can grow in that region. There is a preference for EMIC waves to be driven in the He+ band (frequencies between the O+ and He+ gyrofrequencies) within the plasmasphere, although they can also grow in the plasmatrough. If present, H+ band waves are more likely to grow in the plasmatrough. This fact, plus L dependence of the frequency and possible time evolution toward lower frequency waves can be explained by a simple model. Large O+ concentration limits the frequency range of or even totally quenches EMIC waves. This is more likely to occur in the plasmatrough at solar maximum. Such large O+ concentration significantly affects the H+ cutoff frequency, and hence the width in frequency of the stop band above the He+ gyrofrequency. EMIC wave surfaces predicted by cold plasma theory may not be valid.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical data from the Galileo and Cassini-Huygens missions are consistent with the presence of aqueous subsurface oceans in several icy satellites of the solar system. The generic structural model of ocean-harboring icy moons has stood for decades: in the H2O unary system, the density contrasts between the liquid and the ice polymorphs imply that an aqueous ocean will sink relatively to an ice Ih surface layer but will be buoyant against high-pressure ices. However, high-pressure experiments in water-salt systems of interest to outer solar system bodies (e.g. the H2O-MgSO4 and H2O-NaCl systems) illustrated different density contrasts between brines and ices, thus questioning this structural paradigm [1,2]. To determine whether an ocean may be stable below a specific ice layer, composition-density data alone are not sufficient and must be coupled to solubility constraints. At any brine-ice boundary, the density of the liquid may only exceed that of the ice phase if its contaminants are soluble enough, i.e. if the eutectic composition of the water-salt system at the specific P-T conditions of the boundary allows the critical density to be achieved [3]. However, the exploration of liquid-ice equilibria in water-salts systems of interest is still incomplete between 0 and 1 GPa, the pressure range expected in the hydrospheres of Ganymede and Titan. To address this problem, we developped a quantitative Raman spectroscopy approach to explore the liquid-ice equilibria in the H2O-MgSO4 system. The acquired dataset complete previous works in this binary system in the 0 – 1 GPa range by (a) extending the exploration of the ice VI solidus and (b) giving reliable PTx datapoints on the liquidii of ices at low (~7 wt. %) and high (~15 wt. %) aqueous MgSO4 concentrations. With available data constraining the density of these solutions, these new results now make possible a reliable description of the H2O-MgSO4 system to be established up to 1 GPa. This background will be used to illustrate that the formation of deep high-pressure oceans may be a necessary consequence of the cooling of large differentiated icy moons such as Ganymede and Titan.\n[1] Vance and Brown, 2013, GCA 110, 176-189.

            "abstract": "The oxyhydroxides of iron are common soil minerals and known to control the availability of various major and trace elements essential for biogeochemical processes. We present a study from acidic natural forest soils, where reducing redox conditions due to seasonal waterlogging lead to the dissolution of Fe-oxyhydroxides, and to the release of Fe to soil water. In order to study in detail the mechanism of redox cycling of Fe, we used Rare Earth Element (REE) distribution patterns, because an earlier study has shown that they are a suitable tool to identify trace metal sources during soil reduction in wetland soils (Davranche et al., 2011). The REE patterns of soil leachates obtained with the modified 3-step BCR extraction scheme of Rauret et al., (1999) were compared with those of natural soil water. The adsorbed fractions (F1 leach), the reducible fraction of the deepest soil horizon H4 (F2 leach, 50-120 cm), and the oxidizable fractions of horizons H2 to H4 (F3 leachs, 24-120 cm) yielded REE patterns almost identical to soil water (see figure), showing that the REE and trace metal content of soil water was mainly derived from the F1 pool, and from the F2 and F3 pools of the clay mineral-rich deep soil horizons. In contrast, the F2 leach mobilized mainly Fe-oxyhydroxides associated with organic matter of the surface soil and yielded REE patterns significantly different from those of soil water. These results suggest that the trace metal content of soil water in hydromorphic soils is primarily controlled by the clay fraction of the deeper soil horizons and not by organic matter and related Fe-oxyhydroxides of the surface soil. Additional analyses are in progress in order to verify whether the REE and trace metals of the deeper soil horizons were directly derived from clay minerals or from associated Fe-oxyhydroxide coatings.

            "abstract": "The velocities of seismic waves passing through a complex Earth volume can be influenced by heterogeneities at length scales shorter than the seismic wavelength. As such, seismic wave propagation analyses can be performed by replacing the actual Earth volume by a homogeneous i.e., \"effective\", elastic medium. Homogenization refers to the process by which the elastic stiffness tensor of the effective medium is \"averaged\" from the elastic properties, orientations, modal proportions and spatial distributions of the finer heterogeneities.\nWhen computing the homogenized properties of a heterogeneous material, the goal is to compute an effective or bulk elastic stiffness tensor that relates the average stresses to the average strains in the material. Tensor averaging schemes such as the Voigt and Reuss methods are based on certain simplifying assumptions. The Voigt method assumes spatially uniform strains while the Reuss method assumes spatially uniform stresses within the heterogeneous material. Although they are both physically unrealistic, they provide upper and lower bounds for the actual homogenized elastic stiffness tensor.\nIn order to more precisely determine the homogenized stiffness tensor, the stress and strain distributions must be computed by solving the three-dimensional equations of elasticity over the heterogeneous region. Asymptotic expansion homogenization (AEH) is one such structure-based approach for the comprehensive micromechanical analysis of heterogeneous materials. Unlike modal volume methods, the AEH method takes into account how geometrical orientation and alignment can increase elastic stiffness in certain directions. We use the AEH method in conjunction with finite element analysis to calculate the bulk elastic stiffnesses of heterogeneous materials. In our presentation, wave speeds computed using the AEH method are compared with those generated using stiffness tensors derived from commonly-used analytical estimates. The method is illustrated by comparing the homogenized properties and wave speeds with those presented by Backus [1962] for layered media, solutions that Voigt and Reuss methods cannot provide. We also investigate the influence of fold structures on seismic anisotropy in the crust.",

Here we present 15 year-long time series of shallow and deep AMOC fingerprints in the North Atlantic. We find coherent decadal transport fluctuations in the range of 5•106 m3s-1, accounting for a significant fraction of the overall AMOC variability. At the exit of Labrador Sea, the fluctuations are confined to the deepest layers and explain 70% of the variance of transport fluctuations longer than 90 days. In the two upper layer time series, in the Gulf Stream region, and in the eastern part of the subpolar gyre, about 20% of the variances are associated with the decadal AMOC fluctuation. Wind stress curl fluctuations in the northern part of the subpolar gyre appear to be in phase with the transport fluctuation and suggest atmospheric forcing of the basin-scale decadal variability. Implications for the AMOC variability on these time scales and AMOC observing system requirements to detect long-term trends are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The primary goal of Earth System Models (ESMs) is to improve understanding and projection of future global change. In order to do this models must accurately represent the terrestrial carbon cycle. Although Arctic carbon fluxes are small relative to global carbon fluxes, uncertainty is large. Photosynthetic CO2 uptake is well described by the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis and most ESMs use a derivation of the FvCB model to calculate gross primary productivity. Two key parameters required by the FvCB model are an estimate of the maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco (Vc,max) and the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax). In ESMs the parameter Vc,max is typically fixed for a given plant functional type (PFT). Only four ESMs currently have an explicit Arctic PFT and the data used to derive Vc,max in these models relies on small data sets and unjustified assumptions. We examined the derivation of Vc,max  and Jmax in current Arctic PFTs and estimated Vc,max  and Jmax for a range of Arctic PFTs growing on the Barrow Environmental Observatory, Barrow, AK. We found that the values of Vc,max currently used to represent Arctic plants in ESMs are 70% lower than the values we measured, and contemporary temperature response functions for Vc,max also appear to underestimate Vc,max at low temperature. ESMs typically use a single multiplier (JVratio) to convert Vc,max to Jmax, however we found that the JVratio of Arctic plants is higher than current estimates suggesting that Arctic PFTs will be more responsive to rising carbon dioxide than currently projected. In addition we are exploring remotely sensed methods to scale up key biochemical (e.g. leaf N, leaf mass area) and physiological (e.g. Vc,max and Jmax) properties that drive model representation of photosynthesis in the Arctic. Our data suggest that the Arctic tundra has a much greater capacity for CO2 uptake, particularly at low temperature, and will be more CO2 responsive than is currently represented in ESMs. As we build robust relationships between physiology and spectral signatures we hope to provide spatially and temporally resolved trait maps of key model parameters that can be ingested by new model frameworks, or used to validate emergent model properties.",

            "abstract": "An 8-year volcanic emission inventory for 2005-2012 is obtained based upon SO2 product from OMI (The Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and ancillary information from ground-based reports. It includes contributions not only from global eruptive volcanoes but also 8 near-equator degassing volcanoes. Emissions from Nyamuragira in November 2006 November and Grimsvotn in May 2011 that were missed in the IPCC-5 inventory are now included. Overall, in comparison with our new inventory, well-used AEROCOM eruptive volcanic emission has high biases by a factor of 4. With updated volcanic emission inventory, the volcanic sulfate distribution was simulated from global transport model GEOS-Chem, which shows consistent temporal evolution of zonally averaged sulfate AOD with the CALIOP AOD above 10 Km, and the modeled AOD capture every eruption volcano sulfate with similar magnitude as CALIOP counterpart. The 8 years average contribution from eruptive SO42- to total SO42- loading is ~10% over the most area, and is only significant for those eruptions above 10 km, with the maximum ratio of 30% along tropical area. Tropical degassing volcano SO42- barely reaches above 10 km, but is regionally dominate type of aerosols (60%+ in terms of mass in lower atmosphere) over Hawaii, and ocean area at northeast to Australia. The 8 years averaged global eruption volcano sulfate forcing (-0.09 Wm-2) is found to be slightly higher than reported by IPCC, and the tropical degassing sulfate forcing is estimated as -0.02 Wm-2. The global and monthly mean sulfate forcing efficiency to SO2 emission was calculated for 3 categories. For eruptive volcanoes sulfate the forcing efficiency is more than 5 times of the counterpart of the background (mostly anthropogenic) sulfate, and for the 8 tropical degassing volcanoes sulfate it is slight higher than the one for background sulfate. That indicates the injection height is an important factor to decide the volcano sulfate forcing efficiency. The updated volcanic database is available upon request.",

            "abstract": "We present field observations of erosional columns in the Bishop Tuff and then use laboratory results and numerical models to argue that these columns are evidence of relict convection in a cooling ignimbrite. Many square kilometers of the Bishop Tuff have evenly-spaced, vertical to semi-vertical erosional columns, a result of hydrothermal alteration. These altered regions are more competent than the surrounding tuff, are 0.1-0.7 m in diameter, are separated by ~ 1 m, and in some cases are more than 8 m in height. JE Bailey (U. of Hawaii, dissertation, 2005) suggested that similar columns in the Bandelier Tuff were formed when slumping allowed water to pool at the surface of the still-cooling ignimbrite. As water percolated downward it boiled generating evenly spaced convection cells similar to heat pipes. We quantify this conceptual model and apply it the Bishop Tuff to understand the physics within ignimbrite-borne hydrothermal systems. We use thin sections to measure changing porosity and use scanning electron microscope (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses to show that pore spaces in the columns are cemented by the mineral mordenite, a low temperature zeolite that precipitates between 120-200 oC (Bish et al., 1982), also found in the Bandelier Tuff example. We then use scaling to show 1) that water percolating into the cooling Bishop Tuff would convect and 2) that the geometry and spacing of the columns is predicted by the ignimbrite temperature and permeability. We use the computer program HYDROTHERM (Hayba and Ingebritsen, 1994; Kipp et al., 2008) to model 2-phase convection in the Bishop Tuff. By systematically changing permeability, initial temperature, and topography we can identify the pattern of flows that develop when the ignimbrite is cooled by water from above. Hydrothermally altered columns in ignimbrite are the natural product of coupled heat, mass, and chemical transport and have similarities to other geothermal systems, economic ore deposits, and mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. The columns allow direct observation to constrain complex models of multiphase convection, reactive transport, and permeability. Our results also have paleoclimate implications, implying a large and stable source of water in the SE/SSE Long Valley area immediately after the ~760,000 ka caldera-forming eruption.",

Reduced instream flows and increased nutrient concentrations affect native fish populations through warm daily stream temperatures and low nightly dissolved oxygen concentrations. Water rights purchases are being considered to maintain instream flows, improve water quality, and enhance habitat for native fish species, such as Lahontan cutthroat trout. This study uses the River Modeling System (RMSv4), an hourly, physically-based hydrodynamic and water quality model, to estimate streamflows, temperatures, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the Walker River. We simulate thermal and dissolved oxygen changes from increased streamflow to prioritize the time periods and locations that water purchases most enhance native trout habitat. Stream temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations are proxies for trout habitat. Monitoring results indicate stream temperature and dissolved oxygen limitations generally exist in the 115 kilometers upstream of Walker Lake (about 37% of the study area) from approximately May through September, and this reach currently acts as a water quality barrier for fish passage.",

            "abstract": "Spectroscopy is an extremely powerful tool for diagnosing astrophysical and other plasmas. For example, the shapes of line profiles provide valuable information on the distribution of velocities along an optically thin line-of-sight and across the finite area of a resolution element. A number of recent studies have measured the asymmetries of line profiles in order to detect faint high-speed upflows, perhaps associated with coronal nanoflares or perhaps associated with chromospheric nanoflares and type II spicules. Over most of the Sun, these asymmetries are very subtle, so great care must be taken. A common technique is to perform a spline fit of the points in the profile in order to extract information at a spectral resolution higher than that of the original data. However, a fundamental problem is that the fits do not conserve intensity. We have therefore developed an iterative procedure called Intensity Conserving Spline Interpolation that does preserve the observed intensity within each wavelength bin. It improves the measurement of line asymmetries and can also help with the determination of line blends.",

            "abstract": "An ionospheric model relies on a number of input fields that are climatological in nature, being based on the statistical averaging of observations that have been classified or binned according to parameters such as season, solar activity level, geomagnetic activity level, and so on. One of the most important input fields for an ionospheric model, especially at mid-latitudes, is the neutral wind. The primary mechanism by which the neutral wind affects ionospheric densities is an induced upward or downward ion drift along the magnetic field lines. The magnitude of this effect depends upon the dip angle of the magnetic field; for this reason, the impact of the neutral wind is less in polar regions than at mid-latitudes. The quality of a model's output cannot be expected to be better than the quality of its inputs. It is unfortunate that observations of the neutral wind are relatively scarce, as compared for example with observations of the earth's electric field or auroral precipitation, and that the existing climatological models of the neutral wind are thus sharply limited in their accuracy. In this work, using Utah State University's Time Dependent Ionospheric Model (TDIM), we bring to light the degree to which a model's ability to simulate or forecast the ionosphere is hampered by an uncertain representation of the neutral wind.",

            "abstract": "In-situ bioremediation is a widely applied treatment technology for source zones contaminated with dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). It is both economical and reasonably efficient for long-term management and closure of contaminated sites. A number of laboratory studies have demonstrated enhancement in chlorinated ethene dissolution rates due to the presence of dehalogenating microorganisms, which may lead to increased mass removal rates and shorter cleanup times. Previous modeling efforts have suggested this dissolution enhancement can be a factor of 10 or more when the contaminant is located in high saturation DNAPL pools. Yet, laboratory studies with DNAPL trapped as ganglia have suggested dissolution enhancement is often less than 10. This presentation investigates the interplay between dissolution and degradation rates in ganglia-contaminated source zones using a one-dimensional, simplified, steady-state, analytical solution to the advection-dispersion-reaction equation. A linear driving force model is employed to simulate ganglia dissolution. Degradation kinetics are approximated as zero- or first-order. Model predictions are independently compared to laboratory data available in the literature. Results indicate that dissolution enhancement predictions in ganglia-dominated source zones are often much less than those predicted assuming high saturation pools, suggesting that the presented model is a better tool for estimating bioenhanced dissolution in ganglia-contaminated regions. Furthermore, this screening model provides a remarkably good prediction of laboratory results and could provide practitioners with a useful tool for estimating the extent to which bioenhanced dissolution may aid in site closure strategies.",

Here we describe results of the water cycle assessment, including mean annual and monthly fluxes over continents and ocean basins during the first decade of the millennium. To the extent possible, the water flux estimates are based on (1) satellite measurements and (2) data-integrating models. A careful accounting of uncertainty in each flux was applied within a routine that enforced multiple water and energy budget constraints simultaneously in a variational framework, in order to produce objectively-determined, optimized estimates. Simultaneous closure of the water and energy budgets caused the ocean evaporation and precipitation terms to increase by about 10% and 5% relative to the original estimates, mainly because the energy budget required turbulent heat fluxes to be substantially larger in order to balance net radiation. In the majority of cases, the observed annual, surface and atmospheric water budgets over the continents and oceans close with much less than 10% residual. Observed residuals and optimized uncertainty estimates are considerably larger for monthly surface and atmospheric water budget closure, often nearing or exceeding 20% in North America, Eurasia, Australia and neighboring islands, and the Arctic and South Atlantic Oceans. The residuals in South America and Africa tend to be smaller, possibly because cold land processes are a non-issue. Fluxes are poorly observed over the Arctic Ocean, certain seas, Antarctica, and the Australasian and Indonesian Islands, leading to reliance on atmospheric analysis estimates. Other details of the study and future directions will be discussed.",

Two recent earthquakes, including a M7.8 thrust event near Haida Gwaii on 28 October 2012, have sparked renewed interest in the margin and led to further study of how convergent stress is accommodated along the fault. Recent studies have looked in detail at offshore structure, concluding that a change in strike of the QCF at ~53.2 degrees north has led to significant differences in stress and the style of strain accommodation along-strike. We provide updated fault mapping and seismic images to supplement and support these results.\nOne of the highest-quality seismic reflection surveys along the Queen Charlotte system to date, EW9412, was shot aboard the R/V Maurice Ewing in 1994. The survey was last processed to post-stack time migration for a 1999 publication. Due to heightened interest in high-quality imaging along the fault, we have completed updated processing of the EW9412 seismic reflection data and provide prestack migrations with water-bottom multiple reduction. Our new imaging better resolves fault and basement surfaces at depth, as well as the highly deformed sediments within the Queen Charlotte Terrace.\nIn addition to re-processing the EW9412 seismic reflection data, we have compiled and re-analyzed a series of publicly available USGS seismic reflection data that obliquely cross the QCF. Using these data, we are able to provide updated maps of the Queen Charlotte fault system, adding considerable detail along the northernmost QCF where it links up with the Chatham Strait and Transition fault systems. Our results support conclusions that the changing geometry of the QCF leads to fundamentally different convergent stress accommodation north and south of ~53.2 degrees; namely, reactivated splay faults to the north vs. thickening of sediments and the upper crust to the south. We also highlight areas where additional data are needed and would be ideal targets for future study.",

            "abstract": "The long-term and large scale dynamics of ecosystems are in large part determined by the performances of individual plants in competition with one another for light, water and nutrients. Woody biomass, a pool of carbon (C) larger than that in the atmosphere, exists because of height-structured competition for light. However, none of the current Earth System Models that predict climate change and C cycle feedbacks includes a mechanistic formulation for height-structured competition for light, or an explicit scaling from individual plants to the globe. In this study, we incorporate height-structured competition and explicit scaling from individuals to ecosystems into the land model (LM3) currently used in the Earth System Models developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory based on the Perfect Plasticity Approximation model (PPA), which has been shown to scale accurately from individual plants to stands in individual-based simulation models of plant competition for light, water and nutrients. Because of the tractability of the PPA, the coupled LM3-PPA model is able to include a large number of phenomena across a range of spatial and temporal scales, and still retain computational and mathematical tractability. We test a range of predictions against data from the temperate forests in northern USA. The results show the model predictions agree with diurnal and annual C fluxes, growth rates of individual trees in the canopy and understory, tree size distributions, and species-level population dynamics during succession. We also show how the competitively optimal allocation strategy shifts at different atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to competition with alternative strategies in the model. The results show that the competitively optimal allocation of carbon to leaves, wood, and fine roots depends on the atmospheric CO2 concentration, and that C sinks caused by CO2 fertilization in forests limited by light and water are down-regulated if allocation tracks changes in the competitive optimum, indicating the critical roles of competition played in predicting forest ecosystems responses to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Near-source, seismo-acoustic observations provide a unique opportunity to characterize urban sources, remotely sense human activities including vehicular traffic and monitor large engineering structures. Energy separately coupled into the solid earth and atmosphere provides constraints on not only the location of these sources but also the physics of the generating process. Conditions and distances at which these observations can be made are dependent upon not only local geological conditions but also atmospheric conditions at the time of the observations. In order to address this range of topics, an empirical, seismo-acoustic study was undertaken in and around the Texas Motor Speedway in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area during the first week of April 2014 at which time a range of activities associated with a series of NASCAR races occurred. Nine, seismic sensors were deployed around the 1.5-mile track for purposes of documenting the direct-coupled seismic energy from the passage of the cars and other vehicles on the track. Six infrasound sensors were deployed on a rooftop in a rectangular array configuration designed to provide high frequency beam forming for acoustic signals. Finally, a five-element infrasound array was deployed outside the track in order to characterize how the signals propagate away from the sources in the near-source region. Signals recovered from within the track were able to track and characterize the motion of a variety of vehicles during the race weekend including individual racecars. Seismic data sampled at 1000 sps documented strong Doppler effects as the cars approached and moved away from individual sensors. There were faint seismic signals that arrived at seismic velocity but local acoustic to seismic coupling as supported by the acoustic observations generated the majority of seismic signals. Actual seismic ground motions were small as demonstrated by the dominance of regional seismic signals from a magnitude 4.0 earthquake that arrived at the local seismometers as the race began. The infrasound arrays recorded a variety of atmosphere only processes including substantial helicopter traffic although the array outside the track did not capture the details of the race as a result of the rapid attenuation of high frequency signals.",

            "abstract": "The age, composition and extent of Archean lithosphere is well documented beneath the Slave Craton, however, little is known about the deep continental roots beneath the rest of Canada’s vast north, despite the discovery of many new diamond-bearing kimberlites. Here we present age and composition information for kimberlite-borne peridotite xenoliths from the western Rae Craton (two localities: Repulse Bay and Pelly Bay) and central Victoria Island (CVI - a possible northern extension of the Slave Craton), as well as the Parry Peninsula (a possible new micro-craton).\nThe peridotites from the western Rae Craton, CVI and Parry Peninsula are generally characterized by high forsterite contents (Fo 92-93) and low whole-rock Al2O3 contents (< 2 wt.%, many < 1wt.%), similar to typical cratonic peridotites worldwide. However, these peridotites show a large span in Re-depletion model ages (TRD). For the western Rae Craton, both localities preserve evidence of Archean parentage, with more of the Repulse Bay samples yielding Archean TRD ages (>2.5 Ga) than for Pelly Bay. The samples from these two localities with post-Archean TRD ages indicate significant lithospheric disturbance likely related to the Arrowsmith Orogeny (ca. 2.3 to 2.5 Ga), contrasting with the little disturbed central Slave lithosphere by other studies. For both CVI and Parry Peninsula peridotites, despite whole-rock and mineralogical compositions analogous to previously studied portions of cratonic mantle, there is no evidence of any Archean TRD ages. Given that the CVI peridotites have major modes in TRD ages of 1.7 to 2.1 Ga, the local lithosphere is more likely to represent an extension of the Wopmay Orogen (ca. 1.9 Ga) to the southwest or the Thelon tectonic-magmatic zone to the east, instead of the northern extension of the Slave Craton. Similarly, TRD ages of 1.8 to 2.3 Ga indicate that the highly depleted Parry Peninsula peridotites are also synchronous with formation of the Wopmay Orogen with a northern extension. Hence, deep, refractory, diamond-bearing lithosphere can form in post-Archean times, perhaps in subduction zone settings.",

The low-angle geometry, however, conflicts with Anderson’s classic theory of faulting, which favors normal faults that dip at approximately 60°. By conducting two-dimensional (2D) simulations using the discrete element method (DEM), we probe the effects of different initial fault angles (10°-45°), the addition of sediment in the rifting process, and the strength of the fault relative to the wall rocks, on the activity or inactivity of a prescribed low-angle normal fault. In accordance with Anderson’s theory, normal faults with dip values lower than 60° require additional mechanisms to maintain active slip. Both the addition of sediment during the rifting process and anomalously weak faults have been proposed as potential mechanisms that can localize slip along a fault with low-angle geometry. Our study investigates how these proposed mechanisms alter the limits of activity along these low-angle faults, and controls the resulting hanging-wall deformation, for comparison with natural examples.",

            "abstract": "The size distribution of sediments produced on hillslopes and supplied to channels depends on the geomorphic processes that weather, detach and transport rock fragments down slopes. Little in the way of theory or data is available to predict patterns in hillslope size distributions at the catchment scale from topographic and geologic maps. Here we use aerial imagery and a variety of remote sensing techniques to map and categorize geomorphic landscape units (GLUs) by inferred sediment production process regime, across the steep mountain catchment of Inyo Creek, eastern Sierra Nevada, California. We also use field measurements of particle size and local geomorphic attributes to test and refine GLU determinations. Across the 2 km of relief in this catchment, landcover varies from bare bedrock cliffs at higher elevations to vegetated, regolith-covered convex slopes at lower elevations. Hillslope gradient could provide a simple index of sediment production process, from rock spallation and landsliding at highest slopes, to tree-throw and other disturbance-driven soil production processes at lowest slopes. However, many other attributes are needed for a more robust predictive model, including elevation, curvature, aspect, drainage area, and color. We combine tools from ArcGIS, ERDAS Imagine and Envi with groundtruthing field work to find an optimal combination of attributes for defining sediment production GLUs. Key challenges include distinguishing: weathered from freshly eroded bedrock, boulders from intact bedrock, and landslide deposits from talus slopes. We take advantage of emerging technologies that provide new ways of conducting fieldwork and comparing field data to mapping solutions. In particular, cellphone GPS is approaching the accuracy of dedicated GPS systems and the ability to geo-reference photos simplifies field notes and increases accuracy of later map creation. However, the predictive power of the GLU mapping approach is limited by inherent uncertainty in remotely sensed data and aerial imagery. This work is a contribution toward the long-term goal of reliable and automated mapping of hillslope sediment size distributions for use in sediment budgets and hazard delineation, and for understanding the feedbacks between climate, erosion and topography that drive sediment production.",

            "abstract": "A better understanding of subsurface microbe-water-rock interaction in the Earth’s outer crust is of critical importance because it strongly influences the basic petro-physical properties of sedimentary rock. Over the past decade, miniaturized microfluidic flowcell prototypes of subsurface reservoir systems, usually called micromodels and named GeoBioCells herein, have been used to replace traditional column experiments. However, the inert pore structure in these micromodels does not contain the biogeochemical grain surface heterogeneities in actual subsurface rock reservoirs. In this study, we developed a next-generation microfluidic experimental test bed, herein called the Reservoir Rock GeoBioCell (RRGBC), in which an actual piece of subsurface reservoir rock is mounted within a microfluidic flowcell for experimentation.\nSiliciclastic sandstones core samples of an oil-bearing subsurface reservoir were obtained for construction of the RRGBC. Custom petrographic rock sections (0.5 mm thick) were prepared from these core samples impregnated with Super Glue adhesive. Acetone was then used to remove the Super Glue and physically separate thin sections from the glass slides. A PDMS mold (~3-4 mm thick) was prepared to hold the thin section between a microfluidic inlet and outlet channels. The thin section in PDMS mold was covered with a PDMS-coated glass coverslip to help provide a pressure seal for core thin section (Figure 1, left-top).\nMulti-photon laser confocal microscopy of the RRGBC showed pore connectivity to an imaging depth of ~400 µm within the thin section. The geochemical reactive sites were characterized using Raman Backscattering Microscopy, confirming the presence of reactive quartz. A fluorescent tracer test was conducted to identify micro-flow paths and solute breakthrough within the thin section (Figure 1). A multiphase flow experiment was performed to trap residual light oil in the thin section. A mixed-culture of oil-degrading biofilm was developed to degrade the entrapped oil, and an oxygen sensitive fluorophore was used to observe regions of microbial activity. The RRGBC developed in this study is useful for quantitatively testing and monitoring the physical, chemical and biological factors that affect subsurface carbonate diagenesis and other biogeochemical reactions.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying distributed groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) discharges at the watershed scale is a challenging but important aspect of tracking nonpoint-source pollutants and their potential impacts on riverine water quality. This work analyzes high spatiotemporal longitudinal river sampling along a 38 km reach of the lower Merced River (LMR) in California’s San Joaquin River (SJR) watershed and estimates GW-SW discharges using a simple discretized mixing model. The LMR flow is dam-controlled upstream and has several distributed surface discharges from SW diversions, SW canal inputs, and potential GW discharges influenced by the surrounding agricultural and municipal landscapes. We collected longitudinal datasets covering a wide range of flows (1.3 to 150 m3/s), sampling georeferenced water specific conductance (SC) at intervals of less than 1 minute. Whole-reach gradients of SW specific conductance (SC), representing GW-SW salinity loading (mS/cm/river km), decreased in proportion to the flow and stage, indicating either (1) a simple dilution effect or (2) reduced GW-SW discharges due to a reduced GW-SW hydraulic gradient at higher stages. With respect to distributed discharges, local gradients were significant (p < 0.05), with estimated local salinity loads varying from -0.4 to 8.9 mS/cm/river km for the LMR conditions. Using local groundwater salinity estimates, we inverted a discretized mixing model to estimate distributed groundwater fluxes. Summation of the fluxes agreed well with stream gage estimates. However, local flux estimates were nonuniform, with mid-reach values consistently increasing to a maximum value at intermediate stream flows, then decreasing for greater flows. Causes for this behavior remain uncertain but may be due to one or more of the following: (1) uncertainty in the groundwater salinity data, (2) salinity reduction in the hyporheic zone (e.g., denitrification), and (3) access to preferential GW-SW flowpaths at intermediate flows and stages. Overall, the methods described provide an efficient and economical means for estimating distributed GW-SW nonpoint-source discharges at the watershed scale.",

            "abstract": "Climate change poses grave risks for societies and people all around the earth. Though details of the risks remain uncertain, they include accelerating sea level rise and ocean acidification, regional drought, floods and heat waves, crop failures and more: dangerous changes are already occurring, while GHG emissions continue to grow, ice melts, water expands, temperature rises, and weather patterns shift.\nOur roles as individuals and nations in producing the emissions of GHGs responsible for this episode of climate change, and the actions that could be taken to mitigate it, raise difficult ethical questions. When we are responsible for putting others in danger, we have a duty to mitigate that danger. But our sense of responsibility is diluted here: each individual act contributes only minutely to the overall risks, and the links between individual acts and the harms they produce are complex, indirect and involve many other agents. In these circumstances, our sense of personal responsibility is diminished and uncoordinated, individual responses to the risks become ineffective.\nWe propose a view of the ethics of climate change that begins with the tragedy of the commons: Free use of a shared, indispensable resource can lead to catastrophe as the resource is overrun, and the destruction of the commons arises from choices that are individuallyrational, if each person’s choice is made independently of others’. Finally, individuals often fail to make ethical choices when the links between individual actions and their negative outcomes are obscure, when individual choices are made separately and privately, and when special interests stand to gain from actions that are generally harmful.\nPhilosophical work in ethics has emphasized the role of ethics in enabling cooperation between individuals and coordinating group responses to problems, while recent work on social rules has modeled them as generalized forbiddings, taught and enforced by ‘blocking’ behaviours which discourage forbidden action-types. We argue that a successful response to climate change will depend on adopting ethically grounded rules (laws and treaties) that acknowledge collective responsibility and take a clear stand against special interests: Margaret Thatcher notwithstanding, there is such a thing as society—or so we must hope.",

During the Mw 8.2 Pisagua earthquake, site effects were registered in the Alto Hospicio, Huara and Pozo Almonte councils, all locations placed above the high cliff. The observed site effects were not predicted by a previous seismic microzonation of the study area. The topographic effects due to the loss of soil confinement in the west edge of the scarp could be responsible of the seismic amplification registered.\nIn this work, a 2-D implicit Galerkin finite element model was constructed to estimate the effect of the seismic waves on the displacements experienced by the coastal scarp geometry. Our results indicate that vertical amplifications of the seismic waves are observed in the surface and in the scarp slope, with a range of influence from the edge of one hundred meters eastward, approximately. The displacement field found using this model is similar to the measurement made by GPS during coseismic displacement of typical subduction earthquakes. However, changes in the geometry of the finite element have a similar effect in the vertical displacement’s magnitude.\nThe model presented is, to the best of our knowledge, the first approximation to resolve the topographic effects in the seismic amplifications due the coastal scarp geometry in the andes?, where many assumptions have been used in order to simplify the results. In order to improve our results, further improvements to the model will be developed in the future, as the inclusion of relevant geological features.",

SESAME stations, together with 62 USArray transportable stations also deployed in this area, provide sampling of unprecedented density.\nWe use vertical component data from SESAME and USArray stations operated from 2011 to 2014, resample to 10 Hz, and compute noise cross-correlation functions (NCF) for each station pair on a daily basis at four different frequency bands within the period range of 5 to 30 s. Noise cross-correlation functions are stacked over 4 years and Rayleigh wave dispersion curves are measured using a phase-matched filter, frequency time analysis technique. We estimate measurement uncertainties using the seasonal variation of the dispersion curves revealed in three-month stacks. We find strong source directivity caused by ocean-wave-generated noise and estimate the 2-D noise source distribution using groups of stations. With the estimated noise source distribution, we correct the strong asymmetry of the NCFs to reduce the bias in phase velocity measurement, and produce Rayleigh-wave phase and group velocity maps at periods from 5 to 30 s. Ultimately, we aim to construct a regional seismic model and interpret the final model in terms of temperature, composition and rock deformation fabrics for a better understanding of the deformation history of the suture zone lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "A variety of topographic and photographic data have revealed widespread impacts to the subaerial portion of the beach system during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 - from beach erosion to barrier island breaching. However, less is known about impacts to the offshore environment. In order to examine a more comprehensive response of the active beach system to Hurricane Sandy, we quantify morphologic changes to the shoreface using bathymetric data along the length of Fire Island, NY. Airborne bathymetric lidar data, collected two days before Sandy made landfall, are used as a pre-storm baseline. Morphologic changes are measured using field surveyed GPS profiles collected along a limited portion of western Fire Island two months following Sandy and along the length of the island one year after Sandy. The offshore extent of the data is variable and analyses are constrained by the resolving ability of the lidar sensor, which typically achieved penetration to depths of 6-8m.\nThe surfzone morphology was extensively impacted by Hurricane Sandy and continued to evolve during subsequent winter storms. As is typical during large storm events, the outer bar moved offshore during Sandy. A year after the storm, however, the bar remains further offshore than it was prior to Sandy, resulting in a widened surfzone. Both the subaerial and submarine portions of the beach system lost considerable volumes of sand. The majority of the loss below mean high water (MHW) is in the surfzone, concentrated in the trough immediately landward of the outer bar and generally in the pre-storm location of the outer bar. The trough not only deepened in response to Sandy, but in many locations continued to deepen over the course of the following year, with an average change of more than a meter. The average volume of the shoreface seaward of the bar increased, which is attributed to the seaward translation of the outer bar and additional offshore transport and deposition of material from the inner surfzone during the storm. Additional surveys will be used to examine whether Sandy resulted in a longer-term reconfiguration of the shoreface or if the morphologic changes are largely ephemeral and the system recovers to a pre-Sandy morphologic state.",

            "abstract": "Lacustrine alkenones are rapidly becoming an important tool for continental paleoclimate reconstructions. However, DNA sequencing of 18S ribosomal RNA marker genes has uncovered multiple species of haptophytes in different lakes. To date, there are only two isolated lacustrine species Chrysotila lamellosa and Isochrysis galbana available for culture studies. In our study, we report the isolation of a new haptophyte species from Lake George (LG) that, based on analyses of partial large subunit rRNA gene sequences, is genetically distinct from both Chrysotila lamellosa and Isochrysis galbana. We examined alkenone unsaturation index UK37 values for the LG species at 4°C, 10°C, 15°C, 20°C and 25°C as a function of temperature in a culture experiment. The temperature sensitivity of the new species was significantly higher than previously cultured Isochrysis galbana and Chrysotila lamellosa strains, with a slope that was 25 to 100 % higher. We found that the best linear relationship was obtained when two double-bond alkenones were excluded from the calibration (we developed an index termed UK''37 = [C37:4] / [C37:3+C37:4]). In particular, UK''37 is more linear to the growth temperature than UK37 at low (4-10°C) and high (20-25°C) temperature ranges. Our experiments show that both UK37 and UK''37 of this new alkenone-produced species is strongly controlled by culture temperature and can be used for paleoclimate reconstruction. However, we recommend the use of UK''37 index to reconstruct temperature if the haptophyte's growing environment falls within temperature extremes (4-10°C and 20-25°C). This newly cultivated species broadens our ability of applying lacustrine haptophyte calibrations to continental paleothermometry.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a key intermediate in microbial remineralization of organic matter, but only a small percentage of this complex pool has been fully characterized. We present the results of a novel approach to the characterization of DOM in whole porewater samples from the anoxic sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin, California Borderland, using solution state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Profiles of porewater DOM were obtained by 1H NMR from 95 to 435 cm sediment depth. 1H NMR spectra of each whole porewater sample showed continuous, broad regions from ~0.5 to ~4.5 ppm, indicative of significant signal overlap inherent to complex mixtures, superimposed on a few highly resolved peaks. The individual samples consist of a broad range of chemical environments with varying relative abundances that show a near linear trend with depth. The normalized spectral data were analyzed by principal component analysis to resolve variations in chemical composition of DOM as a function of depth. In addition to detecting the major components such as carbohydrates, cyclic aliphatics and aromatics, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between carbohydrates concurrent with a relative increase in levels of aliphatics. Furthermore, we have identified a decrease in the abundance of alkenes coupled with an increase in a broad region from ~1.9 to ~3.2 ppm, likely corresponding to signals from carboxylic-rich alicyclic molecules. In both trends, the greatest variation occurs between 115 and 135 cm, which straddles the sulfate-methane transition zone (~125 cm), potentially highlighting a region of relatively high DOM transformation. Our work has also identified thiol species which are thought to be formed by dissolved (inorganic) sulfide incorporation into porewater DOM compounds. The implications of these results with respect to carbon cycling in anaerobic sediments will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In 2007, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) published a science strategy that resulted in an organizational pivot toward more focused attention on societal challenges and our ability to predict changes and study mitigation and resilience. The strategy described a number of global dynamics including climate and resource-related critical zone (CZ) impacts and emphasized the need for data integration as a significant underpinning for all of the science questions raised in the report. Organizational changes that came about as a result of the science strategy sparked a new entity called Core Science Systems, which has set as its mission the creation of a Modular Science Framework designed to seamlessly organize and integrate all data, information, and knowledge from the CZ. A part of this grand challenge is directly within the purview of the USGS mission and our science programs, while the data integration framework itself is part of a much larger global scientific cyberinfrastructure.\nThis talk describes current research and development in pursuit of the USGS Modular Science Framework and how the work is being conducted in the context of the broader earth system sciences. Communities of practice under the banner of the Earth Science Information Partners are fostering working relationships vital to cohesion and interoperability between contributing institutions. The National Science Foundation’s EarthCube and Cyberinfrastructure for the 21st Century initiatives are providing some of the necessary building blocks through foundational informatics and data science research. The U.S. Group on Earth Observations is providing leadership and coordination across agencies who operate earth observation systems.

            "abstract": "Hydrologic processes often undergo change due to anthropogenic influences, such as water withdrawals and regulation due to dams and reservoirs. These changes are often characterized by changes in streamflow statistics, such as the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. Flow regime shifts can also be observed in pre- and post-disturbance flow duration curves (FDCs), which are typically plots of daily streamflow versus the probability of exceedance. Here we develop a hypothesis of hydrologic alteration based on shifts in the expected variability of FDCs as described by their confidence intervals. Employing a database of streamflow gauges that have undergone alteration due to reservoir construction, we develop two tests: one based on deviations from confidence intervals associated with pre-disturbance FDC’s , and a second based on the magnitude of the ecodeficit and ecosurplus, which quantify the magnitude of the change in FDC. Of interest is whether hydrologic alteration can be predicted in a systematic and understandable manner, and whether one can determine an alteration to be “significant.” We also report both type I and II errors, where Type I errors correspond to concluding a river is disturbed when it is not, and type II errors correspond to concluding a river is pristine when in fact it is disturbed. An exploration of whether type II errors are related to common measures of hydrologic disturbance (e.g. water withdrawals, area of surface water, etc.) was carried out using annual FDC series.",

In order to evaluate these datasets appropriately, the overall quality, accuracy, or precision of LULC products needs be determined independently. To this end, the USGS Land Change Research Project manually collected LULC change for 676 sample blocks for the 2001-2006 and 2006-2011 time periods. The team identified 29 of 84 Level III EPA Ecoregions that underwent specific types and amounts of land change between 1973 and 2000, and updated LULC change information to 2011 in these regions using the same sample block classification procedure as the USGS Land Cover Trends project. Ecoregion specific alterations in the sampling density were made to expedite the completion of manual block interpretations. Results from this study include ecoregion-based statistical estimates of the amount of LULC change per time period, the most common types of conversions, rates of change, and percent composition. Overall estimated amount of change per ecoregion from 2001 to 2011 ranged from a low of 370 km2 in the Northern Basin and Range Ecoregion to a high of 78,782 km2 in the Southeastern Plains Ecoregion. The Southeastern Plains Ecoregion continues to undergo one of the most intense forest harvesting and regrowth cycles in the country, with 16.6% of the ecoregion changing between 2001 and 2011. These manually collected LULC change statistics provide a new, valuable resource that may be used along with other ground truth data and field verified LULC data to independently validate other land change products or used alone to conduct regional land change assessments.",

            "abstract": "The period between 50-30 kya in western Eurasia witnessed Neanderthal extinction, anatomically modern human (AMH) expansion, and a transition from Middle to Upper Paleolithic material culture. The prevailing hypothesis suggests a replacement of the Neanderthal populations by incoming AMH population, perhaps involving climatic fluctuations that favored AMH biology and habitat preferences. Yet, new evidence questions the role of climate as a forcing factor in AMH dispersal from Africa, raising the possibility that AMH populations in southern Arabia were responsible for the <50 ka expansion into western Eurasia.\nNew excavations at Mughr el-Hamamah (MHM), Ajlun District, Jordan, uncovered a single well preserved occupational horizon. This horizon is dated by acid-base-wet oxidation/stepped combustion (ABOX-SC) AMS 14C assays to 45-39,000 cal BP and is associated with abundant diagnostic Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) artifacts. The age of the site, combined with its excellent organic preservation, suggests that MHM can play a key role in testing hypotheses about the southern Levantine Rift Valley environment and EUP human adaptations to it.\nThis paper presents a paleoecological reconstruction derived from micromammal remains associated with in situ archaeological deposits in MHM. The assemblage is highly dominated by the Syrian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), typical of cool and humid climate. It is common in Late Glacial fauna of the Mediterranean of the Levant, in sites such as Kebara UP and Amud. Yet, today it is known only from high elevation in Turkey, Syria and Jordan. Other taxa include several genera of murids, further supporting the reconstruction of woodland habitats within a 1-3 km radius around the site. Additional archaeological data confirm that MHM was situated along an ecotone between the forested, temperate plateau and the Jordan Valley bottom grassland. Dead Sea speleothems and stromatolites in Dead Sea escarpment caves, indicating a high stand of Lake Lisan ca. 40 ka, and suggesting an increase in humidity, are consisted with these results.\nThe ameliorate climate may have been a contributing factor for AMH dispersal into and out of the region. Thus, this Levantine rich ecozone would have \"funneled\" longer-distance mobility toward the Taurus-Zagros flanks, Mesopotamia and perhaps beyond.",

            "abstract": "During 2011, Texas experienced a severe drought that killed millions of trees across the state. Drought-induced tree mortality can have significant ecological impacts and is expected to increase with climate change. We identify methods to quantify tree mortality in central Texas by using remotely sensed images before and after the drought at multiple spatial resolutions. Fine-scale tree mortality maps were created by classifying 1-m orthophotos from the National Agriculture Imagery Program. These classifications showed a high correlation with field estimates of percent canopy loss (RMSE = 2%; R2=0.9), and were thus used to calibrate coarser scale 30-m Landsat imagery. Random Forest, a machine learning method, was applied to obtain sub-pixel estimates of tree mortality. Traditional per-pixel classification techniques can map mortality of whole stands of trees (e.g. fire). However, these methods are often inadequate in detecting subtle changes in land cover, such as those associated with drought-induced tree mortality, which is often a widespread but scattered disturbance. Our method is unique, because it is capable of mapping death of individual canopies within a pixel. These 30-m tree mortality maps were then used to identify ecological systems most impacted by the drought and edaphic factors that control spatial distributions of tree mortality across central Texas. Ground observations coupled with our remote sensing analyses revealed that the majority of the mortality was Juniperus ashei. From a physiological standpoint this is surprising, because J. ashei is a drought-resistant tree. However, over the last century, this species has recently encroached into many areas previously dominated by grassland. Also, J. ashei tends to occupy landscape positions with lower available water storage, which could explain its high mortality rate. Predominantly tree mortality occurred in dry landscape positions (e.g. areas dominated by shallow soils, a low compound topographic index, and a high heat index). As increases in extreme drought events are predicted to occur with climate change, it will become more important to establish methods capable of detecting associated drought-induced tree mortality, to recognize vulnerable ecological systems, and to identify edaphic factors that predispose trees to mortality.",

            "abstract": "Tropical islands are global focal points of convection. Observational studies have shown that precipitation over tropical islands is strongly regulated by their size and elevation, and by the large scale prevailing wind. To further develop physical understanding of convection over tropical islands, we perform a set of highly idealized simulations with uniform sea surface temperature to explore flow regimes around an idealized small island (~120 km wide) as a function of large scale wind speed and island elevation. In our simulations the domain as a whole is in radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), which constrains the domain average precipitation. The island occupies a small part of the domain, so that significant precipitation variations over the island can occur, compensated by smaller anomalies over the larger surrounding area.\nOver flat islands, as we vary prevailing wind speed, the island experiences three distinct flow regimes: rainfall is greatly enhanced and a local symmetric circulation is formed in the time mean around the island when the prevailing large scale wind speed is small (0 m/s); but there is little rainfall enhancement when the wind speed is increased to a moderate value (~5 m/s). We interpret these two regimes as the shift of triggering mechanism of convection: thermally forced convection due to surface solar heating dominates when large scale wind is very weak, while mechanically forced convection is favored when the impinging wind is moderate. Further increase of the prevailing wind speed to large values leads to strong asymmetry in the windward and leeward side of island and its coastal area, likely due to gravity waves from flow passing over elevated diurnal heating. Topography has a quantitative impact, but does not alter the qualitative shift of flow regimes as a function of wind speed.",

            "abstract": "The Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ) took place in July-August 2014. This collaborative study was aimed at characterizing those processes which control air quality along Colorado’s Front Range. Although the study was largely focused on ozone, an additional goal of the study included characterizing contributions from Front Range sources and long-range transport to total reactive nitrogen in Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO). Import of reactive nitrogen into ROMO and other pristine, high elevation areas has the potential to negatively impact terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We present measurements of reactive nitrogen species measured within ROMO during FRAPPÉ, and compare these data to measurements made in the surrounding areas. At our monitoring site in ROMO, co-located with IMPROVE and CASTNet monitoring, measurements of NO, NO2, NOx, NOy, NH3, and total reactive nitrogen (TNx) were made at high time resolution. Additional measurements of NH3, HNO3 and PM2.5 ions were made at hourly resolution using a MARGA and also at 24-hour time resolution using URG denuder-filter pack sampling. Precipitation samples also were collected to quantify wet deposition of ammonium, nitrate, and organic nitrogen. Finally, measurements of organic gases were made using online gas chromatography and proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry. Preliminary results for ammonia show both a diel pattern, with concentrations increasing each morning, and a strong dependence on wind direction, implicating the importance of transport. Higher concentrations of NOx and NOy also were observed in the daytime, but in general these patterns differed from that of ammonia. Several upslope events were observed during the measurement period during which NOx, NH3, 2-propylnitrate, 2-butylnitrate, ethane, butane, and pentane were observed to increase in concentration along with ozone.",

            "abstract": "In the present study, COSMIC ionosphere observations are used to investigate temporal variability in the low latitude ionosphere that is driven by upward propagating waves of lower atmospheric origin. The particular focus is on sub-seasonal variability in the wavenumber-4 longitude structure of the low latitude ionosphere, which is known to be generated by the eastward propagating nonmigrating diurnal tide with zonal wavenumber-3 (DE3). Previous studies have identified a clear seasonal variability in the wavenumber-4 longitude structure in the ionosphere, and connected this variability to similar variability in the DE3 at E-region altitudes. Furthermore, first principles general circulation models have shown that tropospheric processes give rise to significant day-to-day, and sub-seasonal, variability in the DE3, and this is anticipated to introduce similar temporal variability in the wavenumber-4 longitude variability of the low latitude ionosphere. The COSMIC observations reveal that, superimposed on the background seasonal variability, there is significant sub-seasonal variability in the longitude structure of the low latitude ionosphere. The variability can be 50-100%, and is thus noteworthy, especially when interpreting short-term variability at a single ground-based observatory. Results based on the COSMIC observations are additionally connected to similar temporal variability in the mesosphere, confirming the connection between the observed ionosphere variability and upward propagating waves of lower atmospheric origin. The results of the present study demonstrate the role of the lower atmosphere on driving considerable short-term variability in the ionosphere during geomagnetic quiet time periods.",

All-sky imaging observations of the OI 630.0 nm nightglow emissions were carried out at Sao Jose dos Campos – SJC (23.21°S, 45.86°W; dip latitude 17.6°S) and Palmas – PAL (10.28°S, 48.33°W; dip latitude 6.7°S), Brazil, during the years 2008 and 2010, a period of minimum extreme solar activity. In this work we present and discuss the height-resolved nocturnal F region zonal drift velocities obtained from plasma bubbles observed in imaging observations of OI 630.0 nm emissions result from excitation mechanisms by dissociative recombination of O2. We have investigated the nighttime zonal plasma drift variations using fixed emission peak altitudes, used by earlier investigators, as well as emission peak altitudes based on simultaneous ionospheric sounding observations for both observatories. The average maximum and minimum zonal plasma drift velocities inferred for OI 630.0 nm emission, using emission peak altitudes based on simultaneous ionospheric observations, (SJC: 116 ± 7 and 57 ± 15 m/s; PAL: 119 ± 6 and 58 ± 10 m/s) are lower and with less scatter than that using fixed emission peak altitudes (SJC: 119 ± 6 and 58 ± 10 m/s; PAL: 111 ± 5 and 85 ± 10 m/s). Also, the nocturnal variations of the zonal plasma drift velocities obtained with peak altitudes based on simultaneous ionospheric observations show better agreement than for the case with fixed emission peak altitudes (h = 280 km).",

            "abstract": "Snap-off is an important dynamic phenomenon for multiphase flow in porous media. It contributes to oil or CO2 residual trapping and foam generation in foam flooding. Current applied and theoretical studies of snap-off have mostly focused on static criterion that determines if snap-off will occur. The dynamics of snap-off process has seldom been studied and thus poorly understood. While the snap-off criterion indicates the potential for nonwetting fluids to snap off, the competition between the time required for snap-off (snap-off time) and the discharge at local pores determines the eventual occurrence of snap-off. Here, snap-off time and shape are investigated with respect to pore throat to pore body aspect ratio, pore body distances, local discharge, wetting/nonwetting fluids viscosity ratio, and wetting film thickness. The analysis is conducted through a theoretical model that has been validated by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Predictive equations of snap-off time as functions of the above factors are developed. The predictive equations of snap-off time can be applied to current two-phase dynamic pore-network models to improve continuum models for relative permeability and residual saturation.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) are important contributors to rainfall in the High Plains of the United States. It is therefore of interest to understand how different vertical distributions and concentrations of aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) may impact the amount, intensity, and spatial distribution of precipitation produced by MCSs. Unlike ordinary cumulonimbi, MCSs are organized convection systems composed of convective upright updrafts and downdrafts, as well as slowly ascending and descending slantwise motions. These motions can supply moisture to the stratiform-anvil of the MCS without passing through the convective cores. Moreover, the slantwise ascending motions originate some 3-5km above ground level thereby consisting of air with different properties than upright convective updrafts. In order to study the impact of enhanced potential CCN concentrations on MCS precipitation, it is important to understand aerosol microphysical impacts on the dynamics of the different modes of convection within the MCS.\nIn this study, different aerosol concentrations and their effects on the dynamics of the different modes of MCS convection are examined by simulating a case study using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). Four simulations were conducted, where each simulation differed in the initial aerosol concentrations as well as their vertical distributions. Previous studies have shown that enhanced aerosols invigorate upright convective updrafts, however, the microphysical effects of increased aerosols and their impact on the dynamics of the slow ascending slantwise motion within an MCS, as of yet, have not been studied. In this presentation, the effects of aerosols on the upright convection, slantwise convection and the resulting impacts on precipitation will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "ENSO variability is manifest in the western Pacific through heat and moisture exchanges associated with the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). Forward modeling (pseudoproxy analysis) results and published coral proxy records from the tropical Pacific indicate that in addition to the central and eastern Pacific regions, corals from the WPWP and SPCZ regions skillfully record ENSO variability. Some studies suggest that precessional forcing directly reduces/enhances ENSO variability. Other studies suggest that internal variability is the primary control on Holocene ENSO changes. Herein, we use coral proxy records from the tropical Pacific and numerical simulations to better understand the response of ENSO to precessional forcing and internal variability.\nWe extend the coral record of ENSO variability using a new modern coral record from the Solomon Islands (1716-2008 CE) and a select suite of Holocene fossil coral records from the WPWP. The new modern coral record captures large ENSO events with considerable skill, providing new evidence for potential large ENSO events during the early 18th and 19th centuries, events that are not represented in current coral and/or multi-proxy reconstructions. We also note that long periods of reduced ENSO activity can occur during intervals with near constant precessional forcing at modern values. The fossil coral records provide discrete time windows into ENSO variability over the Holocene. These records provide evidence of similar patterns of ENSO activity during intervals with different precessional configurations. The modern and fossil coral records imply a strong influence of internal variability in the modulation of ENSO, which may make it difficult to establish a direct control of precessional forcing on ENSO variability over the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "We present the latest 3-D isotropic crustal velocity model beneath central Idaho and eastern Oregon. We produced the velocity model from vertical component Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity measurements on data from the IDaho/ORegon (IDOR) Passive seismic network, 86 broadband seismic stations, using ambient noise tomography and the methods of Gallego et. al (2010) and Lin et. al (2008). We calculated inter-station group/phase velocities in narrow frequency bands from travel-time measurements of the stacked cross-correlations (bandpass filtered between 2 and 30 seconds), which we used to invert for velocity structure beneath the network. Goals of our work include refining models of crustal structure in the accreted Blue Mountain terranes in the western study area; determining the depth extent of the Salmon River Suture/West Idaho Shear Zone (WISZ), which crosses north-south through the middle of the network; determining the architecture of the Idaho batholith, an extensive largely crustal-derived pluton; and examining the nature of the autochthonous (?) North American crust and lithosphere beneath and east of the batholith.\nWe derived Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity maps for each frequency band using the damped least-squares inversion method of Tarantola (2005), and then jointly inverted for velocity with depth. Moho depths are prescribed in the joint inversions based on receiver functions, also from the IDOR seismic data, and provides a starting crustal velocity model. 3-D checkerboard resolution tests indicate lateral resolution of better than 40 km.\nPreliminary results show higher S wave velocities in the western study area, and lower velocities in the lower crust on the east side of the network, consistent with Basin-and-Range style extension there. A tabular velocity anomaly juxtaposing higher above lower seismic velocities dips shallow west in the midcrust on the west side of the network.",

The FIELDS instrument suite will provide SPP with high cadence vector measurements of the coronal magnetic field using two flux gate magnetometers (MAGs) and a single search coil magnetometer (SCM). The SPP spacecraft design places significant limitations on the length of the magnetometer boom. We demonstrate that the short separation distance between the magnetometers causes contaminated measurements of the magnetic field made by the SCM. A source of this contamination is the drive frequency, and harmonics, of the MAGs. We explore the use of numerical techniques, primarily based in Fourier transforms, to quantify and remove this noise from the SCM data.",

            "abstract": "Sequestering carbon in deep geologic formations is one way of reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. When supercritical CO2 mixes with brine in a reservoir, the acid generated has the potential to dissolve the surrounding pore structure. However, the magnitude and type of dissolution are condition dependent. Understanding how small changes in the pore structure, chemistry, and flow properties affect dissolution is paramount for successful predictive modelling.\nBoth ‘Pink Beam’ synchrotron radiation and a Micro-CT lab source are used in dynamic X-ray microtomography to investigate the pore structure changes during supercritical CO2 injection in carbonate rocks of varying heterogeneity at high temperatures and pressures and various flow-rates.\nThree carbonate rock types were studied, one with a homogeneous pore structure and two heterogeneous carbonates. All samples are practically pure calcium carbonate, but have widely varying rock structures. Flow-rate was varied in three successive experiments by over an order of magnitude whlie keeping all other experimental conditions constant. A 4-mm carbonate core was injected with CO2-saturated brine at 10 MPa and 50oC. Tomographic images were taken at 30-second to 20-minute time-resolutions during a 2 to 4-hour injection period. A pore network was extracted using a topological analysis of the pore space and pore-scale flow modelling was performed directly on the binarized images with connected pathways and used to track the altering velocity distributions.\nSignificant differences in dissolution type and magnitude were found for each rock type and flowrate. At the highest flow-rates, the homogeneous carbonate was seen to have predominately uniform dissolution with minor dissolution rate differences between the pores and pore throats. Alternatively, the heterogeneous carbonates which formed wormholes at high flow rates. At low flow rates the homogeneous rock developed wormholes, while the heterogeneous samples showed evidence of compact dissolution. This study serves as a unique benchmark for pore-scale reactive transport modelling directly on the binarized Micro-CT images. Dynamic pore-scale imaging methods offer advantages in helping explain the dominant processes at the pore scale so that they may be up-scaled for accurate model prediction.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic eruptions are quite often associated with tsunamis, and particularly caldera-forming eruptions near the coasts (e.g. Santorini, Krakatau, Aniakchak, Kikai). The main tsunamigenic processes are the entrance of massive pyroclastic flows in water, and flank instability, even if other processes might be involved (e.g. explosions). Fresh tephras are often preserved in sedimentary deposits left inland by tsunamis associated with volcanic eruptions. We review the different sources and incorporation mechanisms of pumices in tsunami deposits, and their significance in terms of volcanic processes, hydrodynamic processes (tsunami inundation) and their possible interactions. Three examples are adressed: the Krakatau 1883 eruption, the Minoan Thera eruption, and the El Abrigo eruption / Teno tsunami in Tenerife.",

            "abstract": "3D seismic data are used to investigate flow processes and sedimentation in deep-water slope channels of an alternate type characterized by short and straight channel courses, a lack of levees, and absence of any coeval fans. The study allows a picture of unusual flow processes in submarine channels. The studied channels can be divided into two discrete segments:\n(1) Upper segments are characterized by low aspect ratio(W/T), little lateral offset (Lm), and low migration/aggradation ratios (Lm/Va). These upper segment channels build vertically-stacked channel-complex sets (CCSs), each of which is characterized by a facies transition from fine-grained sands in the lower part overlain by debris flow deposits and then shale drapes. Energetic sediment density flows triggered by fluid escape and/or strong wave action were well able to bypass sediment and to mask relatively weak bottom currents, yielding deep-water channels characterized by little lateral offset and dominantly aggradational stacking patterns.\n(2) Lower segments are characterized by higher W/T, wide lateral offset (Lm), and high Lm/Va. They consist of laterally-migrated CCSs, each of which consists of fine-grained reworked sands in the lower part overlain by debris flow deposits and, finally, shale drapes. Bottom currents restricted within the channels would have induced a tilt of the interface between turbidity currents and the overriding bottom currents (Wedderburn number > 1). This would have deflected turbidity currents downward and back toward the gentle channel bank, thus causing channel migration (the steep bank) by ~2° to 15°, and yielding a helical flow circulation composed of a high-velocity zone along the steep bank and a low-velocity zone along the gentle bank. This bottom current-induced helical flow circulation promoted deposition on the gentle bank, but it favored erosion on the steep banke, yielding deep-water channels exhibiting wide lateral offset and dominantly laterally-offset stacking patterns.\nSediment supplied to the studied channels was therefore sorted, winnowed and swept along the steep bank by the high-velocity zone along this bank, yielding bottom current-reworked sands that that are preferentially disturbed along the steep bank of the studied channels.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations from a midlatitude network of ground-based Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) have revealed an anomalous blueshift in the spectrum of the red-line 630.0-nm airglow emission looking to the zenith during the geomagnetic storm of 02 Oct 2013 [Makela et al., 2014]. Although the red-line emission is historically interpreted as an indicator of the thermospheric neutral wind at an altitude of 250 km, Makela et al. [2014] argue that the apparent sustained downward winds of 150 m/s are not physical and suggest that during a storm, the emission is contaminated by fast oxygen atoms created by charge exchange with precipitating oxygen ions. We extend this analysis to include every storm with adequate data quality in our FPI database and find that this anomalous blueshift is a persistent effect at midlatitudes. This complicates the interpretation of red-line data collected by FPIs during storm periods. We compare with the ionospheric response to these storms as estimated by an assmiliative model, IDA4D, in order to investigate the possible sources of contamination.\n",

            "abstract": "Continuum scale models have been used to study subsurface flow, transport, and reactions for many years but lack the capability to resolve fine-grained processes. Recently, pore-scale models, which operate at scales of individual soil grains, have been developed to more accurately model and study pore-scale phenomena, such as mineral precipitation and dissolution reactions, microbially-mediated surface reactions, and other complex processes. However, these highly-resolved models are prohibitively expensive for modeling domains of sizes relevant to practical problems. To broaden the utility of pore-scale models for larger domains, we developed a hybrid multiscale model that initially simulates the full domain at the continuum scale and applies a pore-scale model only to areas of high reactivity. Python script components provide loose coupling between the pore- and continuum-scale codes into a single hybrid multiscale model implemented in the SWIFT parallel scripting language. We consider an irreversible homogenous bimolecular reaction (two solutes reacting to form a third solute) in a 2D test problem. This presentation is focused on the approach used for multiscale coupling between pore- and continuum-scale models, application to a realistic test problem, and implications of the results for predictive simulation of mixing-controlled reactions in porous media. Our results and analysis demonstrate that loose coupling provides a feasible, efficient and scalable approach for multiscale subsurface simulations.",

When combining these records to construct a single long-term data set for analysis we must estimate the uncertainty in the record resulting from potential biases and drifts in the individual measurement records. In this study we present a Monte Carlo analysis used to estimate uncertainties in the Merged Ozone Dataset (MOD), constructed from the Version 8.6 SBUV/SBUV2 series of instruments. We extend this analysis to incorporate OMI and OMPS total ozone data into the record and investigate the impact of multiple overlapping measurements on the estimated error.

            "abstract": "Effective cloud and aerosol screening is critically important to the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission, which can accurately determine column averaged dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) only when the scenes are sufficiently clear of scattering material. Two primary algorithms are used to calculate the degree of contamination within OCO-2 soundings, both of which evaluate the light path modification induced by clouds and aerosols.\nThe first algorithm compares the measured spectra of the Oxygen-A band near 0.76 microns (mm), to synthetic spectra generated for clear scenes with only Rayleigh scattering. Large, spectrally dependent residuals indicate the presence of large path length modifications. The second cloud screening algorithm compares ratios of retrieved CO2 (and H2O) in the 1.6mm (weak CO2) and 2.0mm (strong CO2) spectral bands estimated with a radiative transfer code that neglects scattering. Soundings with significant cloud or aerosol scattering produce ratios that differ from unity because scattering modifies the optical path lengths differently in these two spectral regions.\nThese two cloud screening algorithms have been used successfully for the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) mission. Here they are evaluated for the first time as applied to early OCO-2 data by comparing their results to cloud and aerosol parameters retrieved from collocated observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. In addition, we also evaluate the hypothesis that an individual OCO-2 sounding is twice as likely to be cloud-free as compared to a GOSAT TANSO-FTS sounding, due to a surface footprint that is more than 30 times smaller.",

            "abstract": "To further develop our understanding of global carbon and water cycles and to support the NASA Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission efforts have been made to develop joint and combined radar and radiometer soil moisture estimation algorithms. Taking advantage of the complimentary sensitivities of radar backscatter and brightness temperature to soil moisture and vegetation has the potential to greatly improve global soil moisture estimates. With the advent of SMAP, not only combing radar and radiometer information is of interest, combing multi-resolution data becomes critical.\nThe work presented here will discuss methods to estimate soil moisture within the SMAP framework via a global optimization technique. Fine resolution radar backscatter measurements (3 km for SMAP) are combined with coarse resolution radiometer data (36 km for SMAP) in a joint cost function. Brightness temperature disaggregation and soil moisture estimation are then performed at the radar resolution. Furthermore, to capture the underlying physics of emission and scattering within the cost function, physics-based forward models which link emission and scattering from first principles are employed. The resulting effect is the ability to define a parameter kernel shared between emission and scattering models. Preliminary investigation yields improved soil moisture estimation when radar and radiometer information are used jointly. Furthermore, over a wide range of soil moisture (0.04 – 0.4 cm3/cm3) and vegetation (0- 5 kg/m2) physics based joint estimation yields the least retrieval errors.",

            "abstract": "Flows in both submarine and fluvial channels are subject to lower boundary roughness. Lower boundary roughness occurs as frictional roughness suffered by the flow as it moves over the bed (skin friction) or drag suffered by the flow as it moves past a large obstacle (form drag). Critically, to overcome such roughness the flow must expend (lose) energy and momentum. However, whilst overcoming bed roughness the degree of turbulent mixing in the flow may be enhanced increasing the potential energy of the flow.\nThis is of key importance to density driven flows as the balance between kinetic energy lost and potential energy gained (through turbulent diffusion of suspended particulate material) may critically affect the criterion for autosuspension. Moreover, this effect of lower boundary roughness may go as far as helping to explain why, even on shallow slopes, channelized submarine density currents can run out over ultra long distances. Such effects are also important in fluvial systems, where they will be responsible for maximizing or minimizing sediment capacity and competence in different flow environments.\nNumerical simulations are performed at a high Reynolds number (O (106)) for a series of crestal length to height ratio (c/h) at a fixed width to height ratio (w/h). Here, we present key findings of shear flow over a range of idealized bedform shapes. We show how the total basal shear stress is split into skin friction and form drag and identify how the respective magnitudes vary as a function of bedform shape and scale. Moreover we demonstrate how said bedforms affect the balance of energy lost (frictional) and energy gained (turbulent mixing). Overall, results demonstrate a slow reduction in turbulent mixing and flow resistance with decreasing bedform side slope angle. This suggests that both capacity and competence of the flow may be reduced through decrease in of the potential energy of the flow as a result of change in slope angles.",

            "abstract": "Excess nitrogen (N) resulting from current agricultural management practices can leach into sources of drinking water as nitrate, increasing human health risks of ‘blue baby syndrome’, hypertension, and some cancers and birth defects. Nitrogen also enters the atmosphere from land surfaces forming air pollution increasing human health risks of pulmonary and cardio-vascular disease. Characterizing and attributing nitrogen from agricultural management practices is difficult due to the complex and inter-related chemical and biological reactions associated with the nitrogen cascade. Coupled physical process-based models, however, present new opportunities to investigate relationships among environmental variables on new scales; particularly because they link emission sources with meteorology and the pollutant concentration ultimately found in the environment.\n In this study, we applied a coupled meteorology (NOAA-WRF), agricultural (USDA-EPIC) and air quality modelling system (EPA-CMAQ) to examine the impact of nitrogen inputs from corn production on ecosystem and human health and wellbeing. The coupled system accounts for the nitrogen flux between the land surface and air, and the soil surface and groundwater, providing a unique opportunity to examine the effect of management practices such as type and timing of fertilization, tilling and irrigation on both groundwater and air quality across the conterminous US. In conducting the study, we first determined expected relationships based on literature searches and then identified model variables as direct or surrogate variables. We performed extensive and methodical multi-variate regression modelling and variable selection to examine associations between agricultural management practices and environmental condition. We then applied the regression model to predict and contrast pollution levels between two corn production scenarios (Figure 1). Finally, we applied published health functions (e.g., spina bifida and cardio-vascular mortality rates) and economic impact functions (e.g., loss of work/school days, decontamination of drinking water wells). The results of this analysis will be presented at the conference.",

These deciduous needleleaf forests with a single species dominance over a large continuous area are not found anywhere except the extreme continental zones of Siberia and the Russian Far East. Most of these forests are located in remote and sparsely populated areas and, therefore, little is known about spatial variability of their structure and dynamics. Wall-to-wall repeated observations of this area are available only since the 2000s. Previously, we developed methods for reconstruction of stand-age distribution from a sample of 1980-2000 disturbances in Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery. However, availability of those images in Siberian larch forests is particularly limited. Built upon the hypothesis that the spectral characteristics of the disturbed forest in the region change with time consistently, this paper proposes a novel method utilizing the newly released Global Forest Change (GFC) 2000-2012 dataset. We exploit the data-rich era of annual forest disturbance samples identified between 2000 and 2012 in the Siberian larch forest by the GFC dataset to build a robust training set of spectral signatures from regrowing larch forests as they appear in Landsat imagery in 2012. The extracted statistics are ingested into a random forest, which predicts the approximate stand age for every forested pixel in the circa 2000 composite. After merging the estimated stand age distribution for 1989-2000 with the observed disturbance records for 2001-2012, a gap-free 30 m resolution 24-year long record of stand age distribution is obtained. A preliminary accuracy assessment against the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) burned area product suggested satisfactory performance of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic watershed disturbance by agriculture, deforestation, roads, and urbanization can alter the timing, composition, and mass of sediment loads to adjacent coral reefs, causing enhanced sediment stress on corals near the outlets of impacted watersheds like Faga’alu, American Samoa. To quantify the increase in sediment loading to the adjacent priority coral reef experiencing sedimentation stress, suspended-sediment yield (SSY) from undisturbed and human-disturbed portions of a small, steep, tropical watershed was measured during baseflow and storm events of varying magnitude. Data on precipitation, discharge, turbidity, and suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) were collected over three field campaigns and continuous monitoring from January 2012 to March 2014, which included 88 storm events. A combination of paired- and nested-watershed study designs using sediment budget, disturbance ratio, and sediment rating curve methodologies was used to quantify the contribution of human-disturbed areas to total SSY. SSC during base- and stormflows was significantly higher downstream of an open-pit aggregate quarry, indicating the quarry is a key sediment source requiring sediment discharge mitigation. Comparison of event-wise SSY from the upper, undisturbed watershed, and the lower, human-disturbed watershed showed the Lower watershed accounted for more than 80% of total SSY on average, and human activities have increased total sediment loading to the coast by approximately 200%. Four storm characteristics were tested as predictors of event SSY using Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients. Similar to mountainous watersheds in semi-arid and temperate watersheds, SSY from both the undisturbed and disturbed watersheds had the highest correlation with event maximum discharge, Qmax (Pearson’s R=0.88 and 0.86 respectively), and were best fit by a power law relationship. The resulting model of event-SSY from Faga’alu is being incorporated as part of a larger project investigating relationships and interactions between terrigenous sediment, water circulation over the reef, and the spatial distribution of sediment accumulation under various conditions in a linked watershed and fringing-reef embayment.",

            "abstract": "While it is well known that methylmercury (MeHg) biomagnifies in aquatic food chains, few studies have quantified its bioaccumulation in marine phytoplankton from seawater, even though that is overwhelmingly the largest bioaccumulation step. Aquatic animals acquire MeHg mainly from dietary exposure and it is important to evaluate the bioaccumulation of this compound in planktonic organisms that form the base of marine food webs. We used a gamma-emitting radioisotope, 203Hg, to assess the rate and extent of MeHg uptake in marine diatoms, dinoflagellates, coccolithophores, cryptophytes chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria held in unialgal cultures under varying temperature and light conditions. For experimental conditions in which the dissolved MeHg was at 300 pM, the uptake rates in all species ranged from 0.004 to 0.75 amol Hg µm-3 cell volume d-1 and reached steady state within 2 d. Volume concentration factors (VCFs) ranged from 0.4 to 60 x 105 for the different species. Temperature and light conditions had no direct effect on cellular MeHg uptake but ultimately affected growth of the cells, resulting in greater suspended particulate matter and associated MeHg. VCFs strongly correlated with cell surface area to volume ratios in all species. Assimilation efficiencies of MeHg from phytoplankton food (Thalassiosira pseudonana, Dunaliella tertiolecta and Rhodomonas salina) in a marine copepod grazer (Acartia tonsa) ranged from 74 to 92%, directly proportional to the cytoplasmic partitioning of MeHg in the phytoplankton cells. MeHg uptake in copepods from the aqueous phase was low and modeling shows that nearly all the MeHg acquired by this zooplankter is from diet. Herbivorous zooplankton can be an important link from phytoplankton at the base of the food web to fish higher in the food chain.",

            "abstract": "Present knowledge of the chain of dominantly andesitic volcanoes, which span the Sumatran portion of the Sunda Arc is extremely limited. Previous studies have focused on Toba and Krakatau, although over 13 further volcanic edifices are known. Several recent explosive eruptions in Sumatra such as that of Mt. Sinabung, 2014, have highlighted the potential hazard that these volcanoes pose to the local and regional communities. Mount Kerinci, is one of the most active of the volcanoes in this region, yet little is known about the petrogenesis of the magma by which it is fed. Kerinci is located approximately mid-way between Toba in the North and Krakatau in the south.\nAlong arc variations are observed in the major, minor and trace elements of whole rock analyses. However, bulk rock approaches produce an average chemical composition for a sample, potentially masking important chemical signatures. In-situ micro-analytical analysis of individual components of samples such as melt inclusions, crystals and groundmass provides chemical signatures of individual components allowing the evolution of volcanic centres to be deciphered in considerably more detail. Examination of whole rock chemistry indicates its location may be key to unravelling the petrogenesis of the arc as significant chemical changes occur between Kerinci and Kaba, 250 km to the south.\nKerinci samples are dominantly porphyritic with large crystals of plagioclase, pyroxene and Fe-Ti oxides, rare olivine crystals are observed. Plagioclase and pyroxene crystals are chemically zoned and host melt inclusions. Multiple plagioclase populations are observed. A combination of in-situ micro-analysis techniques will be used to characterise the chemical composition of melt inclusions and crystals. These data can be used along with extant geothermobarometric models to help determine the magma source, storage conditions and composition of the evolving melt. Integration of the findings from this study with existing data for the volcanic chain will enable along-arc variations in magmatic processes in Sumatra to be assessed more thoroughly, providing fundamental insights into the evolution of not only Kerinci, but magma genesis in Sumatra in general.\nKeywords: Sunda Arc, andesite, arc volcanism, petrogenesis.",

            "abstract": "To address long-standing questions on relationships between tectonic, magmatic, and geochemical segmentation of ocean ridges, we synthesized geological, geophysical and geochemical data in well-studied axial regions at a range of spreading rates. At fast and slow spreading ridges, changes in ridge properties such as axial depth, gravity anomalies, crustal thickness, and lava composition approaching or across transform faults are often comparable to those at smaller offsets. This argues against hierarchical models where transform fault-bounded segmentation arises from deeper processes than small-scale segmentation. At both fast and slow spreading rates, geophysical observations support the concept of relatively regularly spaced “principle magmatic segments,” on average 30-50 km long and fed by melt accumulations in the shallow asthenosphere. Evidence includes thicker crust at segment centers than ends along slow spreading ridges, and seismic imaging of segmented melt accumulations in the upper mantle at fast spreading ridges (Toomey et al., 2007). In the classification of Macdonald et al. (1988), principle magmatic segments correspond with 2nd order segments on slow spreading ridges and 3rd order segments on fast spreading ridges. The principle magmatic segment concept bears similarities to the spreading cell concept of Schouten et al. (1985) but it is linked to a distinct melt plumbing system in the aesthenosphere (>6 to >12 km dbs). While principle magmatic segments are well defined by geophysical observations in a number of regions, their relationship with chemical segmentation is more complex. At fast spreading rates, changes in source composition or melting parameters can coincide with offsets of all orders, and along one of the few well-studied slow-spreading ridges the great diversity of melt compositions over short spatial scales (Gale et al., 2011) must be reconciled with geophysical evidence suggesting significant focusing of melt toward segment centers.",

These models also make a number of scaling assumptions to simplify the representation of complex biochemical and structural properties of ecosystems. This makes it difficult to use these models to test new ideas for parameterizations or to evaluate scaling assumptions. The stripped down nature of these models also makes it difficult to “connect” with current disciplinary research which tends to be focused on much more nuanced topics than can be included in the models. In our opinion/experience this indicates the need for another type of model that can more faithfully represent the complexity ecosystems and which has the flexibility to change or interchange parameterizations and to run optimization codes for calibration. We have used the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) model in this way to develop, calibrate, and test parameterizations for solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence, OCS exchange and stomatal parameterizations at the canopy scale.

The molecular-scale 43Ca NMR results for a Ca-smectite-Suwannee River NOM-H2O system suggests that Ca2+ in smectite-NOM composites  behaves more like Ca2+ in smectites without NOM than Ca2+ in NOM alone also support the idea that much of the Ca2+ in the composites bridges between the NOM and the mineral surface. The NMR results also show that the NOM protonation state (pH) during composite synthesis has little effect on the local molecular-scale coordination environment and dynamics of Ca2+ and that H2O activity is the most important control of composite basal spacing and ion dynamics. XRD results corroborate the formation of smectite-NOM composites and suggest significant cation-NOM association. With NOM present, there is loss of the (005) smectite reflection; no evidence of amorphous NOM; and growth of a broad peak near 3.5 Å, similar to the spacing observed in the benzene ring stacking of graphene. The XRD results also show that the composite materials expand upon exposure to H2O, suggesting that H2O has access to the interlayer spaces and cations. HeIM images offer an explanation as to why there is no pH-dependence in the Ca2+ molecular-scale behavior. Ca-smectite-NOM composites formed at pH 12 appear to be a relatively homogeneous on the <~100 nm scale, whereas composites formed by rapidly decreasing the pH from 12 to 2 show both composites and separate NOM aggregates with little porosity at scales >10 nm. It is likely the formation of NOM aggregates is dominated by hydrophobic interactions that exclude Ca2+ and thus that 43Ca NMR observes bridging Ca2+ similar to that in the pH 12 samples.\n  ",

            "abstract": "Most climate forcing calculations treat black carbon (BC) as the only carbonaceous particulate light-absorber. Numerous studies have shown that some organic aerosols (OA), mainly associated with biomass burning emissions, contain significant amounts of light-absorbing brown carbon (BrC). However, the light absorption properties of biomass burning OA are poorly constrained, complicating its representation in climate models.\nDuring the Fire Laboratory at Missoula Experiment (FLAME 4), we conducted experiments to characterize the light absorption properties of OA in emissions of globally important biomass fuels. We showed that the effective absorptivity of OA depends largely on burn conditions, not fuel type, and derived a parameterization that links OA absorptivity to the BC-to-OA ratio of the emissions (Nature Geoscience, DOI:10.1038/ngeo2220).\nHere, we utilize this parameterization to estimate the direct radiative effect (DRE) of carbonaceous aerosols in biomass burning emissions using a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and a column radiative transfer model (libRadTran). The simulations were performed for the year 2005. Monthly-averaged global aerosol concentrations, including BC, OA, inorganic sulfates and nitrates, sea salt, and mineral dust, were obtained from GEOS-Chem simulations. Concentrations of BC and OA from biomass burning emissions were determined by running two GEOS-Chem simulations, one with and one without biomass burning emissions. We attributed the difference in BC and OA concentrations between the two simulations to biomass burning, and could thus calculate the BC-to-OA ratio for biomass burning emissions. libRadTran was used (offline) to calculated DRE due to biomass burning carbonaceous aerosols at each GEOS-Chem grid-cell. Our results show that the global average DRE due to carbonaceous biomass burning emissions increases significantly if light-absorption by OA is considered (using our parameterization for OA absorptivity), compared to the case with non-absorbing OA.",

            "abstract": "Liquid-bubble interaction, especially in complex two-phase bubbly flow under breaking waves, is still poorly understood. Derakhti and Kirby (2014a,b) have recently studied bubble entrainment and turbulence modulation by dispersed bubbles under isolated unsteady breaking waves along with extensive model verifications and convergence tests. In this presentation, we continue this examination with attention turned to the simulation of periodic surf zone breaking waves. In addition, the relative importance of preferential accumulation of dispersed bubbles in coherent vortex cores is investigated. Heavier-than-liquid particles, i.e. sediment, tend to accumulate in regions of high strain rate and avoid regions of intense vorticity. In contrast, lighter-than-liquid particles such as bubbles tend to congregate in vortical regions. We perform a three dimensional (3D) large-eddy simulation (LES) using a Navier-Stokes solver extended to incorporate entrained bubble populations, using an Eulerian-Eulerian formulation for the polydisperse bubble phase. The volume of fluid (VOF) method is used for free surface tracking. The model accounts for momentum exchange between dispersed bubbles and liquid phase as well as bubble-induced dissipation. We investigate the formation and evolution of breaking-induced turbulent coherent structures (BTCS) under both plunging and spilling periodic breaking waves as well as BTCS’s role on the intermittent 3D distributions of bubble void fraction in the surf zone. We particularly examine the correlation between bubble void fractions and Q-criterion values to quantify this interaction. Also, the vertical transport of dispersed bubbles by downburst type coherent structures in the transition region is compared to that by obliquely descending eddies. All the results are summarized at different zones from outer to inner surf zone.",

            "abstract": "Scientific literacy and inquiry-based writing go together like a hand and glove. Science literacy, defined by NRC in The NSF Standards, stresses the relationship between knowledge of science and skill in literacy so “a person can ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences. It means that a person has the ability to describe, explain, and predict natural phenomena. Scientific literacy entails being able to read with understanding articles about science in the popular press and to engage in social conversation about the validity of the conclusions. Scientific literacy implies that a person can identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed.” A growing body of research and practice in science instruction suggests language is essential in the practice of the geosciences.\nWriting and critical thinking are iterative processes. We use this approach to educate our geoscience students to learn, write, and think critically. One does not become an accomplished writer via one course. Proficiency is gained through continued exposure, guidance and tailored assignments.\nInquiry-based geoscience makes students proficient in the tools of the geosciences and to develop explanations to questions about Earth events. We have scaffolded our courses from introductory geology, English composition, writing in the geosciences, introduction to field methods and report writing to do more critical thinking, research data gatherings, and in-depth analysis and synthesis. These learning experiences that encourage students to compare their reasoning models, communicate verbally, written and graphically. The English composition course sets the stage for creative assignments through formulation of original research questions, collection of primary data, analysis, and construction of written research papers. Proper use of language allows students to clarify their ideas, make claims, present arguments, and record and present findings. Students have acquired the skills to be considered scientifically literate and capable of learning. A poster demonstrating the tie between Scientific Literacy and Inquiry-Based Writing has been produced and distributed widely around campus.",

            "abstract": "The annual cycle of mean diurnal surface pressures observed by Curiosity’s Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) has shown oscillations after two Southern Hemispheric storms that occurred before the annual pressure maxima and minima of the dusty season (Ls~250 and 330). The oscillations had a period of ~7 sols and were less visible or absent during the dust free seasons (Ls ~ 0). Martian airborne dust alters the atmosphere’s response to solar radiation and the resulting heating profiles. Since the atmospheric circulation responds to thermal forcing by the Sun, atmospheric dust can alter the large-scale circulation. We use coincident global observations by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) to examine the global circulation. We find that the observed surface pressure oscillations relate to oscillations of the Hadley cell. We also analyze the potential impacts of these coupled oscillations especially as related to traveling waves and thermal tides.",

            "abstract": "Forest ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada are greatly influenced by wildfire disturbance. A study of vegetation regrowth following fire is essential for us to better understand and evaluate the effects of disturbances on ecological processes, such as carbon and nitrogen storage, soil erosion, water quality and forest dynamics. The rate of short-term vegetation recovery, as measured by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), was explored following fire over multiple years (1999-2006) in Sierra Nevadan forests. The role of both temporal (e.g. variations in multiple years’ precipitation) and landscape factors (e.g. altitude, slope, aspect, pre-fire and immediate post-fire vegetation status, and burn severity) were investigated in explaining the short-term vegetation regrowth following fire using remote sensing on the landscape scale. Our results indicate that spatial-temporal variability existed in the short-term post-fire vegetation regrowth. Pre-fire vegetation status, burn severity, immediate post-fire wet season precipitation and elevation were found to play important roles in short-term post-fire vegetation recovery trends. Consistent with a local forest gap model, our results also corroborate that water availability may be the limiting factor for the post-fire vegetation regrowth in the lower elevation of Sierra Nevadan forests. In the future, post-disturbance vegetation regrowth trends and related controlling environmental factors following various forest disturbances (e.g. insect outbreak and forest harvest) other than wildfire can also be studied and compared using the methodology proposed in this study.",

            "abstract": "Regional tomography studies in the SJFZ area gives detailed images up to the top 500 meters or so of the crust (Zigone et al., 2014; Allam et al., 2014). To obtain additional high resolution information on local structures at the shallower crust, we use cross correlation of ambient seismic noise between 10 Hz and 70 Hz recorded by several linear arrays that cross the SJFZ with typical inter-station distances around 40 m. Pre-processing techniques involving earthquakes removal and whitening on 15 minutes time windows are used to obtained the 9-component correlation tensors associated with all station pairs. The obtained cross correlations exhibit coherent waves up to 30-40 Hz that travel between the station pairs. Polarization and dispersion analysis show that both body and surface waves are reconstructed with Rayleigh group velocity around 400-500 m/s. The results likely include also body waves and trapped fault zone signals. After rejecting paths without sufficient signal to noise ratios, we invert the Rayleigh group velocity measurements using the Barmin et al. (2001) approach on a 20m grid size. The obtained group velocity maps reveal complex structures with very low velocity damage zones around the surface traces of the SJFZ. The group velocities are inverted to 3D images of shear wave speeds using the linear inversion method of Hermann & Ammon (2002). The results show local flower-type damage structures in the top 200m, with Vs values at 30m depths around 250-300 m/s in agreement with the available Vs30 values in the literature. This high-resolution study will be complemented with a more detailed analysis using a dense rectangular array with 1108 vertical-component seismometers separated by 10-30 m centered on the fault. This geometry allows the use of very high frequency seismic noise up to 200 Hz that can be used to image the small-scale features (~10-20 m) in the top few hundred m of the crust. Updated results will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Kinematic data for outcrop-scale faults and strain inversions for shallow earthquakes across the eastern slope of the southern Central Range of Taiwan suggest subhorizontal NE-SW stretching plays a role in ongoing exhumation. We document oblique strike-slip near the ridge crest and normal faulting on the eastern flank of the range, kinematics rarely emphasized to date. We invert shallow earthquake focal mechanisms for strain (cosserat model) and show that stretching is accommodated on nodal planes whose geometries vary systematically. Close to the crest of the Central Range from north to south we find a transition from oblique normal faulting on moderately N- and NE-dipping nodal planes to strike-slip faulting on steeply W-dipping and N-dipping nodal planes. On the eastern flank of the Central Range ~13 km south of the Southern Cross Island Highway (SXIH), earthquakes reveal normal faulting accommodated largely on moderately SW- and NE-dipping nodal planes. We also invert brittle faults exposed along the SXIH for strain. Forty-one of the 44 faults record normal or oblique normal displacement with the majority of faults dipping steeply NE and W. The best-fitting strain tensor for these faults indicates subhorizontal NE-SW maximum stretching, similar to the strain tensor for the earthquakes to the south. Some of the faults dip only ~20° suggesting surface processes may be important (e.g., mass movement). Nineteen of the normal faults, however, dip >60° suggesting that they may be linked with faults at seismogenic depths that reflect tectonic strain. Most of these faults dip steeply to the NE with geometries similar to many of the preferred nodal planes from our strain inversions for earthquakes to the south. If the strain geometries we document are representative of processes operating at 105–106 years, then two important conclusions can be made. (1) Normal faults play a role in the exhumation of rocks on the eastern flank of the orogen. These faults largely record SW-side up motion that may contribute to rock uplift along the range crest. (2) Subhorizontal stretching for all areas investigated is at a moderate angle to the orogen suggesting that neither the mapped lithologic contacts nor the topographic grain reflect ongoing deformation in a simple way. This highlights a possible role for deeper, as yet unknown processes.",

While the current regulatory environment places limits on the application of UAS towards these ends, demonstrated success targeting tornadic and non-tornadic supercells proves the general feasibility of this work. In this presentation we will summarize the successes using UAS to collect data in the vicinity of supercell thunderstorms and discuss ways that these data, along with additional data collected in future field campaigns, can be used answer basic research questions concerning tornado formation and applied research questions concerning the value of UAS in the tornado warning decision process.\nThe associative relationship between the rear-flank downdraft (RFD) and tornadogenesis has long been recognized. Yet, despite decades of research focused on tornadoes, the causal relationship between the RFD and tornadogenesis remains unresolved. In the presentation, we will describe ways that UAS could be used to test hypotheses posed to explain this causal relationship.\nWe will also present a strategy to quantify the impact of UAS on tornado warning skill. Through controlled forecast experiments conducted using data collected through small field campaigns that leverage prior success targeting supercell thunderstorms with UAS, the value of targeted surveillance of potentially tornadic storms using UAS can be assessed. Significant changes to the existing regulatory environment are likely required for UAS, operated in a targeted surveillance mode, to contribute to improving tornado warning skill, but progress can be made today towards quantifying the impact that UAS could make.",

In our recent work (Markonis and Koutsoyiannis, Surveys in Geophysics, 2013) we showed that natural temperature variability exhibits Hurst-Kolmogorov (HK) behaviour (also known as long term persistence) for time scales spanning nine orders of magnitude with Hurst coefficient near 0.92. However, this is a negatively biased estimate, as no bias correction technique was applied; this implies that the true value should be higher. Here, we adapt the estimation to account for bias and provide a possible stochastic model for an important variable of the climatic system: temperature. We also compare the behaviour of this model with other models which are widely used in climatology, including AR and ARMA models.",

In this study, we quantified the global volume and distribution of groundwater that has been recharged over the past 50 years, a time-scale relevant to current policy planning and intimately tied to human generations. We modelled groundwater residence time distributions with several thousand two-dimensional flow and age-as-mass transport simulations guided by global datasets of basin geometric and hydraulic properties. The models suggest that less than 15% of the groundwater on Earth to 2 km depth was recharged in the past 50 years. For most watersheds on Earth, this young groundwater is restricted to the upper 100 m of the Earth’s crust.

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (COS) has recently been proposed as a promising tracer for partitioning ecosystem carbon assimilation due to the close analogy between leaf uptake processes of COS and CO2. This emerging framework requires accurate characterization of the source and sink components of COS, including soil fluxes. Here we present the first direct, continuous observations of soil COS fluxes for 4 months at a tropical rainforest, La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Three soil plots with contrasting water content were selected for chamber measurements. Our observations confirmed that soils are principally COS sinks, with daily mean COS fluxes averaged across all chambers ranging from -3 to 0 pmol m-2 s-1. When compared with net ecosystem COS uptake which peaks around -30 pmol m-2 s-1, their contributions should be considered in ecosystem COS balance. We did not find a temperature optimum, but soil COS uptake slightly increased with soil temperature, indicating biotic control on soil COS fluxes. Diurnal cycles of COS fluxes were observed during drying out periods after rain. The diel periodicity of COS fluxes was probably obscured by frequent raining at the site. Diffusional control of soil COS fluxes is shown from increasing soil COS uptake at lower soil water-filled pore space. These confirm that soil COS fluxes are mediated both by soil physical and biological factors. Using a depth-resolved diffusion-reaction model with data-driven enzyme activity parameterization, we simulated the COS fluxes from measured soil environmental variables, consistent with observations. This modeling scheme is useful for separating soil COS fluxes from net ecosystem COS fluxes, which lends support to the emergent COS-based approach of carbon flux partitioning.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution point clouds and digital elevation models (DEMs) are used to investigate lava textures on the Big Island of Hawaii. An experienced geologist can distinguish fresh or degraded lava textures (e.g., blocky, a’a and pahoehoe) visually in the field. Lava texture depends significantly on eruption conditions, and it is therefore instructive, if accurately determined. In places where field investigations are prohibitive (e.g., Mercury, Venus, the Moon, Mars, Io and remote regions on Earth) lava texture must be assessed from remote sensing data. A reliable method for differentiating lava textures in remote sensing data remains elusive. We present preliminary results comparing properties of lava textures observed in airborne and terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Airborne data, in this study, were collected in 2011 by Airborne 1 Corporation and have a ~1m point spacing. The authors collected the terrestrial data during a May 2014 field season. The terrestrial scans have a heterogeneous point density. Points close to the scanner are 1 mm apart while 200 m in the distance points are 10 cm apart. Both platforms offer advantages and disadvantages beyond the differences in scale. Terrestrial scans are a quantitative representation of what a geologist sees “on the ground”. Airborne scans are a point of view routinely imaged by other remote sensing tools, and can therefore be quickly compared to complimentary data sets (e.g., spectral scans or image data). Preliminary results indicate that LiDAR-derived surface roughness, from both platforms, is useful for differentiating lava textures, but at different spatial scales. As all lava types are quite rough, it is not simply roughness that is the most advantageous parameter; rather patterns in surface roughness can be used to differentiate lava surfaces of varied textures. This work will lead to faster and more reliable volcanic mapping efforts for planetary exploration as well as terrestrial geohazards.",

We show that estimating the radiative forcing for ESM2M using both the instantaneous and fixed SST methods results in the need for a time-varying climate sensitivity during the first 1000 years after CO2 is doubled. However, the use of an unrealistically small radiative forcing of 2.1 Wm-2, estimated by applying the ‘Gregory’ linear fit method to the full 3000 year period results in an almost constant climate sensitivity as a function of time. We found that the primary cause behind such a small forcing estimated by the Gregory method is an increase in the reflection of solar radiation by clouds, mainly over the Southern Ocean. This occurs within the first few decades after CO2 is increased in the coupled model. The fact that such cloud adjustments are not seen in a fixed SST model run suggests that the primary cause is the initial pattern of ocean warming induced by the radiative forcing. We also show that these cloud adjustments can lead to an underestimate of the equilibrium temperature of up to 30 % if the Gregory method is only applied to the first 150 years after an instantaneous increase in forcing. A similar magnitude of cloud adjustments also occurs in GFDL-CM3 in response to both greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings.",

            "abstract": "Radar-based technologies have made spatially and temporally distributed quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) available in an operational environmental compared to the raingauges. The floods identified through flash flood monitoring and prediction systems are subject to at least three sources of uncertainties: (a) those related to rainfall estimation errors, (b) those due to streamflow prediction errors due to model structural issues, and (c) those due to errors in defining a flood event. The current study focuses on the first source of uncertainty and its effect on deriving important climatological characteristics of extreme rainfall statistics. Examples of such characteristics are rainfall amounts with certain Average Recurrence Intervals (ARI) or Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP), which are highly valuable for hydrologic and civil engineering design purposes. Gauge-based precipitation frequencies estimates (PFE) have been maturely developed and widely used over the last several decades. More recently, there has been a growing interest by the research community to explore the use of radar-based rainfall products for developing PFE and understand the associated uncertainties. This study will use radar-based multi-sensor precipitation estimates (MPE) for 11 years to derive PFE’s corresponding to various return periods over a spatial domain that covers the state of Louisiana in southern USA. The PFE estimation approach used in this study is based on fitting generalized extreme value distribution to hydrologic extreme rainfall data based on annual maximum series (AMS). Some of the estimation problems that may arise from fitting GEV distributions at each radar pixel is the large variance and seriously biased quantile estimators. Hence, a regional frequency analysis approach (RFA) is applied. The RFA involves the use of data from different pixels surrounding each pixel within a defined homogenous region. In this study, region of influence approach along with the index flood technique are used in the RFA. A bootstrap technique procedure is carried out to account for the uncertainty in the distribution parameters to construct 90% confidence intervals (i.e., 5% and 95% confidence limits) on AMS-based precipitation frequency curves.",

            "abstract": "Rock particles in debris flows are reduced in size through abrasion and fracture. Wear of coarse sediments results in production of finer particles, which alter the bulk material rheology and influence flow dynamics and runout distance. Particle wear also affects the size distribution of coarse particles, transforming the initial sediment size distribution produced on hillslopes into that delivered to the fluvial channel network. A better understanding of the controls on particle wear in debris flows would aid in the inferring flow conditions from debris flow deposits, in estimating the initial size of sediments entrained in the flow, and in modeling debris flow dynamics and mapping hazards. The rate of particle size reduction with distance traveled should depend on the intensity of particle interactions with other particles and the flow boundary, and on rock resistance to wear. We seek a geomorphic transport law to predict rate of particle wear with debris flow travel distance as a function of particle size distribution, flow depth, channel slope, fluid composition and rock strength. Here we use four rotating drums to create laboratory debris flows across a range of scales. Drum diameters range from 0.2 to 4.0 m, with the largest drum able to accommodate up to 2 Mg of material, including boulders. Each drum has vanes along the boundary to prevent sliding. Initial experiments use angular clasts of durable granodiorite; later experiments will use less resistant rock types. Shear rate is varied by changing drum rotational velocity. We begin experiments with well-sorted coarse particle size distributions, which are allowed to evolve through particle wear. The fluid is initially clear water, which rapidly acquires fine-grained wear products. After each travel increment all coarse particles (mass > 0.4 g) are weighed individually. We quantify particle wear rates using statistics of size and mass distributions, and by fitting various comminution functions to the data. Laboratory data are compared with longitudinal evolution of grain size and angularity of particles deposited by debris flows along Inyo Creek, Sierra Nevada, California. Preliminary results suggest wear rates can be scaled across drum sizes and to field conditions using non-dimensional metrics of flow dynamics including Savage, Bagnold, and Froude numbers.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies suggest the boreal forests of Canada are responding to climate change. Time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) show declining trends in forested regions of boreal Canada over the period 1982-2012, which may reflect the responses of boreal forests to longer growing seasons, increased summer drought stress, and higher frequency of fire occurrence. In this paper, we describe research where we analyzed Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ time series data for eleven scenes distributed across the Canadian boreal forest zone. To do this, we created annual cloud-free, peak-summer composites for 28 years of Landsat data (1984-2011) using a maximum NDVI compositing procedure. By isolating areas of the landscape that were undisturbed during the Landsat record, our results highlight the difficulties involved in distinguishing subtle trends from data artifacts caused by unscreened atmospheric effects, subtle changes in sensor view angles, and differences across sensors. Differences in sensor view geometry across adjacent, overlapping Landsat scenes cause the eastern scene to have higher reflectances in the red and NIR bands than the western scene, but does not significantly affect NDVI values. A significant difference was observed between the red bands of the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors, with Landsat 5 TM data having a higher red reflectance on average. However, no such systematic difference was observed between the NIR bands of these two sensors. In contrast to the effect of view geometry, NDVI values derived from the TM and ETM+ sensors should not be used interchangeably because of the sensitivity of NDVI values to variations in the red band. More generally, the results from this work demonstrate that while the opening of the Landsat archive has provided unprecedented opportunities for studying changes to the Earth's biosphere over the last 30 years, care must be taken in analyzing these data because artifacts introduced to the time series from a variety of sources can compromise results from analyses of long-term trends.",

            "abstract": "Identifying and locating gaseous seafloor seeps using multibeam sonar water-column backscatter is a growing interest in the scientific, energy, and resource management communities. Until recently, seeps were manually detected when viewing water-column backscatter returns in post-processing software. This manual procedure is time consuming and subjective. To examine this subjectivity, the NOAA Office of Exploration and Research conducted a quality control test using data collected during an expedition aboard the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer in the Gulf of Mexico from March to April, 2014. Water-column backscatter data was post-processed underway in FMMidwater and seep coordinates were manually geopicked from the beam fan. Ten percent of the original survey lines were independently re-processed using the same manual detection methods but with a different observer. Results show that manual seep selection can be highly variable between two different individuals. To help reduce this subjectivity and time required to manually detect seeps, QPS, Inc. developed a Feature Detection Tool for FMMidwater that uses an algorithm developed by the University of New Hampshire Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping. To test the tool, the 10% subset of survey lines were run through the Feature Detection Tool using default settings, and the automatically detected seeps were compared with the manual geopicks. Not surprisingly, initial results show there can be variability between manual and algorithm seeps. Scrutiny of the automatic picks shows that the tool identified 60% of the seeps detected, and verified, by the independent manually-detecting observers. 32% of the seeps identified manually were missed by the tool, but 8% additional seeps were identified by the algorithm that had been missed through manual detection. The automatic detection showed several false positives, requiring manual intervention, but at a significantly lower level of effort than manual scrutinization of the raw data.",

            "abstract": "Energy use by water and wastewater treatment plants equates to approximately 4% of total energy use in the United States. For many municipal water and wastewater treatment plants, energy costs related to pumping, treating, and transporting water represent a large fraction of total costs. The energy intensity of any given utility is heavily variant dependent on location and regional conditions, but energy requirements are generally expected to increase in many regions due to limits on water resources and regulatory requirements for water quality. Quantifying the energy use associated with our nation’s water system – the energy needed to convey, extract, treat and distribute water in a particular location – is an important step in understanding the impact and interconnections of the water system on the energy system, in identifying opportunities for savings, and in improving existing modeling and analytic methods for both energy and water systems. Local topography and other regional conditions can greatly affect how much energy a particular water facility utilizes, which in turn affects its relationship with the broader electricity sector. This research evaluates what previous and current efforts have been undertaken to quantify water energy intensity factors (w-EIFs) on a regional scale, provides first steps for cataloguing resulting datasets and findings, and initiates a methodology for developing regional and localized w-EIFs. Improved regional w-EIFs can facilitate national reductions in energy intensity metrics by highlighting areas where energy savings opportunities could provide the greatest benefit.",

            "abstract": "We assessed trace element evidence for changes in the delivery and deposition of sediments to the upper shelf of southeast Brazil, which can be linked to the evolution of regional oceanic and continental conditions during the last 17.1 cal kyr. Mineralogical and major and trace elements analyses of a 14C-dated sediment core have identifiedchanges in the compositions of the two lithologic units of this core that reveal a succession of changes in sediment delivery and accumulation at this location as postglacial sea level rose and the Holocene climate on land evolved. The results imply that depositional conditions have changed from a high energy environment under the strong influence of sea level rise before 9.1 kyr cal BP to conditions indicative of progressive sea-level stabilization until ~3 kyr cal BP. This location then became a deepwater lower energy environment that has persisted to modern times. Despite their proximity to the high organic matter productivity associated with the Cabo Frio upwelling system, the sediments have remained sufficiently oxygenated to make the variations in trace elements serve as evidence of changes in sediment delivery at this location. As an example, several occurrences of elevated concentrations and accumulation rates of U and Mo suggest that changes in erosion and fluvial transport from nearby land areas affected the record of trace element composition of sediments of the Cabo Frio shelf area.",

            "abstract": "The parameterization of dry deposition fluxes in climate models is an important component of the dust model, since it is one of the main processes responsible for the removal of aerosol particles from the atmosphere. The parameterization currently used in most climate models is obtained from a two-layer approach in which the physical domain between the first grid point and the ground surface is divided into an upper and a lower layer. The lower layer is the region where Brownian diffusion is relevant, and where particles interact with the surface roughness elements. In this layer important processes such as impaction, interception, and rebound of particles on the surface are parameterized. In the upper layer turbulent transport and gravitational settling determine the particle flux, and the effects of atmospheric stability become relevant. In the usual two-layer model, mean vertical gradients of particle concentration are approximated using a first order finite-difference approach, resulting in a set of two algebraic equations. The solution of these equations yields the desired parameterization for the deposition velocity. We argue that in the upper model, the finite-difference approximation is the largest source of error. In addition, the error introduced by this approximation is grid-dependent, increasing with increasing distance between the first grid point and the ground. We develop a new model in which the finite-difference approximation is not invoked. Instead, the analytical solution for the differential equation is obtained. This solution can be seen as a generalization of the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory to concentration of settling particles. We use large-eddy simulations to show the validity of the analytical solution for a range of particle sizes. The final expression obtained for the deposition velocity is as simple as the one currently used, and the parameterizations of impaction, interception, and rebound in the lower layer can be introduced in the same way. Compared to the proposed model, the deposition velocity parameterization currently used in climate models over predicts fluxes by as much as 30%. The errors tend to be largest in the range of particle sizes between one and ten micrometers, a range of critical importance for dust modeling.",

Because of the unprecedented joint observations of an X-flare with the ground-based Dunn Solar Telescope and the spacecraft IRIS, Hinode, RHESSI, STEREO, and SDO, we can sample many solar layers from the photosphere to the corona. We find that a filament eruption, which was possibly caused by a thermal instability, was the cause of this X-flare. The filament was rising in the chromosphere for at least one hour before the flare occurred with a velocity of $\\sim$2--5 km/s. 15 minutes before the flare, its chromospheric rise velocity increased to $\\sim$6--10 km/s, before it lifted off with at least 600 km/s, as seen by IRIS in the transition region. Doppler velocities from H-alpha images reveal intriguing small scale flows along the filament and enable us to derive its probable shape. An unusual feature was a low-lying twisted flux rope near the filament, which did not participate in the filament eruption. After the flare ribbons started on each of its sides, the flux rope seems to have untangled and vanished during the flare. We present a comprehensive overview of the flare, including polarimetric and spectroscopic data at subarcsecond resolution.",

Our understanding of these effects is primarily based on scattering calculations, but due to the variability in ice habit it is computationally difficult to determine the required scattering and absorption properties, and the difficulties are only compounded by the need to include consideration of air and carbon inclusions of the sort frequently observed in collected samples. Much of the previous work on effects of inclusions in ice particles on scattering properties has been conducted with variants of geometric optics methods. We report on simulations of scattering by ice crystals with enclosed air bubbles using the pseudo-spectral time domain method (PSTD) and improved geometric optics method (IGOM). A Bouncing Ball Model (BBM) is proposed as a parametrization of air bubbles, and the results are compared with Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations. Consistent with earlier studies, we find that air inclusions lead to a smoothing of variations in the phase function, weakening of halos, and a reduction of backscattering. We extend these studies by examining the effects of the particular arrangement of a fixed number of bubbles, as well as the effects of splitting a given number of bubbles into a greater number of smaller bubbles with the same total volume fraction. The result shows that the phase function will not change much for stochastic distributed air bubbles. It also shows that local maxima of phase functions are smoothed out for backward directions, when we break bubbles into small ones, single big bubble scatter favors more forward scattering than multi small internal scatters.",

            "abstract": "We present a paleo-ocean bathymetry reconstruction for Cenomanian-Turonian (90 Ma) time in a 0.1°x0.1° resolution for use in paleo-climate studies. Age of the ocean floor for the Cenomanian-Turonian (90 Ma) is from Müller et al. (2008 a,b); coastlines are from the PALEOMAP Project (Scotese, 2011). To reconstruct paleo-ocean bathymetry, we use a plate model equation to model depth to basement (Turcotte and Schubert, 2002). We estimate plate model equation parameter values from measurements of modern oceans (Crosby et al., 2006). On top of the depth to basement, we isostatically add a multilayer sediment model derived from area-corrected sediment thickness data (Divins, 2003; Whittaker et al., 2013). Lastly, we parameterize the modern continental shelf, slope, and rise in a “sediment wedge model” to connect the coastline with the closest ocean crust as defined by Müller et al. (2008 a, b). These parameters are defined using empirical relationships obtained from study of modern ocean transects where a complete rifting history is preserved (Atlantic and Southern oceans), and the closest approach of the respective oceanic crust (Müller et al., 2008a,b) to the coastline. We use the modern ocean as a test, comparing maps and cross sections of modern ocean bathymetry modeled using our reconstruction method with that of ETOPO1 (Amante and Eakins, 2009). Adding sea plateaus and seamounts minimize the difference between our modeled bathymetry and ETOPO1. Finally, we also present a comparison of our reconstructed paleo-bathymetry to that of Müller et al. (2008 a,b) for the Cenomanian-Turonian (90 Ma).\n",

            "abstract": "Tsunami recurrence intervals can be determined by age dating paleotsunami deposits, but relative tsunami magnitude is more difficult to infer from deposit characteristics alone. Deposit thickness, grain size, and certain sedimentary structures are used to infer hydrodynamic conditions during deposition, which can be used as proxies for tsunami magnitude. Recent field studies in the eastern Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone have identified sequences of tsunami deposits from the 1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake (MW 8.6) and at least five other pre-historic tsunami events from the last 2,400 years. At Stardust Bay on the Pacific Coast of Sedanka Island, a sand-rich deposit attributed to the 1957 tsunami is 1-13 cm thick and is found at elevations up to 18.5 m. Older sand units are 6-50 cm thick and often have rounded gravel at the base of multiple, normally-graded sand beds. At Driftwood Bay on the south side of Umnak Island, about 200 km to the southeast of Stardust Bay, the 1957 deposit is 1 - 5.5 cm thick, underlain by a sequence of peat with up to 8 sandy deposits, some of which exhibit normally-graded beds up to 14 cm thick. Relatively thick deposits that exhibit suspension grading, a type of grading created by sediment falling out of suspension that is often observed in modern tsunami deposits, are typically formed under steady and uniform flow and are therefore good candidates for reconstructing flow conditions using inverse sediment transport models. By applying forward models of sediment transport, we will test how different tsunami waveforms, wave heights, sediment source distributions, roughness, and local slopes affect patterns of deposition. This will help us assess which deposits have characteristics that scale with tsunami wave heights used as initial conditions in the forward model, and are therefore more indicative of relative tsunami magnitude. Here, we attempt to determine if the tsunamis that created the pre-historic deposits found at Stardust and Driftwood Bays were larger than the 1957 tsunami. Several of the deposit ages can be correlated between Stardust and Driftwood Bay, suggesting common sources in large subduction zone earthquakes. We may ultimately be able to use the deposit characteristics and modeling results to estimate minimum magnitudes of these pre-historic great earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "River deltas form where sediment-rich waters debouche into bodies of standing water. These sediments are sorted, deposited, and re-worked, through the combined effects of buoyancy, rivers, tides, winds, and waves, creating a self-organized system. This organization is further controlled by vegetation where landforms are high enough relative to the standing water level to support it. Past work on wetland systems use histograms of elevation to infer rates of change in elevation as a function of elevation itself. We test this inference on Wax Lake Delta, a rapidly prograding sub-delta in Atchafalaya Delta system, Louisiana, using two lidar surveys collected in 2009 and 2013. The island surfaces have comparably low elevation relative to mean water level, with subaerial relief of only 0-1.5 m being composed of chevron-shaped channel-bounding levees bounding large, shallow internal lagoons. Island vegetation succeeds from aquatic to intertidal to emergent species along the elevation gradient. Peaks in the histogram of 2009 elevations suggest multiple stable elevations within the delta. Statistical analysis of the differences between the lidar surveys shows elevation change as a function of both location (within the delta as a whole and within individual islands) and initial elevation. These functional relationships can be attributed to the interaction of sediments, vegetation, water currents due to both riverine and bay processes, and local subsidence.",

            "abstract": "It has been shown that Great Basin precipitation is greatly affected by modes associated with the Pacific Ocean, mainly El Nino—Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We completed an assessment of 20 models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) using historical (1900-2005) monthly model precipitation and sea surface temperature (SST) output. We evaluated model performance of the effects of ENSO and PDO on Great Basin precipitation and compared the results to observations. The results of the study informed a filtering of the future (2010-2099) precipitation output of the top performing models over the western US under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). In general, average precipitation in the top models tended to increase in a late future period (2070-2099) over the northern portion of the western US and decrease over the southern portion, with the zero-line centrally located over the Great Basin. This is consistent with the variance ratio computed for the same time period, which tended to increase where average precipitation increased and vice versa. One challenge for the models identified across the ensemble stems from the connectivity between ENSO and the PDO. The effect of ENSO on western US precipitation is modulated by the phase of the PDO. To better understand how the ocean interacts with the atmosphere and results in precipitation over the Great Basin, the storm track dynamics were analyzed by computing the stream function and correlating it with precipitation.",

            "abstract": "The use of reflective surfaces offers one low-cost solution for reducing solar loading to urban environments and the Earth that should be considered as part of sustainable urban design. Here, we characterize the radiative benefits, i.e. the additional shortwave radiation leaving the atmosphere, from the installation of highly reflective “cool” roofs in urban areas in India that face relatively large local aerosol burdens. We use a previously tested column radiative transfer model to estimate the energy per unit area reflected to space from increasing the surface albedo at six cities within India. The model is used to characterize radiative transfer each day over five years (2008-2012) based on mid-day satellite retrievals of MODIS aerosol depth, cloud water path, and average surface albedo and MERRA atmospheric profiles of temperature and composition. Compared against 10 months of field observations in two cities, the model derived incoming surface shortwave radiation estimates relative to observations show small biases (0.5% and -2.6%, at Pantnagar and Nainital, respectively). Despite the high levels of local aerosols we found cool roofs provided significant radiative benefits at all locations. Averaged over the five year period we found that increasing the albedo of 1 m-2 of roof area by 0.5 would reflect to space 0.9 - 1.2 kWh daily from 08:30 – 15:30 LST, depending on location. This is equivalent to a constant forcing of 37 - 50 W m-2 (equivalent to reducing CO2 emissions by 74 to 101 kg CO2 m-2 roof area). Last, we identify a co-benefit of improving air quality, in that removing aerosols from the atmosphere could increase the radiative benefits from cool roofs by 23 – 74%, with the largest potential increase found at Delhi and the smallest change found at Nainital.",

It responds little to ionspheric currents, which dominate ground-based measurements, so that AMPERE and ground datasets complement each other to give a comprehensive view of near-Earth electric currents.\nConnors et al. (GRL, 2014) found that a three-dimensional current system slightly modified from the original substorm current wedge (SCW) concept of McPherron et al. (JGR, 1973) represented substorm midnight sector perturbations well both in the auroral and subauroral regions, if a current equivalent to that found by integrating AMPERE downward current was used, located where clear SCW signatures were indicated by AMPERE, and featuring an ionospheric electrojet. The AMPERE upward current was found to exceed that in the SCW, at least in part since the evening sector electrojet fed into it. We extend these results with a more detailed accounting of field-aligned and ionospheric currents throughout the active period (including growth phase). Ionospheric currents for the study are obtained from ground perturbations through optimization of a simple forward model over regions or on a meridian chain. We also investigate the degree to which subauroral perturbations may be directly calculated from AMPERE results.\nWe further find that auroral zone currents may be very localized, to the extent that the entire SCW ionospheric current flows in a very restricted latitudinal range near onset, possibly corresponding to a single auroral arc.",

AMS Radiocarbon ages have been available to researchers for several decades now, and precision of the technique has continued to improve. Analysis and time cost is high, though, and projects are often limited in terms of the number of dates that can be used to develop a chronology. The Gas Ion Source at the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS), while providing lower-precision (uncertainty of order 100 14C y for a sample), is significantly less expensive and far less time consuming than conventional age dating and offers the unique opportunity for large amounts of ages. Here we couple two approaches, one analytical and one statistical, to investigate the utility of an age model comprised of these lower-precision ages for paleotempestology. We use a gas ion source interfaced to a gas-bench type device to generate radiocarbon dates approximately every 5 minutes while determining the order of sample analysis using the published Bayesian accumulation histories for deposits (Bacon). During two day-long sessions, several dates were obtained from carbonate shells in living position in a sediment core comprised of sapropel gel from Mangrove Lake, Bermuda. Samples were prepared where large shells were available, and the order of analysis was determined by the depth with the highest uncertainty according to Bacon. We present the results of these analyses as well as a prognosis for a future where such age models can be constructed from many dates that are quickly obtained relative to conventional radiocarbon dates. This technique currently is limited to carbonates, but development of a system for organic material dating is underway. We will demonstrate the extent to which sacrificing some analytical precision in favor of more dates improves age models.",

            "abstract": "Among natural fractures observed in core of Eagle Ford Shale, Texas, tall sub-vertical calcite-cemented fractures are the most spatially extensive. Similar sub-vertical opening-mode fractures are found in many mudrocks, and far more often than not they are completely cemented. Currently there is very little evidence that these calcite cements are anything but impermeable, and thus would hinder flow across the fractures while having an insignificant effect on flow parallel to the fractures. This suggests that natural fractures in mudrocks are barriers to flow, which goes against the general consensus that natural fractures in mudrocks enhance flow. We used scanning-electron microscopy (SEM) on broad-beam argon-ion milled samples of a calcite-cemented fracture with a kinematic aperture (width) of 200 µm to study the pore space of the calcite for any indication that completely cemented fractures are permeable. In the fracture calcite cement, we observed primary porosity between calcite grains that is generally well-connected with an average aperture between 25 and 100 nm. The permeability of these flow-paths was determined by lattice Boltzmann methods to be between 50 to 200 µD. These flow-paths have a spacing between 50 and 300 µm, therefore a square centimeter (length*height) of fracture cement will contain on average more than 100 flow-paths. Thus for flow across the fracture cement (orthogonal to the fracture) the overall cross-fracture permeability of the cement can be approximated using simple effective medium upscaling. The fracture cement studied here is found to have a cross-fracture permeability in the range of 25 to 100 nD. Although this is a very low permeability, it is within the range of the permeability of the host rock, and thus these calcite cements would have almost no effect on flow orthogonal to the plane of the fracture. These flow-paths are also connected within the cement creating the equivalent of a single tortuous flow-path along the plane of the fracture with a possible permeability upwards of 10 to 50 µD. This is far lower than the permeability of the fracture without the cement (~1500 D), but in comparison to the host rock permeability (< 200 nD) would still act as a highway for fluid flow.",

Previous work using thin-sheet modeling indicates lithospheric buoyancy dominates the force balance driving large-scale Nubia-Somalia divergence, however GPS observations within the Western Branch of the EARS show along-rift motions that contradict this simple model. Here, we test the role of mantle flow at the rift-scale using our new, regional 3D numerical model based on the open-source code ASPECT. We define a thermal lithosphere with thicknesses that are systematically changed for generic models or based on geophysical constraints in the Western branch (e.g. melting depths, xenoliths, seismic tomography). Preliminary results suggest existing variations in lithospheric thicknesses along-rift in the Western Branch can drive upper mantle flow that is consistent with geodetic observations.",

            "abstract": "South America fires are an important component of the tropical carbon budget. In this research we compare the 2007 and 2010 fire seasons: satellite observations reveal a similar burned area extent for 2007 and 2010 fires but very different levels of CO emissions, thus these differences reveal some of the processes controlling tropical fires. For example, the 2010 drought year may have resulted in an increase in combustion efficiency and/or combustion completeness due to more readily combustible fuel. Alternatively the 2010 drought may have resulted in combustion completeness decrease due to a reduction in readily combustible fuel production. These two hypotheses have conflicting implications on the net carbon losses from drought fires. To determine the likelihood of the above-stated hypotheses, we use the satellite-based CO and CH4 constraints to optimize a simple biomass-burning model. Relative to 2007, we show that a lower combustion completeness for forest and savanna fires, combined with an increase in combustion efficiency and completeness in agricultural areas, best explain the TES and MOPITT constraints. While we have gained an insight on the effects of the 2010 drought on biomass combustion characteristics, additional constraints are needed to improve estimates of total carbon losses from both years.",

Weather stations and networks of stations have been installed both locally and abroad in mostly rural and resource-limited settings. The data are being used either in the classroom to engage students in place-based, scientific investigations and/or research to improve hydrometeorological hazard forecasting, including water scarcity. The San Vicente (El Salvador) Network of six stations monitors rainfall to aid warning and evacuations for landslide and flooding hazards. Other parameters are used in modeling the watershed hydrology. A station installed in Hermosillo, Mexico is used in both Geography and Ecology Classes. Trends in temperature and rainfall are graphed and compared to historic data gathered over the last 30 years by CONAGUA. These observations are linked to local water-related problems, including well salinization, diminished agriculture, depleted aquifers, and social conflict regarding access to water. Two weather stations were installed at the Hannahville Indian Community School (Nah Tah Wahsh) in Michigan for educational purposes of data collection, analysis, and presentation. Through inquiry-based explorations of local hydrological processes, students are introduced to how meteorological data are used in understanding watershed hydrology and the sustainable management of groundwater resources. Several Michigan Technological University Peace Corps Masters International students have deployed weather stations in and around the communities where they serve, and the data are used in research to help in understanding water resource availability and irrigation needs.",

            "abstract": "Long-term observations (10 years) of current velocity, hydrographic properties, and meteorological conditions collected at the University of Maine Ocean Observing System (UMOOS) buoy F in outer western Penobscot Bay, Maine, are used to characterize flow structure and its associated dynamics in this system. The mean vertical velocity structure is primarily density-driven, with characteristic outflow typically restricted to the upper layer and inflow at middle and deep depths. At the synoptic scale, weather-based events dominate current variability; along-channel velocity at the surface and at depth is highly correlated with along-channel wind. This is typical of two-layer competition between wind forcing and pressure gradient force: wind forcing drives the surface layer, and the deeper return flow is forced by an expected sea-level setup resulting from the wind forcing. This velocity structure is modulated seasonally; during fall-winter, the surface outflow layer is deeper, and the shear at depth stronger, than during spring-summer conditions. The seasonal change in the velocity profile appears related to the seasonal change in wind conditions rather than river discharge, although seasonal stratification is linked to the restriction of shear to shallower depths in spring-summer. At interannual timescales, the same link between wind forcing and along-channel velocity is observed. These findings have important implications for key processes in the bay, such as the transport of nutrients, planktonic larvae, and pollutants.",

Information about how stishovite deforms under stress is important for understanding subduction of quartz-bearing crustal rocks into the mantle. Particularly, stishovite is elastically anisotropic and thus development of crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) during deformation may contribute to seismic anomalies in the mantle.\nWe converted a natural sample of flint to stishovite in a laser heated diamond anvil cell and compressed the stishovite aggregate up to 38 GPa. Diffraction patterns were collected in situ in radial geometry at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) and the Advanced Photon Source (APS) to examine development of CPO during deformation. We find that (001) poles preferentially align with the compression direction and infer deformation mechanisms leading to the observed CPO with visco-plastic self consistent (VPSC) polycrystal plasticity models.\nOur results show pyramidal and basal slip are most likely active at high pressure and ambient temperature, in agreement with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of rutile (TiO2) and paratellurite (TeO2), which are isostructural to stishovite. Conversely other TEM studies of stishovite done at higher temperature suggest dominant prismatic slip. This indicates that a variety of slip systems may be active in stishovite, depending on conditions. As a result, stishovite’s contribution to the seismic signature in the mantle may vary as a function of pressure and temperature and thus depth.",

The complementary nature of each site's strengths, Goldstone's maneuverability (and, recently, higher spatial resolution) and Arecibo's higher nominal output power and unmatched collecting area, allow for better constraints on sizes, shapes, spin states, and surface properties of near-Earth asteroids than either system can provide on its own. Here, we will discuss a handful of objects observed with both facilities, including binary asteroids (285263) 1998 QE2 and (153958) 2002 AM31 and contact-binary asteroid (192642) 1999 RD32, and describe how the complementary nature of the Goldstone and Arecibo radars has enhanced our knowledge of these small bodies.\nThe importance of collaboration between Goldstone and Arecibo will only increase in the future as we look to expand the use of high-resolution bistatic observations of near-Earth asteroids, where both sites simultaneously observe a target. Observations this past June during the close flyby of 2014 HQ124 (Benner et al., this meeting) demonstrated reception at Arecibo of a 40-MHz bandwidth (3.75-m resolution), X-band transmission from Goldstone. Future capabilities of the Deep Space Network (Busch et al., this meeting), such as the 80-MHz (1.875-m resolution) radar on the Goldstone 34-m dish, will benefit greatly from the sensitivity of Arecibo's large aperture.",

            "abstract": "The ability of terrestrial ecosystems to increase net primary production in response to rising CO2 requires that the availability of water and other resources keep pace with increasing evaporative demand due to warming. While climate models project increasing aridity and drought severity for many areas, our understanding of the potential effects of drying on ecosystems is uncertain and largely based on satellite observations and short-term experiments. With limited long-term field data it is difficult both to distinguish effects of transient departures from climatological norms (drought) from monotonic changes to background aridity and to separate the effects of drying from other factors (e.g., carbon dioxide and nitrogen (N)) that might ameliorate responses to increased evaporative demand. Here, we use a long-term harvest record to document a >50% reduction in primary production of a native subalpine grassland over the last four decades and link this to increasing regional aridity. Declines in plant productivity occurred across C3 grasses and non-graminoid annual forbs but were most severe in forbs. Using the statistical method of convergent cross mapping (CCM) in combination with a long-term snow-addition experiment and climatological and biogeochemical data, we assign the timing and mode of forcing to increasing late summer dryness. Analysis of long-term patterns of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of plants and regional patterns of atmospheric N deposition suggest that increasing water use efficiency may have slightly ameliorated the decline in grasses but not forbs and that N availability had no effects. Our results demonstrate a sustained climate-induced decline in the productivity of a grassland ecosystem and underscore the importance of long-term monitoring.",

Melt inclusions were analyzed for volatile contents using two different techniques, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and ion microprobe (SIMS). Data from FTIR on quartz-hosted melt inclusions reveal pre-eruptive CO2 concentrations (maximum ~ 300 ppm), and H2O contents (average = 4.3 wt.%) that are similar to H2O contents derived from SIMS on the same inclusions (average = 4.2 wt.%). Melt inclusions in sanidine yield higher CO2 concentrations (maximum ~ 400 ppm) than those hosted in quartz, yet yield much lower H2O contents (average = 2.5 wt.% via FTIR; average = 2.7 wt.% via SIMS). The higher CO2 trapped in sanidine-hosted melt inclusions may suggest higher trapping pressures than are recorded by quartz, whereas the low H2O recorded by sanidine may signify preferential H loss from sanidine. SIMS and Laser-Ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS) trace element analyses of melt inclusions define a continuous liquid line of descent from sanidine-hosted inclusions that record high Sr and increasing Ba with crystallization, to quartz-hosted inclusions that record low Sr and decreasing Ba with crystallization. In the case of the Tara magmatic system, sanidine-hosted inclusions seem to record an earlier, deeper stage of the melt’s history. Assessing melt inclusions within multiple phenocryst hosts may provide insights into different stages of a melt’s history from storage to ascent and eruption.",

            "abstract": "The extraction of fossil fuels from the Alberta oil sands has been the focus of considerable attention due to its association with sizeable emissions of a variety of atmospheric pollutants, the magnitude and impacts of which are currently poorly constrained by observations. In order to more reliably estimate the magnitude and impact of these emissions, an intensive air quality measurement campaign, called \"Fort McMurray Oil Sands Strategic Investigation of Local Sources\" (FOSSILS), was conducted in the summer of 2013 as part of the Alberta-Canada joint oil sands monitoring program (JOSM) to identify and quantify emissions and their transformations from the Alberta oil sands. The challenge is that the region is surrounded by boreal forest, which provides a substantial background of biogenic hydrocarbons during summer.\nIn this presentation, measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at the AMS13 ground site near Fort McKay, Alberta, from Aug 17 to Sept 6, 2013 using a commercial Griffin 450 gas chromatograph equipped with ion trap mass spectrometric detection and Tenax preconcentration are described. The combination of retention information and electron impact mass spectral data allowed unambiguous identification and quantification of the major biogenic monoterpenes, e.g., α and β-pinene, limonene, camphene, and 3Δ-carene, and of many anthropogenically derived hydrocarbons. Mixing ratios of biogenic hydrocarbons varied with time of day, temperature, and solar radiation, with maxima typically occurring at night, rationalized by nocturnal mixing heights and low mixing ratios of the nocturnal oxidants ozone (O3) and the nitrate radical (NO3). In contrast, mixing ratios of anthropogenic VOCs, e.g., benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and o-, p-, and m-xylene (BTEX), strongly depended on meteorological conditions, i.e., local wind direction. During episodes with high BTEX abundance, many additional high molecular weight hydrocarbons were observed which were not resolved on the chromatographic column.

            "abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry is a promising method for diagenetic and deep time paleoclimate studies, but original clumped isotope (Δ47) compositions can be altered by fluid and thermal diagenetic processes. Previous work shows Δ47 resetting of calcite occurs at temperatures exceeding 100°C over time periods of millions of years, but such thermally-driven effects have not been considered for dolomite. Differences between calcite and dolomite temperature calibrations are also largely unquantified, and the effect of burial diagenesis on dolomite Δ47 has not been measured.\nCoexisting calcites and dolomites in a ~4500 meter core from Andros Island, Bahamas, offer a unique opportunity to address these questions. These dolomites and calcites formed over a time span from the Cretaceous to Pleistocene under near-surface temperature conditions. Clumped isotope analysis of this material reveals that where these carbonate phases are buried to depths greater than ~3000 meters, realistic surface temperatures (~25 °C) are not preserved. Moreover, these phases do not record reasonable geothermal conditions (> 80 °C), but rather record temperatures between 40 and 60°C.\nHere we evaluate whether this Δ47 “error” is due to solid-state resetting of clumped isotopes, emplacement of minor burial cements, fabric retentive recrystallization, or some combination thereof. Our results show that clumped isotope compositions of both calcite and dolomite respond similarly to diagenetic resetting of primary values under conditions of burial. These data further emphasize the need to constrain the diagenetic history of samples used for clumped isotope work. The similar Δ47 temperatures recorded by each carbonate type suggest that dolomites and calcites are equally viable temperature proxy sources under shallow burial conditions, yet both seem equally susceptible to “resetting” of their primary clumped isotope abundances.",

            "abstract": "Geomagnetic storms start with activity on the Sun that causes propagation of magnetized plasma structures in the solar wind. The type of solar activity is used to classify the plasma structures as being either interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) or corotating interaction region (CIR)-driven. The ICME-driven events are further classified as either magnetic cloud (MC)-driven or sheath (SH)-driven by the geoeffective structure responsible for the peak of the storm. The geoeffective solar wind flow then interacts with the magnetosphere producing a disturbance in near-Earth space. It is commonly believed that a SH-driven event behaves more like a CIR-driven event than a MC-driven event; however, in our analysis this is not the case. In this study, geomagnetic storms are investigated statistically with respect to the solar wind driver and the intensity of the events. We use the Hot Electron and Ion Drift Integrator (HEIDI) model to simulate the inner magnetospheric hot ion population during all of the storms classified as intense (Dstmin < - 100 nT) within solar cycle 23 (1996-2005). HEIDI is configured four different ways using either the Volland-Stern or self-consistent electric field and either event-based Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) magnetospheric plasma analyzer (MPA) data or a reanalyzed lower resolution version of the data that provides spatial resolution. Presenting the simulation results, geomagnetic data, and solar wind data along a normalized epoch timeline shows the average behavior throughout a typical storm of each classification. The error along the epoch timeline for each HEIDI configuration is used to rate the model's performance. We also subgrouped the storms based on the magnitude of the minimum Dst. We found that typically the LANL MPA data provides the best outer boundary condition. Additionally, the self-consistent electric field better reproduces SH and MC-driven events throughout most of the storm timeline but the Volland-Stern electric field better reproduces CIR-driven events. Contrary to what we expect, examination of the HEIDI model results and solar wind data show that SH-driven events behave more like MC-driven events than CIR-driven storms.",

This polar desert provides a simple hydrologic system, where seasonally intermittent streams convey glacier melt water into closed basin lakes. Streams are underlain by continuous permafrost, but during the flow season a thawed hyporheic zone (<1m) develops around the open channel. The exchange of relatively dilute glacier water with hyporheic sediments facilitates weathering processes that control stream solute loads. This study uses several end-member mixing models to simulate concentration – discharge relationships observed in 14 streams, using over 20 years of hydro chemical data. Results show that (1) streams exhibit chemostatic behavior across daily and annual timescales, indicating a temporally variable flux of solutes from the hyporheic zone; (2) the chemical budgets of longer streams are more influenced by hyporheic zone reactions than shorter streams; and (3) end-member mixing models and naturally occurring tracers allow for the passive modeling of hyporheic exchange processes. This work provides insight into how weathering contributions from hyporheic zones affect catchment ionic budgets in diverse temperate and polar catchments with dilute snow and glacial meltwater sources of streamflow.",

Over two field seasons two cadres of 12 students (12 women and 12 men) were chosen from small-to-large state universities and private colleges. REU students participated in three major activities constituting a complete research experience: Field studies involved geologic mapping and sampling of Precambrian basement; formulation of testable research questions by smaller working groups; and mapping and sampling projects to address research questions; Analytical studies, sample preparation immediately followed field work with petrographic analysis at students' home institutions and a week-long visit to analytical laboratories to conduct follow-up studies by small research groups during the academic year (Univ. Florida - geochemistry and geochronology; Univ. Minnesota - EMPA analysis); Communicating results, each working group submitted an abstract and collectively presented 13 posters at the 2011 and 2012 GSA Rocky Mountain sectional meetings. We used directed discovery to engage students in a community of practice in the field and found that a long apprenticeship (2-3 weeks) is optimal for novice-master interactions in exploring natural setting. Initial group hikes were used to normalize methods and language of the discipline. Students developed a sense of ownership of the overall project and assumed personal responsibility for directed research projects. Training was provided to: guide students in selection and appropriate use of tools; develop sampling strategies; discuss communal ethics, values, and expectations; develop efficient work habits; stimulate independent thinking; and engage decision-making. It was important to scaffold the field experience to students’ level of development to lead to mastery. Analytical activities were designed from rock to analysis so that each group mastered all preparation steps and instrumental techniques under supervision of graduate mentors and lab managers leading to a clearer understanding of data interpretation. Students were communally engaged in abstract and poster preparation to ensure proper focus, scientific breadth, and style of presentation.",

We present here high-resolution, benthic foraminiferal δ13C and δ18O records from a 4-core depth transect in the Southwest Pacific Ocean that document shallow stratification and poor ventilation below ~660 m in the last glacial period. Starting at 17 ka, rapid convergence of shallow and intermediate-depth (660-2050 m) δ13C suggests thickening and increased ventilation of intermediate water, which was interrupted by restratification starting during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; 14.5-12.8 ka). δ18O and δ13C from two planktonic foraminiferal species, G.bulloides and G. inflata, growing at different depths, suggest changes in thermocline depth and a switch in source location of mixed layer and shallow subsurface waters from proximal Southern Ocean and more distal equatorial sources which was coeval with changes in intermediate water ventilation. The close coincidence of these changes with early Southern Hemisphere warming and wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean suggests that latitudinal shifts in the southern Westerly wind belt affected intermediate water formation and initiated CO2 release from the ocean early in the termination.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic VLF waves, such as whistler mode waves, both control the lifetime of trapped electrons in the radiation belts by pitch-angle scattering and are responsible for the energization of electrons during storms. Traditional approaches to understanding the influence of waves on trapped electrons have assumed that the wave characteristics (frequency spectrum, wave-normal angle distribution, etc.) were both stationary in time and amplitude independent from event to event. In situ data from modern satellite missions, such as the Van Allen probes, are showing that this assumption may not be justified. In addition, recent theoretical results [Crabtree et al. 2012] show that the threshold for nonlinear wave scattering can often be met by naturally occurring VLF waves in the magnetosphere, with wave magnetic fields of the order of 50-100 pT inside the plasmapause. Nonlinear wave scattering (Nonlinear Landau Damping) is an amplitude dependent mechanism that can strongly alter VLF wave propagation [Ganguli et al. 2010], primarily by altering the direction of propagation. Laboratory results have confirmed the dramatic change in propagation direction when the pump wave has sufficient amplitude to exceed the nonlinear threshold [Tejero et al. 2014]. Nonlinear scattering can alter the macroscopic dynamics of waves in the radiation belts leading to the formation of a long-lasting wave-cavity [Crabtree et al. 2012] and, when amplification is present, a multi-pass amplifier [Ganguli et al., 2012]. Such nonlinear wave effects can dramatically reduce electron lifetimes. Nonlinear wave dynamics such as these occur when there are more than one wave present, such a condition necessarily violates the assumption of traditional wave-normal analysis [Santolik et al., 2003] which rely on the plane wave assumption. To investigate nonlinear wave dynamics using modern in situ data we apply the maximum entropy method [Skilling and Bryan, 1984] to solve for the wave distribution function [Storey and Lefeuvre, 1979] to yield the power distribution as a function of wave-normal angle and local azimuthal angle. We have validated this technique in the NRL space chamber and applied this methodology to Van Allen probe data to demonstrate that traditional wave-normal analaysis can give misleading results when multiple waves are present.",

            "abstract": "Improving the estimate of snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Sierra Nevada has merit for California, given the ongoing drought that has lasted for years. In this study, we carried out an experiment to estimate SWE in the Upper Kern Basin, Sierra Nevada, by assimilating AMSR-E observed brightness temperatures (Tb) into a coupled hydrology and radiative transfer model using an ensemble Kalman batch reanalysis. The data assimilation framework merges the complementary SWE information from modeling and observations for an improved SWE estimate. The novelty of this assimilation study is that both the modeling and the radiance data processing were specifically improved to provide more information about SWE. With the enhanced SWE signals in both simulation and observation, the batch reanalysis should stand a better chance of successfully improving the SWE estimates.\nThe modeling was at a very high resolution (90m) and spanned a range of mountain environmental factors to better characterize the effects of the mountain environment on snow distribution and radiance emission. We have developed a dynamic snow grain size module to improve the radiance modeling during the intense snowfall events. The AMSR-E 37GHz V-pol observed Tb was processed at its native footprint resolution at ~100 km2. In the batch assimilation, the model predicted the prior SWE and Tb; the prior estimate of an entire year was then updated by the dry-season observations at one time. One advantage of this is that the prior SWE of a certain period is updated using the observations both before and after this period, which takes advantage of the temporally continuous signal of the seasonal snow accumulation in the observations.\nWe found the posterior SWE estimates showed improved accuracy and robustness. During the study period of 2003 to 2008, at point-scale, the average bias of the six-year April 1st SWE was reduced from -0.17 m to -0.01m, the average temporal SWE RMSE of the dry season and the entire year decreased by 51.2% and 11.7%, respectively. The basin-scale results showed that the average April 1st SWE bias reduced from -0.17m to -0.11m, and the temporal SWE RMSE of the dry season and the entire year decreased by 23.6% and 13.1%, respectively. Future work includes assimilating visible band observations to improve the overall SWE estimate in the ablation season.",

            "abstract": "Production of hydrocarbon from shale requires creation and maintenance of fracture permeability in an otherwise impermeable shale matrix. In this study, we use a combination of triaxial coreflood experiments and x-ray tomography characterization to investigate the fracture-permeability behavior of Utica shale at in situ reservoir conditions (25-50 oC and 35-120 bars). Initially impermeable shale core was placed between flat anvils (compression) or between split anvils (pure shear) and loaded until failure in the triaxial device. Permeability was monitored continuously during this process. Significant deformation (>1%) was required to generate a transmissive fracture system. Permeability generally peaked at the point of a distinct failure event and then dropped by a factor of 2-6 when the system returned to hydrostatic failure. Permeability was very small in compression experiments (< 1 mD), possibly because of limited fracture connectivity through the anvils. In pure share experiments, shale with bedding planes perpendicular to shear loading developed complex fracture networks with narrow apertures and peak permeability of 30 mD. Shale with bedding planes parallel to shear loading developed simple fractures with large apertures and a peak permeability as high as 1 D. Fracture systems held at static conditions for periods of several hours showed little change in effective permeability at hydrostatic conditions as high as 140 bars. However, permeability of fractured systems was a function of hydrostatic pressure, declining in a pseudo-linear, exponential fashion as pressure increased. We also observed that permeability decreased with increasing fluid flow rate indicating that flow did not follow Darcy’s Law, possibly due to non-laminar flow conditions, and conformed to Forscheimer’s law. The coupled deformation and flow behavior of Utica shale, particularly the large deformation required to initiate flow, indicates the probable importance of activation of existing fractures in hydraulic fracturing and that these fractures can have adequate permeability for the production of hydrocarbon.",

            "abstract": "We used the USEPA’s 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) data to assess the potential sensitivity of stream biodiversity to both spatial variation in measures of extreme flow and likely changes in extreme flows associated with projected climate change. The NRSA data consisted of macroinvertebrate samples collected at 1313 reference-quality sites. We characterized the hydrologic regimes at each of these sites by developing Random Forest empirical models from long-term (≥ 20 years) daily flow records obtained from 601 gaged USGS stations. These models described spatial variation in 16 flow variables as a function of climate and watershed attributes. Three of the models characterized aspects of extreme flow: the mean number of zero-flow events per year (ZeroDays), the mean number of high-flow events per year (HighDays = number of events per year that exceed the 95th percentile of mean annual flow), and the coefficient of variation of daily flows (CV). We used these models to predict the flow attributes expected at each of the 1313 sites with ecological data. We then built additional Random Forest models that related among-site differences in stream macroinvertebrate taxonomic composition, assemblage richness, and the likelihood of observing individual taxa to the 16 measures of flow regime and other environmental predictors. At the national level, ZeroDays was an important predictor of macroinvertebrate biodiversity: richness declined as ZeroDays increased. A similar pattern was observed when analyses were restricted to lowland and plains streams. For eastern highland streams, HighDays was a better predictor of stream biodiversity than aspects of low flow: richness declined as HighDays increased. For western streams, CV was a better predictor of biodiversity than either ZeroDays or HighDays: biodiversity decreased as CV increased. Empirical models that linked flow attributes to climate change projections imply that flow regime response to climate change will vary nationally with many currently intermittent streams becoming more permanent and many permanent streams becoming more intermittent. Ecological responses to climate change are therefore expected to exhibit similar idiosyncratic patterns with some streams losing biodiversity and other streams gaining biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "Infrasound (sound between ~0.01-20 Hz) is often used to monitor volcanoes and provide insight into eruption dynamics. Of the main goals in the volcano infrasound community, associating volcanic emissions with specific infrasound features remains of importance. Here we focus on infrasound collected during two separate field campaigns at Karymsky Volcano, Kamchatka, Russia and Sakurajima Volcano, Japan. Both volcanoes are andesitic and produce frequent eruptions. Recent Karymsky eruptions have been classified into four main eruption types: discrete ash explosions, pulsatory gas emissions, gas jetting, and quiescence followed by an explosion. Sakurajima eruptions are typically ash-rich and are dominantly Vulcanian in character. We use a waveform cross correlation scheme to identify infrasound waveform families from recent eruptions at each volcano. We also identify changes in eruption dynamics by tracking the number and occurrence of these families though time. This can be done on a large scale (changes in relation to the families) as well as on a smaller scale (changes in relation to the subfamilies). During these field campaigns volcanic emissions data were also collected using ground-based sampling, and visual, ultraviolet, and infrared remote sensing techniques. The infrasound waveform families are then correlated with volcanic emissions data to determine unique signatures of volcanic emissions. By comparing model calculations and physical data, this information will hopefully lead to improved monitoring and characterization of volcanic eruptions using infrasound in particular at remote, difficult to monitor volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "The mode of extension and crustal accretion may vary significantly during subduction margin evolution. Mantle water content likely has a strongly influence on this evolution as it strongly affects the mantle solidus and rheology. Effects of mantle hydration on volcanism and tectonics were examined in the southern Mariana margin in 2012 on a R/V Thompson cruise. The southern Mariana margin is actively rifting sub-parallel to the trench forming new crust and lithosphere directly above the de-watering slab (see Ribeiro et al. session T011). Shallow seismicity shows broadly distributed active deformation in the upper plate. Shallow-towed and near-bottom sidescan sonar data map a highly faulted terrain with rotated crustal blocks and distributed volcanic emplacements. The near-bottom sidescan sonar data also image an apparent corrugated core complex structure, the first such described from a convergent margin setting, indicating low-angle normal faulting during the extension. Water content in sampled volcanics is ~2 %, approaching that of the volcanic arc itself. Volcanic rocks from the eastern margin are mostly ~2-4 m.y. old, but younger basaltic volcaniclastics were recovered farther west suggesting that active volcanism may continue. We hypothesize that the broadly distributed volcanism and tectonic activity is due to high mantle water content that weakens the margin lithosphere. Continual water addition from the subducting slab inhibits melting-related dehydration and strengthening as has been proposed for lithosphere formed at mid-ocean ridges. A consequence of a broadening zone of rifting is that extension-related mantle upwelling rates will decrease with time. Surface cooling will thus progressively depress the mantle solidus, perhaps explaining the paucity of current observed volcanism at the margin. The volcano-tectonic processes active today in the southern Mariana margin may be modern analogs of those inferred at subduction zone infancy where broadly distributed contemporaneous extension and volcanism above the initially subducting and de-watering slab have been proposed. If so, and if ophiolites are relicts of early crust formed at subduction settings, they may reflect crustal accretion processes that differ significantly from those at mid-ocean ridges.",

            "abstract": "The temperature of shallow groundwater is tightly coupled to aquatic ecosystem health and rates of subsurface geochemical processes. Shallow groundwater temperatures are understood to respond to soil surface temperatures, which in turn depend on climate and land use. To address gaps in knowledge concerning land use impacts on shallow groundwater quality, a bookended floodplain study was implemented in Hinkson Creek Watershed, central Missouri, USA to better understand rural land use impacts on shallow groundwater temperature (SGW). Study sites included a historic agricultural field (Ag) and remnant bottomland hardwood forest (BHF). Each site included nine piezometers equally spaced in an 80 x 80 m grid. Piezometers were equipped with pressure transducers to monitor SGW temperature and water level at 30 minute intervals during the 2011, 2012, and 2013 water years. Average SGW temperature during the three water years was 11.3 °C at both the Ag and BHF sites. However, the temperature range at the Ag site was 63% greater than the BHF. Results indicate a greater responsiveness to seasonal climate fluctuations in the SGW temperature of the Ag site where there was an absence of forest canopy. Average SGW temperatures at the Ag site were 11.8, 11.1, and 10.9 °C, for piezometer rows located 10, 50, and 90 m from the stream, respectively. Average shallow groundwater temperatures at the BHF site were 11.0, 11.8, and 11.2 °C, for piezometers located 10, 50, and 90 m from the stream, respectively. The range of SGW temperatures at the Ag site also decreased with increasing distance from stream, suggesting a distinct stream influence on Ag site SGW temperature. The 63% greater SGW temperature range indicates the Ag site may contribute warmer water to the stream, relative to the BHF. Results hold broad implications for land managers seeking to mitigate the impact of land use on floodplain processes and groundwater quality.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the spatial distribution of heavy energetic neutral atoms, mostly oxygen and neon, in the sky maps taken with the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) in 2009 - 2011. The IBEX-Lo sensor, one of two highly sensitive single-pixel cameras on the IBEX spacecraft, measures neutral particles within an energy range from 0.01 to 2 keV. In the time-of-flight detector of IBEX-Lo these neutral atoms can be identified as hydrogen or heavier atoms, such as oxygen. These measurements have provided all-sky maps of neutral hydrogen and oxygen. The dominant feature in these maps is the interstellar oxygen and neon gas flow. Its peak location is approximately consistent with the interstellar helium gas flow (Möbius et al., 2009, Science, 326, 969). The flow distribution is distributed over 210° - 240° ecliptic longitude and −6° - 12° ecliptic latitude. Another prominent feature in the oxygen sky maps at 0.2 to 0.8 keV is an extended tail of the oxygen signal toward lower longitude and higher positive latitude (180° - 210° ecliptic longitude and 0° - 24° ecliptic latitude). The measured peak rates in the extended tail is 3 – 5% of the maximum count rate in the primary oxygen and neon gas flow, but is four times higher than any other surrounding oxygen signals. The extended tail may indicate the secondary component of the interstellar oxygen, which is likely generated by charge exchange between local O+ ions and interstellar neutral H in the outer heliosheath. In this poster, we will discuss these two most prominent features in the oxygen sky maps and their implications for the source and the mechanism generating an extended tail in the oxygen signal.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the attenuation and amplification on the seismic wave propagation is fundamental for study Earth crust, its water content, temperature, and geology in general. The surface waves amplitude and attenuation can be used to help unravel both elastic as well as anaelastic structure of the Earth. Today, amplitude studies are mainly focused on long period seismic signals generated from earthquakes. This aspect introduces a limitation because of lack of high frequency energy from teleseismic events, and their limited geometrical distribution. We present here recent developments to retrieve amplitudes from the ambient seismic field (ASF). Our aim is to obtain unbiased measure of high frequency amplitude, to reconstruct the anelastic structure of the crust and upper mantle, while considering the effects of elastic focusing and defocusing in our analysis. Our processing, aimed to limit the effect of non-isoptropic ASF source distribution of incoming noise energy is employed in calculating noise correlation in US. Furthermore, we try to avoid any modification of the coherent amplitude information while pre-processing seismic noise time series before correlation. The resulting estimated amplitudes mainly explain the effect of station-to-station propagation and can be used to invert for attenuation parameters on the crust and upper mantle, although significant detailed analysis is needed to account for focusing.",

            "abstract": "The black carbon (BC) is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and is an important short-lived climate forcer because it absorbs solar radiation altering the Earth’s radiative budget and climate. It is also an atmospheric pollutant that promotes reactions of other compounds in the atmosphere. Despite its importance for health and climate, in Mexico there are very few studies on ambient concentrations of BC in urban areas and virtually no information of continuous measurements over long periods (more than a month of measurements). So, in order to develop more efficient local and regional mitigation strategies and policies that allow reducing ambient concentrations of BC, it is necessary to know BC seasonal evolution, contribution to radiative budget and impacts on health.\nThis study shows continuous measurements (from July 2013 to July 2014) of BC to perform an analysis of seasonal variations. The selected monitoring site is located at Iztapalapa, a densely populated area with high traffic on the southeastern part of Mexico City. BC concentrations were obtained by two aethalometers (Magee Scientific Company, models AET31 and AET42) placed 15 meters above the ground. The aethalometers operate in the wavelength range of 370-950 nm and use a standard value of mass absorption coefficient MAC = 10.8 m2/g to calculate BC environmental concentration. To correct the aethalometers readings to the conditions of Mexico City, it was employed MAC = to 6.7 m2/g, which was determined for PM2.5 with a carbon analyzer (UIC, Inc.) and represents the mass absorption coefficient of soot emitted in Mexico City. The average value of the corrected concentration of BC in Mexico City during the period from July 2013 to July 2014 was 5.39 ± 1.89 μg/m3 (1.6 higher than readings recorded by aethalometers), which is greater than that measured in Shanghai in 2014 (annual average 2.33 μg/m3) and those reported for some U.S. cities; the value implies a potential danger to the health of inhabitants in Mexico City.",

            "abstract": "Heat as a tracer has proven to be an effective method for quantifying groundwater - surface water interactions. However, there remains a lack of controlled, experimental data to assess fundamental aspects of heat transport in porous media. There may be a disconnect between field and model-based studies, because: 1) model results have yet to be tested against data from controlled laboratory experiments, and 2) there are often too many variables in field studies to be thoroughly modeled without simplification. This study is comprised of a three-dimensional transient numerical model of heat flow through a porous media coupled with steady state fluid flow using COMSOL Multiphysics. Pressure and temperature outputs are compared to data measured in a laboratory flume. The 3D model enables exploration of the effects of oblique flow paths through a stream bed and/or banks with a (stream) surface water upper boundary on diurnal temperature records. By imposing known flow or temperature gradients in any direction, we can analyze the effects of these diverse gradients on the veracity of current heat as a tracer methods (which assume unidirectional flow) as well as develop valid error statistics for these methods in the presence of non-vertical flow.",

In the United States, flood characterization studies have only been done on a case study basis. The lack of a comprehensive database matching flood characteristics such as peak discharges and flood duration with geospatial and geomorphologic information hampered systematic exploration. This study examines flooding characteristics across the continental United States in order to identify how space and time scales of floods vary with climatic regimes and geomorphology. Benefiting from the availability of a representative and long archive of flood events, this work results in a spatially and temporally comprehensive flood characterization over the US.\nWe characterized flooding events by linking flood response variables such as unit peak discharge and flooding rise time with morphologic parameters such as basin area, relief ratio and elongation ratio. This study also establishes new regression equations taking advantage of the long historical record of floods in US at our disposal per the publicly available flooding database.",

            "abstract": "To improve the efficiency of upwelling to control nitrogen dynamic in the ocean, better understanding of the occurring processes is necessary. This research explores δ15N of nitrate and sinking particles on a western boundary upwelling System (Cabo Frio, Brazil). The Continental Shelf of southeastern Brazil is dominated by the oligotrophic Brazil Current, whose instabilities promote the coastal upwelling of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), and consequently increases of primary productivity. The coastal upwelling system plays an important role in the nitrogen dynamics on the Cabo Frio Upwelling System (CFUS). However, the interactions between biological induced processes, including biological N-fixation and nitrate inputs from upwelled waters in CFUS still have not been well explored. Then, this study aims clarify N-dynamics on CFUS based on a cross-shelf approach. δ15N-nitrate was characterized for each water masses present on the shelf (South Atlantic Central Water, Tropical Water and Coastal Water) and associated with physicochemical parameters (T/S, nutrients), as well as the δ15N of sinking particles at different depths (from surface to the bottom water). Samples were collected in a time interval of 1 month during ~4 years (2011 to 2014). Cross-shelf gradients of nitrogen species concentration (ammonium + nitrite + nitrate) and stable isotopes were observed. The δ15N of nitrate and sinking particles were interpreted according to the prevailing processes of the N-transformations. Considering the region as N-limited (N:P < 16), processes as biological N-fixation seems to be dominant on oligotrophic Tropical Waters. Coastal upwelled SACW showed δ15N-nitrate signature within the global average of deep ocean (5-6‰) characterizing the inner and mid-shelf conditions, where the input of new nitrate from upwelling is rapidly used by organisms in the euphotic zone without any fractionation. On the other hands, the dominance of N-limited Tropical Waters on the outer shelf provide a δ15N-nitrate and δ15N-sinking particles signals (-2.0 to 3.0‰) lower than the global average of deep ocean range indicating the importance of N-biological fixation as a dominant source of nitrogen.

            "abstract": "The dynamic variability of Earth’s outer radiation, over a time scale of a day, is largely controlled by whistler mode chorus waves as demonstrated by satellite observations and numerical simulations. To better understand whistler mode wave generation in a controlled laboratory environment, we perform an experiment in the Large Plasma Device at UCLA. A broadband whistler-mode spectrum is generated by injecting a gyrating electron beam in a uniformly magnetized plasma. The mono-energetic electron beam is relaxed first in the parallel direction by rapidly growing electrostatic waves and collisions with background particles. After creating velocity spread in the parallel direction, the whistler mode wave grows due to the negative gradient of the velocity distribution function in the parallel direction (dF/dv//<0). We show that the unstable frequency range varies as either the beam tilt angle changes or the background electron density changes, which agrees well with the predictions of linear growth theory. The results reported are part of a long-term project to understand the physical process responsible for the generation of whistler-mode waves and their effects on energetic particles.",

            "abstract": "Seismic noise correlation is used nowadays to retrieve interstation body waves propagation at global scale. While the accuracy long period retrieved body waves are still under debate, short period (~7sec) P waves sampling the deep mantle can be used to infer the fine structure of the Earth. Thus accurately reconstructed body waves as PcP can be sued to study the structure in the vicinity of the core mantle boundary, and study the presence of low and high velocity layer above the CMB.\nBy using double beam forming we demonstrate that seismic noise correlations can be used to robustly image deep mantle reflections with a quality superior to that of earthquake data. The arrival time and slowness for noise and earthquakes sampling one region beneath Siberia are identical and the small amplitude reflections are sufficiently clear in the noise correlations to compare them reliably to synthetic data. Our study area is characterised by high seismic velocities and the imaged reflector at 2530 km depth is consistent with predictions for this scenario. Our results open exciting prospects of illuminating new target zones in the deep mantle to further constrain the dynamics and mineralogy of the deep Earth.",

            "abstract": "The Tertiary Nenana basin of Interior Alaska is currently the focus of both new oil exploration and coalbed methane exploitation and is being evaluated as a potential CO2sequestration site. The basin first formed as a Late Paleocene extensional rift with the deposition of oil and gas-prone, coal-bearing non-marine sediments with excellent source potential. Basin inversion during the Early Eocene-Early Oligocene times resulted in folding and erosion of higher stratigraphic levels, forming excellent structural and stratigraphic traps. Initiation of active faulting on its eastern margin in the middle Oligocene caused slow tectonic subsidence that resulted in the deposition of reservoir and seal rocks of the Usibelli Group. Onset of rapid tectonic subsidence in Pliocene that continues to the present-day has provided significant pressure and temperature gradient for the source rocks.\nApatite fission-track and vitrinite reflectance data reveals two major paleo-thermal episodes: Late Paleocene to Early Eocene (60 Ma to 54.8 Ma) and Late Miocene to present-day (7 Ma to present). These episodes of maximum paleotemperatures have implications for the evolution of source rock maturity within the basin.\nIn this study, we are also investigating the potential for coalbed methane production from the Late Paleocene coals via injection of CO2. Our preliminary analyses demonstrate that 150 MMSCF of methane could be produced while 33000 tonnes of CO2 per injection well (base case of ~9 years) can be sequestered in the vicinity of existing infrastructure. However, these volumes of sequestered CO2and coal bed methane recovery are estimates and are sensitive to the reservoir’s geomechanical and flow properties.\nKeywords: extensional rift, seismic, subsidence, thermal history, fission track, vitrinite reflectance, coal bed methane, Nenana basin, CO2 sequestration",

            "abstract": "The reliability of the power sector is highly vulnerable to variability in the availability and temperature of water resources, including those that might result from potential climatic changes or from competition from other users. In the past decade, power plants throughout the United States have had to shut down or curtail generation due to a lack of available water or from elevated water temperatures. These disruptions in power plant performance can have negative impacts on energy security and can be costly to address. Analysis of water-related vulnerabilities requires modeling capabilities with high spatial and temporal resolution. This research provides an innovative approach to energy-water modeling by evaluating the costs and reliability of a power sector region under policy and climate change scenarios that affect water resource availability and temperatures. This work utilizes results from a spatially distributed river water temperature model coupled with a thermoelectric power plant model to provide inputs into an electricity production cost model that operates on a high spatial and temporal resolution. The regional transmission organization ISO-New England, which includes six New England states and over 32 Gigawatts of power capacity, is utilized as a case study. Hydrological data and power plant operations are analyzed over an eleven year period from 2000-2010 under four scenarios that include climate impacts on water resources and air temperatures as well as strict interpretations of regulations that can affect power plant operations due to elevated water temperatures. Results of these model linkages show how the power sector’s reliability and economic performance can be affected by changes in water temperatures and water availability. The effective reliability and capacity value of thermal electric generators are quantified and discussed in the context of current as well as potential future water resource characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The budget of atmospheric CO2 is commonly studied using records of CO2 concentrations and isotopic abundances. δ13C and δ18O are the most frequently used isotopic tracers and can be used to constrain marine and terrestrial fluxes. However, the large number of sources and sinks prevents concentrations, d13C and d18O alone from uniquely constraining the budget. Δ17O as well as clumped isotopologues of CO2 can provide independent constraints on CO2 fluxes. Here we present a record covering multiple 1+ year periods between 2003 and 2012 documenting seasonal variations at La Jolla, CA, of δ13C, δ18O and clumped isotopologues of CO2 as well as preliminary results for Δ17O. Samples were collected from the La Jolla pier only on days a seaward breeze was present, therefore local anthropogenic effects should be minimal. We report the clumped isotopologues of CO2 using Δ47 notation in the absolute reference frame.\n In the years studied, δ13C showed a seasonal cycle that is consistent with previous measurements and can be explained by the seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity of plants as well as a longer term trend of fossil fuel injection into the atmosphere. Similarly δ18O showed a seasonal and interannual cycle that is consistent with previous measurements and can be explained by the interaction of the terrestrial biosphere with the hydrologic cycle.\nThe La Jolla ∆47 record shows a strong seasonal pattern for all years studied, and initial results suggest seasonality is also present in ∆17O. The La Jolla ∆47 pattern is similar to the Pasadena ∆47 record collected for 2003-2004. Both records exhibit amplitudes and phasing of ∆47 variations that are not consistent with the equilibration of CO2 with the local air or sea surface temperatures, nor can they be explained by fossil fuel burning, which can only weakly influence the seasonal cycles. The seasonal cycle may be explained in part by a competition between low ∆47 from respiration sources and higher values from CO2-water exchange during photosynthesis and marine air-sea exchange. We construct a box model to explain our stable isotope results and quantify the sizes of the CO2 fluxes influencing our La Jolla samples.",

            "abstract": "Polar and FAST conjunction events are selected from Polar cusp crossings in 1997. These conjunction events reveal a common pattern in which Polar observed significant ion kinetic energy flux in the upward direction at mid-altitudes (below 6 Re). Depending on the magnetic activity level, the maximum ion kinetic energy flux is on the order of 10-100 mW/m^2, when mapped to the ionosphere. It is an order of magnitude or more larger than the ion kinetic energy flux observed by FAST in conjunction at altitudes of <1 Re. Therefore, the ion outflows are significantly energized within the mid-latitude cusp. Also shown in the conjunction events is that the downward Poynting flux has enough wave energy to power the ion energization. The observed pattern suggests that the cusp at ionosphere altitudes is not a simple mapping of higher altitude particles. Instead, the mid-latitude cusp receives significant downward Poynting flux from higher altitude due to the solar wind/magnetosphere coupling. Within the mid-altitude cusp, the Poynting flux then supplies energy to power the ionosphere/magnetosphere coupling. Ion outflows are triggered and energized, forming a planetary wind that feeds the magnetosphere with ionospheric ions. During southward IMF, the wind convects anti-sunward and can affect the tail lobe, the nightside auroral region and the nightside plasma sheet.",

Here, we present a high-resolution study on fossilized G. ruber from two sites in North Atlantic subtropical gyres (VM25-21 and ODP 1055B) through 20 ka BP to evaluate how B/Ca responds to past changes in atmospheric CO2. Forams were picked and crushed gently, then cleaned and dissolved using a variation of the Boyle and Keigwin (1985) and Barker et al. (2003) cleaning protocols prior to analysis. ODP 1055B (from Carolina Slope, West Atlantic) produced a high-resolution record with lower B/Ca values during the glacial period followed by a rapid shift to higher B/Ca values in the early deglaciation, with values remaining high through the Holocene. These results were not predicted by culture calibrations, but they are consistent with B/Ca records from the Caribbean (ODP 999, Foster et al. 2008), suggesting this pattern is characteristic of surface waters in the greater North Atlantic region.",

            "abstract": "Cryptotephras (tephra not visible to the naked eye) form the foundation of the tephrostratigraphic frameworks used in Europe to date and correlate widely distributed geologic, paleoenvironmental and archaeological records. Pyne-O’Donnell et al. (2012) established the potential for developing a similar crypto-tephrostratigraphy across eastern North America by identifying multiple tephra, including the White River Ash (east; WRAe), St. Helens We and East Lake, in a peat core located in Newfoundland. Following on from this work, several ongoing projects have examined additional peat cores from Michigan, New York State, Maine, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland to build a tephrostratigraphic framework for this region. Using the precedent set by recent research by Jensen et al.(in press) that correlated the Alaskan WRAe to the European cryptotephra AD860B, unknown tephras identified in this work were not necessarily assumed to be from “expected” source areas (e.g. the Cascades).\nHere we present several examples of the preservation of tephra layers with an intercontinental distribution (i.e. WRAe and Ksudach 1), from relatively small magnitude events (i.e. St. Helens layer T, Mono Crater), and the first example of a Mexican ash in the NE (Volcan Ceboruco, Jala pumice). There are several implications of the identification of these units. These far-travelled ashes:\n(1) highlight the need to consider “ultra” distal source volcanoes for unknown cryptotephra deposits,.\n(2) present an opportunity for physical volcanologists to examine why some eruptions have an exceptional distribution of ash that is not necessarily controlled by the magnitude of the event.\n(3) complicate the idea of using tephrostratigraphic frameworks to understand the frequency of eruptions towards aiding hazard planning and prediction (e.g. Swindles et al., 2011).\n(4) show that there is a real potential to link tropical and mid to high-latitude paleoenvironmental records.\nJensen et al.

First, we use a two-population smog chamber experiment to test the phase-behavior between isotopically-labeled squalane (D62-squalane) and SOA (from α-pinene + O3). Next, we present mixed-particle experiments where one particle type (squalane or SOA) was prepared first to serve as surface area for condensation of the other material, forming the mixed particles. The mixed particles were then subjected to a heating ramp from 22 to 44 ◦C in the chamber. From these experiments, we were able to determine that: 1) squalane and SOA phase separate; 2) the vast majority of squalane is able to evaporate from the mixed particles on the same timescale regardless of the order of preparation; 3) almost all of the SOA mass is comprised of material less volatile than squalane; 4) AMS collection efficiency in these mixed-particle systems varies widely but systematically the course of these experiments where particle phase is dynamic, and can be parameterized as a function of the mass fraction of squalane; and 5) the evaporation profile of squalane can be used to estimate the diffusion coefficient (Dorg) of squalane through SOA.",

We develop a model that generates updated spectra of solar wind charge-exchange emissions together with accurate scattering and fluorescence spectra of solar X-rays by atoms, molecules, and ice/dust particles. Our model also explores scattering and fluorescence spectra for different solar conditions, including spectra induced by solar X-ray flares of different classes and durations. Utilizing our results, the major emission mechanism is determined for both the 0.3-1.0 keV and 1.0-3.0 keV photon energy ranges. Additionally, we compare the modeled spectra of cometary X-rays with cometary observations from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. These comparisons establish upper limits on ice/dust mass production rates, with an emphasis on nanoparticles, for several comets. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of of ice/dust particles in the formation of cometary X-ray emission spectra.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, investigators have revisited the problem of basin-scale fluid flow with an emphasis on depth-dependent permeability, which is a frequently observed geological phenomenon that is seldom accounted for in basin-scale flow models. These recent investigations have shown that depth-dependent permeability at the basin scale strongly influences the relationship between sub-basin and regional-scale flow paths. Here, we revisit topography driven fluid flow within a foreland basin using a numerical modeling experiment designed to assess first-order fluid system behavior when permeability decreases systematically with depth. Critical taper theory is invoked to define two-dimensional basin geometry, and three sub-aerially exposed orogenic wedge models are presented with critical taper angles of 2°, 4°, and 10°. To assess the combined influence of topographic slope and depth-dependent permeability, a constant rate infiltration is applied at the wedge surface and a transient simulation is performed within each model for 500,000 years. Our results suggest that fluid system structure within the narrowly tapering orogenic wedge (2°) is explained by recent investigations applying depth-decaying permeability to the classic Tóth basin; however, increasing topographic slope beyond 3° results in a fundamentally different fluid system architecture. As topographic slope increases, fluid system structure is characterized by (1) dominant regional flow paths and little, if any, sub-basin scale fluid circulation, (2) shallow meteoric water penetration, (3) a stratified distribution of groundwater residence time without pronounced stagnation points. Moreover, for a given detachment slope, these effects become more pronounced as topographic gradient increases.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, 3D Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) has become a standard model-building tool in exploration seismology, especially in oil and gas applications -thanks to the high quality (spatial density of sources and receivers) datasets acquired by the industry. FWI provides superior quantitative images than its travel-time counterparts (travel-time based inversion methods) because it aims to match all the information in the observations instead of a severely restricted subset of them, namely picked arrivals.\nThe downside is that the solution space explored by FWI has a high number of local minima, and since the solution is restricted to local optimization methods (due to the objective function evaluation cost), the success of the inversion is subject to starting within the basin of attraction of the global minimum.\nLocal minima can exist for a wide variety of reasons, and it seems unlikely that a formulation of the problem that can eliminate all of them -by defining the optimization problem in a form that results in a monotonic objective function- exist. However, a significant amount of local minima are created by the definition of data misfit. In its standard formulation FWI compares observed data (field data) with predicted data (generated with a synthetic model) by subtracting one from the other, and the objective function is defined as some norm of this difference. The combination of this criteria and the fact that seismic data is oscillatory produces the well-known phenomenon of cycle-skipping, where model updates try to match nearest cycles from one dataset to the other.\nIn order to avoid cycle-skipping we propose a different comparison between observed and predicted data, based on Wiener filters, which exploits the fact that the “identity” Wiener filter is a spike at zero lag. This gives rise to a new objective function without cycle-skipped related local minima, and therefore suppress the need of accurate starting models or low frequencies in the data. This new technique, called Adaptive Waveform Inversion (AWI) appears always superior to conventional FWI.",

            "abstract": "Some 500 city blocks were selected randomly via population-based stratification. Equal volumes of soil collected from the public space (where present) in front of each house on a block yielded a composite sample. Composites provide neighborhood level “smoothing” relative to sampling many individual houses, and greatly decrease laboratory effort/cost.\nIn the laboratory 10 g of soil were comminuted in a ceramic ball mill, mixed with cellulose/ paraffin binder, and pressed (20 tons) into a pellet. A Panalytical Epsilon5 EDS-XRF, using 8 sequential secondary target conditions and 12 NIST and USGS multi-element rock standards provided analyses.\nThe concentration of Pb ranged from 11 to 420 ppm; Cr, 4.3 - 52 ppm; Cu, 6.5 - 390 ppm; Zn, 17 - 480 ppm; Cd, 0.4 - 12 ppm; and Sb, 2.9 - 20 ppm. High levels of all metals characterize the urban core area of El Paso, which dates to the late 19th Century. This area hosts both commercial and old residential structures, as well as major highways and a large railroad yard. There currently is, and was in the past, considerable light industry in the area. Two highly traveled highway and one railroad border crossing over the Rio Grande into contiguous Cd. Juarez (population close to 2 million) add to current and past contamination. A century-old Pb-Cu-Zn smelter, recently demolished, forms the western boundary of the urban core. Heavy metal pollution from the smelter is recognized near the former site. Its effect on the rest of the urban core is uncertain due to the current and former presence of other heavy metal sources.\n Aggressive post-World War II growth and expansion of El Paso into the surrounding desert, as is common in the US Southwest, placed newer housing onto more pristine land surfaces. This is reflected in generally low-to-background levels of heavy metals in these newer areas of the city. Thus there is a strong contamination and heavy metals exposure risk gradient between older and newer neighborhoods within a single city, El Paso. In contrast, in older cities (e.g., US Northeast) where metropolitan boundaries are long-established, the equivalent risk gradient would be between the city and surrounding suburbs, each subject to separate government (political) controls and different funding and resources for cleanup and prevention measures.\nResearch supported by NIEHS Grant 1RO1-ES11367.",

            "abstract": "In the Eastern Himalaya, the structure of the orogenic wedge above the subducting Indian lithosphere and even the Moho topography of the latter are poorly constrained at present. The Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) is considered a crustal-scale detachment that marks the plate boundary separating the bottom of the orogenic wedge from the top of the Indian crust. In western and central Himalaya portions of the MHT have been imaged by receiver functions (RF) from the surface near the foothills of the Himalayan front range to mid-crustal depths. In Bhutan, however, the MHT and other major thrust geometries at depth remain a matter of debate, without direct geophysical image. Furthermore, earthquake activity in Bhutan seems to be significantly lower compared to most other parts of the Himalayan arc and there appears to be a lack of great earthquakes. This lower level of seismicity could be related to a more ductile deformation in the orogenic wedge, or, alternatively, result from a currently locked situation of the thrust system.\nIn this work, we use data of a densely spaced, temporary seismic network in Bhutan (GANSSER experiment) to determine lithospheric and intra-crustal discontinuities in the Eastern Himalaya with RF complemented by seismic velocities derived from simultaneous inversion of local earthquake data. Along two south-north profiles across the Himalayan range in eastern and western Bhutan the geometry of the dipping Indian Moho is defined by migrated RF images including a dip correction. Based on the characteristics of the RF, the dip and strike of the Moho is independently defined and the occurrence of intra-crustal conversion interfaces like the MHT are mapped across the orogenic wedge.\nIn combination with the geometry of the intra-crustal seismic structure, we use the seismic velocities and the hypocenters of local earthquakes to discuss the predominant deformation type in the orogenic wedge in Bhutan and the potential for large earthquakes in this region of the India-Asia collision.",

It is crucial to have calibrated ground-based measurements to which these satellite measurements can compare and refine their retrieval algorithms. To this end, a Fourier Transform Spectrometer has been deployed to the Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) in Edwards, CA as a member of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). This location was selected due to its proximity to a highly reflective lakebed. Such surfaces have proven to be difficult for accurate satellite retrievals. This facility has been in operation since July 2013. The data collected to date at this site will be presented. In order to ensure the validity of the measurements made at this site, multiple vertical profiles have been performed using the Alpha jet, DC-8, and ER-2 as part of the AJAX (ongoing), SEAC4RS (August 2013), and SARP (July 2014) field campaigns.

We undertook an analysis of rupture forecasts along the active faults in this area of central Greece, using most updated datasets (active fault maps, fault geometry, fault slip rates, trenching data on past earthquakes, historical and instrumental seismicity, strain) and models for earthquake budget extrapolated from observed seismicity, magnitude-frequency distributions and calculated earthquake rates vs. magnitude for individual faults. We present a unified rupture forecast model that comprises a time-independent (Poisson-process) earthquake rate model, and a time-dependent earthquake-probability model, based on recent earthquake rates and stress-renewal statistics conditioned on the date of last event.

            "abstract": "Application of airborne geophysical surveys ranges in scale from detailed site scale such as locating abandoned well casing and saline water plumes to landscape scale for mapping hydrogeologic frameworks pertinent to ground water and tectonic settings relevant to studies of induced seismicity. These topics are important in understanding possible effects of hydrocarbon development on the environment. In addition airborne geophysical surveys can be used in establishing baseline “snapshots”, to provide information in beneficial uses of produced waters, and in mapping ground water resources for use in well development.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has conducted airborne geophysical surveys over more than 20 years for applications in energy resource environmental studies. A majority of these surveys are airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys to map subsurface electrical conductivity related to plumes of saline waters and more recently to map hydrogeologic frameworks for ground water and plume migration. AEM surveys have been used in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming to characterize the near surface geologic framework for siting produced water disposal ponds and for beneficial utilization in subsurface drip irrigation. A recent AEM survey at the Fort Peck Reservation, Montana, was used to map both shallow plumes from brine pits and surface infrastructure sources and a deeper concealed saline water plume from a failed injection well. Other reported applications have been to map areas geologically favorable for shallow gas that could influence drilling location and design.\nAirborne magnetic methods have been used to image the location of undocumented abandoned well casings which can serve as conduits to the near surface for coproduced waters. They have also been used in conjunction with geologic framework studies to understand the possible relationships between tectonic features and induced earthquakes in the Raton Basin. Airborne gravity as well as developing deeper mapping AEM surveys could also be effectively used in mapping tectonic features. Airborne radiometric methods have not been routinely used in hydrocarbon environmental studies but might be useful in understanding the surficial distribution of deposits related to naturally occurring radioactive materials.",

            "abstract": "Model-based studies are foundational to perform diagnosis (has there been a change?) and attribution (what caused this change?) in the context of global environmental change. Here we employ a dual method approach using machine learning and simulation differencing across an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models (TBM) to attribute changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) from 1901 to 2010. The simulations are taken from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP). For each TBM MsTMIP prescribes a semi-factorial set of five runs (globally at 0.5º spatial resolution) where time-varying controls on carbon metabolism are sequentially enabled. MsTMIP has a constrained simulation protocol –driving data, vegetation cover, boundary conditions, and steady-state spin up protocol are all standardized– such that only model structure varies and ensemble spread addresses process uncertainty. Applying this dual method to MsTMIP simulation output we attribute changes in GPP to changes in climate, land cover/land use change, atmospheric CO2, nitrogen deposition, near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and downwelling shortwave radiation as well as climate sigma (irreducible climate noise) and nonlinearity (interactions). Globally, the key factor associated with the Anthropocene, namely the sustained increase in atmospheric CO2, dominates changes in GPP across the full time period. Climate factors are of secondary importance and, along with land cover/land use change, may act to decrease GPP depending on decade and reference period. Despite differences in model structure attribution results across the full ensemble are generally consistent. Spatial morphologies, replicating the same dual approach by grid cell, exhibit high variability but with an atmospheric CO2 fertilization effect dominating the tropical zone. Our results suggest that the modern era of global warming, when viewed through the prism of GPP attribution, reaches back at least until the early 1900s.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE-2, ~94 Ma: late Cretaceous) was characterized by a perturbation in seawater chemistry, an expansion of marine anoxia and euxinia, an increase in marine organic-carbon burial, a decrease in atmospheric pCO2 during an interval of high global temperatures, an extinction event among marine organisms, and changes in weathering intensity. However, many of the most detailed studies of OAE-2 are from the northern hemisphere, and consequently how global environmental changes were expressed at the local and regional scale in the southern hemisphere is poorly understood.\nA detailed geochemical, petrographic and micropalaeontological dataset from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1138 on the Kerguelen Plateau, southern Indian Ocean (53.5oS paleolatitude), identifies OAE-2 from a 3‰ positive carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) and from high-resolution nannofossil biostratigraphy. An enrichment of organic carbon (to ~15%) corresponds with a shift towards locally sub-oxic/anoxic conditions, as recorded by trace-metal enrichments and molybdenum-isotope compositions. The redox changes coincide stratigraphically with an abrupt decline in the delivery of highly weathered detrital material and terrestrial organic matter to Site 1138. A rapid relative sea-level rise occurring around the onset of OAE-2 could have reduced the input of highly weathered detrital sediments, while moving the local seafloor deeper into an oxygen minimum zone impinging on the margins of the Kerguelen Plateau. Alternatively, or additionally, intensified mid-latitude hydrological cycling in the early stages of OAE-2 could have rapidly destabilized terrestrial sediments from sub-aerial landmasses on the Kerguelen Plateau. In either case, the new datasets highlight the abrupt nature of the palaeoenvironmental response to OAE-2 in the mid-latitude southern hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "NASA has a continuing requirement to collect high-quality in situ data for the vicarious calibration of current and next generation ocean color satellite sensors and to validate the algorithms that use the remotely sensed observations. Recent NASA airborne missions over Monterey Bay, CA, have demonstrated novel above- and in-water measurement capabilities supporting a combined airborne sensor approach (imaging spectrometer, microradiometers, and a sun photometer). The results characterize coastal atmospheric and aquatic properties through an end-to-end assessment of image acquisition, atmospheric correction, algorithm application, plus sea-truth observations from state-of-the-art instrument systems. The primary goal is to demonstrate the following in support of calibration and validation exercises for satellite coastal ocean color products: 1) the utility of a multi-sensor airborne instrument suite to assess the bio-optical properties of coastal California, including water quality; and 2) the importance of contemporaneous atmospheric measurements to improve atmospheric correction in the coastal zone. The imaging spectrometer (Headwall) is optimized in the blue spectral domain to emphasize remote sensing of marine and freshwater ecosystems. The novel airborne instrument, Coastal Airborne In-situ Radiometers (C-AIR) provides measurements of apparent optical properties with high dynamic range and fidelity for deriving exact water leaving radiances at the land-ocean boundary, including radiometrically shallow aquatic ecosystems. Simultaneous measurements supporting empirical atmospheric correction of image data are accomplished using the Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer (AATS-14). Flight operations are presented for the instrument payloads using the CIRPAS Twin Otter flown over Monterey Bay during the seasonal fall algal bloom in 2011 (COAST) and 2013 (OCEANIA) to support bio-optical measurements of phytoplankton for coastal zone research.",

Carbon storage varies with seagrass species and region, and with meadow condition, where healthy meadows sequester carbon but those that are declining may be sources of inorganic carbon to the atmosphere. Very little is known about carbon storage in Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadows in the Gulf of Maine, where they are threatened by poor water quality and physical disturbance.\nIn 2014 we studied two eelgrass meadows in coastal Massachusetts, U.S.A. We sampled biomass and measured carbon content in above- and below-ground plant tissues, sediments, and particulate organic matter in the water column. We estimated bed density and extent using a combination of sonar, visual imaging, and diver surveys. To investigate persistence of carbon storage in sediments, we also sampled sediments from an area where a meadow had historically existed, but had died back in 2012. Results of this work will not only support eelgrass restoration and protection measures locally, but will also help clarify our global understanding of carbon storage in blue habitats.",

The lessons learned from this mission, combined with the availability of new technologies, have guided the design and development of the follow-on ICESat-2 mission and its Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). Scheduled for launch in 2017, ICESat-2 will operate year-round, at a lower orbit inclination, extending coverage to +/- 88 degrees latitude, and at a lower altitude, yielding 1,387 revolutions in a 91-day repeat ground track. The ATLAS instrument uses photon-counting detectors to record surface returns from six laser beams, grouped into three pairs, yielding denser spatial coverage and enabling direct measurements of local slopes. As a result, ICESat-2 will provide a more detailed view of the Earth’s surface. Here, we discuss the mission design and concepts of operations. We focus primarily on the strategies being developed for collecting altimetry data over different surfaces, including the ice sheets, sea ice, oceans, vegetation and other scientific targets of opportunity.",

            "abstract": "A great deal can be discovered from comparing and studying a chosen region or area on a planetary body. In this age, science has an enormous amount of instruments and data to study from; often the first obstacle can be finding the right information. Developed at Arizona State University, Java Mission-planning and Analysis for Remote Sensing (JMARS), enables users to easily find and study related datasets. JMARS supports a long list of planetary bodies in our solar system, including Earth, the Moon, Mars, and other planets, satellites, and asteroids.\nWithin JMARS a user can start with a particular area and search for all datasets that have images/information intersecting that region of interest. Once a user has found data they are interested in comparing, they can view the image at once and see the numeric information at that location. This information can be analyzed in a few powerful ways.\nIf the dataset of interest varies with time but the location stays constant, then the user may want to compare specific locations through time. This can be done the Investigate Tool in JMARS. Users can create a Data Spike and the information at that point will be plotted through time. If the region does not have a temporal dataset, then a different method would be suitable and involves a profile line. Also using the Investigate Tool, a user can create a Data Profile (a line which can contain as many vertices as necessary) and all numeric data underneath the line will be plotted on one graph for easy comparison. This can be used to compare differences between similar datasets – perhaps the same measurement but from different instruments – or to find correlations from one dataset to another.\nA third form of analysis is planned for future development. This method involves entire areas (polygons). Sampling of the different data sources beneath an area can reveal statistics like maximum, minimum, and average values, and standard deviation. These values can be compared to other data sources under the given area.\nJMARS has the ability to geographically locate and display a vast array of remote sensing data for a user. In addition to its powerful searching ability, it also enables users to compare datasets using the Data Spike and Data Profile techniques. Plots and tables from this data can be exported and used in presentations, papers, or external software for further study.",

With the adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards, which emphasize climate change and other human impacts on natural systems, there has never been a better time to provide instructional support to educators on these topics. In response to this clear need, the University of California Museum of Paleontology, in collaboration with the National Center for Science Education, developed a new web resource for teachers and students titled “Understanding Global Change” (UGC) that introduces the drivers and impacts of global change. This website clarifies the connections among deep time, modern Earth system processes, and anthropogenic influences, and provides K-16 instructors with a wide range of easy-to-use tools, strategies, and lesson plans for communicating these important concepts regarding global change and the basic Earth systems processes.\nIn summer 2014, the UGC website was field-tested during a workshop with 25 K-12 teachers and science educators. Feedback from participants helped the UGC team develop and identify pedagogically sound lesson plans and instructional tools on global change. These resources are accessible through UGC’s searchable database, are aligned with NGSS and Common Core, and are categorized by grade level, subject, and level of inquiry-based instruction (confirmation, structured, guided, open). Providing a range of content and tools at levels appropriate for teachers is essential because our initial needs assessment found that educators often feel that they lack the content knowledge and expertise to address complex, but relevant global change issues, such as ocean acidification and deforestation. Ongoing needs assessments and surveys of teacher confidence when teaching global change content will continue to drive UGC resource development as the site expands in the future.",

The lifetime of prompt emissions is much less than 1 millisecond, and high-speed cameras have observed auroral forms with millisecond scale morphology. Satellite observations have corroborated these spatial and temporal findings. Satellite observation platforms give a very valuable yet passing glance at the auroral region and the precipitation driving the aurora. To gain further insight into the fine structure of accelerated particles driven into the ionosphere, ground-based optical instruments staring at the same region of sky can capture the evolution of processes evolving on time scales from milliseconds to many hours, with continuous sample rates of 100Hz or more. Legacy auroral tomography systems have used baselines of hundreds of kilometers, capturing a “side view” of the field-aligned auroral structure. We show that short baseline (less than 10 km), high speed optical observations fill a measurement gap between legacy long baseline optical observations and incoherent scatter radar. The ill-conditioned inverse problem typical of auroral tomography, accentuated by short baseline optical ground stations is tackled with contemporary data inversion algorithms. We leverage the disruptive electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) imaging technology and solve the inverse problem via eigenfunctions obtained from a first-principles 1-D electron penetration ionospheric model. We present the latest analysis of observed auroral events from the Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska. We discuss the system-level design and performance verification measures needed to ensure consistent performance for nightly multi-terabyte data acquisition synchronized between stations to better than 1 millisecond.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands have been important in their radiative forcing effect on the Earth’s past glacial-interglacial cycles, and evidence suggests that recent interannual variations in atmospheric methane concentrations are driven partly by climatic effects on wetland methane emissions. Methane emissions from wetlands are offset by their substantial ability to sequester carbon. We use best estimates from the literature to construct a radiative mass balance for trace gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration from the world’s wetlands. We also distinguish between the static radiative balance of wetlands and their radiative forcing, with only the latter affecting climate. Large uncertainties in our estimates are particularly due to uncertainties in historical and current wetland area and soil sequestration rates in mineral-soil wetlands. Overall, we conclude that destruction of mineral-soil wetlands has likely had a global cooling effect (and vice-versa for restoration), whereas destruction of peatlands and marine-associated wetlands has had a warming effect using a 100 year global warming potential. We also emphasize the myriad goods and services that wetlands provide besides their effects on climate forcing.",

            "abstract": "The liquidus water content of a granitic melt at high pressure (P) and temperature (T) is important because it constrains the volume of granite that could be produced by melting of the deep crust. Previous estimates based on melting experiments at low P (≤0.5 GPa) show substantial scatter when extrapolated to deep crustal P and T (700-1000˚C, 0.6-1.5 GPa). To improve the high-P constraints on water concentration at the granite liquidus, we preformed experiments in piston-cylinder apparatus at 1 GPa using a range of granite compositions. In each experiment, granite glass + H2O was homogenized well above the liquidus T, then T was lowered by increments until quartz and alkali feldspar crystalized from the liquid. To establish reversed equilibrium, we crystallized the homogenized melt at the lower T, then raised the T until we found that the crystalline phases were resorbed into the liquid. Four different bulk compositions were studied (ab-ksp-qz, in wt%): 40-40-20, 37.5-37.5-25, 36.25-36.25-27.5, 35-35-30. Quenched charges were analyzed by petrographic microscope, SEM and electron microprobe. Microprobe analysis of all-glass charges reproduced our intended starting compositions. The minimum temperature of the 1 GPa liquidus at a given water content occurs at 27.5±0.3 wt% quartz, regardless of H2O content. The reversed liquidus temperatures at 3.0, 4.1, 5.85, 7.95 wt% water are respectively 935-985, 850-915, 775-825 and 700-750˚C. Our results conform closely to the extrapolation of Holtz 2001, which give significantly higher water contents than used by most dehydration melting models. This presents a challenge for producing voluminous amounts of metaluminous granites from lower crustal biotite-amphibole gneisses by dehydration melting. For example, a deep-crustal tonalitic gneiss with 0.6-0.8 wt% H2O would yield less than 20 vol% granitic liquid for complete dehydration and perfect extractability, neither of which are likely to be realized in deep crustal melting.",

            "abstract": "Organic halogens and hydrocarbons are important contributors to chemical processes in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) region and hydrocarbons are well known contributors to chemical processes throughout the troposphere. Whole Air Sampler systems (WAS) were deployed during Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) on the NASA ER-2 (Univ. of Miami WAS) and the NASA DC-8 (Univ. of California, Irvine WAS). Both systems measured a wide variety of organic halogen and hydrocarbon species in the samples collected. For this presentation we show the vertical distributions of select chemical species from the surface to the lower stratosphere and compare those distributions to the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-Chem) in order to evaluate their representation in the global model. We also show a comparison of measurements taken during SEAC4RS (2013) with those taken in the same region during the Stratosphere-Troposphere Analysis of Regional Transport 2008 (START08) campaign. The Univ. of Miami WAS system was flown on the NSF/NCAR GV during START08. The two campaigns were conducted in different seasons and different stratosphere/troposphere exchange regimes, allowing evaluation of how the North American Monsoon convection influences the transport time scale in the UTLS (during SEAC4RS) relative to the pre-monsoon regime observed during START08.",

            "abstract": "Martian atmospheric dust is not spherical and contains irregular shaped particles. This irregularity adds complexity to models determining radiative heating of the atmosphere. Particle size has been studied extensively with remote sensing, but particle shape is still poorly understood. Bi et al. show that an assortment of triaxial ellipsoids provides a good analog for the scattering properties of terrestrial dust aerosols. In addition Z. Meng et al. (2010) have developed a database containing single-scattering properties of irregularly shaped dust particles with pre-defined microphysical and optical parameters. The tabulation allows quick and efficient use of the results from time-consuming models and can be applied to the Martian atmosphere. The landing site for Phoenix was in a region that fell within the northern seasonal ice cap and was active during a period of large dust upwelling. The lander’s Surface Stereo Imager performed several cross-sky brightness surveys to constrain the size distribution and scattering and absorption properties of the airborne dust in the Martian northern polar environment. Using the database, single scattering properties adapted to the Martian atmosphere can be used to determine bulk scattering properties of the medium at the Phoenix landing site. We will present a comparison of triaxial ellipsoids with spheroidal models using Phoenix spectrophotometric data and show that triaxial ellipsoid properties can produce a good fit to the observed data. In addition we will provide initial results of polarization to test the triaxial ellipsoid hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Dipping faults, shear zones, and pervasive anisotropic crustal fabric due to deformation are all capable of generating strong near-station mode conversions of teleseismic body waves, even for weak (a few percent) velocity anisotropy. These conversions can be found using the receiver function technique. Dipping foliation and dipping isotropic velocity contrasts can occur in isolation or together in deformed crust. Both generate receiver function arrivals that have a characteristic periodicity with azimuth. Different fixed azimuthal phase shifts between radial and tangential component receiver functions distinguish dipping or tilted structure and fabric from horizontal axis anisotropy.\nWe demonstrate a method that uses these characteristics to map geologically relevant information such as strike and depth of foliation of dipping isotropic velocity contrasts and of horizontal symmetry axis anisotropy contrasts. The method uses waveforms without matching them via forward modeling, which makes choices such as slow versus fast axis symmetry and isotropic dip versus anisotropic axis tilt unnecessary. It also does not use shear wave splitting of the converted waves, which is more difficult to isolate.\nWe show results from the continental U.S. and Canada and from the collision zones in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau and Taiwan. We discuss interpretation of our results in the light of recent laboratory measurements of deformed crustal rocks and contributions to the seismic signal from individual minerals such as micas, amphiboles, and quartz. Our observations are connected to geological ground truth by using structural maps and sample anisotropy determined using electron backscatter diffraction from exhumed deep crust in the Athabasca granulite province to predict the seismic signal from present-day deep crust. We also discuss the reconciliation of measurements from anisotropic receiver functions, surface waves, and split shear waves.",

            "abstract": "Non-Maxwellian metaequilibrium states may exist in low-collisionality plasmas as evidenced by direct (particle distributions) and indirect (e.g., instabilities driven by pressure anisotropy) satellite and laboratory measurements. These are directly observed in the solar wind (e.g. [1]), in magnetospheric reconnection events [2], in magnetically confined plasmas [3] or in simulations of Vlasov turbulence [4]. By including the full pressure tensor dynamics in a fluid plasma model, we show that a sheared velocity field can provide an effective mechanism that makes an initial isotropic state anisotropic. We discuss how the propagation of magneto-elastic waves can affect the pressure tensor anisotropization and the small scale formation that arise from the interplay between the gyrotropic terms due to the magnetic field and the flow vorticity and the non-gyropropic effect of the flow strain tensor. We support this analysis by a numerical integration of the nonlinear equations describing the pressure tensor evolution. This anisotropization mechanism might provide a good candidate for the understanding of the observed correlation between the presence of a sheared velocity flow and the signature of pressure anisotropies which are not yet explained within the standard models based e.g. on the CGL paradigm. Examples of these signatures are provided e.g. by the threshold lowering of ion-Weibel instabilities in the geomagnetic tail, observed in concomitance to the presence of a velocity shear in the near-earth plasma profile [5], or by the relatively stronger anisotropization measured for core protons in the fast solar wind [4,6] or in “space simulation” laboratory plasma experiments [3].\n[1] E.

            "abstract": "During the geomagnetic storms of solar cycle 24, several tongue of ionization (TOI) events have been observed over Antarctica with polar maps of total electron content (TEC) derived from the global network of GNSS receivers. Until solar cycle 24, the coverage of GPS receivers in the southern hemisphere was too sparse to clearly detect TOI’s in the Antarctica. The TOI plasma originates from plasma that has been transported from the mid-latitudes by a feature known as storm enhanced density (SED). The TOI, as observed by GPS, extends through the dayside cusp, across the polar cap to the night side, in both hemispheres. The TOI is a source of ionospheric irregularities and its distribution across the high latitude ionosphere is controlled by plasma convection. This is illustrated by overlaying TEC plots onto SuperDARN convection maps. Here, our focus is on summarizing these new SED/TOI observations in the southern hemisphere. We explore the development of southern hemisphere polar cap patches and their associated irregularities as observed by both GPS scintillation receivers and the SuperDARN HF radars. We identify cases where the position of the SED base stays fixed in latitude and longitude as the earth rotates. We also examine the observed symmetries and asymmetries of the SED/TOI features in both hemispheres, and provide preliminary statistics on preferred universal times/longitudes associated with SED/TOI’s in Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "An increasing number of studies are focused on assessing the environmental footprint of different products and processes, especially using life cycle assessment (LCA). This work shows how combining statistical methods and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with environmental analyses can help improve the quality of results and their interpretation.\nMost environmental assessments in literature yield single numbers that characterize the environmental impact of a process/product – typically global or country averages, often unchanging in time. In this work, we show how statistical analysis and GIS can help address these limitations. For example, we demonstrate a method to separately quantify uncertainty and variability in the result of LCA models using a power generation case study. This is important for rigorous comparisons between the impacts of different processes. Another challenge is lack of data that can affect the rigor of LCAs. We have developed an approach to estimate environmental impacts of incompletely characterized processes using predictive statistical models. This method is applied to estimate unreported coal power plant emissions in several world regions.\nThere is also a general lack of spatio-temporal characterization of the results in environmental analyses. For instance, studies that focus on water usage do not put in context where and when water is withdrawn. Through the use of hydrological modeling combined with GIS, we quantify water stress on a regional and seasonal basis to understand water supply and demand risks for multiple users. Another example where it is important to consider regional dependency of impacts is when characterizing how agricultural land occupation affects biodiversity in a region. We developed a data-driven methodology used in conjuction with GIS to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the impacts of growing different crops on different species in various biomes of the world.",

            "abstract": "Climate model output often contains significant biases that can hinder its use in impacts analysis. Recent work has shown that, of the many bias correction methods in use, the best overall performance is provided by distribution mapping. Distribution mapping corrects bias via a transfer function that adjusts data points such that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the model output matches the CDF of the observational data. However, this method is not guaranteed to preserve the relationships between variables when applied to the variables individually.\nWe present a new method of bias-correcting multiple variables jointly based on simultaneous diagonalization of the covariance matrices. This process transforms the variables into an uncorrelated form, where each component can be corrected independently using distribution mapping; the corrected variables are then transformed back into their original form, restoring the correlations of their joint distribution.\nWe apply the method to model output from NARCCAP (the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program), bias-correcting 7 impacts-relevant variables (daily minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, incoming solar radiation, specific humidity, and u- and v-winds) to match the University of Idaho's METDATA, which combines NLDAS-2 reanalysis with PRISM observations to derive a high-resolution daily gridded observational dataset for the contiguous United States. This joint multivariate bias correction produces results that better capture regional climate processes, such as the seasonal pattern of differences in moisture flux on dry vs rainy days and seasonal changes in diurnal heating on clear vs cloudy days.",

The fundamental problems to retrieve the ice cloud microphysical properties of DCS using radar reflectivity are the attenuation of cloud radar reflectivity by heavy precipitation, unknown particle size distributions (PSDs) and the habit of the ice particles in sample volume. In this study, NEXRAD (precipitation radars) reflectivity, with no/little attenuation in heavy precipitation and intense spatial coverage, has been used in retrieval, although it has lower vertical resolution than cloud radars. The aircraft in-situ measurements observed PSDs were fit to analytic function (gamma function) to compare observations made in different meteorological conditions (stratiform rain /anvil regions of DCS) and to best reproduce the true PSD for retrievals. The aircraft in-situ cloud particle imager (CPI) measurements show the habit of the ice particles (aggregates). The relationship between backscatter cross section (σ) and particle dimension (D) is parameterized for the ice crystal habit (aggregates) with the aid of scattering database. Results of the vertical profiles of ice water content (IWC) and median mass diameter (Dm) in ice cloud of DCS, which have been retrieved from NEXRAD reflectivity assuming gamma distribution and σ-D relationship during the MC3E, will be presented. The retrieved microphysical properties are also validated by aircraft in-situ best-estimated IWC and Dm.",

These lakes and estuaries are important for economic reasons such as tourism and fishing. This project investigated the composition of phytoplankton present using pigment analysis to identify dominant phytoplankton groups. A total of 28 different sites with a wide range of salinity (0 - 60) in central and southern California were examined. These included 13 different bodies of water in central California: 6 in the Sierras, 7 in the San Francisco Bay Estuary, and 15 from southern California. The samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid-chromatography (HPLC) to quantify the pigments present (using retention time and the spectral thumbprint). Diagnostic pigments were used to indicate the phytoplankton class composition, focusing on diatoms, dinoflagellates, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria - all key phytoplankton groups indicative of the health of the sampled reservoir. Our results indicated that cyanobacteria dominated four of the seven bodies of central California water (Mono Lake, Bridgeport Reservoir, Steamboat Slough, and Pinto Lake); cryptophytes and nannoflagellates dominated two of the central California bodies of water (Mare Island Strait and Topaz Lake); and diatoms and dinoflagellates dominated one central California body of water, Oakland Inner Harbor, comprising more than 70% of the phytoplankton present. We expect the bodies of water from Southern California to be as disparate. Though this data is only a snapshot, it has significant implications in comparing different ecosystems across California, and it has the potential to provide valuable insight into the composition of phytoplankton communities.",

            "abstract": "In the past few years, space-borne retrievals of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence, or SIF, have been enabled by the GOSAT, SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 satellite. Initial studies demonstrate that SIF often has a direct relationship with gross terrestrial carbon uptake, and therefore provides a complementary view of the carbon cycle to that provided by column carbon dioxide (XCO2) measurements. Accurate estimates of SIF have also been shown to be necessary for bias free estimates XCO2 itself. The OCO-2 O2 A-band channel allows us to perform SIF retrievals, and pre-launch sensitivity studies indicated that OCO-2 will provide an unprecedented SIF dataset along its orbit track, albeit at the expense of coverage. Compared to GOSAT, it will record 100 times more SIF data, which will significantly reduce the large random errors in present in GOSAT-based global maps of SIF.\nHere, we will show first SIF results from OCO-2 data with an initial comparison to previous retrievals from GOSAT. Owing to the low computational demand and relative simplicity of the SIF retrieval algorithm, we expect SIF data to mature somewhat earlier than the more complex XCO2 product. The focus of this presentation will be on quantifying the retrieval quality, showing potential issues, providing a comparison with cloud flags, and presenting the first global maps of SIF from OCO-2.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water vapor fluxes between land surface and boundary layer using the eddy covariance method have many applicable uses across several disciplines. Three eddy flux towers have been established over no-till winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and native and improved pastures at the USDA ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, OK. An additional tower will be established in fall 2014 over till winter wheat. Each flux site is equipped with an eddy covariance system, PhenoCam, COSMOS, and in-situ observations of soil and atmospheric state variables. The objective of this research is to measure, compare, and model the land-atmosphere exchange of CO2, water vapor, and CH4 in different land cover types and management practices (till vs no-till, grazing vs no-grazing, native vs improved pasture). Models that focus on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and CH4 fluxes can be improved by the cross verification of these measurements. Another application will be to link the in-situ measurements with satellite remote sensing in order to scale-up flux measurements from small spatial scales to local and regional scales. Preliminary data analysis from the native grassland site revealed that CH4 concentration was negligible (~ 0), and it increased significantly when cattle were introduced into the site. In summer 2014, daily ET magnitude was about 4-5 mm day-1 and the NEE magnitude was 4-5 g C day-1 at the native grassland site. Further analysis of data for all the sites for longer temporal periods will enhance understanding of biotic and abiotic factors that govern carbon, water, and energy exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere under different land cover and management systems. The research findings will help predict the responses of these ecosystems to management practices and global environmental change in the future.",

            "abstract": "The presence of spatial variation in grain size within the surf and swash zone is often ignored in numerical modeling whereas Upon closer inspection, a broad range of grain sizes is visible on a beach. This could potentially lead to a significant mismatch between predictions and observations of profile evolution given the strong sensitivity of sediment transport formulae to the grain size. To explore this in more detail, numerical simulations with XBeach have been performed to simulate the observations of changes in beach profile and stratigraphy within the swash zone at Duck, NC, under a range of wave and tidal conditions (see presentations by Wadman et al., and Gallagher et al. for complementary information on the observations at this conference). The research focus is to establish the morphodynamic response to the sediment dynamics at short and longer time scales in the presence of stratigraphy. A better understanding of the mechanisms and subsequently improved modeling will provide more accurate predictions of the morphodynamic response of the beach during moderate and extreme conditions. It will also help in the interpretation of sediment layering of the beach to relate to past extreme storms on geological time scales.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic processes operate at various frequencies that often range from daily to annual and interdecadal time scales. As a result, water fluxes at the land surface can vary cyclically at multiple simultaneous frequencies. These time-varying fluxes combine with vadose zone processes to produce time-varying flux and water content in the vadose zone. Previous work has defined the dominant characteristics that control the damping of a single time-varying cycle. This work resulted in a numerical tool that can be used to determine whether recharge can be approximated to be steady state in subregions of an aquifer. Single-frequency analyses suggest that the variability from shorter period events (e.g. the rapid changes in water content that result from episodic precipitation and runoff) are damped at shallow depths. However, given the nonlinear character of unsaturated flow, it is not always appropriate to assume that the effects of multiple, simultaneous time-varying cycles will add linearly. Therefore, we extend our previous analysis to identify areas of steady recharge in aquifers in response to multi-frequency cyclical infiltration. Results show that wet periods of the longer cycle (e.g. interannual and interdecadal variations related to global-scale oceanic-atmospheric phenomena) can “carry” the shorter cycle infiltration to greater depths. In contrast, the shorter cycle damps more rapidly during a dry part of a long cycle. This suggests that long-term changes in precipitation and ET may have more complicated impacts on the spatial and temporal patterns of recharge than has been considered to date.",

            "abstract": "To meet water quality goals stormwater utilities and not-for-profit watershed organizations in the U.S. are working with citizens to design and implement green infrastructure on residential land. Green infrastructure, as an alternative and complement to traditional (grey) stormwater infrastructure, has the potential to contribute to multiple ecosystem benefits including stormwater volume reduction, carbon sequestration, urban heat island mitigation, and to provide amenities to residents. However, in small (1-10-km2) medium-density urban watersheds with heterogeneous land cover it is unclear whether stormwater retrofits on residential parcels significantly contributes to reduce stormwater volume at the watershed scale. In this paper, we seek to improve understanding of how small-scale redistribution of water at the parcel scale as part of green infrastructure implementation affects urban water budgets and stormwater volume across spatial scales. As study sites we use two medium-density headwater watersheds in Baltimore, MD and Durham, NC. We develop ecohydrology modeling experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of redirecting residential rooftop runoff to un-altered pervious surfaces and to engineered rain gardens to reduce stormwater runoff. As baselines for these experiments, we performed field surveys of residential rooftop hydrologic connectivity to adjacent impervious surfaces, and found low rates of connectivity. Through simulations of pervasive adoption of downspout disconnection to un-altered pervious areas or to rain garden stormwater control measures (SCM) in these catchments, we find that most parcel-scale changes in stormwater fate are attenuated at larger spatial scales and that neither SCM alone is likely to provide significant changes in streamflow at the watershed scale.",

            "abstract": "This study provides bias corrected, high space-time resolution meteorological data sets for the 21st century over the Amazon Basin, which is used to drive land-surface and ecosystem models. The bias corrections and resolution adjustments are performed on the outputs of three widely-used General Circulation Models (GCMs) including the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3), the Parallel Climate Model (PCM1), and the Hadley Centre Coupled Model (HadCM3) under A2 scenario (the IPCC climate scenario). The study processes the primary GCM’s outputs including temperature, precipitation, downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation, specific humidity, horizontal wind velocities, and pressure, which are main forcing for ecosystem models to understand the consequences of climate and land-use changes in Amazonia. A series of simple but effective statistical downscaling approaches are used to properly project the data onto a unified space-time resolution at 1° by 1° grid cells and hourly temporal resolution. The bias correction step uses a quantile-based CDF matching method to adjust the model CDF for the climate projection based on the difference between the historically modeled and observed CDFs at each percentile. These improved data sets have been used as inputs to the Common Land Model (CLM), the Ecosystem Demography Model version 2 (ED2), the Integrated Biosphere Simulator Model (IBIS), and the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) to study and predict the effects and interactions between climate, forest/deforestation, and land use in the Amazon Basin.",

            "abstract": "Harbors are typically modified to enhance operations and increase space in ports. Ports are usually designed to protect boats and docks against sudden vertical water fluctuations. Tsunami currents however are often ignored-current monitoring is usually not quantitative- in the design of harbor modifications. Damage from tsunami currents in ports has occurred in several recent tsunamis (Sea of Japan, 1983; Chile, 1960, 2010; Tohoku, 2011). Significant tsunami currents (>2 m/sec) often occur without substantial wave amplitudes (<1-2 meters). Because tsunami amplitudes are used as the basis to determine event “significance”, the hazard from potentially strong currents may be overlooked. In order to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic effects on tsunami impact at ports, we examine the history of man-made modifications made to San Diego Bay since the late nineteenth century.\nDigital elevation models were created based on historic nautical charts of 1892, 1935, 1945 and at present. Tsunami simulations were conducted based on two distant events (1960 Chile and 2011 Tohoku) and two hypothetical severe local cases (San Clemente fault bend and Coronado Canyon landslide). The distant events provide historical comparisons with the model while the local events are based on offshore geology and tectonic activity.\nMost of the changes in San Diego Bay have included dredging, enlargement of the North Island/Coronado, widening of the Silver Strand, and creation of new marinas by enhancing already existing dunes or filling and creating breakwaters. Those changes mostly occurred during the first half of the 20th century. Post- 1965 the bay has sustained a similar appearance to the bathymetry/topography we know today.\nEarly harbor configurations showed strong currents in the narrow channel between Point Loma and North Island/Coronado while overtopping of the narrow Silver Strand to the south occurred. The modern configuration finds increased currents at the harbor entrance and between Coronado and downtown San Diego, where the channel has been narrowed, while widening of the Silver Strand appears to reduce overtopping.\nSince the change in tsunami impact is not a linear function of modifications in the harbor, we will discuss on how these man-made modifications introduce or relocate strong currents and inundation in the bay.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenically contaminated soils pose a significant threat to biota across the world. Much of the literature on explosives contaminated soils has focused on individual or species level impacts while the larger plant community is often ignored. Our goal was to fill that gap and investigate impacts on community structure and diversity in an area contaminated with three common explosive compounds (RDX, TNT, Composition B). Community data were collected from an experimental minefield that was cleared 17 years ago, seeded with a surveyed grid of explosive compounds, and allowed to naturally revegetate. Plots within contaminated and reference sites were established. Woody and herbaceous species composition was recorded and species diversity and richness were calculated. Species composition and functional type data were analyzed using cluster analyses, multi-response permutation procedure analyses (MRPP), and detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) to investigate separation of the treatment groups.\nClassical diversity metrics were similar across treatments; however, cluster analyses and MRPP revealed significant differences in species and functional type composition. DCA of species composition showed no separation of treatment groups while DCA of functional traits showed that the TNT and Comp B plots contained a narrower range of functional traits, primarily due to life history and leaf characteristics, which differentiated them from the other treatment groups;. Differences between reference and contaminant sites in species composition and traits suggests that the presence of soil contaminants act as a physiological filter controlling which plant species establish and prosper. This in turn may have long lasting and significant impacts on the overall community composition and structure. Further research is needed to fully understand the community and ecosystem scale impacts of such contaminants.",

The ecohydrologic system is complex system in which the relationships between the variables in the system change depending on time and system state. A monsoon introduces a profound alteration in process which may define a shift in the system state. Transpiration in the ecohydrologic system is an important point of contact between water, carbon, and energy exchange subsystems, and the stomatal conductance is one of the key factors which controls transpiration.\nWe utilized transfer entropy in a dynamical process network application to define changes in system state by observing changes in the couplings between this system’s carbon, water, and energy subsystems. We quantified the transfer entropy from the micrometeorological variables of a flux tower i.e., solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, air temperature, and soil water content to the stomatal conductance for the five forest ecosystems in East Asia. The strength of this coupling increased significantly during and after the monsoon. Based on the result, we are modifying the parameterization of stomatal conductance to integrate the biological adaptation to the monsoon into the simulation of transpiration in a land surface model.\nAcknowledgment.

The Lau Backarc Spreading Center is comprised of three segments, Central Lau Spreading Center, Eastern Lau Spreading Center, and the Valu Fa Spreading Center. The segments show very different spreading and magma production rates as a function of their distance to the arc and slab, which decreases from north to south. Geochemical studies also indicate a systematic change in magma composition along strike of the Lau Back-Arc Spreading Center with more water and fluid-mobile elements in the south.\nFrom 2009-2010, 16 broadband seismometers and 51 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) were installed for one year across the Lau backarc spreading centers and in Fiji and Tonga to image the along-strike structural variation of the subduction zone and the dynamics of the melt production region. We present preliminary results from the joint inversion of P and S wave arrivals from local and teleseismic events recorded by this network. Arrivals from local events were picked manually, while travel time residuals for teleseismic arrivals were determined via the adaptive stacking method developed by Rawlinson and Kennett (2004). Travel times for local events and residuals for teleseismic events are inverted using TOMOG3D (Zhao et al., 1994) to solve for three dimensional velocity structure along strike of the Lau Backarc Spreading Center and Tonga Arc.\nPreliminary results show a clearly defined westward-dipping low velocity region beneath the Eastern Lau and Valu Fa Spreading Centers, which is most pronounced at depths less than 150 km. The low velocities beneath the Eastern Lau and Valu Fa Spreading Centers are more pronounced relative to those associated with the Tonga Arc.",

            "abstract": "Despite several decades of research we lack a mechanistic theory to predict deposition in porous media in the presence of colloid-collector repulsion (unfavorable conditions). Recently, mechanistic models have been developed that incorporate nanoscale surface heterogeneity in colloid-collector interactions. Comparisons of simulations to experimental data allows backing out a representative heterogeneity for the surface, which to date has been reported only for silica. Colloid deposition onto a variety of representative aquifer materials expected to be unfavorable under environmental conditions (quartz, muscovite and albite) was observed for 0.25, 1.1 and 1.95 µm carboxylate-modified latex microspheres using an impinging jet system. Deposition efficiencies varied in response to changes in collector mineralogy, ionic strength, electrolyte valence and pH. Collector surface charge heterogeneity characteristics (heterodomain size and spatial distribution) were backed out from these experiments via comparison to particle trajectory simulations incorporating discrete nano-scale attractive domains (heterodomains). A bi-modal distribution (1:4, ratio of large to small heterodomains) of 120nm and 60nm heterodomains was found to quantitatively predict retention for all three colloid sizes for a given surface. Varying the surface coverage of heterodomains allowed a characteristic coverage for each observed collector surface to be determined. This developing catalog of surface characteristics will aid prediction of colloid transport and deposition under environmentally relevant conditions (aquifer material composition and groundwater chemistry).",

            "abstract": "Using data from the Array of Arrays (AofA) and Cascadia Arrays for Earthscope (CAFE) experiments we found 61 families of low frequency earthquakes (LFEs) beneath the Olympic Peninsula, Washington. Detections within each family range from Mw1-2. We cross-correlated 6-second long windows within 99 separate hours of tremor data during the 2010 and 2011 Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events. For each hour, we stacked the autocorrelation functions from a set of 7 three-component base stations chosen for their high signal-to-noise ratios. We extracted windows with correlation coefficients higher than 9 times the median absolute deviation. These time windows contain our preliminary LFE detections. We clustered the time windows and produced template waveforms by stacking the waveforms corresponding to a given cluster. By scanning templates through the entire time period when the AofA network was active (June 2009 – September 2010 and August 2011), we identify bursts of LFE activity lasting 2-10 days during times of known tremor [Wech, 2010], including the August 2010 and 2011 ETS events and three tremor swarms in November 2009, March 2010, and July 2010, each of which is assumed to signify a slow-slip event (SSE). During the larger ETS events, we can identify the passage of the main rupture front, rapid tremor reversals and/or dip-parallel streaks. These alternate propagation modes are less obvious during smaller SSEs. We examine the spatial extent of the SSEs by determining which families were active during each event. While all families were active during the 2010 and 2011 ETS events, fewer families were active during the smaller SSEs. The families active during smaller SSEs are located farther down dip. Finally, we are applying double-difference methods to obtain more robust LFE locations, which will shed light on the patchy structure of the plate interface.",

            "abstract": "Diverse interactions of winds, currents and ice around Antarctica dictate how, where and when the world’s densest waters form and massive floating ice shelves and glaciers melt, as well as control sea surface gas exchange and primary productivity. Compelled by recent rate estimates of East Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss, we contrast the paths and mixing histories of oceanic waters reaching the continental ice edge off the Sabrina and Adelie coasts relying on the unique set of synoptic shipboard measurements from NBP1402 (swath bathymetry, ADCP, underway CTD).\nAnalysis of historical hydrography and sea ice concentration fields within the Mertz Polynya indicates the apparent effect of evolving ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions on the characteristics of local Shelf Water (SW) sources to current outflow of newly formed Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). A polynya dominated water mass structure similar to that observed off the Adelie Coast before the removal of the Mertz Ice Tongue was expected to the west of the Dalton Ice Tongue (DIT). However, we found no evidence of dense SW off Sabrina Coast, which may lessen the region’s preconceived influence to global meridional overturning.\nPresent sea ice production within the eastern Dalton Polynya is overshadowed by freshwater input to relatively stable interior upper waters. The Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC) picks up distinct meltwater contributions along the DIT western flank and in front of the Moscow University Ice Shelf (MUIS) and Totten Glacier (TG). Unlike over other highly influential margins to global sea level rise, there is no evidence of local cross-shelf inflow and mixing of warm Circumpolar Deep Water. Relatively cold thermocline waters from the continental slope enter the eastern trough off Sabrina Coast, and they are swiftly steered poleward by complex underlying topography. Meltwater export from beneath the MUIS and TG is observed at newly discovered trenches that effectively constrain sub-cavity inflow to low salinity near-freezing waters drawn from intermediate levels of the adjacent westward flowing ACoC.\nWinds, currents and ice interactions observed off Sabrina Coast during NBP1402 are most likely widespread, in view of reported decadal freshening of upper waters over the Antarctic continental shelf and their localized AABW outflows.",

            "abstract": "Recent theory and observations of asteroids have shown that rubble pile bodies can have a weak level of cohesion, allowing them to spin faster than the gravitational limit, but not too fast (Sanchez & Scheeres MAPS 2014; Hirabayashi et al. ApJL 2014). However, these predicted fission spin rates are less than the maximum spin rates observed for small asteroids, implying that some of these smaller asteroids may be the monolithic components of a rubble pile, or boulders shed from these bodies in the past. \nFor a rubble pile body with a given level of cohesion, its maximum spin rate is inversely proportional to the body diameter. Thus, every time a rubble pile body is split into smaller components, the resulting body can spin proportionally faster before it can shed or fission again. In contrast, the YORP effect’s spin acceleration is inversely proportional to the body diameter squared. Thus, the time it takes for the components of a fissioned body to spin up to its new fission limit is proportional to the body diameter and takes proportionally less time to achieve their next fission. If a body fissions into N components, the new effective diameters of the components will equal\nN\n−1/3\ntimes their initial diameter. Thus, if we assume that a fissioned component is immediately accelerated to its next fission rate, the total time for a rubble pile to completely fission is a convergent power series, and can be shown to be equal to the initial YORP time scale of the starting, initial rubble pile. This total time can be extended by an order of magnitude if a fissioned body is initially rotationally decelerated. It may also be extended if its post-fission tumbling state slows its YORP rotational acceleration.\nWe will present predictions for the lifetimes of small rubble pile asteroids before they are disaggregated. Direct comparisons will be made between the competing effects of YORP acceleration, dissipation of a complex rotation state back to uniform rotation, and the number of components that a body may split into. We find that, based on recent constraints placed on the\nμQ\nvalues of rubble pile bodies, the relaxation time back to uniform rotation should be short compared to the time to be accelerated to its next fission spin rate. Throughout the talk the rubble pile, fast-spinning, tumbling asteroid 2008 TC3 will be used as a motivating example. ",

            "abstract": "Mantle-derived mafic magmas are often invoked as a mechanism to transfer heat, mass and volatiles to felsic plutons that reside in the Earth’s crust. This process has been suggested as a means of sustaining shallow magmatic bodies and triggering volcanic eruptions. Various field observations suggest that mafic water-rich magmas might intrude a viscous felsic crystal-rich mush. This scenario might be expected to produce water advection from the crystallizing mafic magma to the felsic magma, leading to an increase of melt fraction in the felsic mush and subsequent mobilization whilst the mafic magma is simultaneously quenched. To investigate certain features of this scenario we conducted 24-hour experiments to establish the petrological evolution of a water-saturated (4 wt.% H2O in the interstitial melt) dacitic crystal mush (50-80 vol.% quartz crystals) subject to a volatile supply released from a water-saturated (≥ 6 wt.% H2O) andesitic magma at 950 °C and 500 MPa (15 km depth). Run products were characterised by SEM, EPMA, SIMS and Raman. Our results show unidirectional solidification textures (comb layering) as crystal nucleate at the mafic-felsic interface and grow into the mafic end-member. This is a direct effect of isothermal undercooling that results from a change in liquidus temperatures of the interacting magmas with changing water content. This is the first study exploring felsic-mafic magma interaction under “natural conditions” and shows that textures associated with mafic-felsic interactions found in the field may not be simply cooling-driven in origin. These experiments allow us to explore some essential concepts for understanding the origin of mafic enclaves, how volatiles contribute to crystal mush remobilisation within the Earth’s crust and can trigger explosive volcanic eruptions during recharge of mafic inputs into felsic reservoirs, and how degassing processes might be traced by textural features that indicate the direction of volatile transfer.",

In modern, historic and prehistoric times the sandbars have been used for camping, hunting, fishing and recreational activities. Sandbars are a dynamic geomorphic unit of the river system that stores and exchanges sand with the main river channel. Both natural and anthropogenic changes to river systems affect the size, shape and dynamics of sandbars. During high spring flows, the Snake River can resupply and build the sand bars. During the lower flows of the summer and fall the sand is redistributed to lower levels by natural and anthropogenic forces, where it can be remobilized by the river and exported from the bar. During the summer and fall high use season many people camp and recreate on the bars and redistribute the sand. This study utilizes change detection from repeat high resolution terrestrial LiDAR scanning surveys to study the impacts humans have on the sandbars in Hells Canyon. Nearly a decade of annual LiDAR and Bathymetric surveys were used to place these recreational impacts into the context of overall sandbar dynamics.",

PHA metrics include (but are not limited to) channel substrate, width and wetted width, bank slope, and bank height. Hinkson Creek, located in Boone County, Missouri, was placed on the Missouri Department of Natural Resources list of impaired waters (Section 303d) of the Clean Water Act in 1998. A physical habitat assessment of Hinkson Creek in 2014 provides quantitative data characterizing the current potential of Hinkson Creek to fully support aquatic life, specifically macroinvertebrates (a goal for delisting). The PHA was conducted every 100m of Hinkson Creek (56km). Results from the lower 87.9% (contiguous) of the drainage indicate channel width ranged from a maximum of 70m to a minimum of 4.6m, with a mean width of 17m and standard deviation (SD) of 7.4m. Bankfull width ranged from a maximum of 74m to a minimum of 8.8m (mean = 26.1m, SD = 8.2). Bank height ranged from a maximum of 5.8m to a minimum of 0.4m (mean = 2.9m, SD = 1m). Mean bank angle for the left and right banks was nearly equivalent (left = 33.8°, right = 34.6°). Bank height and bankfull width increased with increasing drainage distance.

            "abstract": "Sources of volcano infrasound associated with explosive eruptions are typically modeled assuming an acoustic monopole and/or dipole. While the monopole represents the mass outflux of erupted materials, the dipole represents a force system acting in the source region during eruptions. Therefore, appropriate acoustic source inversions of volcano infrasound data can provide estimates of eruption parameters which are critical to understanding eruption dynamics. Reliability of the source parameters is dominantly controlled by the accuracy of the acoustic Green's functions between the source and receiver positions. Conventional source inversions of volcano infrasound, however, were typically performed using a simplified Green's function obtained in a free space or half space. This may result in intolerable errors in the source parameters, especially when the infrasound waveforms are significantly distorted by volcano topography and/or local atmospheric variability (i.e., layered velocity structure or wind). In this study we present a full waveform inversion technique for volcano infrasound using numerical Green's functions. A full 3-D Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method accelerated with GPU is used to compute accurate Green's functions taking into account volcano topography and local atmospheric conditions. The presented method is applied to data recorded at Sakurajima volcano (Japan) and Tungurahua volcano (Ecuador), which provide a large volume of high-quality data recorded by azimuthally well-distributed stations within 2 -- 6 km distance of the volcanoes. We analyze infrasound signals associated with explosive eruptions exhibiting 1) distinct explosion waveforms followed by gas discharges and 2) strong anisotropic radiation patterns, which can be caused by either source directivity or topographic barriers/reflections. Here the role of topography in controlling the infrasound radiation is investigated through numerical modeling, and then the observed infrasound is inverted for the source parameters by using the modeled Green's functions. Finally, we investigate explosive source mechanisms for different types of eruptions considering the obtained monopole and dipole components.",

            "abstract": "Ridge-runnel (RR) systems are morphological features that may form in the intermittently wet and dry zone of the beach immediately after storm events. Their onshore migration provides a natural way of recovery for an eroded beach but the detailed swash interactions and complex feedback mechanisms between wave dynamics, sediment transport and profile evolution are not well understood and challenging to measure in-situ. During a storm, elevated water levels and large waves can significantly erode the beach profile in a matter of hours through offshore-directed sediment transport. The beach recovery process, on the other hand, occurs over a much longer time period during less intense wave conditions. In the beginning of this 3-week field campaign at South Bethany Beach, Delaware, a Nor’easter, eroded significant portions of this steep, meso-tidal beach and formed a pronounced RR system which then evolved during the less energetic conditions after the storm. An extensive cross-shore array of sensors was installed immediately after the storm measuring near-bed velocity profiles (5 Nortek Vectrino Profilers) and horizontal velocities (6 Sontec Electromagnetic Current Meters; 1 side-looking Nortek Vectrino) suspended sediment concentrations (10 Optical Backscatter Sensors OBS-3+), and pressure fluctuations (7 GE Druck pressure transducers) in the swash zone. Dense topography surveys of the RR system were conducted twice a day during low tide conditions with a Leica RTK GPS rover system. In addition, sediment grab samples along the entire RR cross-section were collected daily. An offshore ADCP with surface wave tracking capability (Nortek 2MHz AWAC AST) measured directional wave spectra and current profiles at a water depth of approximately 6m.\nThe RR system showed rapid onshore migration over the two tide cycles immediately after the storm, followed by a period of vertical ridge accretion of up to 3 ft at certain locations. A first look at the collected data and analysis results related to the feedback mechanisms between wave forcing and RR evolution is presented along with a discussion of difficulties encountered during the experiment.",

            "abstract": "Holocene millennial-scale oscillations and Bond Events (Bond et al. 1997) are well reported in the North Atlantic as consequence of fresh water input and weaking of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). It has been hypothesized that the effect of weaking of AMOC would lead to warming in the South Atlantic due to “heat piracy”, causing surface waters to warm and a reorganization of surface circulation. There are few reconstructions of AMOC strength in the South Atlantic, and none with a high resolution Holocene record of changes of productivity and the biological pump. We reconstruct past changes in the surface water mass hydrography, productivity, and sediment redox changes in high-resolution in the core KCF10-01B, located 128 mbsl water depth off Cabo Frio, Brazil, a location where upwelling is strongly linked to surface ocean hydrography. We use Benthic Foraminiferal Accumulation Rate (BFAR) to reconstruct productivity, which reveals a 1.3kyr cyclicity during the mid- and late-Holocene. The geochemistry of trace and rare earth elements on foraminiferal Fe-Mn oxide coatings show changes in redox-sensitive elements indicating that during periods of high productivity there were more reducing conditions in sediment porewaters, producing a Ce anomaly and reduction and re-precipitation of Mn oxides. Bond events 1-7 were identified by a productivity increase along with reducing sediment conditions which was likely caused by Brazil Current displacement offshore allowing upwelling of the nutritive bottom water South Atlantic Central Waters (SACW) to the euphotic zone and a stronger local biological pump. In a global context, correlation with other records show that this occurred during weakened AMOC and southward displacement of the ITCZ. We conclude that Bond climatic events and millennial-scale variability of AMOC caused sea surface hydrographic changes off the Brazilian Margin leading to biological and geochemical changes recorded in coastal records. The 8.2kyr climatic event is reported here for the first time in South American coastal sediment records as high productivity conditions and a rapid change in porewater redox chemistry.",

            "abstract": "The Tonga subduction zone is one of the most seismically active areas in the world, with a high rate of plate convergence between the subducting Pacific plate and the Tonga arc from 15°S to 25°S.However, seismically recorded large interplate thrusting events along the arc have not been larger than about Mw 8.0, and the degree of interplate seismic coupling has been inferred to vary from moderate to very low going from northern Tonga to southern Tonga [e.g., Scholz and Campos, 2012]. The possibility of this region experiencing a low probability maximum magnitude event of Mw8.57 up to 9.14 has been raised, but a paucity of geodetic observations and their distance from the Tonga trench have precluded assessments of slip deficit accumulation on the megathrust [Wallace et al., 2005]. Faulting mechanisms of historical large shallow earthquakes are uncertain [e.g., Okal et al., 2011], and some recent large events have been normal faulting or thrust-faulting intraslab events, so catalog-based assessments of seismic coupling are uncertain. Two recent large thrust-faulting earthquakes in 2006 and 2009 further complicate such assessments. The 3 May 2006 Mw8.0 event was located 100km west of the trench and caused a substantial regional tsunami, so it is sometimes assumed to be an interplate rupture. However, finite-fault modeling of teleseismic body waves supports a slip distribution centered about 60 km depth, consistent with centroid depths from W-phase (60.5 km) and global CMT (65 km) inversions. This was an intraslab thrust event with estimated stress drop of ~10 MPa. The fault plane is difficult to resolve unambiguously using teleseismic body waves, but joint inversion with static offsets from local GPS stations favors a shallow-dipping plane subparallel to the megathrust, or possibly a steeply dipping plane with triggered megathrust faulting. The 19 March 2009 Mw 7.6 thrust event occurred below the trench, and finite-fault and W-phase inversions indicate a 45km deep centroid. The fault plane is also difficult to establish. There continues to be a paucity of large megathrust earthquakes in Tonga.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of the coupled chemical and mechanical properties and behavior of reservoir and seal rocks is critical for assessing both the short and long term security of sequestered CO2. A combined structural diagenesis approach using observations from natural analogs has great advantages for understanding these properties over longer time scales than is possible using laboratory or numerical experiments. Current numerical models evaluating failure of reservoirs and seals during and after CO2 injection in the subsurface are just beginning to account for such coupled processes. Well-characterized field studies of natural analogs such as Crystal Geyser, Utah, are essential for providing realistic input parameters, calibration, and testing of numerical models across a range of spatial and temporal scales.\nFracture mechanics testing was performed on a suite of naturally altered and unaltered reservoir and seal rocks exposed at the Crystal Geyser field site. These samples represent end-products of CO2-related alteration over geologic (>103 yr) time scales. Both the double torsion and short rod test methods yield comparable results on the same samples. Tests demonstrate that CO2-related alteration has weakened one reservoir sandstone lithology by approximately 50%, but the subcritical index is not significantly affected. An altered siltstone sample also shows a reduction in fracture toughness values and lowered subcritical index in comparison to unaltered siltstone. In contrast, elevated calcite content in shales due to CO2 alteration has increased fracture toughness. Similarly, fracture toughness was increased in what is otherwise a weak, poorly cemented sandstone unit due to increased calcite cement. Combined, these results demonstrate that CO2-related alteration generally weakens rock to fracturing (i.e. lowers fracture toughness), except in cases where calcite cementation is significantly increased. The natural system at Crystal Geyser demonstrates that water-CO2-rock interaction driven by changes in the geochemical environment have measurably altered rock geomechanical properties and that some rock units may become more prone to failure, ultimately leading to fracturing and leakage of subsurface reservoirs. These results also have application for CO2-based enhanced oil recovery. ",

Over the past 25 years, the influence of Fe concentration on phytoplankton production has been well studied and this research has been instrumental in our understanding of the influence that biology has on the sequestration of atmospheric CO2. However, other trace elements that are directly involved in carbon metabolism by primary producers, such as Zn, Cd, and Co, have received less attention. We examined the physiological response of two strains of Emiliania huxleyi to a range of realistic trace element concentrations (Zn, Cd, Co) in the marine environment under batch, semi-continuous, and continuous culture conditions. In addition, the continuous culture system was maintained at a pH of 8.15 ±0.02 by a sensor and regulator-controlled CO2­ injection system. The results from this study will highlight the influence that trace element composition of seawater has on the growth rate, elemental quota, inorganic carbon uptake, and carbon metabolism of Emiliania huxleyi. Potential limitations for the interpretation of paleo-productivity records will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "As one of the most prominent tropical atmospheric variability modes, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) exerts profound influences on global weather and climate, and serves as a critical predictability source for extend-range forecast. In spite of the recent effort toward improving the ability of general circulation models (GCMs) to simulate the MJO, significant challenges still remain for current GCMs to produce more realistic MJO simulations. Previous studies have highlighted the important role of multi-scale interactions within the MJO including the momentum exchanges in order to improve MJO prediction skill. In this study, convective momentum transport (CMT) associated with the MJO is analyzed based on the recent NOAA Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), in particular, by capitalizing on its archive of the parameterized subgrid CMT. Consistent with previous cloud-resolving model study, a three-layer vertical structure associated with the MJO is clear in the subgrid CMT from the CFSR. In association with enhanced MJO convection over both the Indian Ocean (IO) and western Pacific (WP), within and to the west (east) of the MJO convection, positive (negative), negative (positive), positive (negative) subgrid CMT momentum tendency anomalies are evident in the upper, middle, and lower troposphere, respectively. This subgrid CMT vertical structure tends to damp the large-scale MJO circulation in the middle and upper troposphere, but enhances MJO winds in a shallow near-surface layer. Further analyses illustrate that this three-layer vertical structure in subgrid momentum tendency of the MJO is largely balanced by grid-scale u-momentum transport. The momentum tendency structure associated with the MJO based on the CFSR is also confirmed with the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis for the two-year period of the Year of the Tropical Convection (YOTC), which further lends confidence to our results.",

            "abstract": "Himalayan glaciers are important natural resources and climatic indicators. Many of these glaciers have debris-covered ablation zones, while others are mostly clean ice. Regarding glacier dynamics, it is expected that debris-covered glaciers will respond differently to atmospheric warming compared to clean ice glaciers. In the Bhutanese Himalaya, there are (1) north flowing clean-ice glaciers with high velocities, likely with large amounts of basal sliding, and (2) south flowing debris-covered glaciers with slow velocities, thermokarst features, and influenced more by the Indian Summer Monsoon. This region, therefore, is ideal for comparing the dynamical response of clean-ice versus debris-covered glaciers to climatic change. In particular, previous studies have suggested the north flowing glaciers are likely adjusting more dynamically (i.e. retreating) in response to climate variations, while the south flowing glaciers are likely experiencing downwasting, with stagnant termini locations. We test this hypothesis by assessing glacier changes over three decades in the Bhutan region using a newly-developed workflow to extract DEMs and orthorectified imagery from both 1976 historical spy satellite images and 2006 ASTER images. DEM differencing for both debris-covered and clean glaciers allows for quantification of glacier surface elevation changes, while orthorectified imagery allows for measuring changes in glacier termini. The same stereo-matching, denoising, and georeferencing methodology is used on both datasets to ensure consistency, while the three decade timespan allows for a better signal to noise ratio compared to studies performed on shorter timescales. The results of these analyses highlight the similarities and differences in the decadal response of clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers to climatic change, and provide insights into the complex dynamics of debris-covered glaciers in the monsoonal Himalayas.",

            "abstract": "The meridional overturning circulation in a wind-driven re-entrant channel arises from a balance between an Eulerian mean overturning and an eddy overturning. These cancel to leading order in the Southern Ocean's Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). An ACC-like flow, with realistic stratification, zonal transport and distributions of eddy kinetic energy, develops even when these two overturning components cancel completely. Many studies have noted that an enhancement of the Eulerian overturning circulation, which tends to steepen isopycnals, is balanced in part by an enhancement of the eddy circulation that relaxes isopycnal tilt. Thus the domain-averaged isopycnal slope and zonal transport are relatively insensitive to changes in wind forcing. However, the response of the system's mesoscale variability and eddy fluxes is not uniform throughout the domain. We present a process study of an idealized eddy-resolving ACC-like channel with negligible residual overturning to explore how the along-stream distribution of eddy characteristics establishes a balance between wind and eddy overturning circulations.\nFor each simulation, we decompose the overturning circulation into mean, standing and transient components. As the surface wind stress increases, the standing component balances a larger portion of the mean overturning. This in turn leads to an increasing departure from zonally-symmetric eddy characteristics. A zonal-mean, or net, eddy diffusivity Κnet is defined as the eddy diffusivity required to exactly balance the mean overturning based on the zonal-mean isopycnal slope, s. This gives Κnet=τ/ρ0fs, where τ is the wind stress, ρ0 is a reference density and f is the Coriolis parameter. Κnet is compared to local eddy diffusivities, Κlocal, diagnosed directly from the divergent component of the eddy buoyancy flux divided by the local isopycnal slope. We find that with a simple topographic ridge and moderate wind forcing, along-stream averages of Κlocal diverge from Κnet, and are typically smaller than Κnet. Strong “transport corridors,\" where Κlocal≥Κnet develop in the lee of topography. We explore the sensitivity of the Κlocal distribution and meander structure to wind forcing and to channel length, and we discuss the challenges this presents for eddy flux parameterizations.",

Therefore, it is critical to acquire accurate precipitation and ET data as input into a statewide water balance. Since existing meteorological stations in New Mexico don’t cover the entire state and leave many areas without accurate information, we propose to evaluate the accuracy of existing nationwide remotely sensed databases for precipitation and ET to quantify the spatial and temporal distributions of those components in a statewide water balance.\nIn this study we compare five precipitation products and three ET products: the CHIRPS (Climate Hazard Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) model, the National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service product, the PERSIANN-GCCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network – Global Cloud Classification System) model, the PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes) model the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, the ALExI (Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse) model, the MOD 16 ( MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Product) model of NASA, and the SSEB (Simplified Surface Energy Balance) model produced by the USGS.\nEarly results show a strong relationship between all precipitation products across the state of New Mexico from 2000 to 2013 with an average depth of 315 mm, except for the PERSIANN model which has a rainfall depth approximately 53% higher (673mm) than the average of the other models. Additionally there is a strong relationship between the ALExI and SSEB ET models yet these models exceed the precipitation in the state by approximately 35%. The MOD 16 ET model has an average ET depth approximately 42% less than the average of the precipitation models and about 60% less than the ALExI and SSEB ET models.\nFuture work includes validation of precipitation and ET models using high density rain gauge networks, as well as METRIC (Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high spatial Resolution with Internalized Calibration) and eddy-covariance towers across the state. Additionally the ET models will be systematically compared with land cover and precipitation in effort to identify areas with greater errors and biases in those models.",

            "abstract": "The modern central Peruvian Andes are dominated by a laterally extensive region of flat slab subduction. The Peruvian flat slab extends for ~1500 km along the strike of the Andes, correlating with the subduction of the Nazca Ridge in the south and the theorized Inca Plateau in the north. We have used data from the CAUGHT and PULSE experiments for finite frequency teleseismic P- and S-wave tomography to image the Nazca slab in the upper mantle below 95 km depth under central Peru between 10°S and 18°S as well as the surrounding mantle. Since the slab inboard of the subducting Nazca Ridge is mostly aseismic, our results provide important constraints on the geometry of the subducting Nazca slab in this region. Our images of the Nazca slab suggest that steepening of the slab inboard of the subducting Nazca Ridge locally occurs ~100 km further inland than was indicated in previous studies. The region where we have imaged the steepening of the Nazca slab inboard of the Nazca Ridge correlates with the location of the Fitzcarrald Arch, a long wavelength upper plate topographic feature which has been suggested to be a consequence of ridge subduction. When the slab steepens inboard of the flat slab region, it does so at a very steep (~70°) angle. The transition from the Peruvian flat slab to the more normally dipping slab south of 16°S below Bolivia is characterized by an abrupt bending of the slab anomaly in the mantle in response to the shift from flat to normal subduction. The slab anomaly appears to be intact south of the Nazca Ridge with no evidence for tearing of the slab in response to the abrupt change in slab dip. A potential tear in the slab is inferred from an observed offset in the slab anomaly north of the Nazca Ridge extending subparallel to the ridge axis between 130 and 300 km depth. A high amplitude (-5-6%) slow S-wave velocity anomaly is observed below the projection of the Nazca Ridge. This anomaly appears to be laterally confined to the mantle directly below projection of the Nazca Ridge but descends to ~300 km depth in the mantle. This sub-slab slow anomaly may correlate with vertical mantle flow induced by movement of material through the inferred tear in the slab north of the Nazca Ridge or alternately may represent a long-lived feature of the sub-slab mantle possibly associated with the development of the Nazca Ridge at the Easter Island hot spot.",

            "abstract": "Seismic instrumentation for recording strong earthquakes, in Mexico, goes back to the 60´s due the activities carried out by the Institute of Engineering at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. However, it was after the big earthquake of September 19, 1985 (M=8.1) when the project of seismic instrumentation assumes a great importance.\nCurrently, strong ground motion networks have been installed for monitoring seismic activity mainly along the Mexican subduction zone and in Mexico City. Nevertheless, there are other major regions and cities that can be affected by strong earthquakes and have not yet begun their seismic instrumentation program or this is still in development.\nBecause of described situation some relevant earthquakes (e.g. Huajuapan de León Oct 24, 1980 M=7.1, Tehuacán Jun 15, 1999 M=7 and Puerto Escondido Sep 30, 1999 M= 7.5) have not been registered properly in some cities, like Puebla and Oaxaca, and that were damaged during those earthquakes. Fortunately, the good maintenance work carried out in the seismic network has permitted the recording of an important number of small events in those cities. So in this research we present a methodology based on the use of neural networks to estimate significant duration and in some cases the response spectra for those seismic events.\nThe neural model developed predicts significant duration in terms of magnitude, epicenter distance, focal depth and soil characterization. Additionally, for response spectra we used a vector of spectral accelerations. For training the model we selected a set of accelerogram records obtained from the small events recorded in the strong motion instruments installed in the cities of Puebla and Oaxaca. \nThe final results show that neural networks as a soft computing tool that use a multi-layer feed-forward architecture provide good estimations of the target parameters and they also have a good predictive capacity to estimate strong ground motion duration and response spectra.\n ",

            "abstract": "We report observations from 15 solar wind reconnection exhausts encountered along the Ulysses orbit beyond 4 AU in 1996-1999 and 2002-2005. The events, which lasted between 17 and 45 min, were found at heliospheric latitudes between -36o and 21o with one event detected as high as 58o. All events shared a common characteristic of a tripolar guide-magnetic field perturbation being detected across the observed exhausts. The signature consists of an enhanced guide field magnitude within the exhaust center and two regions of significantly depressed guide-fields adjacent to the center region. The events displayed magnetic field shear angles as low as 37o with a mean of 89o. This corresponds to a strong external guide field relative to the anti-parallel reconnecting component of the magnetic field with a mean ratio of 1.3 and a maximum ratio of 3.1. A 2-D kinetic reconnection simulation for realistic solar wind conditions reveals that tripolar guide fields form at current sheets in the presence of multiple X-lines as two magnetic islands interact with one another for such strong guide fields. The Ulysses observations are also compared with the results of a 3-D kinetic simulation of multiple flux ropes in a strong guide field.",

We assess the capabilities of these models in capturing quasi-steady solar wind features including sector boundaries and the fast-slow stream interaction regions.

            "abstract": "GCM skill in the climate change-sensitive polar regions is a key factor in using them to predict future changes in ice sheet/shelf surface melting. Knowing why a GCM is wrong (or right) versus observed climate is also key. We address these topics by using a neural network-based tool, self-organizing maps (SOMs), to evaluate the variability and skill of modern GCM melt-season surface climates in Antarctica (January) and Greenland (July).\nThree scenarios test GCMs in contemporary polar settings: how well do models capture variability in a reference dataset (the ERA-Interim reanalysis, ERAI); locating GCMs in a “universal” data space covering all models plus ERAI; and how well do GCMs reproduce the patterns associated with extremes such as the July 2012 Greenland ice sheet melt event. In each case, SOMs abstract complex datasets (e.g., daily near-surface air temperature) into a relatively small set of generalized patterns representing dataset variability. We study 19 models from the CMIP5 archive that provide the sub-daily data needed for regional-scale modeling plus the recent 30-member CESM1.0-CAM5-BGC Large Ensemble.\nA SOM of ERAI (1981-2000) provides both a summary of variability in the reanalysis and a mapping of each GCM within the ERAI data space. How well GCMs reproduce ERAI pattern frequencies reflects GCM skill. With frequency differences indicating over/underoccurence of patterns, insights to mechanisms behind model skill are possible (albeit complex to develop).\nBy analyzing ERAI and CMIP5 models together, the “universal” SOM (1981-2000) summarizes the variability of multiple realizations of climate and helps place each GCM in a common context. For example, four main pattern groups can summarize Antarctic temperature: warm- and cold-everywhere and ocean/continent warm/cold dipoles. Warm GCMs are found in both the warm-everywhere group (MRI-CGCM3) and the warm continent/cold ocean group (BNU-ESM).\nERAI SOMs also provide context to test GCM skill versus extreme events. Analysis of 35 years (1979-2013) of Greenland temperature indicates that SOM patterns associated with the July 2012 ice sheet-wide melt event are present only since 2006. GCM skill in reproducing such statistics will inform our analyses of GCM-based predictions of future melting.",

            "abstract": "The Delaware River provides half of New York City's drinking water, is a habitat for wild trout, American shad and the federally endangered dwarf wedge mussel. It has suffered four 100‐year floods in the last seven years. A drought during the 1960s stands as a warning of the potential vulnerability of the New York City area to severe water shortages if a similar drought were to recur. The water releases from three New York City dams on the Delaware River's headwaters impact not only the reliability of the city’s water supply, but also the potential impact of floods, and the quality of the aquatic habitat in the upper river. The goal of this work is to influence the Delaware River water release policies (FFMP/OST) to further benefit river habitat and fisheries without increasing New York City's drought risk, or the flood risk to down basin residents. The Delaware water release policies are constrained by the dictates of two US Supreme Court Decrees (1931 and 1954) and the need for unanimity among four states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware ‐‐ and New York City. Coordination of their activities and the operation under the existing decrees is provided by the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC). Questions such as the probability of the system approaching drought state based on the current FFMP plan and the severity of the 1960s drought are addressed using long record paleo‐reconstructions of flows. For this study, we developed reconstructed total annual flows (water year) for 3 reservoir inflows using regional tree rings going back up to 1754 (a total of 246 years). The reconstructed flows are used with a simple reservoir model to quantify droughts. We observe that the 1960s drought is by far the worst drought based on 246 years of simulations (since 1754). However, there are intermediate drought warning periods and proper adaptation would be sufficient during these periods. Modified release rules that aid thermal relief to wild trout in the upper Delaware can be explored without much stress to the system during most periods.",

Highly stabilized DFB laser was used as local oscillator, while single model quartz fiber Y-coupler served as a diplexer. Radiation mixed in the single mode fiber was detected by quadratic detector using p-i-n diode within the bandpass of ~10 MHz. Wavelength coverage of spectral measurement was provided by sweeping local oscillator frequency in the range 1,1 см-1. With the exposure time of 10 min, the absorption spectrum of the atmosphere over Moscow has been recorded with S/N ~ 300.\nWe retrieved methane vertical profile using Tikhonov method of smooth functional, which takes into account a priori information about first guess profile. The reference to model methane profile means that the regularization procedure always selects a priorivalues unless the measurements contradict this assumption.The retrieved methane profile demonstrates higher abundances in the lower scale height compared to the assumed model profile, well expected in the megalopolis center. The retrievals sensitivity is limited by 10 ppb, with the exception of the lower part of the profile where the tendency to lower values is revealed. Thus the methane abundance variations may be evaluated with relative accuracy better than 1%, which fits the requirements of greenhouse gas monitoring.\nThe retrievals sensitivity of CO2 is about 1-2 ppm. CO2 observations was also used to estimate stratoshere wind by doppler shift of absorption line.\nDue to higher spectral resolution, lower sensitivity to atmospheric temperatures and other external factors, compared to heterodyne measurements in the thermal IR spectral range, the described technique provides accuracy comparable with much more complicated high resolution measurements now used in TCCON stations. Relative simplicity of the proposed scheme opens a perspective to employ it for high resolution spectroscopy in various applications. In particular, it may allow solar occultation observations of CO2, CО, CH4, H2S, C2H4 and other gases from spacecraft, airborne or ground-based platforms.",

Measuring how these surfaces evolve in the face of a rapidly changing climate requires the utmost attention to detail in the design and calibration of these instruments, as well as understanding the changing optical properties of these surfaces. As single photon counting lidars, MABEL and NASA’s ATLAS (Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System) on the upcoming ICESat-2 mission provide fundamentally different information compared with waveform lidars such as ATM, or GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) on NASA’s previous ICESat-1 mission. By recording the travel times of individual photons, more detailed information about the surface, and potentially the subsurface, are available and must be considered in elevation retrievals from the observed photon cloud. Here, we investigate possible sources of uncertainty associated with monochromatic visible light scattering in subsurface snow, which may affect the precision and accuracy of elevation estimates. We also explore the capacity to estimate snow grain size in near surface snow using experimental visible light laser data obtained in laboratory experiments.",

Geochemical and textural observations have failed to fully elucidate the origin and history of the olivine crystals; however, little research attention has been devoted to their crystallographic orientations within the metal matrix. Klosterman and Buseck [1] found no crystallographic preferred orientation of olivine in nine pallasites, but the Leitz five-axis universal stage method imposed limitations on precision (estimated within ∼4◦) and sample size (only 10 crystals were measured in the Springwater pallasite, for instance). Using Electron Backscatter Diffraction, we have collected crystallographic orientation data (accurate to ±0.5◦ [2]) for 343 crystals within ∼65 cm2 sample surface from Springwater. Though no global crystallographic preferred orientation exists, very low misorientations are observed among [100] axes of olivine crystals within specific texturally-defined domains. Combined with our thorough characterization of large-scale Springwater textures, the definitively non-random spatial distribution of olivine orientations reveals the nature of the olivine’s initial formation environment as well as the sequence of events subsequent to metal incorporation.\n[1] Klosterman and Buseck. 1973.

            "abstract": "Temporal and spatial variations of streamflow, stream temperature, groundwater recharge/discharge areas, and groundwater temperature are primarily controlled by localized climatic conditions within watersheds. Many watershed components, including stream/groundwater exchanges, can be tracked using temperature patterns, and due to the hydrologic information gained through the use of temperature monitoring, the USGS has increasingly included continuous (15 minute) stream temperature data along with continuous stream stage (elevation) at many streamgages nationwide over the past 25 years. To advance the localized understanding of recharge and discharge patterns near streams, the use of continuous water-temperature monitoring was extended to include the groundwater component of hydrologic systems with the development of USGS Groundwater Streamgage (Eddy-Miller et al., 2012, USGS Fact Sheet 2012-3054). The necessary and sufficient parameters of a basic USGS Groundwater Streamgage are: stream stage, stream temperature, groundwater elevation and groundwater temperature (\nhttp://wy-mt.water.usgs.gov/projects/ogw/index.htm\n), with availability for add-on parameters (e.g., electrical conductivity) as appropriate. The ability to evaluate stream and groundwater hydrographs simultaneously with their thermographs permits detailed analysis of continuous stream exchanges with nearby groundwater, and for example, if a specific stream reach is a groundwater discharge or recharge area on a specific day or over a seasonal or on a decadal scale. There are numerous case-specific advantages available using this four-parameter approach in watersheds; for example, determination whether a rise in the water table is induced by increases in overpressure or rather by groundwater recharge may be determined by analyzing whether the corresponding groundwater temperature changes, which indicates groundwater recharge. Several visual examples are provided to detail methods in which USGS Groundwater Streamgages utilize stream and groundwater temperature in tandem with stream and groundwater elevation to enhance our hydrologic understanding in watersheds, with a clear potential for analyzing impacts of land-use change or climate change on the hydrology of watersheds.",

            "abstract": "The topography of southern and eastern Africa (referred to as the African Superswell by Nyblade and Robinson, 1994) is anomalously high (> 900m) relative to central and west Africa, and also to other continents. The southern tip of Africa is surrounded by passive margins and mid ocean ridges as a result of continental rifting (early Jurassic in the east, late Jurassic in the west) and Gondwana break up. Recent studies have also identified the Earth's largest low seismic velocity anomaly in the mid-lower mantle beneath southern Africa and catalysed interest in the role the interactions between surface and deep processes play in generating large scale topography. Understanding how the relief evolved since rifting onset is fundamental to advancing knowledge about the coupling between deep tectonics and dynamic topography. Such a large scale topographic feature may also have important impact on atmosphere circulation and precipitations patterns. The complexity of such a system requires an integrated approach looking at interactions between tectonics and surface processes on a range of spatial and temporal scales. We use high-resolution numerical experiments coupling a 2D upper-mantle-scale thermo-mechanical model with a plan-form 2D surface processes model (SPM) to investigate the factors controlling the style of deformation. The experiments consist in simple extension models involving lithosphere with variable thickness (normal-like lithosphere to thick cratonic-like lithosphere) and explore the effects of rheological and compositional variability of the layer components of the crust and the lithosphere. Tomography and geochemistry evidences suggest a possible counterflow in the lower lithosphere in parts of the African western margins. We discuss the effect of a gravitationally driven lithospheric counterflow of depleted lower lithosphere (compositionally less dense than sublithospheric mantle) on the rift geometry and the effect of the isostatic responses in terms of uplift or subsidence on the surrounding topography. We explore a range of erosion, deposition, basin filling scenarios and compare the predictions to estimates derived from modelling of thermochronological data (Apatite Fission Track ages (AFT) and U-Th/He ages(Ahe)) and sediment budgets offshore.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of zeta potential are typically obtained using crushed samples and commercial zetameters at ionic strength <1M. However, many natural brines have much higher salinity. This study reports zeta potential values interpreted from streaming potential measurements in two intact carbonate rock samples as a function of brine salinity (up to 5M) and potential determining ions (PDIs: Ca, Mg, SO4). The two samples appear to be identical pure carbonates in XRD analysis but differ in age and provenance.\nFor low salinity NaCl brines (<1M), in which the initial PDI concentration was established during pre-equilibration with the rock samples, the measured (negative) zeta potential decreased in magnitude with increasing NaCl concentration, consistent with published data and reflecting contraction of the electrical double layer. At higher NaCl salinity (>1M) the surface charge polarity was inverted for one rock sample, yet equilibrium Ca and Mg concentrations remained constant (c. 1.3x10-3 and 7x10-5M respectively) and similar for both samples, regardless of NaCl salinity. We suggest charge inversion was caused by differences in SO4 concentration (3x10-4 versus 1.2x10-3M) in the two samples after equilibration.\nAt higher and externally controlled concentrations of Ca (0.1 – 0.42M), the zeta potential was less affected by NaCl salinity and pCa was the dominant control, although the role of SO4 in distinguishing between rock samples remained valid. The iso-electric point was different for the two samples (pCa 1.7 versus 0.5) and lower than any previously published values. Our results suggest that small differences in PDI concentration may invert surface charge polarity at high NaCl concentration; moreover, trace amounts of anhydrite or other minerals that yield aqueous SO4 can significantly modify surface charge in carbonates that otherwise appear identical. These results are important when interpreting the streaming component of SP measurements in carbonates.",

            "abstract": "Northern Chile was described as a seismic gap due to the lack of large seismicity in more than a 100 years. Recently, another large subduction earthquake (Mw 8.1) released part of the accumulated energy in the area. Due to the anticipation produced by this activity, a large seismological network deployed at the site successfully recorded this event. This network is composed by a wide variety of instruments, ranging from strong-motion accelerograms, broadbands, and continuous GPS. This wide variety of instruments enabled a detailed study of this large event, as well as the precursory activity and subsequent aftershock events. This enormously rich database has been used to detect repeating earthquakes, interpreted as aseismic slip along the plate boundary and strongly linked to large subduction earthquakes. In the present study, we search for repeating events in the plate boundary, as well as within the subducting slab (intermediate-depth intraplate earthquakes) using reported clusters in the area, previously identified with standard techniques, extending the observational time window to ~2008. We use a methodology successfully applied to interplate events in this area: using the clusters’ waveforms as a template, we search for repeating events in the continuous data. We believe that these findings will improve our current knowledge of the seismic sequences of large interplate and intermediate-depth intraplate earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The continental shelf off Charleston, South Carolina is the site of an on-going project to understand fluid flow and geochemical budgets across the seafloor over a broad area of typical passive margin. The continental shelf of the east coast of the United States is commonly incised with paleochannels, sub. The paleochannel fill consists of a lithology and permeability distinct from the surrounding material, changing the rate of submarine groundwater discharge across these features. We have visually described 13 cores from 0.5 to 6.5 meters in length and sampled and tested for permeability and grain size using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer and a permeameter. Each core is at the intersection of two perpendicular 0.5-10 kHz chirp lines covering about 220 sq km to about 14 kilometers offshore. The chirp lines are spaced about every 5.5 kilometers perpendicular to shore and about 4.5 kilometers parallel to shore. The chirp data define the entire extent of the channels and the volume of the infill.\nComparison of a sediment core in a paleochannel with a core directly adjacent suggests much higher permeability in the channel. Both cores have shelly gravel on the seafloor, but layer outside the channel is 1.3 m thick while in the channel there is a thin veneer of gravel. The channel fill has a 3 meter thick layer of coarse arenite sand. The core outside the channel has a 1.7 meter thick layer of silty sand interbedded with thin silt layers above a 0.8 meter thick layer of muddy shell hash. A layer of massive brown mud at the bottom of the core that in the channel is 3.2 meters thick and outside of the channel is 1.9 meters thick acts as a basal confining unit.\nFuture work will provide an estimate of the influence of paleochannels on the flow across the seafloor on a passive continental shelf by using these data to constrain numerical groundwater flow models.",

            "abstract": "Lakes integrate landscape processes and climate conditions. Most of the permanently ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica are closed basin, receiving glacial melt water from streams for 10-12 weeks per year. Lake levels rise during the austral summer are balanced by sublimation of ice covers (year-round) and evaporation of open water moats (summer only). Vertical profiles of water temperature have been measured in three lakes in Taylor Valley since 1988. Up to 2002, lake levels were dropping, ice covers were thickening, and total heat contents were decreasing. These lakes have been gaining heat since the mid-2000s, at rates as high as 19.5x1014 cal/decade). Since 2002, lake levels have risen substantially (as much as 2.5 m), and ice covers have thinned (1.5 m on average). Analyses of lake ice thickness, meteorological conditions, and stream water heat loads indicate that the main source of heat to these lakes is from latent heat released when ice-covers form during the winter. An aditional source of heat to the lakes is water inflows from streams and direct glacieal melt. Mean lake temperatures in the past few years have stabilized or cooled, despite increases in lake level and total heat content, suggesting increased direct inflow of meltwater from glaciers. These results indicate that McMurdo Dry Valley lakes are sensitive indicators of climate processes in this polar desert landscape and demonstrate the importance of long-term data sets when addressing the effects of climate on ecosystem processes.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding problem effecting paleoclimate reconstructions from borehole temperature data is related to the subsurface noise from land use changes, in particular deforestation. Here a series of model experiments were conducted to explore the effect of deforestation on subsurface temperatures. The experiments were conducted using the land surface component of the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM) forced offline with CRU corrected NCEP reanalysis data. The model was spun-up for 500 years by repeating the 1900-1931 monthly climatology. Simulated deforestation was imposed globally at 100, 99, 90, 70, and 50% of the grid cell area. Deforestation was held for 10 years and thereafter ecosystems were allowed to recover. Baseline simulations were also conducted where no deforestation occurs. By examining the difference between the deforestation and baseline simulations the effect of deforestation on various model metrics is isolated. It is found that the change in subsurface temperature depends on the competing surface energy balance effects of an increase in surface albedo and decrease in surface roughness length induced from deforestation. In once heavily forested regions the net result is an increase in the surface and subsurface temperatures. The magnitude of the thermal noise due to deforestation can reach 1 K at 23 m depth in the decades following deforestation. The results of these experiments illustrate the need to take into account deforestation when conducting borehole derived climate reconstructions.",

The DEBOT model is primarily designed for modelling of ocean flow generated by the tidal attraction of the Moon and the Sun, however it can be used for other ocean applications where the barotropic model is sufficient, for instance, a tsunami wave propagation. The model has been thoroughly tested by several different methods: 1) synthetic example which involves a tsunami-like wave propagation of an initial Gaussian depression and testing of the conservation of integral invariants, 2) a benchmark study with another barotropic model, the LSGbt model, has been performed and 3) results of realistic simulations have been compared with data from tide gauge measurements around the world. The test computations prove the validity of the numerical code and demonstrate the ability of the DEBOT model to simulate the realistic ocean tides. The DEBOT model will be principaly applied in related geophysical disciplines, for instance, in an investigation of an influence of the ocean tides on the geomagnetic field or the Earth’s rotation. A module for modelling of the secondary poloidal magnetic field generated by an ocean flow is already implemented in the DEBOT model and preliminary results will be presented.

            "abstract": "The integration of kinetic effects in global fluid models is a grand challenge in space plasma physics, and has implication for our ability to model space weather in collisionless plasma environments such as the Earth's magnetosphere. We propose an extensible multi-fluid moment model, with focus on the physics of magnetic reconnection. This model evolves the full Maxwell equations, and simultaneously moments of the Vlasov-Maxwell equation for each species in the plasma. Effects like the Hall effect, the electron inertia, and the pressure gradient are self-consistently embedded in the resulting multi-fluid moment equations, without the need to explicitly solving a generalized Ohm's law. Two limits of the multi-fluid moment model are discussed, namely, the five-moment limit that evolves a scalar pressure for each species, and the ten-moment limit that evolves the full anisotropic, non-gyrotropic pressure tensor. Particularly, the five-moment model reduces to the widely used Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (Hall MHD) model under the assumptions of vanishing electron inertia, infinite speed of light, and quasi-neutrality. In this presentation, we first compare ten-moment and fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of a large scale Harris sheet reconnection problem, where the ten-moment equations are closed with a local linear collisionless approximation for the heat flux. The ten-moment simulation gives reasonable agreement with the PIC results, regarding the structures and magnitudes of the electron flows, the polarities and magnitudes of elements of the electron pressure tensor, and the decomposition of the generalized Ohm’s law. Preliminary results of application of the multi-fluid moment model to Ganymede are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Examination of radiative forcing (RF), a key measure of changes in the energy balance of the Earth, facilitates understanding of the role of various drivers of climate change. For short-lived compounds, the RF can be highly inhomogeneous geographically. The relationship between the spatial patterns of RF and climate response is poorly characterized, however. Here we examine the relationship between RF and surface temperature response in the latest generation of climate models. We find that the geographic distribution of historical changes in aerosol and ozone RF strongly influences the response, leading to substantial regional differences with respect to the response to quasi-uniform well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG). In particular, the response in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics and tropics follows the forcing in those regions fairly closely. There is a stronger global sensitivity to historical aerosol plus ozone RF than to WMGHG RF with equivalent global mean value, as noted previously [D T Shindell, 2014] and a stronger response in much of the NH extratropics, especially in and downwind of industrialized areas. The enhanced response is shown to be particularly large over land plus polar ocean areas, where transient response occurs more rapidly and strong snow and ice albedo feedbacks operate. This response is not attributable to greater forcing over those regions, but rather appears to reflect a broad sensitivity of NH extratropical land areas to NH extratropical forcing. The models show substantial diversity in the enhancement of land+polar ocean response to aerosols plus ozone relative to WMGHG, and for ocean response some models show reduced sensitivity to aerosols plus ozone (though the multi-model mean shows an enhancement), suggesting that different representations of land and ocean adjustment timescales and regional heat transport contribute greatly to the differences in response to inhomogeneous forcing. In addition, areas with greatest variation across the CMIP5 models’ simulations of historical surface temperature change are shown to correspond in most cases with areas where aerosol+ozone forcing has enhanced impact, suggesting that better characterization of those forcings could play an important role in improving modeling of regional climate change.",

            "abstract": "This study demonstrates that the spaceborne Aquarius instrument is able to monitor the sea surface salinity (SSS) variations in the East China Sea (ECS), where routine observations are difficult. The two geophysical contaminants enter the sidelobes of the Aquarius antenna and bias the coastal SSS low: the emission from the land surface and the radiofrequency interference (RFI). Away from about one Aquarius pixel (150 km) from the coastline, the Aquarius SSS is fairly insensitive (less than about 0.2 psu) to the radiometric details of the method to correct for the land emission. The ascending orbits appear to be affected by unfiltered RFI much less than the descending tracks. The Aquarius SSS along the ascending tracks is low over the ECS by 0.40 to 0.93 psu (with respect to the in situ data during the two separate 7-day periods) and is biased low by 0.41 to 1.07 psu (accuracy, or the time-mean of difference from the regional model along three Aquarius tracks over a 18-month period). The presence of the ascending and descending differences in the Aquarius SSS, and the spatially widespread bias suggest that the bias is attributed to the unfiltered RFI originating from strong point sources (rather than to the land contamination from weak distributed sources, or to other seasonally-varying geophysical contaminants). Despite the bias, the Aquarius data describe well the temporal and spatial variability of the ECS SSS. The temporal trend and magnitude of salinity changes agree remarkably between Aquarius and a regional numerical model, during both the freshwater discharge season from the Yangtze river and the rest of the year. The river discharge rate correlates with the Aquarius SSS with the coefficient of 0.71 on a seasonal scale with the discharge leading the SSS changes. The Aquarius SSS increases away from the coast, in response to the river outflow. The interannual changes in the Aquarius SSS capture the effect of the regional drought in summer 2013.\nKim et al., in revision: Sea surface salinity variability in the East China Sea observed by the Aquarius, J.

We investigate the response of a zonally symmetric atmosphere to robust land-sea surface warming contrast using two global circulation models (GCMs): Non-hydrostatic Icosahedral Model (NIM) and Global and Regional Integrated Model system (GRIMs). NIM is a Finite-volume icosahedral model developed as a next-generation operational model at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA ESRL). Full model physics were taken from Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) physics suite. GRIMs is a spectral model which has been developed in Korea (Hong et al., 2013, APJAS). It has flexibility for selection of comparable physics options with NIM.\nTwo sets of experiments are designed: one is the control experiment with zonally-symmetric distributions with maxima at the equator and varying off-equatorial temperature gradients on ocean and land. The other experiment will impose the land/sea warming ratio of 1.5. Since two models can be set up with identical physics parameterizations, general consensus on responses and model-dependent feedback can be suggested.",

The development of predictive models that can more accurately represent NAPL dissolution dynamics is desirable for evaluating source longevity, remediation efficiency and risk assessment. In this study, we develop a conceptual approach to relate NAPL dissolution to variations of groundwater flux in the NAPL source zone. The approach is based on the idea that the source zone NAPL mass discharge into the aqueous phase is directly related to the temporal variation of NAPL source zone groundwater flux. The NAPL source dynamics including source zone concentrations, reduction in the NAPL mass discharge to the aqueous phase, reduction in the NAPL mass in the source zone can be effectively related. We use power law and rational forms of NAPL source zone water flux to represent a range of potential variations of groundwater flux. The developed models can predict how NAPL source zone characteristics changes with time, which can be used in modeling subsequent fate and transport. The models developed have already taken into account the requirement of NAPL mass conservation. Based on the developed models, we discuss how NAPL source zone concentrations, NAPL mass discharge, and remaining NAPL mass in the source zone are inter-related.",

The divergent or congruent response of ecosystem processes such as Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Respiration (R) hold important implications for atmospheric accumulation of CO2, as the net difference, or Net-Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), is the signal observed within the atmosphere. The turn-of-the-century drought has recently been highlighted as a test-case for the effect of water availability (as measured through evaporative fraction) on the current carbon dioxide sink that constitutes the western U.S. Here we leverage eddy co-variance FLUXNET observational data and expand on previous analyses to include observed ecosystem carbon flux response to surface air temperature, downwelling short-wave flux and evaporative fraction, as all three co-occur during drought, but the severity and duration of water availability and surface air temperature can vary significantly. The result is a comparison to previous ecosystem response analyses and an extrapolation to the more recent 2012 drought.",

Waves with frequencies in the ULF range are understood to play an important role in loss and acceleration of energetic particles. We are investigating the contributions from perturbations in both the magnetic and the electric fields in driving radial diffusion of charged particles and wish to probe two unanswered questions about ULF wave driven radial transport. First, how important are the fluctuations in the magnetic field compared with the fluctuations in the electric field in driving radial diffusion? Second, how does ULF wave power distribution in azimuth affect radial diffusion? Analytic treatments of the diffusion coefficients generally assume uniform distribution of power in azimuth but in situ measurements suggest otherwise. We present results from a study using the electric and magnetic field measurements from the Van Allen Probes to estimate the radial diffusion coefficients as a function of L and Kp. During the lifetime of the RBSP mission to date, there has been a dearth of solar activity. This compels us to consider Kp as the only time and activity dependent parameter instead of solar wind velocity and pressure.",

            "abstract": "The Seal Beach wetlands (SBW) are located along strike of the Newport-Inglewood fault zone (NIFZ), where fault geometry is poorly understood. However, the fault steps to the right in the SBW, and oil well and seismological studies indicate that the northeast segment of the fault is down-dropped as a result of oblique-normal slip. The location is significant because coseismic subsidence could alter tidal and/or fluvial processes within the SBW. Such a change should be recorded in the stratigraphy by sudden changes in grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and/or diatom assemblages. Based on field observations of 48 reconnaissance gouge cores and multi-proxy analyses of three vibracores and one piston core, we identify four stratigraphic units in the SBW: (1) very fine to fine sand from 426-350 cm; (2) organic-rich mud from 350-225 cm; (3) fine to coarse silt and clay from 225-100 cm; and (4) organic-rich mud with interbedded mud laminae from 100-0 cm. We interpret unit 2 to represent a relic marsh surface that subsided coseismically and was preserved under unit 3. We analyzed 38 sediment samples for diatoms from vibracore SB002VC to test this idea and characterize the depositional environment of stratigraphic units 4, 3, and 2. The diatom data suggest unit 4 is an intertidal deposit, unit 3 is a fresh/slightly brackish water deposit, and unit 2 is an intertidal deposit. Units 2 and 3 are separated by a sharp, irregular contact. Thus, the diatom data and depositional contact from vibracore SB002VC are consistent with a relic marsh surface subsiding abruptly during an earthquake on the NIFZ. As a result of the earthquake, the intertidal environment abruptly changed to an environment dominated by fresh to slightly brackish water. We hypothesize that the earthquake did not result in flooding by seawater because coseismic uplift of the southwest segment of the NIFZ temporarily isolated the SBW from tidal influence. Radiocarbon dates constrain this event to no more than 1957 cal yr BP. Future work will include Cs-137/Pb-210 dating of unit 4 and pollen analysis in units 3 and 2, additional radiocarbon dating and completing grain size analysis of vibracore SB002VC.",

They lead to most magnetosphere-ionosphere disturbances (i.e., PBIs, streamers, substorms), and significantly affect substorm expansion phase activity. Using radar and all-sky-imager observations, we have identified weak, azimuthally moving auroral features near the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval. We find that they are associated with large azimuthal flow bursts in the SAPS region, and we find evidence that they originate from tail flow bursts that are guided to the SAPS by the large-scale evening side convection. This suggests that, in addition to the well-established effects, some tail flow bursts may flow around the Harang reversal and reach the subauroral region of the inner magnetosphere without breaking or bouncing, leading to SAID-like flow enhancements in the SAPS region. We also have preliminary evidence that some of these flow bursts can extend earthward of the pre-existing SAPS region, leading to ring current earthward injections, proton aurora, and EMIC waves that are important for radiation belt electron loss.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater harmful algal blooms are occurring with increasing frequency worldwide, intensifying the need for deeper understanding of the processes driving bloom formation. Such understanding is a prerequisite for developing management strategies for limiting bloom occurrence. Unfortunately, however, data for developing robust predictive models of bloom formation are lacking. Even in the well-studied Lake Erie, where diatom and cyanobacteria blooms have occurred for several decades in the Western Basin, previous in-situ and remote-sensing data collection efforts have been hampered by spatial and temporal sampling limitations, resulting in a sparse historical record. Leveraging available data to expand the historical record of algal blooms would thus make it possible to better evaluate hypotheses about factors influencing bloom formation.\nIn this work, remotely-sensed observations of phytoplankton obtained using LANDSAT imagery are presented for 1984-2011. Several phytoplankton detection algorithms based on LANDSAT 5 imagery are evaluated during the period also covered by MERIS (2002-2011), which offers a relatively detailed assessment of bloom occurrence over the last decade. The best algorithm is then applied to historical LANDSAT data, and results are used to obtain new information about historical conditions and assess implications for developing improved models of bloom formation.\nEstimates of historical bloom occurrence and bloom seasonality shed new light on the widely-held view that phosphorus controls and invasive mussels resulted in substantial bloom reductions in the early 1990s. The new estimated records are not consistent with limited in-situ phytoplankton measurements from that period, and provide additional information on bloom occurrence during years with little to no supporting literature. This work demonstrates the potential to unearth new insights about historical phytoplankton blooms in Lake Erie, as well as in freshwater lakes broadly, and is a step forward in supporting efforts to prepare for, and ultimately prevent, future blooms of harmful algae.",

The experiments were designed to test our hypothesis of methane oxidation as a communal function, with the specific contents of the communities being determined by environmental factors such as oxygen concentration and the nature of the nitrogen source. We first measure taxonomic compositions of long-term oxygenated enrichment cultures and determine that, while dominated by Methylococcaceae bacteria, these cultures also contain accompanying types belonging to a limited number of bacterial taxa, both methylotrophs and non-methylotrophs. We then follow with the short-term community dynamics, under different oxygen tension regimens (‘high’ to ‘low’), different nitrogen source regimens (added nitrate versus no nitrate) and different temperature ranges (10 to 30 oC). We observe rapid loss of species diversity in all incubations, but the composition of the communities depends on the specific environmental factors. Methylobacter represents the major methane-oxidizing partner in the communities incubated at low temperatures while Methylomonas and Methylocystis are more competitive at higher temperatures. All methanotrophs respond positively to nitrate. The non-methanotroph members of the communities reveal different trajectories in response to different oxygen tensions over time, with Methylotenera species persisting under ‘low’ and Methylophilus species persisting under ‘high’ oxygen tensions. Metagenomic sequencing reveals successions of different types of the major methane-oxidizing species as well as accompanying species. These types differ in their physiological details such as central carbon meand nitrate metabolism. A broad range of denitrifying capabilities in the organisms forming these stable methane-oxidizing communities is evident from genomic analysis. Our results support prior observations on distribution of carbon from methane among diverse bacterial populations and support the hypothesis of community function in cycling. Our data also suggest that oxygen and nitrate may simultaneously serve as electron acceptors during metabolism of methane.",

            "abstract": "Clumped- and site-specific isotopic compositions of organic compounds can constrain their formation temperatures, sources, and chemical reaction histories. The large number of isotopologues of organic molecules may allow for the isotopic composition of a single compound to illuminate many processes. For example, it is possible that clumping or site specific effects in different parts of the same molecule will differ in blocking temperature, such that a molecule’s full isotopic structure could simultaneously constrain conditions of biosynthesis, catagenic ‘cracking’, and storage in the crust.\nRecent innovations in high-resolution mass spectrometry and methods of IR and NMR spectroscopy make it possible to explore these questions. Methane is the first organic molecule to have its clumped isotope geochemistry analyzed in a variety of natural environments and controlled experiments. Methane generated through catagenic cracking of kerogen and other organic matter forms in equilibrium with respect to isotopic clumping, and preserves that state through later storage or migration, up to temperatures of ~250 ˚C. This kinetic behavior permits a variety of useful geological applications. But it is unexpected because the bulk stable isotope composition of thermogenic methane is thought to reflect kinetic isotope effects on irreversible reactions. Our observations imply a new interpretation of the chemical physics of catagenic methane formation.\nAdditional instrument and methods developments are currently extending the measurement of isotopic clumping and position specific effects to larger alkanes, other hydrocarbon compounds, and amino acids. These measurements will ultimately expand our capacity to understand the formational conditions and fates of organic molecules in high- and low-temperature environments through geological time.",

            "abstract": "This study aimed to reconstruct paleotemperatures through Mg/Ca ratio in Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerina bulloides using the laser ablation and ICP-MS technique (LA-ICP-MS) in a core sampled from a western boundary upwelling system. The mean Mg/Ca ratio from the last three chambers was measured in seven tests of G. ruber and G. bulloides .Paleotemperatures were reconstructed using the equations of Anand et al (2003) for G. ruber and Mashiotta et al. (1999) for G. bulloides. The last chamber from G. ruber recorded Mg/Ca values which temperatures varied between 19 and 22°C. The temperatures obtained from the last chamber were lower than from the others two chambers, which temperatures varied between 24 and 26°C. This difference suggests the specie migrate to cold deeper waters during the calcification of the last chamber. It indicates that reconstructions based on the last chamber confronted with the mean of others two chambers could be used to estimate past water stratification. The Mg/Ca values of G. bulloides were not so different among the chambers, generating paleotemperatures between 18 and 22°C. However, G. bulloides’s individual variation coefficient was higher (14 – 48%) than G. ruber (12 – 28%), indicating the specie tolerates higher thermic amplitude due to its behavior related to searching by food. Cold surface waters and warmer sub-surface waters occurred between 9.0 and 7.2 kyr BP and the opposite occurring after 7.2 ka BP. The G. bulloides’s estimated cold episodes were marked before 8,0 ka BP, between 6.0 and 5.5 kyr BP, between 4.5 and 4.0 kyr BP and after 2.0 ka BP, which could be associated to upwelling intensity. The divergence of G. bulloides and G. ruber’s last chamber paleotemperatures suggest the species may not inhabit during the same time, which demands caution in stratification reconstructions based on these two species.",

The HadGEM3-RA is a regional version of the newly developed HadGEM3 global model and the HadRM3P is based on the earlier HadCM3 global model. The RCMs simulations were carried out at 0.44o x 0.44o degree resolution over South America-CORDEX domain for the period 1989-2008. The initial and boundary conditions were provided by ERA-Interim Reanalysis data available at 6-h intervals with a resolution of 1.5o x 1.5o in the horizontal and 37 pressure levels. We compare the results against a number of observational datasets, including gridded dataset of CRU, UDEL, TRMM and GPCP. Moreover, available station data is derived from Direccion General de Aguas (DGA) mainly for Central Chile, which is the heartland of Chile with the highest population and important economic activities. The analysis is mainly focused on evaluating the abilities of the RCMs in simulating spatial pattern and ENSO related precipitation variability in different subregions of South America-CORDEX domain. In general, both RCMs have a good skill in reproducing spatial pattern and annual cycle of observed precipitation in climatically different subregions. However, both RCMs tend to underestimate precipitation in the Amazon Basin, which is more pronounced in the HadRM3P simulations. On the contrary, the RCMs tend to overestimate the precipitation over the Andes and southern Chile. The overestimation could be related to the physical core of the RCMs, but the discrepancies could also arise due to insufficient station network, especially in the mountainous areas, potentially yielding smaller precipitation quantities in the observed data than the true ones. In terms of interannual variability, the models capture ENSO related wet and dry interannual precipitation anomalies with some differences in the magnitude of precipitation. The study will be also extended with evaluation the ability of the RCMs and driving fields to simulate large-scale atmospheric fields in order to understand the biases in the regional simulations. Moreover, intercomparison of other South America-CORDEX simulations will be also included.",

Much of the lower Walker River is impaired for native aquatic species because of elevated stream temperatures and nutrients, and low streamflow and dissolved oxygen levels. We deployed a 1 kilometer single-ended fiber-optic Raman spectra distributed temperature sensing (DTS) cable in the Wabuska drain outlet and surrounding Walker River for one week in June 2014 to improve fine-scale understanding of stream temperatures. These data identify and quantify thermal variability of micro-habitat that standard temperature monitoring and modeling do not capture. Results indicate stream temperatures exceeded 26°C and a return flow channel exhibited greater thermal variability with both warmer daytime temperatures and cooler nighttime temperatures – possibly providing more complex thermal habitat during some flow conditions. Fine-scale DTS data complement ongoing stream temperature modeling by bounding thermal variability within model reaches that are 250 m long and where stream temperature is assumed to be well-mixed within each reach.",

            "abstract": "Erosion microcosms are devices commonly used to investigate the erosion and transport characteristics of sediments at the bed of rivers, lakes, or estuaries. In order to understand the results these devices provide, the bed shear stress and flow field need to be accurately described. In this research, the UMCES Gust Erosion Microcosm System (U-GEMS) is numerically modeled using Finite Volume Method. The primary aims are to simulate the bed shear stress distribution at the surface of the sediment core/bottom of the microcosm, and to validate the U-GEMS produces uniform bed shear stress at the bottom of the microcosm. The mathematical model equations are solved by on a Cartesian non-uniform grid. Multiple numerical runs were developed with different input conditions and configurations.\nPrior to developing the U-GEMS model, the General Moving Objects (GMO) model and different momentum algorithms in the code were verified. Code verification of these solvers was done via simulating the flow inside the top wall driven square cavity on different mesh sizes to obtain order of convergence. The GMO model was used to simulate the top wall in the top wall driven square cavity as well as the rotating disk in the U-GEMS. Components simulated with the GMO model were rigid bodies that could have any type of motion. In addition cross-verification was conducted as results were compared with numerical results by Ghia et al. (1982), and good agreement was found. Next, CFD results were validated by simulating the flow within the conventional microcosm system without suction and injection. Good agreement was found when the experimental results by Khalili et al. (2008) were compared. After the ability of the CFD solver was proved through the above code verification steps. The model was utilized to simulate the U-GEMS. The solution was verified via classic mesh convergence study on four consecutive mesh sizes, in addition to that Grid Convergence Index (GCI) was calculated and based on that the computation uncertainty was quantified. The numerical results reveal that the bed shear stress distribution for the U-GEMS model was not uniform. The mean and standard deviation of the bed shear stress for the U-GEMS model was 0.04 and 0.019 Pa respectively.",

            "abstract": "Foredune morphology is often described in storm impact prediction models using the elevation of the dune crest and dune toe and compared with maximum runup elevations to categorize the storm impact and predicted responses. However, these parameters do not account for other foredune features that may make them more or less erodible, such as alongshore variations in morphology, vegetation coverage, or compaction. The goal of this work is to identify other descriptive features that can be extracted from terrestrial lidar data that may affect the rate of dune erosion under wave attack. Daily, mobile-terrestrial lidar surveys were conducted during a 6-day nor’easter (Hs = 4 m in 6 m water depth) along 20km of coastline near Duck, North Carolina which encompassed a variety of foredune forms in close proximity to each other. This abstract will focus on the tools developed for the automated extraction of the morphological features from terrestrial lidar data, while the response of the dune will be presented by Brodie and Spore as an accompanying abstract.\nRaw point cloud data can be dense and is often under-utilized due to time and personnel constraints required for analysis, since many algorithms are not fully automated. In our approach, the point cloud is first projected into a local coordinate system aligned with the coastline, and then bare earth points are interpolated onto a rectilinear 0.5 m grid creating a high resolution digital elevation model. The surface is analyzed by identifying features along each cross-shore transect. Surface curvature is used to identify the position of the dune toe, and then beach and berm morphology is extracted shoreward of the dune toe, and foredune morphology is extracted landward of the dune toe. Changes in, and magnitudes of, cross-shore slope, curvature, and surface roughness are used to describe the foredune face and each cross-shore transect is then classified using its pre-storm morphology for storm-response analysis.",

            "abstract": "In many arid regions, including parts of California, a common pattern of groundwater use is to cultivate crops needing high levels of irrigation annually and accept unsustainable drawdown of groundwater levels in the near term. Reducing current pumping rates to create a protected reserve of groundwater could produce an economic benefit by mitigating the high cost of future droughts. The objective of our investigation is to quantify the economic benefits of reducing current pumping rates to protect groundwater as a backup irrigation source for long-term conditions. We describe the development and use of an integrated model of aquifer pumping, surface-water use, and economic conditions to identify economic values of groundwater protection as a drought mitigation measure. An optimization framework is developed using GAMS software to investigate conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and to solve an integrated economic model of crop irrigation and production. Data requirements for the analysis include precipitation, aquifer recharge, crop water requirements, size of groundwater reserve, surface water supplies, and economic factors such as crop prices, pumping costs and efficiency, and yields for selected crops. Our results indicate that economic values of groundwater reserve protection increase with future higher prices of crops and reduced costs of production. These economic values also increase with potential reductions in streamflows from future drought and climate variability that could raise the cost of irrigated agriculture. Results from the integrated GAMS optimization model are comparable to those obtained from simulations of the same conditions performed with MODFLOW-GWM software.",

            "abstract": "Gravity anomalies at subduction zones and the degree of megathrust locking inverted from geodetic data have been individually correlated with coseismic asperities ruptured by great earthquakes. The time-scale of both observables varies from millions of years in the case of gravity to years for geodetic locking. Since the relationship between these different proxies of plate coupling has not been established, it is unclear whether megathrust asperities are permanent or transient features, and therefore the combined use of these proxies for seismic hazard assessment remains problematic. Here we show that the area ruptured by the April 1st 2014 Mw8.2 Pisagua/Iquique earthquake at the Central Andean subduction zone coincides with an anomalous region of the northern Chile seismic gap where the degree of preseismic fault locking was much larger than what could be expected from the value of its gravity anomaly. Preseismic locking and coseismic slip were inverted from GPS observations using a finite element approach with a realistic slab geometry derived from a 3D density model. The same model was used to compute the slab gravity effect that was subtracted from a global geopotential model (EGM2008) in order to obtain a residual gravity anomaly due to lateral variations of forearc density structure. We suppose that locking and gravity must be positively correlated as could be inferred if regions of low/high forearc density would induce small/large vertical stresses on the megathrust. We found that the location of the main coseismic slip patch almost perfectly matches a region of anomalously high locking compared with its gravity anomaly. This result favors a conceptual model where regions of low gravity anomaly are caused by a low-density forearc that imposes a low normal stress loading the megathrust, which promotes a conditionally-stable frictional regime. Under this regime the megathrust creeps aseismically during certain time after a great earthquake but can eventually lock and start building up elastic strain during years or decades before its coseismic release.

            "abstract": "The goals of this work are to probe how mantle lithosphere discontinuity structure varies beneath the cratonic terranes of the northern U.S. and to relate this structure to the processes that created and modified the cratonic mantle. Our region samples the Archean Wyoming, Medicine Hat and Superior cratons, and the Proterozoic terranes that lie between them. We imaged the mantle using Sp phases recorded by permanent and temporary seismic networks, including EarthScope’s Transportable Array. Sp receiver functions for individual waveforms were obtained by extended time multi-taper deconvolution, and migrated into a 3D volume using common conversion point stacking, a spline representation of phase Fresnel zones, and 3D models for crust and mantle structure. The stack was bootstrapped.\nIn the cratonic mantle, we observe multiple mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs) that are characterized by three types of structures: a relatively continuous negative discontinuity (velocity decrease with depth) that lies in the 65-100 km depth range; deeper negative MLDs (80-145 km) that are more discontinuous and intermittent; and occasional positive MLDs at the greatest depths (>125 km). In contrast to the tectonically active western U.S., beneath cratonic regions we typically do not observe a strong negative discontinuty at the base of the tomographically-defined lithosphere, indicating that the transition to asthenospheric properties is gradual.\nThe MLDs indicate strong layering in the cratonic mantle lithosphere. In multiple cases, one negative discontinuity dips below another, consistent with a slab of lithosphere imbricated beneath pre-existing cratonic mantle. One of the clearest examples is a north-dipping phase at depths of 80-130 km beneath the Cheyenne Belt, the suture between the Wyoming Craton and the accreted Proterozoic terranes to its south. In Sept. 2013, an unusual earthquake occurred within the high velocity mantle of the Wyoming craton at ~76 km, a depth that overlaps with a negative MLD. This suggests that the negative MLD coincides with a zone of mechanical weakness, for example a relict fine-grained shear zone. Overall, the negative MLDs are consistent with models in which Archean and Proterozoic cratonic mantle was at least partially formed by accretion of subducted lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost peatlands cover extensive areas in the northern circumpolar permafrost region and are important soil organic carbon reservoirs. To better understand how permafrost peatlands will respond to future climate change and assess the carbon-climate feedback as a result of permafrost thaw, more knowledge about the impact and relative importance of different meteorological parameters on ground temperatures is needed. In Tavvavuoma located in the sporadic permafrost zone in northern Sweden, meteorological parameters and ground temperatures have been monitored in a peat plateau complex since 2005. Various landscape units within the peatland have different ground temperatures. In fen deposits of drained thermokarst lakes and in lake sediments permafrost is absent. In the central part of the peat plateau permafrost is present, but close to 0 °C. Alongside a thermokarst lake shoreline, a maximum thermo-erosion rate of ~0.2 m/yr has been registered and ground subsidence of 0.5 m has taken place from 2102 to 2013. Despite a slight cooling trend in the air temperature record 2006-2012, ground temperatures at 2 m depth have increased by 0.05 °C/yr and at 6 m depth the permafrost has started to thaw from below. According to simple linear regression analyses the mean summer temperature the present and preceding year and mean annual temperature the preceding year are variables affecting the thaw depth (p<0.1). For the ground temperature at 1 m depth the number of thawing degree-days in the summer, mean summer temperature the preceding year, mean winter temperature and snow depth are possible contributing factors (p<0.2). However, it is difficult to explain why the permafrost is getting warmer despite the overall cooling trend in air temperature (2006-2012). An explanation could be that the permafrost is relict and not in equilibrium with the current climate. A long-term increase in air temperature has been recorded at surrounding meteorological stations since the mid 20th century. If the ongoing increase in ground temperature in Tavvavuoma is a result of this continuing warming trend, short-term variability in meteorological parameters can still have an impact on the rate of permafrost degradation, but unless pronounced climate cooling would take place the overall long-term thawing of the peat plateau is inevitable.",

            "abstract": "A spatially and temporally expansive record of early Cenozoic high-latitude ocean history resides in the pelagic clay of the South Pacific Gyre (SPG). At the beginning of the Cenozoic, four sites drilled during IODP Expedition 329 were located between 40-62°S, which may have been the center of an ancient polar gyre. As the Pacific Plate migrated northward, these sites were subjected to major paleoceanographic changes including the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, Australian desertification, and Southern Hemisphere volcanism.\nThe SPG sediment is homogenous brown, zeolitic, metalliferous pelagic clay. Such sediment can be challenging for paleooceanographic research due its ultrafine grain size, slow accumulation rate, post-depositional alteration, and lack of biogenic material. However, our geochemical techniques embrace the authigenic nature of SPG clay to develop a constant-Co age model and track variations in sediment origin and accumulation. By combining sedimentation patterns with backtracked site paths, we produce an unprecedented characterization of the Cenozoic paleoceanographic evolution of the SPG.\nWe analyzed 47 major, trace, REE concentrations in 206 bulk sediment samples from 7 sites across the SPG, deposited as long ago as 100 Ma. For each sample, traditional geochemical partitioning techniques, Q-mode factor analyses, and multiple linear regressions allowed us to quantify contributions of six end-members: post-Archean average Australian shale (PAAS), Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxides, apatite, biogenic Si, and two distinct types of altered volcanic ash.\nMass accumulation of the PAAS end-member increased 12-18% throughout the Cenozoic, with the most rapid increase occurring just after the mid-Miocene when Australia became more arid. The Paleogene/Neogene boundary also marks a change in sedimentation, likely caused by a change in eolian activity and/or a change in authigenic processes due to changing bottom water conditions. Contributions from one kind of altered ash decreased throughout the Cenozoic while the second kind of altered ash increased in importance. This volcanic shift reflects either a large-scale change in the source of volcanic ash and/or different alteration of ash from the same source, possibly from changes in bottom water conditions or sedimentation rate.",

            "abstract": "Southern pine forests provide many important ecosystem services, including biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and softwood timber production, which is a vital component of local economies in the American South. However, all southern pine forests are sensitive to damage from infestations of bark beetles and drought events, which can lead to declines in productivity that may cause mortality in extreme cases, and which may increase in frequency in the future due to ongoing climate change. This study explores how southern pine management for restored, old-growth like conditions, in contrast with management for timber production, affects stand scale drought response and tree resistance to bark beetle herbivory by leveraging a suite of data from a new eddy covariance flux monitoring site in a 65-year-old restored loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine forest situated in the Crossett Experimental Forest (Arkansas, USA). The sensitivity of ecosystem scale fluxes of CO2 and H2O to drought is interpreted through a synthesis with other long-running Ameriflux sites located in southern pine forests. The effects of the management regime on resin production, which is the pine trees’ main defense against beetle attacks, are assessed by comparing monthly resin flow observations collected over the course of the 2013 growing season in the restored stand and in a co-located stand of even-age planted loblolly pines managed for timber production. Results show that loblolly in the uneven-aged stand consistently produced much larger amounts of resin than loblolly in the even-aged stand, and shortleaf pines were the lowest producers throughout the growing season. No significant relationship between resin flow and diameter at breast height was observed within or across species and sites; thus, species and management effects are independent of their effect on tree size.",

            "abstract": "In [1] the first quantitative evidence of ionospheric outflows (r > 10,000 km) coming from Titan was given using the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS) data for the T9 flyby. Later in [2] similar outflows were shown for T63 and T75. In [3] evidence for ionospheric outflows for T15 was given and [4] showed evidence of outflows for T41. Normally, the CAPS IMS cannot be used to measure Titan’s relatively dense ionosphere because the IMS has high sensitivity to measure the more tenuous plasmas of Saturn’s magnetosphere and its detectors will experience count rates beyond their maximum allowed rates, therefore the IMS is configured not to measure the ionospheric plasma. But, whenever there are high altitude Titan wake flybys the ion densities are low enough so the CAPS IMS can measure these ionospheric outflows and their corresponding composition characteristic of the topside ionosphere (i.e., composition freezes in above the exobase) using its unique compositional capabilities. For example, the IMS can distinguish against specific ion types such as hydrocarbon, nitrile and water group ions due fragmentation of molecular ions within the instrument (i.e., incident ions strikes ultra-thin carbon foils at 14.6 kV or higher with exiting fragments such C+,0,-, N+,0, O+,0,-1). The other ionospheric instruments only measure the ion mass-per-charge (M/Q), while the CAPS IMS measures both the ion M/Q and its fragments. Specific attention will be given to such ions as NH4+, N+, O+, CH4+, C2H5+, HCNH+ and C3H7+. These results may impose important constraints upon Titan’s ionospheric water group, hydrocarbon and nitrile ion chemistry. Are NH4+ ions present as indicated by INMS at 1100 km altitude and/or water group ions? Our work has concentrated on the T15 flyby. Estimates of the NH4+, N+ and O+ abundances presently have upper values < 20% of the total ion density with actual abundances and their uncertainties to be given.\n[1] Sittler, E.C.

Our recent studies based on wave propagation simulations show that Born sensitivity kernels can be used in seismic tomography to account for diffractional effects in surface waves as well as body waves. In addition to direct seismic phases, teleseismic receiver functions which take advantage of secondary waves converted at seismic discontinuities can provides important constraints on discontinuity structures. In this study, we calculate finite-frequency sensitivity of receiver functions to perturbations in seismic discontinuities in the mantle transition zone. The boundary sensitivity kernels based on Born approximation are formulated in the framework of traveling-wave mode summation to account for complete wave interactions within the measurement window. The sensitivity kernels allow us to employ frequency-dependent receiver functions in tomographic inversions to map the topography of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities. We will discuss preliminary results on the structure of mantle transition zone discontinuities beneath the continental US imaged from finite-frequency receiver-function tomography using seismograms recorded at USArray TA stations.",

            "abstract": "Earth and Titan have vastly different physical environments but similar landscapes. Sand dunes, like those found in Earth’s deserts, cover large areas of Titan’s equatorial region and are important records of climate. Titan’s linear dunes and their interaction with topographic obstacles within the dune fields suggest westerly wind flow, which is opposite the easterly flow predicted from several global climate models (GCMs). This interpretation of wind direction is largely based on the notion of the dunes as streamlines that flow around the obstacles. However, the mechanics of this behavior in granular, sandy material and bimodal flows are poorly understood. We examine the interactions between linear dunes and topographic obstacles by mapping the morphology of the obstacles and nearby dunes and using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis of wind flow near obstacles.\nWe map crest line orientation, length, and spacing of the dunes using visible satellite imagery for Earth and radar imagery for Titan. Obstacles are mapped from both satellite imagery and digital terrain models (DTMs). Topographic information about the obstacles, taken from DTMs, and wind data for Earth and Titan, taken from either wind stations or GCMs, are input into a CFD model called WindNinja 2.2.0. We use the CFD model to estimate wind velocity and direction near the obstacles, calculate gross bedform normal transport, and determine dune orientations around the obstacles. Our results indicate greatest variations in wind velocity and direction for regions where wind initially strikes the topographic obstacle and uniform wind flow patterns upwind and downwind of the obstacle. The modeled dune orientations deviate greatest from the mean regional orientations around areas of elevation change. This behavior is consistent on both Earth and Titan. Identifying how dune orientations are affected by topography on Titan provides a new basis to evaluate wind directions on Titan.",

            "abstract": "Redwood trees (Sequoia sempervirens) of coastal California acquire up to a third of their annual water through direct foliar uptake from summer coastal fog. Coastal fog contains elevated concentrations of monomethylmercury (MMeHg) up to 9.8 ng/L (Weiss-Penzias et al., Geophys Res Letters, 39). MMeHg introduced by fog is concentrated in old growth redwood trees throughout their distribution along the California coast. High concentrations of MMeHg occur in living redwood needles (0.20 to 3.76 ng/g dry weight basis, dwb) and are about 2 orders of magnitude greater than typical in evergreen needles that do not receive coastal fog water. MMeHg concentration in living redwood needles changes seasonally reaching a maximum at the end of the fog season (October) and a minimum at the beginning of the fog season (March). Hg concentrations in living redwood needles range from 21.7 to 80.5 ng/g (dwb), comparable to reported values for evergreen needles from non-coastal trees. Redwoods planted in the suburban landscape inland from the coastal fog belt have considerably lower MMeHg concentrations (<0.20 ng/g) but similar Hg concentrations to redwoods in their natural coastal environment. Redwood needles die after 3 years and contain comparable concentrations of MMeHg to those in living needles from the same old growth redwoods but Hg concentrations are much higher (up to 142 ng/g) since Hg accumulates throughout the life of the needle. Stream waters in old growth redwood forests under low and high flow conditions have very low concentrations of MMeHg (<.02 ng/L). However, under high flow conditions Hg concentrations are elevated, up to 22 ng/L, compared to low flow conditions (1.3-3.15 ng/L) and in rainwater (5.4 ng/L). MMeHg concentrations in stream waters are not elevated because MMeHg is retained in redwood needles. Hg concentrations in high flow stream waters are elevated because soils developed under old growth redwoods have elevated concentrations of Hg, up to 280 ng/g (3 times background), resulting from decomposition of litter and transformation of MMeHg to Hg-humic acid complexes (79-91%), and HgS and Hgo (8-20%) as indicated by sequential selective chemical extractions. Because of the high biomass density and annual litter fall, 850 g of Hg and 23 g of MMeHg per ha are added to the redwood ecosystem over a 2000 year life span.",

            "abstract": "Depth profiles of density in modern one-dimensional seismological models of Earth’s interior appear to be inconsistent with the lower mantle convecting, at odds with compelling evidence to the contrary (e.g., estimates of Rayleigh number, and the relative lack of seismologically observed heterogeneity in the mid-mantle). This problem may stem from incorrect a priori constraints used in constructing the seismological models.\nNormal-mode frequencies and waveforms for body and surface waves only provide weak constraints on the detailed density profile at depth. Therefore, starting with PEM and including PREM and AK 135-f, models have imposed an initial constraint that Bullen’s inhomogeneity parameter η ≈ 1 (“adiabatic,” consistent with the Adams-Williamson equation) or even < 1 (“super-adiabatic”). Here η ≈ KS/KE , the ratio of isentropic bulk modulus KS to the effective dependence of density on pressure (hence depth), KE.\nDispersion between normal-mode and body-wave frequencies, a necessary consequence of seismologically observed attenuation, requires KE < KS. In addition, internal heating, as expected from radioactive decay, causes the laterally averaged temperature profile to be subadiabatic in the core of the convection cell. Dynamic overshoot further causes a local deviation toward subadiabatic gradients above and below, respectively, bottom and top thermal boundary layers. Altogether, these effects are estimated to yield η ≈ 1.1 (± 0.05) for the bulk of the convecting lower mantle.\nIn fact, the earlier models 1066A and 1066B match the normal-mode frequencies and show just this pattern, with η ≈ 1.1 (± 0.1) between 1500 and 2500 km depth. Evidently, seismological observations are consistent with a convecting lower mantle, and refined density models should be explored by assuming that the bulk of the lower mantle is suitably “sub-adiabatic.”",

            "abstract": "High-energy gravel-bed rivers are subject to a range of management practices used to control the system’s dynamic behavior. The Snake River, near Jackson, WY, offers an opportunity to study the morphological effects of management practices through a comparison of a reach confined by levees to an unmanaged reach just upstream within Grand Teton National Park (GTNP). I hypothesize that levees have reduced sediment supply by disconnecting the river from its banks and increased transport capacity by increasing flow velocity. Together, these effects accentuate the sediment deficit in the leveed reach. To test this I am developing a morphological sediment budget from GTNP to Wilson, WY, using LiDAR data from 2007 and 2012. This analysis will yield insight as to how sediment transport varies between the relatively natural reach in GTNP and the leveed reach downstream. A problem inherent to morphological budgets is the inability to decipher when change occurs within the budget timeframe. To combat this, a partial mobility study was executed using 300 PIT tagged gravels within the leveed reach. Gravels were relocated to decipher how bed mobility and sediment transport varied with grain size under a range of hydraulic conditions. These results are then used to estimate a critical discharge representing the inception of bed motion and geomorphic change. The critical discharge will be used to reconstruct the timing of bed mobility based on streamflow records and thus deconvolve when morphological change occurred during the sediment budget period. I further hypothesize that a greater imbalance between transport capacity and sediment supply in the leveed reach causes the bed to armor, resulting in larger critical shear stresses and implying that the bed will be mobilized only during greater discharge events. To test this hypothesis I will measure armor ratios within the leveed reach and examine how bed mobility differs between the two reaches by comparing the results of our partial mobility study to a previous tracer study within GTNP.",

            "abstract": "Imaging Magma Under St. Helens (iMUSH) is a collaborative project with the intention of obtaining more detailed information about the internal structure of Mount St. Helens, the most active volcano in the Cascade Arc. Combining data from a magnetotelluric survey, an active source experiment, a passive source experiment, and geochemical/petrological studies at their highest resolution will illuminate the magmatic structure beneath the volcano from surface to slab. The detail from this specific section of the arc will be used to answer broader questions about subduction zone magmatism. In June and July, 2014 we installed and serviced 70 broadband seismometers in a 50 km radius around the volcano. Having an accurate seismometer orientation is important for many applications including Ambient Noise Tomography and Receiver Functions. Since it is difficult to get an accurate orientation when installing the seismometers, the initial data were used to determine this orientation following Stachnik et. al. [Seismol. Res. Lett. 2012]. Theoretically, Rayleigh waves have an elliptical polarization and should only appear in the radial and vertical components. The horizontal components are rotated by steps through 360 degrees to find the angle that maximizes their correlation with the Hilbert transformed (90 degree phase shifted) vertical component. The difference between this angle and the back azimuth is an estimate of the sensor orientation. This is applied to earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6 and focal depths less than 50 km. For the limited data from the first service run we found orientations to be generally within 5 degrees of expected orientations. To increase statistical significance, this will be done again in October, 2014 when more data are available.",

            "abstract": "Observational studies using data from multipoint spacecraft combined with ground-based measurements are presented to understand the role of the low-frequency waves commonly observed along the Earth’s magnetopause and in the low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL). Typical physical processes occurring at the magnetopause boundary layer include Kelvin-Helmholtz waves generated by shear flows, which provide multiple paths to affect inner-magnetospheric particle density and energy fluxes. In particular, nonlinearly-developed forms of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, called Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices, generate field-aligned currents via vortical motion of plasmas that leads to a twist or magnetic shear of the flux tube. A clockwise (counter-clockwise) rotation, as viewed in the direction of the magnetic field, in association with Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices in the dusk (dawn) flank of the magnetopause leads to upward (downward) field-aligned current inside the flux tube. We present in-situ Cluster, THEMIS, and FAST spacecraft observations of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices and associated physical processes that map to the poleward edge of the auroral regions together with ground-based observations (magnetograms, riometer data, and all sky images) to link boundary fluctuations to variations of the inner magnetospheric/ionospheric phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in temperature and precipitation (hereafter climate change) would influence river discharge, but the relative importance of climate change, land use, and elevated atmospheric CO2 have not yet been fully investigated. Here we examined how river discharge in the Mississippi River basin in the 21st century might be influenced by these factors using the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model driven by atmospheric CO2, downscaled GCMs climate and land use scenarios. Our results suggest that river discharge would be substantially enhanced (10.7-59.8%) by the 2090s compared to the recent decade (2000s), though large discrepancies exist among different climate, atmospheric CO2, and land use change scenarios. Our factorial analyses further indicate that the combined effects of land use change and human-induced atmospheric CO2 elevation on river discharge would outweigh climate change effect under the high emission scenario (A2) of Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change. Our study offers the first attempt to project potential changes in river discharge in response to multiple future environmental changes. It demonstrates the importance of land use change and atmospheric CO2 concentrations in projecting future changes in hydrologic processes. The projected increase river discharge implies that riverine fluxes of carbon, nutrients and pesticide from the MRB to the coastal regions would increase in the future, and thus may influence the states of ocean acidification and hypoxia and deteriorate ocean water quality. Further efforts will also be needed to account for additional environmental factors (such as nitrogen deposition, tropospheric ozone pollution, dam construction, etc.) in projecting changes in the hydrological cycle.",

            "abstract": "Most of the fossil corals in the uplifted reef terraces along the Gulf of Aqaba (GOA, which is currently one of the most hyper-arid regions on Earth) were extensively altered to calcite. This observation indicates extensive interaction with freshwater, possibly when the terraces were uplifted through a coastal aquifer that existed along the shores of the GOA, implying a wetter climate during time of recrystallization from aragonite to calcite. Thus, dating of the recrystallization events should yield timing of past wet conditions in the current hyper-arid area of the GOA. In the current study 16 samples of aragonitic and calcitic corals were collected from several uplifted coral terraces off the coast south to the city of Aqaba. While aragonite corals were dated with the conventional closed system (with no initial Th) age equation, the dating of the calcitic corals required the development of adequate equations that allow the calculation of both the initial cystallization age of the coral and time of recrystallization to calcite. The two age calculations were based on the assumptions that each reef terrace went through a single major recrystallization event and that the pristine aragonite corals had an initial U concentration in the range of 2.5-3 ppm (typical for pristine modern corals). Two recrystallization events were identified: at 124±30 ka BP and 106±7 ka BP, which coincide with the timing of sapropel events S5 and S4 when the African monsoon induced enhanced wetness in the desert area (e.g. Torfstein et al., 2014). The original reef deposition ages were calculated to be: ~ 129-127±8 ka BP, 112±3 ka BP and 5.7±0.3 ka BP, matching the interglacial peaks of global sea level high stands MIS5e, MIS5c and the mid-Holocene high stand.",

ElarmS is one of several systems that contribute to CISN ShakeAlert. The UC Berkeley ElarmS system consists of multiple continuous-waveform processors and trigger-association processors running at three geographical locations and communicating via the Apache ActiveMQ Messaging system. With performance monitoring tools, we review the system component latencies and earthquake hypocenter estimations. Statistics are presented for hypocenter and origin time accuracy and alert times latencies for the previous year by geographic regions. We are also testing the ElarmS system by replaying the raw waveform data for historical earthquakes of interest. This allows us to check the signal detection algorithm, the trigger associator and the magnitude estimator.\nOver the last year, ElarmS successfully alerted on all significant earthquakes (M>=4.5, 10 earthquakes) and generated no false alarms. This includes events in Los Angeles, Santa Rosa, offshore Eureka, and the southern Sierra. The magnitude estimates were within 0.5 magnitude units in all cases. The largest event was the M6.8 event offshore of Eureka. The initial ElarmS magnitude estimate was M6.3 with a location 7 km from the true (offshore) location. ElarmS also alerted on all of the larger (M>=4.5) aftershocks. The speed of the alert depends on the quality of the seismic network around the epicenter. For the M5.1 Los Angeles Le Habra event the alert was 4.2 sec after the origin time, this is typical for events in the LA region. For the Santa Rosa event the alert was 6.8 sec after the origin time, 10.8 for the southern Sierra event, and 25.7 for the (offshore) Eureka earthquake. Comparing the performance of ElarmS across the state for a wider range of magnitudes (M>=3) the effect of variable seismic network quality is very apparent. The performance is good to excellent in the SF Bay and LA areas where station coverage is densest. In the greater SF Bay Area of the 38 M>=3.0 events reported by the ANSS, 5 were missed (all in the Geysers Geothermal Area) and there were no false events. In the LA region, of the 35 M>=3.0 events, 4 were missed and there were 2 false events.",

We used specific electrical conductance (EC)(μS/cm) as a measure of salinity, and applied a previously developed EC model to estimate natural, baseflow salinity at each stream. We used the difference between observed and predicted salinity (EC-Diff) as a measure of salinization associated with watershed degradation. Observed levels of EC varied between 22 and 994 μS/cm across reference sites and 22 to 3,256 uS/cm across non-reference sites. EC-Diff was as high as 2,743 μS/cm. We used a measure of local biodiversity completeness (ratio of observed to expected number of taxa) to assess ecological response to salinity. This O/E index decreased nearly linearly up to about 25% biodiversity loss, which occurred at EC-Diff of about 300 μS/cm. Too few sites had EC-Diff greater than 300 μS/cm to draw reliable inferences regarding biodiversity response to greater levels of salinization. EC-Diff increased with % agricultural land use, mine density, and % urban land use in the watersheds implying that human activities have been largely responsible for increased salinization in Nevada streams and rivers. Comparison of biological responses to EC and other stressors indicates that increased salinization may be the primary stressor causing biodiversity loss in these streams and that more stringent salinity water quality standards may be needed to protect aquatic life.",

            "abstract": "Convection-permitting regional climate model (RCM) simulations more accurately resolve small-scale surface features such as land-use patterns or topography and are less dependent on convection parameterizations. They have been shown to provide added value e.g. in the reproduction of the intensities, the diurnal cycle and the spatial distribution of precipitation or dominant interaction processes like soil moisture-precipitation and temperature feedbacks, offering the potential for an improved reproduction of the hydrological cycle. The Rhine River catchment in Central Europe covers 185000 km² from the Alps in the South to the North Sea with many population centres of high economic importance along its major rivers.\nIn this study, first results are presented from 3 km convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) hindcast simulations for a central European model domain that are used as offline forcing data for the LARSIM (Large Area Runoff Simulation Model) hydrological model at 5 km resolution over the Rhine River catchment. The goal is to investigate how well hydrometeorological conditions during recent flood and drought events can be reproduced and how the higher resolution atmospheric forcing data affect the performance of the hydrological model.\nThe WRF model is run in a one-way double-nesting setup, where the 3 km model domain is inscribed into the official pan-European Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) EUR-11 model grid (about 12 km). It is driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis as part of validation runs of a bigger regional climate change experiment. The simulated time span from 2009 to 2013 covers distinct hydrometeorological and hydrological conditions in parts of the Rhine catchment (flood: 2013; hydrological droughts: 2011). The RCM data are compared to high-resolution gridded observations. LARSIM is run using 12 km and 3 km RCM data as input and its results are validated with observed discharge data at gauging stations. In addition, performance metrics are derived to analyse whether an added value of the higher resolution RCM forcing as opposed to coarser standard resolution products can be seen in the simulated hydrometeorological and hydrological data during contrasting events (low- vs high-flow).",

We will describe modifications to the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) frameworks motivated by analysis of NASA satellite and aircraft measurements. Observations of tropospheric column NO2 from OMI have already led to the identification of an important deficiency in the chemical mechanisms used by models; data collected during the DISCOVER-AQ field campaign has been instrumental in devising an improved representation of the chemistry of nitrogen species. Our recent work has focused on the use of: OMI observations of tropospheric O3 to assess and improve the representation of boundary conditions used by AQ models, OMI NO2 to derive a top down NOx emission inventory from commercial shipping vessels that affect air quality in the Eastern U.S., and OMI HCHO to assess the C5H8 emission inventories provided by bioegenic emissions models. We will describe how these OMI-driven model improvements are being incorporated into the State Implementation Plans (SIPs) being prepared for submission to EPA in summer 2015 and how future modeling efforts may be impacted by our findings.",

            "abstract": "With the ever increasing number of geodetic monitoring satellites, it is vital to have a variety of geophysical numerical simulators to produce sample/model datasets. Just as hurricane forecasts are derived from the consensus among multiple atmospheric models, earthquake forecasts cannot be derived from a single comprehensive model. Here we present the functionality of Virtual California, a numerical simulator that can generate sample surface deformations, surface gravity changes, and InSAR interferograms in addition to producing earthquake statistics and forecasts.\nVirtual California is a boundary element code designed to explore the seismicity of today’s fault systems. For arbitrary input fault geometry, Virtual California can output simulated seismic histories of 50,000 years or more. Using co-seismic slips from the output data, we generate surface deformation maps, surface gravity change maps, and InSAR interferograms as viewed by an orbiting satellite. Furthermore, using the times between successive earthquakes we generate probability distributions and earthquake forecasts.\nVirtual California is now supported by the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics. The source code is available for download and it comes with a users’ manual. The manual includes instructions on how to generate fault models from scratch, how to deploy the simulator across a parallel computing environment, etc.\nhttp://geodynamics.org/cig/software/vc/",

            "abstract": "Induced seismicity is inherently associated with underground fluid injections and poses a risk for geologic carbon sequestration efforts, enhanced geothermal systems and shale gas development. If fluids are injected in proximity to a pre-existing fault or fracture system, the resulting elevated pressures can trigger dynamic earthquake slip, which could damage surface structures and create new migration pathways.\nThe goal of this research is to develop a fundamentally better approach to geological site characterization and early hazard detection. We combine innovative techniques for analyzing microseismic data with a physics-based inversion model to forecast microseismic cloud evolution. The key challenge is that faults at risk of slipping are often too small to detect during the site characterization phase.\nA natural response to fluid injection is the creation of microseismicity. Often thousands of microquakes are associated with an injection well. These microquakes are not of concern, as they are too small to be felt at the surface. However, they effectively illuminate the subsurface, allowing us to monitor plume growth and identify previously hidden faults. Precise seismic measurements on these microquakes is key.\nUsing ambient noise correlation we create sharp images of the subsurface. These images together with Bayesian techniques dramatically improve the precision with which microquakes are located. Matched field processing increases the range of magnitudes that can be identified. The virtual seismometer method lights up the seismically active region, allowing us to monitor the evolution of the seismicity, measure changes in the style of faulting, sort microseisms by location and magnitude, and to identify previously un-observed fault zones. Finally, using a hydromechanical inversion, we create a model of the pressure field that is consistent with the microseismic data. We use timing information about the microseismic cloud evolution to estimate major flow paths in the reservoir. The model is initially simple, becoming more sophisticated as new data are added.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 and was funded by the LDRD Program at LLNL under project tracking code 14-ER-051",

            "abstract": "The amount and type of foredune morphologic change during a storm event primarily scales with the level of inundation during that event. Specifically, external hydrodynamic forcing (total water level) can be compared with antecedent beach and foredune morphology to predict an impact regime that relates to the type of expected morphologic evolution of the system. For example, when total water levels are above the dune toe, but below the dune crest, the impact regime is classified as “collision” and the expected morphology response is slumping or scarping of the dune face. While the amount of dune retreat scales largely with the duration of wave attack to the dune face, characteristics of the dune other than its crest or toe elevation may also enhance or impede rates of morphologic change. The aftermath of Hurricane Sandy provided a unique opportunity to observe alongshore variations in dune response to a 6-day Nor’Easter (Hs >4 m in 6 m depth), as a variety of dunes were constructed (or not) by individual home owners in preparation for the winter storm season. Daily terrestrial lidar scans were conducted along 20 km of coastline in Duck, NC using Coastal Lidar And Radar Imaging System (CLARIS) during the first dune collision event following Sandy. Foredunes were grouped by their pre-storm form (e.g. vegetated, pushed, scarped, etc) using automated feature extraction tools based on surface curvature and slope, and daily rates of morphologic volume change were calculated. The highest dune retreat rates were focused along a 1.5 km region where cross-shore erosion of recently pushed, un-vegetated dunes reached 2 m/day. Variations in dune response were analyzed in relation to their pre-storm morphology, with care taken to normalize for alongshore variations in hydrodynamic forcing. Ongoing research is focused on identifying specific metrics that can be easily extracted from topographic DEMs to aid in dune retreat predictions.",

In previous efforts in the multiscale analysis of tropical waves , the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) has been successfully parallelized and used to detect atmospheric wave signals on different spatial scales (e.g. Shen et al., 2013b) that include Mixed Rossby Gravity (MRG) waves, Western Wind Belt (WWB), African Easterly Waves (AEWs), etc. We now extend the related studies to examine the evolution of the large scale waves and their association with the formation of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic for an extensive time period spanning multiple years.\nOur goal is to analyze the multiscale interaction in the initiation and early intensification stage of an AEW and its subsequent impact on TC genesis that involves mainly the large scale downscaling processes. Specific focus is on the impact of barotropic instability and critical level (CL, or steering level) that may appear in association with the AEW. The presence of the CL is believed to play an important role in providing a favorable environment in the early TC-genesis stage in the marsupial paradigm scenario. Preliminary analysis of the satellite data obtained from the newly launched Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission linked to the TC genesis processes will be included.",

            "abstract": "Phragmites is one of the most invasive plants in North American wetlands. Although its spread in coastal marshes has been linked by independent studies to urbanization, eutrophication, and salinity change, there is good evidence that these factors may interactively determine invasion success and in turn, the ecosystem services provided by marshes. We hypothesize that the invasion of Phragmites is linked to changes in freshwater inputs due to climate and/or land use change. El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), originating in the sea surface temperature anomalies (warm or cold) in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, is a notable and prominent signal in inter-annual climatic variation. Recent studies shows that the probability of strong El Nino events may increase in the future. In this study, we will investigate the teleconnections between freshwater inputs to the coastal zone along the eastern U.S. and ENSO indices, and attempt to explore the predictability of temporal and spatial variation of freshwater inputs based on ENSO conditions. To quantify changes in freshwater input in this region, hydrologic modeling, remote sensing and field measurements are combined. The Hillslope River Routing (HRR) model is used to simulate hourly streamflow from all watersheds from southern Florida to northern Maine draining into the Atlantic Ocean. The modeling effort utilizes satellite precipitation (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Product 3B42v7: 2001-current with a 3-hr temporal resolution and 0.25 degree spatial resolution), land surface temperature and vegetation measures (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS, products: 2001-current with a monthly temporal resolution and 0.05 degree spatial resolution). To account for land cover change, annual MODIS land cover data and time varying population statics are merged to estimate annual land cover characteristics for each sub-catchment within the study region. Static datasets for soils and ground elevations are used. Daily U.S. Geological Survey streamflow data from major river outlets along the coastline are used for model validation. Annual streamflow is characterized in terms of volume of export to the ocean: as total flow, storm flow and baseflow and used to explore longitudinal discharge patterns along the coastline.",

However the source, evolution, and optical properties of BrC remain highly uncertain. BrC absorption exhibits strong spectral dependence, which differs from black carbon (BC), the other important absorber in fine aerosols. As a result, multiple wavelengths absorption measurements of aerosols offer constraints on BrC abundance. In this study, we synthesize the multi-wavelength absorption measurements from a suite of field campaigns and derive the BrC absorption. By comparing with the co-measured BC, OA mass and aerosol extinction, we analyze the relationship between BrC absorption and these factors. We then use a global GEOS-Chem model simulation to test these relationships, and estimate the emission and optical properties of BrC in diverse regions. The global burden and direct radiative forcing (DRF) of BrC are also investigated based on our model simulations.",

Here, we investigate it by classifying two groups of historical volcanism between AD 1300 and AD 1850 to 2, 1, and 0.5 times Pinatubo sulfate injection into the northern hemisphere (NH) stratosphere based on IVI2 and Crowley2013 volcanic reconstructions, then comparing precipitation response of BCC-CSM1 and CCSM4 model outputs under past1000 scenario to IVI2 volcanic group, and that of MIROC-ESM and MPI-ESM-P to Crowley2013 group with tree-ring reconstruction data MADA. In both groups, Superposed Epoch Analysis (SEA) of MADA and four model outputs show a drying trend over Asia monsoon regions after the NH injections and drier with larger sulfate magnitude, with a 1 or 2 year time lag in MADA comparing to the model outputs, this may result from the biological response of tree ring data that lag behind the meteorological forcing of model outputs. On the other hand, different responses to Southern Hemisphere (SH) only injections were found between the two groups as well as MADA and model outputs. Most of the results were found significant at 90% or even 95% significance level with a 10,000 Monte Carlo resampling procedure. Spatial variation of MADA show a significant drying effect in central Asia in year 1, and then move westward in year 2 and 3 after 2, 1×Pinatubo eruptions of IVI2, while a significant wetting effect in northwest Asia but drying effect in south Asia were shown in Crowley2013 group. However, model outputs did not show spatial variation, with a pattern drier in northwest than in southeast Asia along the years after the eruptions in both volcanic groups. Thus, observation and model outputs are well consistent on precipitation response to NH aerosol injections, but models may need large improvement on the response to SH aerosol injection as well as the spatial variation. Besides, opposite precipitation response to SH injection of the two volcanic groups also indicate the discrepancy between the two reconstructions, which may lead to discrepancy in different models used as volcanic forcing.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is projected to cause substantial changes in vegetation distribution, but these changes have been given little attention in comparison to anthropogenic land-use change in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Here we compare climate-forced vegetation changes to anthropogenic changes in vegetation from land-use change. To do this, we use an ensemble of simulations with and without anthropogenic land-use change in Earth System Model HadGEM2-ES for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Climate change causes an expansion poleward of vegetation types. This climate-forced land cover change (LCC) affects more area of land than land-use forced land cover change (often referred to as Land-Use forced Land Cover Change, or LULCC) in all of the RCPs considered here. For forest specifically, the climate-forced forest increase compensates 90% of the global anthropogenic deforestation by 2100 in RCP8.5, but just 3% in RCP2.6. The strong relationship between climate-forced LCC and the overall radiative forcing means that the net effect on forest is strongly dependent on the RCP. Carbon emissions from climate-forced LCC are larger than for LULCC. Overall, bigger LCC contributions tend to originate from LULCC in the shorter term or lower radiative forcing scenarios, and from climate changes in the longer term and higher radiative forcing scenarios. The extent to which climate-forced LCC could mitigate LULCC raises difficult questions regarding global forest and biodiversity offsetting, especially at different timescales. This research shows the importance of considering the relative size of climate-forced LCC to LULCC, especially with regard to the net ecological effects of the different RCPs.",

            "abstract": "Frontogenesis and frontal instabilities in the mixed layer are known to be important processes in the formation of submesoscale features. We study the seasonality of such processes in the Gulf Stream (GS) region.\nTo approach this problem, a realistic simulation with the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is integrated for 18 months at two horizontal resolutions: a high resolution (1/48th deg) simulation able to resolve part of the submesoscale regime and the full range of mesoscale dynamics, and a coarser resolution (1/12th deg) case, in which submesoscales are not resolved.\nResults provide an insight into submesoscale dynamics in the complex GS region. A clear seasonal cycle is observed, with submesoscale features mostly present during the winter season in the mixed layer. The submesoscale field is characterized in terms of deviation from geostrophy and 2D dynamics.\nThe limiting and controlling factor in the formation of submesoscales appears to be the depth of the mixed layer, that controls the release of APE stored in the mesoscale fronts present most of the year. Atmospheric forcings are the main energy source behind submesoscale formation, but mostly indirectly through mixed layer deepening. The mixed layer instability scaling proposed by Fox-Kemper et al. 2008 appears to hold, indicating that the parametrization is appropriate even in this complex and mesoscale dominated area.",

To date, field objects have not been extracted from satellite data over large areas because of computational constraints, the complexity of the extraction task, and because consistently processed appropriate resolution data have not been available or affordable. A recently published automated methodology to extract agricultural crop fields from weekly 30 m Web Enabled Landsat data (WELD) time series was refined and applied to 14 states that cover 70% of harvested U.S. cropland (USDA 2012 Census). The methodology was applied to 2010 combined weekly Landsat 5 and 7 WELD data. The field extraction and quantitative validation results are presented for the following 14 states: Iowa, North Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Texas, South Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Michigan (sorted by area of harvested cropland). These states include the top 11 U.S states by harvested cropland area. Implications and recommendations for systematic application to global coverage Landsat data are discussed.",

            "abstract": "We present a new, observationally-based estimate of the atmospheric energy budget for the Antarctic polar cap (the region poleward of 70°S). This energy budget is constructed using state-of-the-art reanalysis products from ECMWF [the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim)] and Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes. We find that the climatological mean Antarctic energy budget is characterized by an approximate balance between the TOA net outgoing radiation and the horizontal convergence of atmospheric energy transport, with the net surface energy flux and atmospheric energy storage generally being small in comparison. We compare these observationally-based results with coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model simulations that have been made available as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 5 (CMIP5). While CMIP5 models generally perform well in simulating the observed climatological mean energy budget, some notable model biases are apparent. These biases are most pronounced during the austral summer and fall seasons, with the largest biases (approaching 30 W m-2 for some models) occurring for the TOA net incoming shortwave radiation during summer. Finally, we examine the causes of model biases (e.g., deficiencies in the simulated cloud cover and sea ice), as well as their relationship to the simulated twenty-first century trends in the energy budget. We find a statistically significant inverse correlation across the CMIP5 models between the present-day biases in atmospheric energy transport into the polar cap, and the simulated future changes in energy transport over the twenty-first century. Possible reasons for this relationship are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Heavy ion dropouts in the solar wind are thought to originate from large, closed coronal loops. The distinctive, mass-dependent fractionation patterns of the dropouts requires that their source loops are relatively quiet and stable long enough (on the order of a day) to undergo gravitational settling. Therefore by studying the composition of heavy ion dropouts we are able to peer into the solar corona and glean information about the fine balance of physical processes. Additionally, the occurrence rates and magnetic profiles of dropouts suggest specific forms of magnetic reconnection are responsible for the release of the otherwise trapped plasma into the solar wind.\nIn this study we identify and compare dropouts observed by two different satellites, ACE and Ulysses, which together provide over 20 years of continuous observations at a variety of heliographic latitudes and radii. The resulting partial global view (or 3D view) enables us to identify coronal source regions and release mechanisms of heavy ion dropouts. We also discuss a physical model of gravitational settling which can be used to reconcile fractionation rates with the rate at which plasma must be escaping via reconnection. Our conclusions and results may contribute towards the ongoing refinement and validation of theories which predict the origin of “slow type” solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Unique field data indicative of maximum run-up owing to extreme wave conditions with a 50 year return period are obtained from the distribution of sea-glass on 10-18 m high dunes. The hypothesis that sea-glass is an indicator of maximum run-up is verified by the observations that new sea-glass on a beach is found at the rackline, the highest point of run-up. The source of the sea-glass is a garbage dump on the dune in southern Monterey Bay from 1937-1951. It is estimated that the dump, located on an erosive shoreline, was falling into the ocean by at least 1960, so that the maximum run-up values have a return period of at least 50 years. Various empirical run-up models based both on extensive laboratory and field measurements are assessed to include contributions from sea-swell and infragravity waves, setup and tidal elevation, which are parameterized on wave height and surf parameter, P, which is a function of wave height, period and beach slope. Deep water hindcast waves (1958-2011) refracted to 4m water depth are used as input to the models. Beach and dune slopes averaged over the run-up region from mean water level to the maximum run-up ranged 0.1 – 0.63 (angle of repose). Reasonable comparison with model predicted run-up with distribution of sea-glass on the dune were obtained for P <2 events, but were underpredicted for large P. Large P events are associated with long period swell waves characteristic of the Pacific Ocean that are outside the empirical parameter space from which the model equations were derived, suggesting a possible deficiency in the models.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of past changes in wetland ecosystems is integral for creating policies for modern land use practices. The Morro Bay salt marsh is home to a large wetland that has experienced significant environmental impacts in the last few centuries. In this study, sediment cores from the Morro Bay salt marsh were analyzed to discern changes in environment since the time of European contact, which occurred in 1772. The marsh is fed by two creeks (Chorro and Los Osos) and their associated watersheds. Sediment cores taken from a portion of the marsh fed by Los Osos creek were analyzed and the results compared to those from previous studies on cores taken from the Chorro and Los Osos portions of the marsh. Magnetic susceptibility, loss on ignition, pollen, radiocarbon, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were conducted. An age-depth model was established for the Los Osos cores using two radiocarbon dates, as well as Erodium cicutarium as a chronological marker. Preliminary pollen analysis from Chorro marsh cores indicates vegetation shifts at the time of contact, when the salt marsh formed. Magnetic susceptibility and XRF data indicate dramatically increased rates of erosion from the time of contact consistently until the present. Influx of non-carbonate inorganic material also indicates a rapid increase in sedimentation in the marsh starting at the time of contact. Comparison of sedimentation rates between the two creeks suggests that differences in watershed geomorphology and land use practices have had pronounced impacts on erosional processes. Over the last decade, the Morro Bay National Estuary Program (MBNEP) has taken more measures to reduce erosion and sedimentation rates in the Chorro watershed, as is reflected by reduced sedimentation rates in MBNEP data collected within the last few years. Our study helps to elucidate the impacts of anthropogenic land use change on wetland systems, and provides much needed data to policy makers seeking to understand and attenuate anthropogenic impacts on sensitive coastal ecosystems.",

We use plasma density measurements made during 30-31 January 2014 on board the low inclination C/NOFS satellite, the polar orbiting SWARM B and C and DMSPF18 satellites to examine in detail the longitudinal, latitudinal (altitudinal) and temporal variations of nighttime equatorial plasma irregularities over a large longitudinal sector centered over South America. These measurements often show deep plasma depletions with over two orders of magnitude extending up to about the equatorial ionization peaks. They are strongest over Brazil and in the pre-midnight sector and decrease significantly at later local times. These depletions exhibit large variations in their scale sizes and over longitudinal distances as short as about 100 km. We compare the satellite data with radar observations of small scale plasma irregularities at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory and with Digisonde observations over Brazil. We also briefly compare our data with results from previous observations and theoretical predictions from plasma irregularity models.",

What are the consequences of this degassing for habitability and extinction? In this presentation, we consider this question in the context of Siberian Traps magmatism, which has been shown to overlap within geochronologic uncertainty with catastrophic deterioration of Permian-Triassic marine and terrestrial ecosystems. To investigate the impacts of endogenic gases on climate, atmospheric chemistry, and ocean circulation, we conducted a series of numerical experiments with a comprehensive global model for the Permian-Triassic. Our simulations predict the intensity and distribution of acid rain and ozone depletion, with implications for terrestrial biota. We further explore feedbacks between sulfur emissions, transient cooling, and shifts in ocean circulation. We suggest that Siberian Traps magmatism may have triggered several distinct kill mechanisms in the oceans and on land, contributing to a complex combined pattern of environmental stress and latest Permian ecological failure.",

            "abstract": "Thermospheric composition changes play a key role in determining ionospheric plasma densities during magnetic storms. High-latitude heating causes a redistribution of atomic oxygen and molecular nitrogen, the two primary chemical species in the thermosphere. It is difficult to forecast the ionosphere without having good solar and geomagnetic forecasts because those two sources cause most of the ionospheric variability during storms. Current solar and geomagnetic forecasts do not provide the necessary detail or level of accuracy. We show that, in the absence of good solar/geomagnetic forecasts, ionospheric forecasts can be greatly improved with initial knowledge of thermospheric composition. Forecast improvements last for 18 hours in the case of the Halloween 2003 storm and for 15 hours in the November 2003 storm. The results show that O/N2 redistribution occurs during storm onset, so it is useful to know the true O/N2 distribution at the start of an ionospheric storm forecast. We also present assimilation results that show it is possible to determine the O/N2 ratio from measurements of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC). The approach uses an ensemble of model runs to estimate the spatiotemporal relationship between TEC and composition. Ensemble approaches are particularly suited to storms, since they allow for dynamic adjustment of the assumed relationships between variables. The O/N2 determination results are produced using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) and validated using Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager (SSUSI) and Global Ultra-Violet Imager (GUVI) measurements. The Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) is used in both the simulation and the data assimilation sections of this research.",

IR, RS, and RO measurements provide information on the most critical but least understood climate forcings, responses, and feedbacks associated with the vertical distribution of atmospheric temperature and water vapor, broadband reflected and emitted radiative fluxes, cloud properties, surface albedo, and surface skin temperature. To perform Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE) for long term climate observations, accurate and fast radiative transfer models are needed. The principal component-based radiative transfer model (PCRTM) is one of the efforts devoted to the development of fast radiative transfer models for simulating radiances and reflecatance observed by various hyperspectral instruments. Retrieval algorithm based on PCRTM forward model has been developed for AIRS, NAST, IASI, and CrIS. It is very fast and very accurate relative to the training radiative transfer model.\nIn this work, we are extending PCRTM to UV-VIS-near IR spectral region. To implement faster cloudy radiative transfer calculations, we carefully investigated the radiative transfer process under cloud condition. The cloud bidirectional reflectance was parameterized based on off-line 36-stream multiple scattering calculations while few other lookup tables were generated to describe the effective transmittance and reflectance of the cloud-clear-sky coupling system in solar spectral region. The bidirectional reflectance or the irradiance measured by satellite may be calculated using a simple fast radiative transfer model providing the type of cloud (ice or water), optical depth of the cloud, optical depth of both atmospheric trace gases above and below clouds, particle size of the cloud, as well as the surface albedo of the earth are given. The fast model is about 3 orders faster than 36-stream DISORT. In the 11,700,000 cases we investigated for ice and water cloud, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of the fast model errors were 0.86% and 1.51% for ice cloud, and 1.93% and 3.71% for water cloud, respectively.",

Much of the agricultural land in the region is composed of winter wheat and is managed under various tilling practices. Soil erosion under these various tilling practices and climate could be detrimental to the agricultural economy of the region and food security. We explore the susceptibility of the agricultural land of the region to erosion impacts under future climate scenarios using a two-pronged approach using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. First, we assess the sensitivity of soil erosion to changes in climate variables including precipitation, temperature and precipitation intensity. This sensitivity analysis is done across several geographic regions, different hill slopes, soil types and land management practices. Secondly, we use downscaled climate projections from 20 climate models for the mid-21st century to develop probabilistic estimates of changes in soil erosion across the region. These projected changes are further contextualized using the sensitivity experiments. Finally, we examine whether changes in erosion due to climate change may be partially offset by changes in land management.",

            "abstract": "The latest polar version of the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2 (RACMO2.3) has been applied to the Antarctic Peninsula. Recently, the model physics have been updated, which resulted in a significant improvement in its performance, at 27 km resolution, over East and West Antarctica, in terms of surface energy fluxes and surface mass budget. Here we present results from a climatological run at 5.5 km over the AP for the period 1979-2013, in which RACMO2.3 is forced by ERA-Interim atmospheric and ocean surface fields and includes an AP surface topography based on state of the art digital elevation models.\nRACMO2.3 resolves the extremely large gradients over the Antarctic Peninsula mountain spine, in terms of surface and 2 meter temperature, which are caused by the persistent atmospheric westerly winds. We evaluate the model results by comparing them to temperature series from manned and automatic weather stations, vertical profiles from balloon soundings and surface energy balance measurements from three automatic weather stations. Results show that RACMO2.3 performs well in terms of surface and 2 m temperatures, 10 m wind speed/direction, but we also identify some significant biases in the downwelling fluxes of shortwave- and longwave radiation, related to clouds. These biases largely compensate each other, however, so that melt energy fluxes are resolved with reasonable accuracy.",

            "abstract": "This study presents a reconstruction of changes in the water column from the last glacial into the early Holocene using stable isotope, 87Sr/86Sr, 14C, and trace element ratios from mollusks from the shelf area and ostracods from the basin of the Black Sea. The stable isotope record is compared to a thoroughly U/Th dated terrestrial stable isotope record of a nearby cave, Sofular cave in northwestern Turkey. The combination of deep, surface, and terrestrial signals gives valuable insight towards the behavior of the lake water during the deglaciation in multiple dimensions, specifically the water column stratification and hydrological dynamics. The comparison of the stable isotope records of two independent proxies allows to make inferences on the changes in the 14C reservoir of the Black Sea-Lake. Results show that during the glacial period, water from the Black Sea-Lake was outflowing to the Sea of Marmara but the ventilation of the water column was weak as old 14C was not removed and allowed to accumulate giving the lake a large 14C reservoir age. A deglacial pulse of meltwater released from the Eurasian Fennoscandian pro-glacial lakes increased ventilation of the water column. This is seen in lighter δ18O and a spike in radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr in both deep and shallow parts of the water column. The dynamic ventilation and outflow of water into the Sea of Marmara continued until the onset of the Bolling/Allerod as the radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr was almost completely flushed out in a couple hundred years time. During the Bolling/Allerod and Preboreal warming, δ18O got heavier whereas the 87Sr/86Sr stayed constant and the 14C again accumulated and contributed to an older reservoir age. The Younger Dryas period, sandwiched in between the two warming periods, shows a return to glacial conditions in the δ13C and that the water outflowed to the Sea of Marmara as the δ18O only showed a slight change towards a more heavy value.",

            "abstract": "Worldwide, selenium (Se) is proving to be a significant environmental concern, with many anthropogenic activities (e.g. coal mining and combustion, phosphate mining and agricultural irrigation) releasing potentially hazardous concentrations into surface and subsurface ecosystems. The US EPA is currently considering aquatic Se regulations, however no guidelines exist for excess soil Se, despite its ability to act as a persistent Se source. Various abiotic and biological processes mediate Se oxidation/reduction (redox) transformations in soils, thus influencing its solubility and bioavailability. In this research we assess (1) the ability of metal-transforming fungal species to aerobically reduce Se (Se (IV and/or VI) to Se(0)), and (2) the relative contribution of biotic and abiotic pathways for aerobic Se transformation. The primary objective of this research is to determine what abiotic and biotic factors enhance or restrict Se bioavailability.\nResults indicate that fungal-mediated Se reduction may be quite widespread, with at least 7 out of 10 species of known Mn(II)-oxidizing fungi isolated from metal impacted environments also identified as capable of aerobically reducing Se(IV) and/or Se(VI) to Se(0). Increasing concentrations of selenite (SeO32-; Se(IV)) and selenate (SeO42-; Se(VI)) generally reduced fungal growth rates, although selenate was more likely to inhibit fungal growth than selenite. To study oxidation, Se(0) was combined with Mn(III/IV) (hydr)oxides (henceforth referred to as Mn oxides), Se-transforming fungi (Alternaria alternata), and oxalic acid to mimic Se biogeochemistry at the plant-soil interface. Increased pH in the presence of fungi (7.2 with fungi, 6.8 without fungi after 24 days) was observed. Additionally, a slight decrease in redox potential was measured for incubations without Mn oxides (236 mV with Mn oxides, 205 mV without Mn oxides after 24 days), indicating that Mn oxides may enhance Se oxidation. Elemental Se oxidation rates to Se(IV and/or SeVI) and extent will also be determined by measuring dissolved Se(IV) and Se(VI). Results from this research are key for understanding Se-transforming reactions in soils, and the role of both biotic and abiotic factors in influencing Se bioavailability and mobility within and out of contaminated ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "This study extends the popular triple collocation method for error assessment from three source estimates to an arbitrary number of source estimates, i.e., to solve the multiple collocation problem. The error assessment problem is solved through Pythagorean constraints in Hilbert space, which is slightly different from the original inner product solution but easier to extend to multiple collocation cases. The Pythagorean solution is fully equivalent to the original inner product solution for the triple collocation case. The multiple collocation turns out to be an over-constrained problem and a least squared solution is presented. As the most critical assumption of uncorrelated errors will almost for sure fail in multiple collocation problems, we propose to divide the source estimates into structural categories and treat the structural and non-structural errors separately. Such error separation allows the source estimates to have their structural errors fully correlated within the same structural category, which is much more realistic than the original assumption. A new error assessment procedure is developed which performs the collocation twice, each for one type of errors, and then sums up the two types of errors. The new procedure is also fully backward compatible with the original triple collocation. Error assessment experiments are carried out for surface soil moisture data from multiple remote sensing models, land surface models, and in situ measurements.",

            "abstract": "Sediment transport during flood events often reveals hysteretic patterns. Hysteresis can be clockwise (when flow discharge peaks after the peak of bedload) or counterclockwise (when flow discharge peaks before the peak of bedload), and recent indexes have been developed in order to quantify the degree of hysteretic patterns. Hysteresis patterns and degree can be used to infer the dynamics of sediment availability, as counterclockwise and clockwise hysteresis have been interpreted as representative of limited and unlimited sediment supply conditions, respectively. This work focuses on the temporal variability of suspended sediment transport measured in the Estero Morales, a 27 km2 Andean catchment located in central Chile. The elevations range from 1850 m a.s.l to 3815 m a.s.l., and the basin host glaciers with a current extent of 1.8 km2. Runoff is dominated by snowmelt in late spring, and glacier melt from December to March. Liquid discharge and turbidity have been measured continuously from October 2013 to March 2014. The analysis of hysteretic loops of daily discharge fluctuations of spring and summer shows that patterns are mostly clockwise during snowmelt and early glacier melt period, and counterclockwise during late glacier melting, revealing a reduction of sediment supply conditions overtime. This is confirmed by the analysis of regressions between liquid discharge and turbidity, revealing that a higher discharge is progressively needed to transport the same concentration of suspended sediments as the glacier melting season progress. These evidences indicate that suspended sediment transport in glacierized basins is affected by complex interactions among runoff generation, and sediment availability, and that the analysis of temporal hysteresis can help inferring the activity of sediment sources at the basin scale.\nThe research was supported by the projects FONDECYT 1130378 and IDRC 107081-00.",

            "abstract": "In addition to influencing the electrical conductivity of volcanic ash, leachates bound to ash grain surfaces may pose significant hazards to water quality through the contribution of sulfates, fluoride, metals, and acidic compounds to local water supplies by either direct ash fallout or incorporation into precipitation runoff. In regions of active volcanism, remobilization of pyroclastic units may be a regular occurrence due to landslides or lahars, but the resultant effects of secondary disaggregation of pyroclasts have not been examined. Laboratory analyses of tephras from several eruptive centers have revealed variations in the pH, conductivity, and total dissolved solid (TDS) concentration of water-soluble compounds as a result of pyroclast disaggregation. Analyses were conducted using the standardized protocols for ash leachate analysis. TDS, conductivity, and pH were then measured and the tephra samples were allowed to air dry before being retested using identical methods. When pyroclast disaggregation was not performed, results show a progressive decrease in water conductivity, acidity, and TDS concentration following each stage of sonication. However, when an additional step of clast disaggregation (through crushing and grinding of samples) preceded the sonication step, water samples showed increases in measured properties. Mass spectroscopic analyses of water samples are in progress and results will be presented. These results indicate that secondary comminution of pyroclastic deposits will release water-soluble components from the pyroclast interior that may result in a renewed series of environmental hazards many years after the initial eruptive event. Break up of pyroclasts during transport in landslides or lahars (or even during cleanup efforts) will not only alter the size distribution of the deposit, but will also release metals, sulfates, and fluoride from the tephra interiors, altering the chemical and electrical properties of the tephra. This poses important implications for evaluating the hazards to water supplies and electrical infrastructure resulting from volcanic activity, and the need to consider how the physical modification of volcanic deposits due to surface processes may spark a renewed set of hazards in volcanically active regions.",

Involving these students in comprehensive, holistic research experiences is one approach that has paid tremendous dividends. The New York City College of Technology (City Tech) was recently awarded a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplemental grant to integrate a community college/two-year program component into its existing REU program. The program created an inviting and supportive community of scholars for these students, nurtured them through strong, dynamic mentoring, provided them with the support structures needed for successful scholarship, and challenged them to attain the same research prominence as their Bachelor degree program companions. Along with their colleagues, the community college/two-year program students were given an opportunity to conduct intensive satellite and ground-based remote sensing research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology Center (NOAA-CREST) at City College and its CREST Institute Center for Remote Sensing and Earth System Science (ReSESS) at City Tech.

            "abstract": "Turbiditic deposits consist of alternating sandstones and shales of various thicknesses. This complex sedimentary architecture produces multiple hierarchies of heterogeneities and controls the development of fractures and faults at various scales. Typically stiff units (e.g., sandstones and siltstones) have a predominantly brittle behavior and produce joints, which propagate across layers characterized by homogeneous mechanical properties and terminate against the boundaries of the so-called mechanical units. Joints provide weak planes for later shearing, leading to the clustering of joint zones and eventually the nucleation of faults. These faults may reach large extents through linkage of neighboring fractures and fault segments. However, the evolution and linkage of the faults is controlled by an interplay between the mechanical properties of the rock units and the fault slip. To evaluate both lateral and vertical continuity of fault zones, which are fundamental for assessing their fluid flow properties, it is desirable to identify what class of heterogeneities may inhibit the fault propagation. This structural framework is also important evidence supporting DFN contaminant transport models used to describe and predict plume behavior at the site.\nFor this contribution we carried out a multi-scale analysis of the fault and fractures cutting across the turbidite sequence of the Chatsworth Formation (Simi Hills, CA). By means of collecting quantitative structural data for both background and fault-related structures, we established the hierarchy of faults and fractures based on their length, height, width, and offset and spacing where available. Detailed structural maps were integrated with scanline surveys to characterize the architecture of the single structures and identify their stage of development.\nFinally, detailed characterization of contaminant distributions from continuous core sampling at the site TCE source and plume corroborate the presence of numerous, multi-scaled, hydraulically active fractures required to match the observed plume migration distance over past decades, thus providing a robust analysis of the hydraulic behavior of structures making up various hierarchical classes within the structural framework.",

Climate variability can also augment or diminish human stresses on water resources. Thus, understanding climate variability has particular relevance for groundwater management. Findings will be presented from a national scale study of groundwater level response to natural climate variability in principal aquifers (PAs) of the U.S., including the California Coastal Basin, Rio Grande, Coastal Lowlands, Mississippi Embayment, Floridan, and Glacial aquifer systems. We use the U.S. Geological Survey hydroclimatic analysis toolkit HydroClimATe to perform singular spectrum analysis and identify quasi-periodic signals in precipitation and groundwater time series that are coincident with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) (6–12 mo cycle), Pacific/North American oscillation (PNA) (<1–4 yr cycle), El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (2–7 yr cycle), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (3–6 yr cycle), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (15–30 yr cycle), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) (50–70 yr cycle). Nearly all of the quasi-periodic signals in the precipitation and groundwater levels have a statistically significant lag correlation (95% confidence interval) with the AO, PNA, ENSO, NAO, PDO, and AMO indices. The largest amount of variance in precipitation and groundwater levels was attributed to the PDO, accounting for more than 90% of the variance in many PAs. The next largest amount of variance in precipitation and groundwater levels was attributed to ENSO, accounting for more than 50% of the variance in many PAs. The AMO was the least frequently detected signal in all time series but accounted for as much as 95% of the variance when detected. Thus, climate variability on interannual to multidecadal timescales has a statistically significant and measurable effect on the lagged responses of precipitation variability and, in turn, groundwater level fluctuations in PAs. Our findings have important implications for the availability and sustainability of groundwater, including management and planning decisions about the locations, cost effectiveness, and optimal time periods for conjunctive use strategies.",

Water with SF6 ages of less than 30 years are found above 26.5 σθ. The highest apparent oxygen utilization rates (AOUR) found in the coastal region are likely due to the upwelling in this region. The central gyre region shows the lowest AOUR, corresponding with the oligotrophic conditions. In between, the OMZ, ranging from 80⁰W to about 120⁰W, has a median AOUR. An analysis of our data compared to WOCE data at 4 co-locations shows changes in the water properties and biogeochemical processes over a 20 year time period. This analysis suggests an expansion and a strengthening of the OMZ in the past 20 years. While there is a decrease in oxygen content within the OMZ, there is a slight increase in AOU in the western part of the OMZ.",

            "abstract": "Over the last century, the Arctic has been warming at a rate almost twice the global average. Aerosols both directly and indirectly affect the radiative balance of the Arctic through the absorption and scattering of sunlight and by providing a source of cloud and ice condensation nuclei. Global climate models currently have difficulty reproducing the observed warming in the Arctic but could be improved through high temporal resolution measurements of aerosols and their sources. This study focuses on the quantification of fossil fuel and biomass combustion contributions to particulate organic carbon (OC) collected during a winter sampling campaign in the North Slope Alaska. Samples were collected at the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) climate research facility in Barrow, AK, USA. Particulate matter (PM10) samples collected from December 2012 to March 2013 were analyzed for organic tracer analysis combined with radiocarbon of elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC). Organic tracers, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkanes, hopanes and levoglucosan, were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). These tracers, commonly used as molecular markers for anthropogenic combustion sources, were then used in a molecular-marker chemical mass balance (CMB) model. Results from the CMB were then combined with radiocarbon (14C) abundance measurements. Radiocarbon analysis differentiates between fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning based on the large difference in end members between fossil and contemporary carbon. Radiocarbon results show an average fossil contribution of 44% to Arctic OC from with spark ignition (gasoline) and compression ignition (diesel) engines being implicated as major sources of fossil OC to Arctic aerosols. The 14C analysis and CMB source apportionment will be combined with back trajectory (BT) to assess the impact of geographic source regions on carbonaceous aerosol burden in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones exhibit a wide range of behavior, from slab stagnation at 660 km to direct penetration into the lower mantle. Due to uncertainties in the tectonic history of individual subduction zones, such as trench velocities, potential mechanisms for controlling slab behavior in the transition zone are explored using numerical models. Numerical simulations have utilized a range of assumptions to improve computational efficiency, such as ignoring latent heat, ignoring compositional effects or fixing the trench location: the net effect of these assumptions resulting modeled dynamics remains unclear. Additionally the eight major, composition-dependent, phase transitions for pyrolite, harzburgite and eclogite may be an important influence on subducting slab dynamics due to the additional forces that are dependent on depth and compositional layering within the slab (e.g., Ricard et al., 2005). With the goal of developing more complete, self-consistent, and less idealized simulations, we test the importance of various factors on slab behavior: the presence of shear, adiabatic and latent heating, compositional layering, composition-dependent phase transitions and explicit plate speeds versus dynamically evolving plate and trench velocities. Preliminary results indicate that individual components have a relatively minor effect, but produce large changes when combined together. The extent of slab folding and stagnation is overestimated by only modeling the 410 and 660 km phase transitions. Dynamic models with all seven composition-dependent phase transitions are very sensitive to the plate strength and weak zone viscosity, causing large changes in plate speed and slab detachment. Changes to the overriding plate buoyance and strength investigate the origin and influence of trench movement on slab deformation. These feedbacks and parameter-sensitive behavior indicate that the wide range of observed slab behavior may result from subtle differences in plate and plate boundary properties.\nRicard, Y., E.

            "abstract": "Given the substantial anthropogenic contribution to global warming, it is tempting to seek an anthropogenic component in any unusual recent weather event, or more generally in any recent change in extreme weather statistics. We caution that such detection and attribution efforts may, however, lead to wrong conclusions if the distinctively skewed and heavy-tailed features of the probability distributions of daily weather variations are not properly accounted for. Large deviations from the mean are far more common in such a non-Gaussian world than they are in a Gaussian world. In such a world, a mean climate shift is also generally accompanied by changes in the width and shape of the probability distribution. Consequently, even the sign of the changes in tail probabilities cannot be inferred unequivocally from the mean shift. These realities further complicate the establishment of significant changes in tail probabilities from historical records of limited length and accuracy.\nA possible solution is to exploit the fact that the salient non-Gaussian features of the observed distributions are captured in a general class of probability distributions introduced in the meteorological literature by Sardeshmukh and Sura (2009). These distributions, called Stochastically Generated Skewed (SGS) distributions (of which Gaussian distributions are special cases), are associated with modified forms of stochastically perturbed damped linear processes, and as such represent perhaps the simplest physically based non-Gaussian prototypes of the observed distributions. Importantly, the distribution of an SGS variable remains an SGS distribution under a mean climate shift. We show further that fitting SGS distributions to all daily values in limited climate records yields extreme value distributions of block maxima with smaller sampling uncertainties than GEV distributions fitted to only the block maxima. Extreme value analysis based on SGS distributions thus provides an attractive alternative to that based on GEV or Generalized Pareto distributions, and can be used to assess changes not only in tail probabilities but the entire distribution. The procedure will be illustrated to assess changes in the observed distributions of daily temperature anomalies in several regions of the globe over the 1874 to 2010 period.",

            "abstract": "This study proposes a modification of the current model for abandoned channel fill stratigraphy produced in unidirectional flow river reaches to incorporate seasonal tidal deposition. Evidence supporting this concept came from a study of two consecutive channel abandonment sequences in Ropers Slough of the lower Eel River Estuary in northern California. Aerial photographs showed that Ropers Slough was abandoned around 1943, reoccupied after the 1964 flood, and abandoned again in 1974 with fill continuing to the present. Planform geomorphic characteristics derived from these images were used in conjunction with sub-cm resolution stratigraphic analyses to describe the depositional environment processes and their resultant sedimentary deposits. Results showed that both abandonment sequences recorded quasi-annual scale fluvial/tidal deposition couplets. In both cases tidal deposits contained very little sand, and were higher in organic and inorganic carbon content than the sandier fluvial through-flow deposits. However, the two abandonment fills differed significantly in terms of the temporal progression of channel narrowing and fluvial sediment deposition characteristics. The first abandonment sequence led to a more rapid narrowing of Ropers Slough and produced deposits with a positive relationship between grain size/deposit thickness and discharge. The second abandonment resulted in a much slower narrowing of Ropers Slough and generally thinner fluvial deposits with no clear relationship between grain size/deposit thickness and discharge. The δ13C values and organic nitrogen to organic carbon ratios of deposits from the first phase overlapped with Eel River suspended sediment characteristics found for low flows (1-5 times mean discharge), while those of the second phase were consistent suspended sediment from higher flows (7-10 times mean discharge). The abandoned channel fill sequences appeared to differ due to the topographic steering of bed sediment transport and deposition previously identified in rivers experiencing only unidirectional flow, while also expressing the seasonal dichotomy of fluvial and tidal deposits.",

            "abstract": "A high-resolution multiproxy dataset is analyzed in the classic K-Pg section of Bottaccione near Gubbio (Italy), including magnetic susceptibility (MS), CaCO3 content, δ18O and δ13C stable isotopes signatures. The stratigraphic interval covers the uppermost 7.2 m of the Maastrichtian. The proxy records provide insight on the paleoclimatological conditions of this interval, and make an evaluation of the potential imprint of astronomical climate forcing possible. Lithologic variations (MS and CaCO3) are mainly reflecting the terrigenous influx (i.e. wind-blown dust) in the deep marine setting of Gubbio around the time of deposition. The availability and transport of this dust is hypothesized to be a function of the vegetation cover on large source areas in the African and/or Euro-Asian continents. This vegetation cover would be susceptible to changes in the monsoonal circulation intensity and patterns. The monsoon and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITZC) are determined by insolation, which in turn is controlled by the precession and obliquity. A vegetation-cover-threshold mechanism is proposed to explain eccentricity related periodicities in the MS record. Together with the dust influx in this tropical western Tethyan basin, both oceanic and terrestrial mechanisms depending on the precession amplitude modulated by eccentricity are proposed to explain the detected eccentricity periodicity in the δ13C record. The astronomical interpretation proposed in this study suggests that high eccentricity corresponds to relatively low δ13C and MS maxima values. Based on this phase relationship, an astronomical tuning of the Maastrichtian section is elaborated. The Maastrichtian part of magnetozone C29r has a duration of ~370 kyr. The duration of several biozones of the uppermost Maastrichtian is calculated. Tentative interpretations of the δ18O record and the astronomical interpretation of the MS record hint towards a warming event ~400 kyr prior to the K-Pg.",

As stellar background photons shortward of 912 angstroms are filtered out by the interstellar medium, and as the solar photon flux is much larger, the contribution to ionization from non-solar photons is typically negligible for planets in our solar system. However, there are conditions under which ionization due to the stellar background may be important, or even dominant. Such conditions include, for example, (some) nightside ionospheres, exoplanets in distant orbits, rogue planets, and possibly brown dwarfs. In this presentation we show calculations of ionization in Jovian-like atmospheres due to stellar background EUV photons. These photons primarily ionize methane near and below the planetary homopause, generating a relatively weak, low-altitude ionospheric layer, and therefore a minimum level of residual ionization is expected for all Jovian-like planets within the solar neighborhood. The resulting ionospheric electrical conductances, while small, may be sufficient to close magnetospheric coupling currents within these planetary ionospheres.",

            "abstract": "We study the Solar Probe Plus (SPP) spacecraft interactions with near-Sun plasma environment. The plasma environment is characterized by a small Debye length due to dense plasmas and large fluxes of photo-/secondary electrons emitted from the spacecraft surface. Prior studies on this issue found that such a condition produces a non-monotonic potential distribution near the spacecraft, and the resultant spacecraft potential becomes negative. The consequences also suggest the significance of photoelectron and secondary electron dynamics near the spacecraft. In this study, we apply our original electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulation code called EMSES to the problem.\nIn the simulations, we consider the SPP spacecraft at its perihelion (about 0.04 AU from the Sun) and important physical effects such as spacecraft charging, photoelectron and secondary electron emission, solar wind plasma flow including the effect of spacecraft orbital velocity, and the presence of a background magnetic field. Our preliminary results show that both photoelectrons and secondary electrons from the spacecraft are magnetized in the spatial scale of several meters, and make drift motion due to the presence of the background convection electric field. In addition to this, secondary electrons emitted laterally from the spacecraft chassis are strongly affected by the radially inward electric field caused by the spacecraft potential. These effects lead to non-axisymmetric distributions of electron density and the resultant electric potential around the spacecraft.\nOur simulations also predict that a strong (about 100 mV/m) spurious electric field can be observed by the probe measurement on the spacecraft due to such a non-axisymmetric effect. We also confirm that the large photo-/secondary electron current alters magnetic field intensity around the spacecraft, but the field variation is much smaller than the background magnetic field magnitude (a few nT compared to thousands of nT). We will report further parameter survey results on such spurious field generation, by changing solar wind and spacecraft orbital conditions. The results will provide useful information in predicting photo-/secondary electron interference with in-situ field measurements planned in the Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions.",

However, the history of Pacific deep and intermediate circulation, as well as its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentration during glacial-interglacial cycles, is poorly constrained because of low sedimentation rates and local high productivity affecting nutrient-based water mass proxies preferentially in sluggish circulation regimes. We reconstruct water mass circulation changes in deep (ODP 846, 03°5.80′ S, 90°49.07′ W, 3296 m) and intermediate (ODP 1241, 05°50.57′N, 86°26.68′W, 2027 m) cores from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) near Galapagos Island over the last 160,000 years using Nd isotopes on foraminiferal coatings allowing comparison with other paleocean proxy records (e.g. δ13C, Cd/Ca, CaCO3%, Δ14C and δ11B) during MIS 1-6. The deeper ODP 846 Nd isotope record shows little to no variability over major glacial-interglacial cycles, but significant radiogenic peaks during each deglaciation which coincide with benthic Cd/Ca and δ11B peaks in Pacific cores in the same water mass. The intermediate-depth ODP 1241 Nd isotope record has relatively unradiogenic glacials and radiogenic interglacials. We propose that this Nd isotope record is monitoring changes in the amount of Southern Ocean-sourced intermediate water, propagated to the EEP during MIS 2 and 6, which is further supported by less carbonate dissolution and nutricline shoaling. Taken together, Nd isotopes of these two records allow the investigation of the Eastern Equatorial Pacific circulation and its association with nutrient and carbon cycling over time.",

The mission is currently in its science analysis phase. During the final weeks (the “endgame”) of the mapping mission, the orbital altitudes of the two spacecraft were lowered to an average of 11 km above the lunar surface. The endgame mapping strategy was designed to provide the highest-resolution coverage over the Orientale basin, to be used to develop a gravity map of a multi-ring impact basin at unprecedented resolution. In order to achieve the highest-resolution gravitational model of Orientale, we performed a short-arc analysis of GRAIL’s Ka-band range rate (KBRR) observations by adjusting a priori field GRGM900A while embedding neighbor smoothing. The combination of a spherical harmonic solution and the local analysis resolves the gravitational structure of Orientale and its environs to 3–5 km, suitable for detailed investigations of basin structure and evolution. The map reveals a correspondence of the inner depression with an excavation cavity that reflects removal of approximately 30 km of crust. The crustal thickness beneath the basin cavity may be as little as 6 km, depending on assumptions regarding the global mean thickness of the crust, the densities of the crust and mantle, and the thickness and density of the impact melt and mare fill. An annulus of negative free-air anomalies is strongest between the Inner and Outer Rook Mountains and is likely due in part to an annulus of thickened crust surrounding the excavation cavity, most likely caused by the crustal overturn during excavation (as suggested by hydrocode models). Gravitational signatures of basin rings are well resolved and distinctive, reflecting substantial fracturing or porosity as well as evidence for localized magmatic intrusion. There is no preserved evidence, however, for a transient cavity that correlates with any of the basin rings. A record of the energetics of this and other impacts is preserved in the excavated volume, the fractured crust and ring structures.",

            "abstract": "Blowing snow in the polar regions is known to be important for a variety of reasons including ice sheet mass balance, atmospheric water vapor transport, interpretation of paleoclimate records and atmospheric chemistry. Over Antarctica, persistent katabatic winds produce extreme blowing snow events often covering 100,000 square kilometers or more and reaching heights of 300-400 meters. New techniques of blowing snow detection using active and passive satellite data are providing a new understanding of the frequency, magnitude and spatial coverage of blowing snow over and around the Antarctic continent. Current research is utilizing these methods to obtain a nearly 10 year climatology of blowing snow events over Antarctica and estimate the amount of mass being blown off the continent and sublimated into the atmosphere on an annual basis. In addition, recent research indicates that blowing snow over sea ice may be important in the process of transporting seal salt aerosol into the atmosphere where it is implicated in the production of bromine compounds that strongly influence many aspects of tropospheric chemistry.",

We performed a number of runs with three levels of constant resistivity.

For constant solar wind driving (southward Bz IMF), we found the formation of bursty bulk flows (BBFs) and dipolarization fronts when the resistivity was below a critical value. We extracted virtual s/c data through dipolarization fronts and BBFs and compared with observed properties of BBFs. We also studied the ionospheric response to BBF formation. By switching on/off the ring current module (CRCM) in the BATSRUS, we examined relationship between BBFs and ring current injections.",

Then we take the detections and relocate them using the double difference method. We explore both the performance that can be expected with using just a small number of stations, and, the benefits of reprocessing a well-studied sequence such as this one using waveform correlation to find even more events. We benchmark our results against previously published results describing relocations of regional catalog data.

            "abstract": "Continuous GPS measurements of bedrock crustal motions in response to GIA in Antarctica have been acquired by the Antarctic Network (ANET) component of the Polar Earth Observing Network (POLENET). Patterns of vertical crustal displacements are commonly considered the key fingerprints of GIA, with maximum uplift marking the position of former ice load centers. However, efforts to develop more realistic 3D earth models have shown that the horizontal motion pattern is a more important signature of GIA on a laterally varying earth. Here we provide the first measurements substantiating predictions of a reversal of horizontal motions across an extreme gradient in crustal thickness and mantle viscosity crossing Antarctica. GPS results document motion toward, rather than away from the sites of major ice mass loss in West Antarctica. When compared in a common reference frame, observed crustal motions are not in agreement with predictions from models of GIA. A gradient in crustal velocities, faster toward West Antarctica, is spatially coincident with the rheological boundary mapped from seismic tomographic results. This suggests that horizontal crustal motions are strongly influenced by laterally-varying earth properties, and demonstrates that only 3D earth models can produce reliable predictions of GIA for Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "African ecosystems are at great risk due to climate and land-use change. Despite the status of several of these regions as biodiversity hotspots, long-standing ideas about African ecology and biogeography have been unable to be tested until now due to lack of sufficiently long records. Here, we present the first long, continuous terrestrial record of vegetation from Lake Malawi, East Africa which goes back to the early Late Quaternary, permitting us to investigate changes in physiognomy and forest composition over many transitions. In this record, we observe eight phases of forest expansion and collapse. Although diversity is much greater during forest phases, composition varies little from phase to phase. Very high abundances of afromontane taxa suggest frequent widespread colonization of the lowlands by modern high elevation trees. Although there are clear successional stages within each forest such that turnover is great within a single phase, among forest samples between phases, there is little dissimilarity. Each forest phase is interrupted by rapid decline of arboreal taxa and expansion of semi-arid grasslands or woodlands whose composition varies greatly from phase to phase. The variable composition of the more open phases, all occurring during arid periods, is likely dynamically linked to thresholds in regional hydrology associated with lake level and moisture recycling within the watershed. This vegetation is unlike any found at Malawi today, with assemblages suggesting strong Somali-Masai affinities. Furthermore, nearly all semi-arid assemblages contain small abundances of forest taxa typically growing in areas with wetter edaphic conditions, suggesting that moist lowland gallery forests were present but restricted to waterways during exceptionally arid times. The waxing and waning of forests throughout this interval has important implications for early human biogeography across Africa as well as disturbance regimes that are crucial for the maintenance of modern East African landscapes.",

But the magnitude of this effect is difficult to quantify, both because of intrinsic atmospheric variability and because of limitations in the record of ENSO variability during megadrought epochs. Here a new, isotope-enabled version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (isoROMS) is used to develop improved 'forward model' translations between ENSO variability and the oxygen isotopic signal (delta-18O) recorded in tropical coral skeletons over the 1940-2009 period. These forward models are nonlinear, and additionally vary with spatial resolution: at Palmyra Atoll, the action of tropical instability waves is shown to significantly impact temperature and seawater delta-18O variability in the near-reef environment. The isoROMS forward models are applied to coral records spanning the past millennium, and the resulting ENSO estimates compared with a new suite of Last Millennium simulations performed with the NCAR Community Earth System Model. Implications for identifying megadroughts forced by the tropical Pacific are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of hillslope and riparian water table dynamics across headwater catchments remains challenging. We suggest that this is partially due to the lack of spatially distributed, high frequency, long duration observations of shallow subsurface flows that connect hillsopes to riparian and stream landscape positions. Further, these observations are rarely considered in the context of both local and watershed scale structure and organization. Here, we provide a synthesis of shallow subsurface hydrologic connectivity duration and magnitude across 9 years of hourly stage recordings for 30 transects of shallow groundwater wells (hillslope size from 0.07 to 4.6 ha) in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, MT. Key results include: 1) the annual average water table depth across all hillsope wells was exponentially related (r2 = 0.94) to upslope accumulated area (UAA). 2) K means analysis of the annual hilllsope water table stage duration curves indicated a transition across the continuum of wells from short duration hydrologic connectivity and low stage (UAA = 0.07 – 1ha, n= 90), sustained snowmelt hydrologic connectivity and moderate stage (UAA = 1.2 – 3ha, n = 20), and continuous hydrologic connectivity and highest stage (UAA = 3.1 – 4.6ha, n=11). 3) hillslopes with the largest UAA (n= 11; continuous connectivity and sustained groundwater stage) exhibited groundwater dynamics similar to those in riparian wells. The synthesis of the well water stage responses across space and time suggests strong emergent behavior according to landscape position and topography. These preliminary analyses provide insight into watershed behavior that is requisite for understanding where streamflow originates in the landscape, appropriate model structures for predicting streamflow, predicting landscape position sensitivity to climate variability, and informing land management decisions.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies have indicated that catchment characteristics (e.g. geology, vegetation, and topography) modulate runoff generation processes that connect hillslopes to streams. However, there has been little direct quantification of the range of spatial scales and climatic forcing under which catchment characteristics and their topology influence patterns and thresholds in stream flow. We measured changes in discharge across 52 reaches (~200 m long) distributed across 5 nested watersheds ranging from 3.2 to 23 km2 in the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, Montana. We performed dilution gauging from early snowmelt through late summer baseflow in the 2013 and 2014 water years to develop stage-discharge relationships for calculation of real-time stream discharge for each of the 52 reaches. We also computed indices of topography, geology, vegetation, and valley characteristics. Preliminary results suggest that the dominant controls, and their degree of influence on observed changes in discharge shifted across wetness states. Total contributing area to each reach was a significant predictor of discharge at high flow with the slope of the relationship decreasing across the annual recession. We examined incremental changes in discharge for each reach and determined that spatiotemporal variability in discharge was related to the underlying lithology. Contributing areas underlain by granite gneiss yielded more water per unit area than those with sandstone. However, yield was less predictable in areas overlying the granite gneiss formation. Our preliminary analysis has identified specific watershed characteristics and time periods at which they influence discharge across watersheds and spatial scales. We suggest that these results can support improved understanding of space-time variability of stream flow and the representation of watershed characteristics in simulation model structures.",

            "abstract": "For experimental analysis of infragravity waves in a dissipative beach we carried out a field campaign. A crosshore array of pressure sensors, located outside the surf zone and inside the surf zone, was used. These sensors measured for 12 hours continuously with a rate of 1 Hz by 3 days. A Fourier analysis was applied to the free surface data to identify infragravity energy. A FIR filter was applied to obtain the infragravity signal along the array of pressure sensors; we found an increase in the height of the infragravity wave as it approaches to the coast of almost 50%. The evolution of the infragravity wave signal was analyzed outside and inside the surf zone for the biggest wave event recorded in the field campaign, finding a significant increase in the height of the infragravity wave. Finally, using a wavelet analysis we observed that as the infragravity wave was approaching to the coast, the energy within the infragravity frequencies increase for lower frequencies. For the numerical analysis of infragravity waves in the dissipative beach, we use the SWASH model that is a non-hydrostatic model which phase-resolves the free surface and fluid motions throughout the water column. The model was validated (Willmott index of 95% of agreement between the simulated and measured time series) with data from the experimental array of pressure sensors. We ran the model by changing the boundary condition to analyze the swash oscillation in the selected beach. We found that the model was able to predict the swash oscillation and confirms that in a dissipative beach the energy in the swash zone was dominated by the infragravity energy. These results help to understand the role of infragravity regime in coastal flooding processes and morphological changes in natural beaches.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s inner and outer radiation belts are surrounded by a natural high intensity radiation environment, composed of high energy and relativistic particles. The dynamic outer plasmasphere overlaps the outer radiation belt beyond L=2.5 and can play a key role in modulating the outer radiation belt. In particular, ambient cold plasma density associated with plasmaspheric structure and density gradients in the plasmasphere boundary layer (PBL) can regulate the occurrence and characteristics of wave-particle interactions (WPI) leading to large changes in precipitation/loss efficiency. These interactions are efficient at scattering high energy particles into the atmospheric loss cone, resulting in spatially localized enhancements in outer radiation belt acceleration and precipitation.\nWe discuss a multi-point observational case study of the relationship of dayside radiation belt precipitation temporal and spatial dynamics to outer plasmasphere processes during a coronal mass ejection driven shock injection and plasmasphere reconfiguration event on 2014-01-09. We combine in-situ magnetosphere diagnostics from the Van Allen Probes A and B spacecraft with in-situ data from multiple BARREL balloons measuring atmospheric precipitation in the afternoon MLT sector, near the Van Allen Probes magnetic footprints. Van Allen Probes and THEMIS E data from their respective EFW instruments determines electric field structure and thermal electron density configurations to L~7. Finally, we place the in-situ diagnostics in a larger context using GPS ground based total electron content observations of L <= 4 wide field plasmaspheric structure and PBL dynamics. We present analysis explaining the observed atmospheric precipitation, and demonstrating the significance of the outer plasmasphere boundary location in processes leading to energetic electron precipitation. Such multi-instrument analysis demonstrates that consideration of interconnected system-level processes leads to a clearer understanding of the characteristics of individual features.",

            "abstract": "Historic records and field investigations reveal that the Mw 8.0 Sanhe-Pinggu (China) earthquake of 1679 produced a 10 to 18 km-long surface rupture zone, with dominantly dip-slip accompanied by a right-lateral component along the Xiadian fault, resulting in extensive damage throughout north China. The fault scarp that was coursed by the co-seismic ruptures from Dongliuhetun to Pangezhang is about 1 to 3 meters high, and the biggest vertical displacement locates in Pangezhuang, it is easily to be seen in the flat alluvial plain. But the 10 to 18 km-long surface rupture couldn’t match the Mw 8.0 earthquake scale. After more than 300 years land leveling, the fault scarps in the meizoseismal zone which is farmland are retreat at different degree, some small scarps are becoming disappeared, so it is hard to identify by visual observation in the field investigations.\nThe meizoseismal zone is located in the alluvial plain of the Chaobai river and Jiyun river, and the fault is perpendicular to the river. It is easy to distinguish fault scarps from erosion scarps. Land leveling just changes the slope of the fault scarp, but it can’t eliminate the height difference between two side of the fault. So it is possible to recover the location and height of the fault scarp by using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analysis and landform surveying which is constrained by 3D centimeter-precision RTK GPS surveying method in large scale crossing the fault zone.\nOn the base of the high-precision DEM landform analysis, we carried out 15 GPS surveying lines which extends at least 10km for each crossing the meizoseismal zone. Our findings demonstrate that 1) we recover the complete rupture zone of the Sanhe-Pinggu earthquake in 1679, and survey the co-seismic displacement at 15 sites; 2) we conform that the Xiadian fault scarp is consist of three branches with left stepping. Height of the scarp is from 0.5 to 4.0 meters, and the total length of the scarp is at least 50km; 3) Combined with the analysis of offset strata of the trench, we conform that the middle segment of the fault scarp is made by 1679 earthquake; 4) The fault scarp strikes along with the Ju river at the northeast segment of the Xiadian fault which course the asymmetrical valley geomorphology.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide gross primary productivity (GPP) is a critical component of the terrestrial biological carbon cycle, but quantifying GPP at regional and global scales is challenging. GPP cannot be observed directly because of large counterbalancing respiration fluxes, and process-based ecosystem models report a wide range of estimates. Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is metabolized by plants in parallel to CO2, and this relationship may provide a method to quantify GPP using COS observations. This COS tracer method depends on a thorough understanding of the leaf relative uptake (LRU) parameter of COS to CO2 by plants. Recent laboratory work suggests that the LRU parameter takes a much narrower range of values than previous atmospheric modeling studies have concluded. Here we conduct new atmospheric transport simulations using the data that underpinned several previous atmospheric modeling studies and demonstrate that GPP uncertainty can explain the relatively wide range of LRU values reported in these studies. We also find that atmospheric COS concentration is more sensitive to GPP uncertainty than to LRU uncertainty. These findings suggest that the COS tracer approach could be useful in quantifying regional and continental GPP.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) presents a triple threat to the global environment: it is the third most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, the largest remaining anthropogenic contributor to stratospheric ozone depletion, and an important component of the nitrogen (N) cascade – where one atom of N can interconvert between a number of forms, each with a unique set of environmental impacts. Here we use a dynamic vegetation model (Princeton-Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab (GFDL) LM3 – the interactive land component of the GFDL Earth System Model) to assess how changes in future climate, land-use, and global fertilizer and manure application are projected to affect global N2O emissions from agriculture by 2050. Agricultural land is defined in this study as the sum of cropland and pasture. In a baseline scenario assuming little improvement in global N use efficiency (NUE) by 2050, the model projects a 24-31% increase in global agricultural N2O emissions (with the uncertainty range stemming from differences in climate forcing, land-use and fertilizer and manure consumption between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, the two climate scenarios used in this study) – rising from 2.9 Tg N2O-N yr-1 in 1990-2000 to 3.6-3.8 Tg N2O-N yr-1 in 2040-2050. This emission increase is considerably less than the projected increases in global fertilizer and manure consumption (42-44%) and previously published projections of global agricultural N2O emission increases (38-75% - again, the uncertainty range reflecting the differences between the climate scenarios used). This disparity appears to be a result of ecological feedbacks captured by the model, where a considerable portion of the increase in fertilizer and manure use is absorbed by agricultural plant biomass rather than lost to the environment. In addition to this dynamic, the model projects that improvements in global NUE of 20-50% could reduce global N2O emissions significantly, delivering important climate and stratospheric ozone benefits over the period 2015-2050: avoiding up to 9.9 Gt CO2 eq. and 567 ODP kt, respectively. This is equivalent to about two years of the CO2 emissions of all the passenger cars currently on the road and 25-35% of the potential reductions from the destruction of the remaining recoverable stocks of other ozone depleting substances.",

            "abstract": "Long and short-term tectonic activity plays an essential role in the segregation, transport and emplacement of fluids and magmas within the continental crust. Magma ascent and emplacement mechanisms within volcanic arcs are largely controlled by the interplay between pre-existing structural anisotropies, regional stress field, magmatic driving pressure, and the viscous resistance to magma flow. For the upper crust, many authors have stated that the orientation of principal tectonic stresses may determine the spatial distribution and geometry of eruptive vents and related feeder dykes Thus, regional and/or local tectonics (differential stresses) may exert a fundamental control in volcanic morphology and produce linear eruptive arrays of Andean-type strato-volcanoes, as a result of stability on long-lived structural system of sub-parallel dyke swarms and aligned minor eruptive centers along volcano flanks. In South-central Chile, the Callaqui Volcano consists of tens of aligned Pleisto-Holocene eruptive vents and hundreds of sub-parallel dykes, preserved along the ENE-WSW Callaqui volcano ridge. Morpho-structural field mapping and remote sensing analysis yields that Pleistocene eruptive vents are aligned into a N60°E-trending en echelon array, whereas its elliptical craters maximum diameter trend N66°E. Post-glacial eruptive vents also are organized into a N60°E trend, observed in both, isolated talweg scoria cone and flank fissural eruption. In addition, sub-parallel, underlying dyke swarms strike N60°E in it central portion of the volcanic system, becoming nearly E-W on distal zones. Examination of morphometrical and structural data yields that emplacement of magma occurs within a dextral transtensional regime, along a major regional discontinuity recognized previously by other authors. The strain field obtained within this study is consistent with the regional ENE shortening derived by the oblique convergence between Nazca and South-American plates.",

            "abstract": "The Utah Geological Survey’s (UGS) Geologic Hazards Program has partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create geologically derived web-based flood hazard maps. Flooding in Utah communities has historically been one of the most damaging geologic hazards. The most serious floods in Utah have generally occurred in the Great Salt Lake basin, particularly in the Weber River drainage on the western slopes of the Wasatch Range, in areas of high population density. With a growing population of 2.9 million, the state of Utah is motivated to raise awareness about the potential for flooding. The process of increasing community resiliency to flooding begins with identification and characterization of flood hazards. Many small communities in areas experiencing rapid growth have not been mapped completely by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM). Existing FIRM maps typically only consider drainage areas that are greater than one square mile in determining flood zones and do not incorporate geologic data, such as the presence of young, geologically active alluvial fans that indicate a high potential for debris flows and sheet flooding. Our new flood hazard mapping combines and expands on FEMA data by incorporating mapping derived from 1:24,000-scale UGS geologic maps, LiDAR data, digital elevation models, and historical aerial photography. Our flood hazard maps are intended to supplement the FIRM maps to provide local governments and the public with additional flood hazard information so they may make informed decisions, ultimately reducing the risk to life and property from flooding hazards. Flooding information must be widely available and easily accessed. One of the most effective ways to inform the public is through web-based maps. Web-based flood hazard maps will not only supply the public with the flood information they need, but also provides a platform to add additional geologic hazards to an easily accessible format.",

            "abstract": "Declining Arctic sea-ice cover in recent decades has driven large-scale freshwater transport into the North Atlantic, possibly influencing the strength of the Meridional Overturning Circulation and even global climate. However, due to the lack of long-term oceanographic observations, little is known about the natural freshwater variability of the Northwestern Atlantic. Crustose coralline algae Clathromorphum compactum are extremely long-lived shallow marine calcareous plants that are abundant along the subarctic eastern Canadian coastline. They are particularly well-suited as recorders of paleoclimate signals due to the formation of annual growth increments, allowing for the precise calendar dating and geochemical sampling of hard tissue. Here, we provide the first annually-resolved multi-centennial record of coralline algal Ba/Ca from Labrador, Canada, as a proxy for North Atlantic freshwater variability extending well into the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1665 AD). Barium-to-calcium ratios (Ba/Ca) from coralline algae have previously been used as an indicator of freshwater runoff. This is because barium-rich clay sediments are transported by terrestrial runoff into coastal waters, and barium is released from the clay minerals upon encountering more alkaline elements present in seawater. We observe higher algal barium concentrations during the LIA, followed by a steady decline to recent times. In addition, coralline algal Ba/Ca shows significant positive relationships to Hudson Strait runoff, as well as Canadian Arctic and North Atlantic sea-ice extent. This suggests that more riverine Ba is transported from the Hudson Strait into the Labrador Sea during periods of increased sea-ice cover. Multiyear sea-ice can block incoming solar radiation thereby diminishing the effects of nutrient scavenging by phytoplankton, resulting in a more conservative transport of Ba into northern Labrador. However as sea-ice continues to thin, more sunlight is able to penetrate through the ice pack, thereby promoting near-surface plankton production. Therefore, the recent decline in coralline algal Ba/Ca indicates decreased Hudson Strait runoff (as also shown by instrumental records) amplified by increased biological scavenging of Ba, resulting from the ongoing thinning and loss of Canadian Arctic sea-ice.",

Systematic biases in the CCSM output such as significant dry biases in the tropics are transmitted into the WRF model through the lateral boundary conditions and degrade the performance of the model when compared to both observations and simulations forced with the CFSR dataset. To improve the ability of CCSM output to appropriately prescribe the NAM, we introduce a process using simple linear regression and the CFSR dataset to perform a mean bias correction that also maintains the physical dependencies across variables. A third NAM climatology was simulated using this bias corrected CCSM output, which showed marked improvement to the NAM precipitation, most notably in the Mexican core of the NAM. Additionally, the climatology of NAM evolutionary characteristics (i.e. onset, intensity, decay) are much better represented in the bias corrected CCSM WRF model than in the original CCSM WRF model, and closely resemble the CFSR simulations. NAM precipitation simulated by each of the three forcing datasets show the bias corrected CCSM simulations produce the most consistent trends when compared to observations, providing confidence for future projections of the NAM.",

            "abstract": "Results of numerical simulation analysis indicate that where groundwater flows in permafrost landscapes in a warming climate, advective heat transport enhances permafrost thaw rate, increasing transmissivity and the movement of warmer recharge and deep waters. Enhanced flows further increase the rate at which permafrost margins warm and thaw, resulting in positive feedback. Groundwater flow is a significant control on thaw rate and on local and regional patterns of residual permafrost in the landscape. Results indicate that residual permafrost patterns in landscapes with groundwater flow should differ from those in landscapes with little flow.\nAs permafrost thaws from above, a deeper seasonal active zone (the shallow subsurface layer that freezes and thaws annually) develops and more through-going thawed zones (taliks) develop that connect supra- and sub-permafrost zones. The new taliks host additional groundwater flow. Despite this potential for increasing groundwater movement in warming arctic environments, most predictive models of permafrost thaw generally have considered only subsurface heat conduction, not incorporating advective heat transport. To understand these systems and feedbacks, the USGS-SUTRA numerical groundwater code, which models coupled groundwater flow and heat transport, was modified to include freeze/thaw. When temperatures are below freezing, the modeled permeability and thermal properties are dependent on ice saturation, and latent heat of ice formation is included in the energy balance.\nSimulations of groundwater flow and permafrost thaw were carried out across a hillslope cross section with undulating topography that is initially underlain by a continuous thick permafrost layer. Climate warming is applied with mean air-temperature increase of 0.5 °C per 100 years for 1600 years with constant temperature thereafter. This temperature evolution is superimposed on a seasonal ±10 °C variation that drives yearly freeze/thaw cycles in the shallow subsurface. Simulation results compare changes in permafrost distribution over a few thousand years of climate change due to (1) purely conductive heat transport (with essentially no groundwater flow) and (2) advective-conductive heat transport (with significant groundwater flow).",

            "abstract": "Inland water bodies play a significant role in terrestrial carbon cycling, rather than being just conduits for the transport of terrestrial carbon to the oceans. Recent syntheses estimate that freshwaters emit substantial amounts of CO2 (1.4 Pg C yr-1) (Tranvik et al. 2009) and CH4 (0.65 Pg C yr-1) (Bastviken et al. 2011), which are similar in magnitude to the global terrestrial carbon sink (2.5 ± 1.7 Pg C yr-1) (IPCC 2013). However, eutrophic waters, which constitute the majority of the global freshwater supply (ILEC/UNEP 1994, Liu et al. 2012, Carpenter et al. 1998), are vastly underrepresented in these estimates. These waters, due to high primary productivity leading to CO2 undersaturation, can act as sinks rather than sources of CO2, thus reversing the role of lakes in the carbon cycle (Balmer and Downing 2011, Pacheco et al. 2013). We are investigating the air-water CO2 exchange of five hypereutrophic lakes in urban Bangalore using a novel Non-Dispersive Infrared (NDIR)-based CO2 sensor installed in flux chambers that can be used to measure CO2 exchange in lakes in situ. This work is a part of a larger study called Bangalore Carbon Mapping Study that aims to track the spatial flows of carbon in an urban area of a developing country.\nPreliminary observations reveal that these lakes absorb CO2 during the photosynthetic hours, at an average rate of 3.4 mg C m-2 h-1. The ongoing study will characterize the complete diurnal cycle of CO2 exchange, its variation over different seasons, and its relationships with various limnological and catchment characteristics. The flux estimates thus produced will also be compared with those predicted by the current models for air-water gas exchange based on wind speed.",

            "abstract": "We study the temporal change of Jupiter's magnetosphere and aurora due to changing solar wind conditions. In particular, we examine how the the main auroral emission is affected by the solar wind density. Using three dimensional global MHD simulations, we perform three different runs, with: 1) quiet solar wind conditions (ram pressure of 0.05 nPa), 2) disturbed solar wind conditions (ram pressure of 0.17 nPa), and 3) very disturbed solar wind conditions (ram pressure of 0.34 nPa). We show that the response of the main auroral emission depends on local time: at noon, the main oval is only weakly affected by the variations in the solar wind; whereas on the night side, the main emission becomes brighter when the solar wind ram pressure increases. For instance, 10 hours after the high density solar wind reached the magnetosphere, the peak in parallel electrical current on the night side is 20% and 40% stronger for the disturbed and very disturbed solar wind conditions, respectively. The main auroral emission begins to change three hours after the solar wind density enhancement strikes the bow-shock and it takes approximately three days for the magnetosphere to adjust to the new solar wind conditions. The total electrical current flowing out of the ionosphere is then 30% (50%) higher for the (very) disturbed solar wind conditions than for the quiet solar wind conditions. In addition, for the three simulations, a localized enhancement of the main oval emission is periodically observed around noon local time (inside the main oval discontinuity). A very similar enhancement has already been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in Far-UV images by Palmaerts et al. (JGR, under review). In our simulations, the localized peak is not caused by fluctuations in the solar wind, but is always associated with a region of negative radial velocity in the equatorial plane at the position where the corotation breaks down. The shearing motions associated with this negative radial velocity region produce strong gradients for Bz in the azimuthal direction, which causes an enhancement of the electrical current.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake swarms are common in volcanic regions where fluids exsolved from magma bodies may trigger a sequence of earthquakes as they episodically transit from ductile surroundings into the neighboring brittle crust. Such swarms do not fit mainshock-aftershock patterns commonly seen with tectonic seismicity. Similar swarms are increasingly being observed in association with industrial fluid injection. Here, we investigate and compare earthquake swarms at Long Valley Caldera (a volcanic center) and Azle, Texas (near active industrial production and wastewater-disposal wells). We perform waveform-correlation-based event detection coupled with double-difference relative location, using catalog events as waveform templates to examine their space-time evolution. This greatly enhances the earthquake catalog, providing locations for ~4 times as many events as in the routine catalog, with location precision often better than 10 m. Despite differences in depth, fluid chemistry, and tectonic environment, we find pronounced spatiotemporal migration of earthquake hypocenters in both of these swarms.\nBoth swarms occurred on well-defined fault structures. The Long Valley south moat swarm followed an inactive, steeply dipping fault zone. Earthquakes began ~7.5 km beneath the surface on 7 July 2014, propagated dominantly upward and northward ~600 m in the first 12 hours, and continued sporadically into late July 2014. The Azle swarm of 28-29 January 2014 activated an ancient normal fault at shallow depths of ~3 km, just below the injection and extraction horizon, and propagated ~400 m northeastward along strike and bilaterally along dip over ~12 hours. For both swarms, we hypothesize that the migration of hypocenters reflects corresponding diffusion of a fluid pressure front within pre-existing fault zones. In some cases we observe larger earthquakes followed by rapid (but not instantaneous) propagation of events into previously inactive zones, perhaps reflecting enhanced permeability and accelerated fluid pressure diffusion via the newly ruptured fault patch. By integrating observations from natural and induced earthquake swarms, we aim to understand factors controlling the combined physics of faulting and fluid pressure diffusion in the crust.",

            "abstract": "Viscosity data of melts measured under in situ high pressure conditions are crucial for the understanding of Earth’s lower mantle and the interior of terrestrial and extrasolar Super-Earth planets. We report recent technical advances and techniques enabling falling sphere viscosity measurements in single- and double-stage DIA-type multi-anvil apparatus. For the experiments we used presses with a maximum load of 250 tons and 1750 tons. We anticipate that our system will enable viscosity measurements up to the maximum pressure for non-diamond anvils, i.e. pressures up to some 30 GPa. For the development of the new set ups the deformation of the cell assemblies were analyzed by X-ray absorption tomography at beamline W II at DESY/HASYLAB after the high pressure runs. These analysis gave considerable insights into strategies for improving the cell assembly with the result that the optimized assemblies could be used at much higher pressures without blow-outs. We think this approach is much faster and more beneficial than the classical way of trial and error. Additionally to prevent high pressure blow outs the task was to make the whole melting chamber accessible for the high pressure X-radiography system up to the maximum pressures. This way the accuracy and reliability of the measurements can be improved. For this goal we used X-ray transparent cBN-anvils at the single-stage DIA large volume press. Because this material is recently not available for the cube size of 32 mm this aproach did not work for the double-stage DIA. As a very useful and economical alternative we used slotted carbide anvils filled with fired pyrophyllite bars. To improve the frame quality of the platinum spheres taken by the CCD-camera the energy of the monochromatic X-rays had to be increased to 100 keV. The resulting ascent of scattered radiation required a new design of the X-radiography unit. Our results are demonstrated with viscosity measurements following Stokes law by evaluation of X-radiography sequences taken by a CCD-camera at pressures of 5 GPa as well as 10 GPa and temperatures of 1890 K. As the first result we could increase the maximum pressure range of published viscosity measurements with dacite melts by almost factor 1.5 (see Tinker et al., 2004).",

            "abstract": "We describe an autonomously deployable, deep-ocean observatory designed to provide long term and near-real-time observations from sites far offshore. The key feature of this new system is its ability to telemeter sensor data from the seafloor to shore without a cable or moored surface buoy. In the future the observatory will be deployable without a ship.\nThe first application of this system is seismology. While permanent ocean seismic stations on the seafloor have long been a goal of global seismology, today there are still no ocean bottom stations in the Global Seismographic Network, mostly for reasons of life-cycle costs. Yet real-time data from stations in oceanic areas are critical for both national and international agencies in monitoring and characterizing earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear explosions.\nThe system comprises an ocean bottom instrumentation package and a free-floating surface communications gateway, which uses a Liquid Robotics wave glider. The glider consists of a surfboard-sized float propelled by a tethered, submerged glider, which converts wave motion into thrust. For navigation, the wave gliders are equipped with a small computer, a GPS receiver, a rudder, solar panels and batteries, and an Iridium satellite modem. Wave gliders have demonstrated trans-oceanic range combined with long-term station holding.\nThe ‘communications gateway,’ which provides the means of communicating between the ocean bottom package and land comprises a wave glider and a towed acoustic communications ‘tow body'. Acoustic communications connect the subsea instruments and the surface gateway while communications between the gateway and land is provided by the Iridium satellite constellation. Tests of the surface gateway in 4350 m of water demonstrated the ability to send four channels of compressed 24-bit, 1 sample per second data from the ocean bottom to the gateway with an average power draw of approximately 0.2 W.",

            "abstract": "Long-standing debate has focused on the timing, mode, and direction of Colorado River integration, either down or up river. Miocene–Pliocene Colorado River deposits are well exposed in the lower Colorado River corridor (i.e. Bouse Fm and Bullhead Alluvium). There, improved geochronologic constraints have the potential to test integration models and improve our understanding of the inception of a continental-scale river system. In addition, timing and magnitude of regional uplift could be estimated if 5-6 Ma paleoelevation of any part of the system can be confidently identified (e.g. paleo sea level).\nPresent data indicate that downward integration occurred in part through a series of lake basins that filled and spilled as fluvial-deltaic sediments prograded towards the Gulf of California. However, a possible marine connection and hence a near sea-level elevation for the lower Blythe basin of the Bouse Fm remains controversial. Non-marine Sr signatures in lower Bouse Fm carbonates are permissibly consistent with mixing in an estuary and conversely, limited assemblages of marine fossils are permissively explained by avian transport to inland saline lakes. Improved geochronology has the potential to discriminate between a < 100 ka episode of downward integration of short-lived lakes from a > 1 Ma longer-lived estuarine system. Improved geochronology can also help resolve controversy about the timing of the arrival of Colorado River sediment and water in each basin and, in particular in the Salton Trough.\nWe present initial U/Pb results on Hualapai Limestone and Bouse Fm carbonates. Hualapai samples give linear 3D isochron ages of 9.3 ± 1.1 and 10.4 ± 3.1 Ma that are consistent with available stratigraphic controls. Preliminary attempts to date Bouse marl have so far yielded imprecise results. However generally high U/Pb ratios and U concentrations in Bouse samples are promising. Efforts are currently underway to date fine-grained banded Bouse tufas from lake margins.",

            "abstract": "At 6th August 2012 a hydrothermal eruption occurred at the Upper Te Maari vent within the Tongariro volcanic center (New Zealand). The eruption comprised a series of short-lived explosions, at least two laterally directed density currents and a vertical ash plume. All explosions were accompanied by ballistic ejection, some of which impacted NZ’s most popular hiking trail and a mountain lodge at 1.4 km from the vent.\nDetailed mapping of the ballistic strew field (craters and where possible impactors) revealed first insights into the eruption dynamics. Ballistics could be discriminated into four main lithology groups and traced back to specific explosion-source locations in the vent region.\nThe main lithology types were used in rapid decompression experiments mimicking hydrothermal explosions under controlled laboratory conditions. The heterogeneity of the lithologies, including breccia with different components, cementation and compaction, necessitated an experimental setup for large samples (34 mm diameter, 70 mm length). The experiments on pre-saturated samples were conducted in a temperature range from 250°C – 300°C and applied pressure between 4 MPa – 6.5 MPa. Within this range we tested rapid decompression from both the liquid-dominated field and the vapor-dominated field. Clasts were ejected with velocities of up to 180 m/s as recorded with a high-speed camera. The resulting fragments were analyzed for their grain size distribution, shape and lithology. Besides a obvious larger clasts, a large amount of fine and very fine (<63 µm) ash was produced in all experiments. Experimental studies of this kind facilitate better constraints on the ejection characteristics of ballistics and their associated hazard.

            "abstract": "Resolving subduction zones in the shallow upper mantle using global shear velocity tomography has long been a challenge, likely due to the rather narrow signature of the slabs down to ~400 km depth compared to the wavelength of fundamental mode and overtone surface waves, on which resolution of Vs at these depths often relies. On the other hand, models based on P wave travel times exhibit higher resolution in subduction zone regions, owing to both the higher frequencies of the P waves as well as an optimal illumination geometry. Conversely, the global Vs models typically have better resolution near the CMB, because of constraints provided by Sdiff and multiple ScS phases. Here we compare the morphology of subducted slabs throughout the mantle, as imaged by both a recent Vp model (GAP_P4, Fukao and Obayashi, 2013) and a new Vs model (SEMUCB-WM1, French and Romanowicz, GJI, in revision). The latter model was developed by inverting body (to 32s) and fundamental and overtone surface (to 60s) waveforms, with the forward seismic wavefield computed using the spectral element method. While the S velocity model is still \"fuzzier\" than the Vp model, it tracks the behavior of slabs trapped in the transition zone, and those ponding around 1000 km depth. We quantify the high correlation of the region of fast Vp and Vs anomalies, and thus derive a robust estimate of the R=dlnVs/dlnVp ratio as a function of depth in regions of faster than average velocity. We compare these results with estimates obtained with other combinations of available P and S models, as well as theoretical values from mineral physical calculations. Estimating R in slow velocity regions is more difficult, as resolution varies more among models. Here we compare slow velocity images in SEMUCB-WM1 with those of other recent Vs and Vp models and attempt to estimate R in those regions as well. Interestingly, we note that, in the SEMUCB-WM1 model, some of the columnar, lower than average velocity regions \"rising\" from the CMB through the lower mantle appear to be deflected horizontally at ~1000 km depth. This observation suggests that whatever mechanism causes the resistance to downward flow in subduction zones at this depth may also affect upwellings.",

            "abstract": "The ability to frame effective climate change policy depends strongly on reducing the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing, which is currently nearly as great as best estimates of its magnitude. Achieving this goal will require significant progress in measuring aerosol properties, including aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo and the effect of relative humidity on these properties for both fine and coarse particles. However both ground- and space-based instruments fail or are highly biased in the presence of clouds, severely limiting quantitative estimates of the radiative effects of aerosols where they are advected over low-level clouds. Moreover, many in situ aerosol measurements exclude the coarse fraction, which can be very important in and downwind of desert regions.\nBy measuring the decay rate of a pulsed laser in an optically resonant cavity, cavity ringdown spectrometers (CRDSs) have been employed successfully in measuring aerosol extinction for particles in relative humidities below 90%. At very high humidities (as found in and near clouds), however, existing CRDSs perform poorly, diverging significantly from theoretical extinction values as humidities approach 100%. The new open-path aerosol extinction CRDS described in this poster measures extinction as aerosol is drawn through the sample cavity directly without inlets or tubing for channeling the flow, which cause particle losses, condensation at high RH and other artifacts. This poster presents the key elements of the new open-path CRDS design as well as comparisons with an earlier generation closed-path CRDS and preliminary data obtained during a field study at the 300 meter tower at NOAA’s Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) in Colorado.",

            "abstract": "An important manifestation of plasma transport in the ionosphere is Subauroral Polarization Streams or SAPS, which are strong westward flow lying just equatorward of the electron auroral oval and thus of enhanced ionospheric conductivities of the auroral oval. While SAPS are known to intensify due to substorm injections, recent studies showed that large variability of SAPS flow can occur well after substorm onset and even during non-substorm times. These SAPS enhancements have been suggested to occur in association with auroral streamers that propagate equatorward and then turn azimuthally, a suggestion that would indicate that plasma sheet fast flows propagate into the inner magnetosphere and increase subauroral flows. We present auroral images from the THEMIS ground-based all-sky-imager array and 2-d line-of-sight flow observations from the SuperDARN radars that share fields of view with the imagers to investigate systematically the association between SAPS and auroral streamers. We surveyed events from December 2007 to April 2010 for which high or mid-latitude SuperDARN radars were available to measure the SAPS flows, and identified 30 events. For streamers observed near the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval either while turning, or after having turned, westward, we find westward flow enhancements of ~200 m/s slightly equatorward of the streamers. A preliminary survey suggests that >90% of the streamers that turn westward lead to westward flow enhancements. We also characterize the SAPS flow channel width and timing relative to streamers reaching radar echo meridians. The strong influence of auroral streamers on rapid evolution of SAPS flows suggests that transient fast earthward plasma sheet flows can lead to westward SAPS flow enhancements in the subauroral region, and that such enhancements are far more common than just during substorms because of the frequent occurrences of streamers under various geomagnetic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Changes in future and historical extreme events may have disastrous consequences in vulnerable systems such as the warm- permafrost-dominated Interior region of Alaska. This paper presents a study examining extreme hydro-climate events (temperature, precipitation and streamflow) in Interior Alaskan watersheds, focused on results from Fairbanks, Alaska, located within the Chena River basin. Results are presented for an ensemble of global climate models (GCMs) and emission scenarios, run through to 2100. GCMs, selected for performance over the Alaskan domain, project the largest increases in minimum daily minimum temperature (TNn), compared to maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx), in the winter and spring at the Fairbanks Airport station. The increases in TNn and TXx are much larger (two to four times) than the across GCM standard deviations, indicating robustness in the projected changes. Statistically significant increases in five-day maximum precipitation are also projected to occur by the 2080s, with the largest increases expected for the summer and fall seasons. Streamflow projections provided by running the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model, coupled with the SNOW17 snow model, are analyzed using a generalized extreme value (GEV) theorem and nonparametric trend approach. The Chena River basin exhibits linear nonstationary increases in maximum and minimum annual streamflow projected by the 2080s under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, minimized by the Akaike Information Criteria statistic, corrected for small sample sizes. Changes are indicative of increased flow volumes in the summer and fall, following precipitation changes projected to occur during these seasons. These changes are distinct from trends and GEV analysis performed on the historical streamflow series, which indicate declining flows associated with the loss of snowpack observed as a statistically significant reduction in relative flow volume (-49%, p-value 0.01) during the May-June period for the Chena River. These results paint a compelling picture of shifting ecosystems and future changes to water resources that may pose risks to ecology and infrastructure in the region.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the transport of hydraulic fracturing (HF) fluid that is injected into the deep subsurface for shale gas extraction is important to ensure that shallow drinking water aquifers are not contaminated from an environmental and public health perspective and to understand formation damage from an oil and gas production perspective. Upward pressure gradients, permeable pathways such as faults or improperly abandoned wellbores, and the density contrast of the HF fluid to the surrounding brine encourages upward HF fluid migration. In contrast, the very low shale permeability and the imbibition of water into partially-saturated shale may sequester much of the HF fluid. Using the Finite Element Heat and Mass Transfer Code (FEHM), single-phase flow and transport simulations are performed to quantify how much HF fluid is removed via the wellbore as flowback and produced water and how much reaches overlying aquifers; imbibition is calculated with a semi-analytical one-dimensional solution and treated as a sink term. The travel time for HF fluid to reach the shallow aquifers is highly dependent on the amount of water imbibed and the suction applied to the well. If imbibition rates and suction are small, the pressure transient due to injection and the density contrast allows rapid upward plume migration at early times. The density contrast diminishes considerably within tens to hundreds of years as mixing occurs. We present estimates of HF fluid migration to shallow aquifers during the first 1,000 years after hydraulic fracturing begins for ranges of subsurface properties.",

Quantifying the impact of HONO as a source of daytime oxidant is crucial to forming a more explicit understanding of tropospheric ozone formation. In this work, ambient observations of HONO were made during the 2013 and 2014 Uintah Basin Wintertime Ozone Study (UBWOS) at a field site in Utah using various analytical techniques including chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS), differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS), and long path absorption photometry (LOPAP). Observations of HONO and HO2NO2 will be presented and compared to model results using a chemical box model applying explicit MCM chemistry to describe an ozone formation event observed during the 2013 wintertime season. Strong inversions leading to a build-up of many primary and secondary pollutants as well as low temperatures drove daytime HO2NO2 observations as high as 1.5 ppbv during the 2013 study. The potential of these high HO2NO2 concentrations as an interference to the various HONO measurements techniques will be discussed. Daytime HONO observations will be presented and analyzed with respect to coinciding vertical gradients, sampling artifacts, and potential instrumental interferences.",

Using the SWPC operational event repository, we compared the forecast for CME arrival time with ground-truth Wind observations and found multiple examples in which the CME forecast failed principally because of incorrect specification of the upstream solar wind speed.

            "abstract": "The middle Miocene Monterey Formation has long been debated as a crucial global sink for organic carbon that led to global cooling. We evaluate proxies for the microbial ecosystem to investigate organic carbon burial within the phosphate-rich interval of the Monterey Formation at Naples Beach, California by combining mineralogical evidence with δ34S analyses of carbonate associated sulfate (CAS). All δ34S are below Miocene seawater values (~22‰, VCDT) and range from +12.2‰ to +18.5‰. δ34SCAS < δ34Sseawater sulfate is typical of microbial environments at or near the interface between oxic and suboxic waters. Low pyrite concentrations characteristic of the Monterey Formation indicate that the system is iron-limited; iron reducing bacteria consume all ferric iron, producing a small amount of pyrite. Sulfate reducing bacteria then consume the excess, residual sulfate, generating free H2S in the absence of available iron. H2S diffuses upward towards the sediment-water interface (an oxic-suboxic mixing zone) where H2S is oxidized to 34S-depleted sulfate either aerobically or coupled to nitrate reduction, and lowers seawater pH. The high phosphate content and low carbonate content of this interval of the Monterey Formation supports a model of precipitation in lower pH waters. Assuming a -40‰ fractionation of δ34S due to microbial sulfate reduction, we estimate at least a 10%-20% contribution of sulfate from sulfide oxidation to marine porewater sulfate. These results suggest that the phosphate-rich interval of the Monterey Formation housed a complex suite of iron and sulfate reducing bacteria as well as sulfide oxidizing bacteria, suggesting that significant organic carbon was consumed during early diagenesis and may account for low organic carbon content described in previous studies.",

Evolution of the magnetotail is revealed in the hybrid simulation. The response of the ring current and radiation belts is calculated by coupling the CIMI model to the global hybrid model. The hybrid simulation results provide the CIMI model with the magnetic field and electric potential at the high‑latitude ionosphere boundary and plasma density and full ion phase space distribution function at the outer boundary at the equator. Our simulation shows that the ion velocity distributions in the tail are non-Maxwellian, with the existence of multiple ion beams, which have a significant impact on the ring current and the convection electric field. Detailed results will be presented for cases with various IMF and solar wind conditions, and the simulation will be compared with satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of slow slip events (SSEs) at subduction margins is critical to our understanding of seismic and aseismic fault behavior in these regions. The Hikurangi subduction margin adjacent to the North Island, New Zealand, provides an ideal natural laboratory to study SSEs, since both shallow and deep SSEs are observed there, and they are also correlated with the locking behavior, which varies from south to north. In our initial work, we included the effects of material property variations using a New-Zealand-wide seismic velocity model (Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2010), as well as an improved interface geometry (Williams et al., 2013), to provide improved slip estimates for portions of two SSEs: the Manawatu event from September - December, 2010, and the Kapiti event from January - July, 2013.\nWe have now improved our original technique, in which we use the finite element code PyLith (Aagaard et al., 2013) to generate Green’s functions using material properties from the seismic velocity model, and then use these Green’s functions in the DEFNODE inversion program (McCaffrey, 1995; 2002). Using our improved method, we re-examine a number of Hikurangi SSEs to provide revised slip estimates. We find that the inclusion of the more realistic material properties reduces the estimated slip by approximately one third, in comparison to models assuming a uniform elastic half-space. This highlights the necessity to account for realistic physical property variations of the crust in studies of slow slip—accounting for this can greatly impact the estimated slip budget accommodated by SSEs at subduction zones, as well as the equivalent moment magnitude of SSEs. In addition, we have developed an alternative inversion code that we apply to the same SSEs. By doing this, we are able to estimate the sensitivity of our results to: 1) Assumed interface geometry, 2) Variations in elastic structure, and 3) Inversion technique. By quantifying the sensitivity of our solution to these effects, we should be able to provide much more robust slip estimates for SSEs at the Hikurangi margin and elsewhere.",

            "abstract": "High-rate, low-latency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data are being refined for real-time applications to monitor and report motions related to large earthquakes in coastal British Columbia. Given the tectonic setting of Canada’s west coast, specific goals for real-time regional geodetic monitoring are: (1) the collection of GNSS data with adequate station density to identify the deformation field for regional earthquakes with M>7.3; (2) the robust, continuous real-time analyses of GNSS data with a precision of 1-2 cm and a latency of less than 10s; and (3) the display of results with attending automated alarms and estimations of earthquake parameters. Megathrust earthquakes (M>8) are the primary targets for immediate identification, since the tsunamis they generate will strike the coast within 15 to 20 min. However, large (6.0<M<7.5) normal or strike-slip earthquakes when occurring within the ocean plate offshore could be mistakenly identified as large-scale tsunamigenic events and need to be discriminated from subduction thrust ruptures in order to avoid tsunami “false alarms” and unwarranted mitigation responses.\nLocally-produced results from the commercial software packages RTD and RTnet are augmented by real-time precise point positioning streams for regional sites received from the Canadian Geodetic Survey (CGS), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO). The comparison of these various real-time solutions allows a realistic evaluation of day-to-day software performance especially when faced with adverse conditions such as data gaps or poor satellite geometry. Forward models for scenario earthquakes in this region are used to \"fingerprint\" the coseismic displacements expected from various offshore events which allows an evaluation of the effectiveness of the current regional coverage. The present distribution and density of real-time sites is largely sufficient for aiding the timely estimation of size, location, and nature of a great (M>8) megathrust earthquake. However, current coverage is inadequate for the unambiguous identification of the same parameters for 7<M<8 earthquakes, especially those occurring offshore northern Vancouver Island.",

            "abstract": "We have developed an updated Version 4 (V4) polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) data set from 35 years of SBUV measurements. The detection threshold has been revised to better represent the expected variation of PMC brightness with scattering angle. We now recommend the use of 273 nm directional albedo values to reduce uncertainties associated with instrument noise. We present our analysis of the V4 PMC data set in terms of ice water content (IWC), using a parameterization of regression results from a microphysical model to determine IWC from observed albedo. While we derive a local time adjustment as a function of IWC in order to use all SBUV measurements, we also find that our long-term trend analysis is insensitive to the nature of this function.\nIn contrast to our earlier published work assuming a linear long-term trend of the SBUV time series, our new multiple linear regression results indicate that the anti-correlated response to solar activity and the increasing trend were both stronger in the first part of our data record (through ~1996) compared to the latter part. The use of a two-part linear trend for this analysis provides a long-term forcing similar to observed variations in upper stratospheric ozone and lower stratospheric temperature, as suggested earlier by Lübken et al [2011]. The fraction of total variance in the IWC time series explained by the multiple regression model is significantly smaller for all Southern Hemisphere latitudes compared to the corresponding Northern Hemisphere latitude. This suggests that interannual variability (not captured by our simple model) plays a larger role in the Southern Hemisphere. Possible explanations for the mid-1990’s ‘break’ in the long-term record are offered.\nLübken, F.‐J., and U.

            "abstract": "Mineral carbonation is a Carbon Capture and Storage (CSS) technology where gaseous CO2 is reacted with alkaline materials (such as silicate minerals and alkaline industrial wastes) and converted into stable and environmentally benign carbonate minerals (Metz et al., 2005). Here, we present a holistic, transparent life cycle assessment model of aqueous mineral carbonation built using a hybrid process model and economic input-output life cycle assessment approach. We compared the energy efficiency and the net CO2 storage potential of various mineral carbonation processes based on different feedstock material and process schemes on a consistent basis by determining the energy and material balance of each implementation (Kirchofer et al., 2011). In particular, we evaluated the net CO2 storage potential of aqueous mineral carbonation for serpentine, olivine, cement kiln dust, fly ash, and steel slag across a range of reaction conditions and process parameters. A preliminary systematic investigation of the tradeoffs inherent in mineral carbonation processes was conducted and guidelines for the optimization of the life-cycle energy efficiency are provided.\nThe life-cycle assessment of aqueous mineral carbonation suggests that a variety of alkalinity sources and process configurations are capable of net CO2 reductions. The maximum carbonation efficiency, defined as mass percent of CO2 mitigated per CO2 input, was 83% for CKD at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. In order of decreasing efficiency, the maximum carbonation efficiencies for the other alkalinity sources investigated were: olivine, 66%; SS, 64%; FA, 36%; and serpentine, 13%.\nFor natural alkalinity sources, availability is estimated based on U.S. production rates of a) lime (18 Mt/yr) or b) sand and gravel (760 Mt/yr) (USGS, 2011). The low estimate assumes the maximum sequestration efficiency of the alkalinity source obtained in the current work and the high estimate assumes a sequestration efficiency of 85%. The total CO2 storage potential for the alkalinity sources considered in the U.S. ranges from 1.3% to 23.7% of U.S. CO2 emissions, depending on the assumed availability of natural alkalinity sources and efficiency of the mineral carbonation processes.",

            "abstract": "While the greater Everglades contains a vast wetland, evapotranspiration (ET) is a major source of water “loss” from the system. Like other ecosystems, the Everglades is vulnerable to drought. Everglades restoration science and resource management requires information on the spatial and temporal distribution of ET. We developed a fully-automated ET model using the Vegetation Index-Temperature Trapezoid concept. The model was tested and evaluated against in-situ ET observations collected at the Shark River Slough Mangrove Forest eddy-covariance tower in Everglades National Park (Sitename / FLUXNET ID: Florida Everglades Shark River Slough Mangrove Forest / US-Skr). It uses Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data from Landsat 5, and Landsat 5 thermal and air temperature data from the Daily Gridded Surface Dataset to output the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (AET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET). When multiplied with a PET estimate, this output can be used to estimate ET at high spatial resolution. Furthermore, it can be used to downscale coarse resolution ET and PET products. Two example outputs covering the agricultural lands north of the major Everglades wetlands extracted from two different dates are shown below along with a National Land Cover Database image from 2011. The irrigated and non-irrigated farms are easily distinguishable from the background (i.e., natural land covers). Open water retained the highest AET/PET ratio. Wetlands had a higher AET/PET ratio than farmlands. The main challenge in this study area is prolonged cloudiness during the growing season.",

            "abstract": "Typhoon Haiyan (2013) caused devastating damage over the Philippines. Based on the best-track data, the maximum intensity of Haiyan during its lifetime reached 895 hPa as the central pressure and 65 m/s as the sustained wind speed. Representation of the intensity of such super-intense tropical cyclones in numerical simulations is a challenging issue. This study investigates the quantitative representations of the intensification of Typhoon Haiyan (2013) in numerical simulations at the horizontal resolutions on the order of 1 km. In the control run, we successfully reproduced the intensification, evolution, and maximum intensity of Haiyan: the simulated minimum central pressure and maximum wind speed was 896.6 hPa and 67.2 m/s, respectively. If the computation of the 2nd domain was initiated 1-day later, the simulated typhoon failed to achieve that maximum intensity because of a slower intensification. If the nested domain was not ingested, the minimum central pressure in the 3-km run was 928.8 hPa. Nesting a finer-resolution domain (i.e., 333-m resolution) reproduced the rapid intensification of the typhoon. We here examine the environmental CAPE amount which is calculated along the TC track within the 100-km distance from the TC center at the time 12-hour before when the TC is located. The analysis on convective available potential energy (CAPE) before the rapid intensification indicates that the environmental CAPE accumulates before the intensification along the typhoon track. Resolving convective development in the inner core of the typhoon at its early stage and the existence of a sufficient amount of convective instability in the environment along the TC track are keys to quantitative representation of the evolution and intensity of Typhoon Haiyan (2013). From the analyses, the accumulation of CAPE before the initiation of rapidly intensifying phase of tropical cyclones put forth by Miyamoto and Takemi (2013) seems to play a role in the intensification of Typhoon Haiyan by providing a favorable condition. The quantitative representation of the evolution and intensity of Typhoon Haiyan led to a successful simulation of the storm surge induced by Haiyan over Leyte Gulf (Mori et al. 2014).",

The last several years have witnessed significant progress in investigation of the SCS through comprehensive research programs using multidisciplinary approaches and enhanced international collaboration. In January-March 2014, International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 349 drilled and cored five sites in the SCS, with three sites located near the relict spreading center in the East and Southwest Subbasins and two sites near the transition zone between the oceanic and continental crust (Expedition 349 Scientists, 2014). The expedition successfully obtained the first basaltic rock samples of the SCS relict spreading center, discovered large and frequent deep-sea turbidity events, and sampled multiple seamount volcaniclastic layers. The Expedition 349 shipboard and shorebased research involves the participation and strong collaboration of scientists from the international community including scientists from countries and regions surrounding the SCS. Meanwhile, major progress in studying the SCS processes has also been made through comprehensive multidisciplinary programs, for example, the “South China Sea Deep” initiative (Wang, 2012).

We use P-wave receiver functions (PRFs) from the 2007-2013 Antarctic POLENET array to explore the characteristics of the MTZ throughout Marie Byrd Land and the West Antarctic Rift System. We obtained over 8000 high-quality PRFs for earthquakes occurring at 30-90° with Mb>5.5 using a time-domain iterative deconvolution method filtered with a Gaussian-width of 0.5 and 1.0, corresponding to frequencies less than ~0.24 Hz and ~0.48 Hz, respectively. We stack P receiver functions as single-station and by common conversion point and migrate them to depth using the ak135 1-d velocity model. Results suggest that the thickness of the MTZ varies throughout the region with thinning beneath the Ruppert Coast of Marie Byrd Land and beneath the Bentley Subglacial Trench and Whitmore Mountains. We identify the 520’ discontinuity throughout much of West Antarctica; the discontinuity is most prominent beneath the Bentley Subglacial Trench and Whitmore Mountains. Additionally, prominent negative peaks are detected above the transition zone beneath much of West Antarctica and may be evidence for water-induced partial melt above the MTZ. We propose that the MTZ beneath West Antarctica is hotter than average in some regions, possibly due to material upwelling from the lower mantle. Furthermore, we propose that the transition zone is water-rich and that upward migration of hydrated material results in formation of a partial melt layer above the MTZ.",

The outcomes of this research provided critical new observations and insights into fundamental geologic processes along continental margins, and associated geologic hazards and economic resources. The transition to the successor GeoPRISMS Program provided a unique opportunity to identify and synthesize the highlights of MARGINS research, and to disseminate this knowledge to educators and students who will carry out the next phase of cutting-edge scientific research. The NSF TUES Program funded a two-year project entitled: “Bringing NSF MARGINS Continental Margins Research into the Undergraduate Curriculum,“ enabling development of ~15 mini-lessons drawing on key MARGINS results and data sets. The mini-lesson development team consists of 18 educators and scientists, grouped by initiative, and guided by experts in MARGINS science and current educational research and practices. Webinars and virtual check-ins enable team interactions and exchange of ideas and experiences; in person workshops solidified pedagogical approaches and assessment strategies, as well as initiative frameworks for the mini-lessons. Field testing by team members and outside volunteers during AY 2013-14 identified challenges and opportunities, guiding mini-lesson revision and finalization. The MARGINS mini-lessons define coordinated, data-rich educational resources, easy to access and free to the public, ready to be incorporated into multiple common geoscience course frameworks, taking the first step toward building a community of practice of scientists and curriculum specialists with the shared goal of moving cutting-edge science into undergraduate classrooms.

            "abstract": "Although the Congo River is the world’s second largest, behind the Amazon, in terms of annual discharge and rain forest extent, our level of hydrologic understanding is somewhat limited largely due to a lack of in-situ measurements. This point is even more important in the context of how large tropical wetlands impact global hydrologic and carbon cycles. For example, although the Amazon and Congo are both large tropical rivers, their wetlands appear to function differently. The Congo River is also unique in that it is the only major river to cross the equator twice, which results in a year-round rainfall from the movement of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). To better understand how the Congo River wetlands function and their role in global carbon cycle, we first characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of water stores and fluxes throughout the basin. Given the limited in-situ measurements, a combination of modeling and remotely sensed measurements are used. Here, we specifically focus on the role of lake storage dynamics in the Congo River discharge. The Hillslope River Routing (HRR) hydrologic model, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation (3B42v7), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo ( MCD43C3), leaf area index (MCD15A2), land surface temperature (MOD11C1 and MYD11C1) and land cover (MCD12C1), water level changes from radar altimetry, and LandSat based extent measurements over major water bodies are used to estimate basin-wide total water storage variations. The HRR model results, which include hourly water dynamics for the Congo and surrounding basins for the period 2002-2012, are also compared to NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) measurements in order to assess the impact of GRACE signal leakage over the Congo Basin.",

Our CO2 fields are produced by simultaneously assimilating 6-hourly weather observations and AIRS-XCO2 observations into the NCAR global carbon-climate model for the year 2003. An ensemble Kalman filter is used for the data assimilation, with an ensemble size of 64, thus producing estimates of the time-evolving standard deviation and mean for the CO2 fields. From these CO2 fields we sample locations where OCO-2 observes CO2 in its 16-day nadir and glint orbit and compare the mean and variability of this subset to that of the full reanalysis. This serves as an estimate of the expected sampling bias of the instrument. We compare the sampling bias for the 16 day nadir / 16 day glint to other options such as 1 day nadir / 1 day glint.",

            "abstract": "The views expressed in this abstract are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views or policies of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nA number of geoengineering strategies have been proposed and, to date, a few are being seriously investigated as possible approaches to reducing the degree of climate change. Whether under the broad rubrics of solar radiation management (SRM) or carbon dioxide removal (CDR), these projects would involve major, intentional intervention in the world’s climate. Even if successful in off-setting the global radiative imbalance induced by human activities, it is not at all clear how well humans and the ecosystems upon which they depend will weather the climate system perturbations induced by the implementation of a large-scale geoengineering program. It is reasonable to expect that such perturbations could exacerbate the existing health and environmental consequences of anthropogenic climate change at large and small scales, or create entirely new ones.\nAn accounting of the derivative physical and biological effects of consequence to human health and ecosystems welfare that may result from the use of geoengineering is a necessary part of any policy-relevant analysis. However, the scientific understanding required to quantitatively assess these potential impacts is absent in most cases, and still nascent in others. Furthermore, current discussions and existing literature lack the fully integrated “systems” approach required for adequately assessing the short- and long-term impacts of geoengineering strategies on ecosystems and human populations. We present an overview of critical science questions, including broad questions concerning the potential response of the complex earth system to further human interference and those concerning potential impacts to local environmental metrics such as air and water quality and ecosystem viability.",

Whilst fluctuating ice cover mitigates against year-round near-field monitoring of the volcanoes, important information can be gleaned from stations deployed at the glacier's edge. Glacial cover significantly increases the complexity of and the solution space for observed seismic signals. For example tremor can be caused by magmatic activity, intra-glacier interactions, melt water flow or hydrothermal boiling. A better understanding of hazard requires a more indepth understanding of the signals generated by these processes at Vatnajökull. We augmented the sparse network in the region with two seven-element broad band seismometer arrays west of Vatnajökull, in Jökulheimar and near Laki respectively. Observed seismic tremor-like transients (< 2 Hz) originating from two cauldrons west of Grimsvötn are directly associated with small flooding events (jökulhaups), as subsequently confirmed by radar and hydrological observations. For larger longer duration floods dominant harmonic tremor frequencies of 2 to 4 Hz are observed, but they change in amplitude and frequency with time, likely reflecting variable feed and flow rates, associated with a moving source. Our aim is to 'fingerprint' these events such that they can be distinguished from seismic tremor signals associated with magmatic activity.",

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that the well known correlation between solar wind speed and temperature arises naturally from symmetries in the solar wind energy equation. In the presence of turbulent heating this explanation is only valid for high Alfven Mach number wind undergoing uniform expansion. We provide supporting evidence for this theory by studying the temperature of solar wind protons at 1 AU as a function of proton speed, Alfven Mach number, and the acceleration of the wind defined as the rate of change of speed over a range of time-scales. We confirm earlier evidence of the sensitivity of temperature to acceleration in addition to velocity. We show that the proton temperature for all solar wind with mach number greater than eight and proton speed between 300 and 800 km/s is reproduced by a three-parameter model that depends only on velocity and acceleration. The continuity of the model across this range in speeds is surprising, given the different coronal conditions and acceleration mechanisms generally attributed to slow and fast solar wind. We investigate the accuracy of the model as a function of the averaging time-scale used to calculate the acceleration and discuss the implications of those time-scales on future measurements by Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter.",

            "abstract": "Baddeleyite (ZrO2) is commonly present as an accessory mineral in silica under-saturated igneous rocks. In recent years, baddeleyite has gained popularity as a geochronological and petrological tool since it can provide important constraints on the age and geochemical evolution of mafic rocks, a rock type in which zircon, the far more routinely used mineral for geochronology, is often absent. Because baddeleyite has a high budget for U and preferentially excludes Pb from its crystal structure [1], the initial U/Pb ratio of baddeleyite is typically very high and its overall Pb isotopic composition becomes dominantly radiogenic in a relatively short timeframe. At the same time, baddeleyite has a strong affinity for Hf and a low budget for rare earth elements (REEs); therefore, the small amount of 176Lu present in baddeleyite does not significantly alter the 176Hf/177Hf composition of baddeleyite over time, making it an ideal mineral to fingerprint the initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios of its host rocks [2]. These geochemical characteristics of baddeleyite make it an important tool for studying the genesis and history both terrestrial and extraterrestrial mafic igneous rocks.\nDespite the favorable geochemical characteristics of baddeleyite outlined above, the interpretations of baddeleyite U-Pb ages and 176Hf/177Hf ratios are limited by the lack of diffusion data for these species in baddeleyite. The importance of quantifying the diffusion kinetic properties of the parent and daughter nuclides of any geochronological system has been well documented [3, 4], thus making acquisition of these data an important priority for the continued development of baddeleyite as a geochronological tool. We have performed preliminary experiments on U, Th, Pb, Hf and REE diffusion in baddeleyite, and obtained high-quality data utilizing a time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. The results of this study should provide a quantitative framework for the interpretation of baddeleyite U-Pb ages and 176Hf/177Hf ratios.\n",

            "abstract": "Scientists are spending an increasing amount of time building and using hydrology software. However, most scientists are never taught how to do this efficiently. As a result, many are unaware of tools and practices that would allow them to write more reliable and maintainable code with less effort. As hydrology models increase in capability and enter use by a growing number of scientists and their communities, it is important that the scientific software development practices scale up to meet the challenges posed by increasing software complexity, lengthening software lifecycles, a growing number of stakeholders and contributers, and a broadened developer base that extends from application domains to high performance computing centers. Many of these challenges in complexity, lifecycles, and developer base have been successfully met by the open source community, and there are many lessons to be learned from their experiences and practices. Additionally, there is much wisdom to be found in the results of research studies conducted on software engineering itself. Software Carpentry aims to bridge the gap between the current state of software development and these known best practices for scientific software development, with a focus on hands-on exercises and practical advice.\nIn 2014, Software Carpentry workshops targeting earth/environmental sciences and hydrological modeling have been organized and run at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System Annual Meeting, and the Earth Science Information Partners Summer Meeting. In this presentation, we will share some of the successes in teaching this material, as well as discuss and present instructional material specific to hydrological modeling.",

In June 2014, we initiated deep soil heating to test the responsiveness of deep peat carbon stocks, microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling processes to heating at 4 warming levels (+2.25, +4.5, +6.75 and +9 °C; 2 replicate plots) compared to fully-constructed control plots (+0 °C; 2 replicate plots). The warming treatments were deployed over eight 113 m2 areas using circular arrays of low-wattage (W) electrical resistance heaters. Perimeter heating was achieved by an exterior circle of 48 100W heaters that apply heat from the surface to a depth of 3 meters. Heating within the study area was accomplished utilizing three zones of 100W “deep only” heaters: an intermediate circle of 12 units, an interior circle of 6 units and one unit placed at the plot center. Heating elements inside the study area apply heat only from -2 to -3 m to keep active heater surfaces away from measured peat volumes. With an average peat depth of 2.5 meters this system was able to warm approximately 113 of the 282 m3 of peat within each target plot. In the absence of the air warming cap, in situ deep peat heating is only effective at sustaining warming in the deep peat layers. Warming levels at depth were achieved over a 25-day (+ 2.25 °C) to a 60-day (+9 °C) period depending on the target treatment temperatures in agreement with a priori energy balance model simulations. Homogeneous temperature distributions between heaters at a given depth interval continued to develop after these targets were reached. Biological and biogeochemical responses to these manipulations are being actively assessed. After one month of transient heating, data for ground-level surface flux of CO2 and CH4 had not shown changes from deep peat heating, but they continue to be tracked and will be summarized in this and related talks.",

From these radiance measurements, profiles of atmospheric temperature, dust and water ice are operationally retrieved from the surface to ~80 km altitude with a vertical resolution of ~5 km.\nWhile limb geometry provides superior vertical resolution over sounding in nadir geometry, it leads to significant horizontal averaging along the line-of-sight. This can lead to misrepresentations in the retrieved quantities in the presence of significant horizontal gradients of these quantities, if the retrieval assumes spherical symmetry. In MCS retrievals, this effect is particularly important in the polar winter regions due to the strong latitudinal gradients in atmospheric temperature. It leads to an apparent shift of the cold pole of the polar vortex away from the viewing direction of the instrument. The assumption of spherical symmetry can lead to misrepresentations of several K in temperature at a given latitude.\nHere we present an approach to consider these horizontal gradients by applying a two-dimensional radiative transfer scheme to the MCS retrieval. In a first pass a retrieval with the assumption of spherical symmetry is performed. From these retrieval results, horizontal gradients in temperature, pressure, dust and water ice are determined for all measurements along an MRO orbit. These gradient fields are then imposed on a second pass of the retrieval using a two-dimensional radiative transfer scheme. We show that the approach reduces misrepresentations in the retrieved temperature to typically less than 1-2 K in the wall of the polar vortex. Application of this approach to the operational MCS retrieval will lead to a significant improvement in the quality of the retrieved parameters, in particular of temperature in the winter polar regions, which have emerged as a focus of recent scientific interest.",

            "abstract": "Ice nucleation plays a critical role in the formation of ice clouds and converting liquid to ice in mixed-phase clouds. Many past heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterizations (INPs) were developed based on field measurements with the artifacts of shattering, and also not connected with aerosol particles. Recent laboratory and field measurements have led to a few new ice nucleation parameterizations connecting with aerosols, which should be implemented to models and evaluated by observations. In this study, we evaluated three very recently developed heterogeneous INPs linked with dust particles: Niemand et al. (2012), DeMott et al. (2013), and Phillips et al. (2013), using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the physics and aerosol packages from the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5). Results from the three new schemes and the default scheme by Meyers et al. (1992) are compared with available observations including aircraft measurements of cloud anvil properties of a storm case from the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign. The Meyers scheme simulates higher ice number concentrations (Ni), while the Phillips scheme simulates lower Ni and shows the best agreement with aircraft measurements in the anvil area. Although the total precipitation amount and evolution of convection are not sensitive to different INPs, the probability density functions of both precipitation and reflectivity are considerably affected by the selected INPs. Simulation with the Phillips scheme shows higher ice nucleation rate at the warmer temperatures of the mixed-phase clouds regime, leading to much smaller ice formation in the upper levels. Reduced ice formation in the upper levels is caused by changes in droplet freezing, which is affected by convection and cloud morphology. Given relatively high dust concentration in the simulated case, sensitivity experiment is performed to examine dust impact with different INPs by reducing dust number concentration to 20 % of its current value. The Phillips scheme exhibits the largest sensitivity in terms of simulated cloud properties and precipitation with decreasing dust concentrations.",

            "abstract": "The Missoula floods had the largest known peak flood discharges of fresh water known from the geologic record. Multiple floods are believed to have originated from the failure of the Purcell trench ice lobe, which dammed glacial Lake Missoula. The flood waters traveled westward creating the Channeled Scabland region, a spectacular complex of anastomosing channels, coulees, cataracts, loess islands, rock basins, broad gravel deposits, and immense gravel bars in east-central Washington State. Several important questions about the Missoula floods and the formation of the Channeled Scabland remain, primarily due to the few geochronological constraints on their timing. Attempts to date the duration of the multiple floods have produced a wide range of ages (13-19 ka from land deposits and 13-31 ka from marine cores), but few of these directly constrain the age of the major flood landscape elements. Here we present 14 new in situ cosmogenic 10Be ages from quartz-bearing boulders deposited at four sites in eastern Washington. Wallula Gap is a narrow constriction along the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington. Hydraulic damming of floodwater at Wallula Gap created glacial Lake Lewis. Surface exposure ages on large boulders found at over 300 m elevation above the river at this site will date the largest flood events. The Wenatchee region represents the most northwestern area influenced by flooding. Dates from this area will determine when flooding occurred after the retreat of the Okanogan lobe. We sampled boulders from the lower Pangborn Bar, ice-rafted boulders north of Wenatchee, and boulders from a flood bar on the Columbia River north of Wenatchee. A boulder from the Mattawa Fan was sampled to assess the last time a megaflood came through the Sentinel Gap. Finally, in order to constrain the last debris dam failure at the southern end of the Upper Grand Coulee, we sampled flood boulders deposited on the Ephrata Fan.",

            "abstract": "We propose an improved approach of calculating infiltration into unsaturated soils. The approach is built on a general concept of discretizing the moisture domain instead of the traditional spatial discretization (Talbot and Ogden, 2008. A method for computing infiltration and redistribution in a discretized moisture content domain. Water Resour. Res. 44, W08453, doi:10.1029/2008WR006815). The entire moisture domain is divided into numerous moisture bins of small increment. The hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity are strongly non-linear functions of water content, which makes the solution of Richards equation challenging. After discretizing into soil moisture bins, we can treat the conductivity and diffusivity in individual bins as moisture dependent constant evaluated at given moisture content corresponding to each bin. For each bin, we can solve the flow equations analytically since the hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity can be treated as a moisture dependent constant. We then develop analytical solutions for each bin to determine the convective and diffusive water amounts at each time step. Then the moisture amount ahead of the convective front for each bin will be redistributed to the next bin. By performing the calculations for all moisture bins, we can then compute the moisture profile, the infiltration rate and the cumulative infiltration at each time step. The proposed approach shows satisfactory agreement compared against the numerical solutions of Richards equation for several soil types. In addition to the agreement in infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration, particular improvement is observed in the evolution of moisture profiles.",

            "abstract": "Critical Coulomb wedge theory established that orogenic and accretionary wedges should develop self-similarly and maintain a critical taper that reflects the balance of strength of the wedge material and a basal décollement. However, a variety of geological processes can perturb that balance, forcing readjustment of the wedge. For example, glacial erosion and landsliding can concentrate erosion on a localized portion of the wedge slope, leaving that portion of the wedge with an out-of-equilibrium slope that would need to re-develop for the wedge to resume self-similar growth. We use the discrete element method to analyze how growing bivergent wedges with different cohesive strengths respond structurally and mechanically to erosional events localized along upper, middle, and lower segments of the pro-wedge. Mechanically, pro-wedge erosion results in a sudden decrease followed by a quick recovery of the mean stress and maximum shear stress throughout the pro-wedge. However, when erosion is localized in the mid- to lower portions of the pro-wedge, a zone of increased mean stress develops where the wedge is concentrating deformation to recover its taper. In contrast, when erosion is localized in the upper axial zone, there is almost no recovery of the wedge taper, reflecting the fact that the material at the top of the wedge is being carried passively in a transition zone between the pro-wedge and retro-wedge. Structurally, wedges composed of lower cohesion material recover their critical taper almost immediately through distributed deformation, while wedges of higher-cohesion material recover more slowly, and incompletely, by concentrating deformation along existing fault surfaces. As a result, localized erosional episodes can have a lasting effect on the wedge morphology when the wedge is composed of higher cohesion material.",

            "abstract": "Bedload transport and flow competence relations are difficult to predict in coarse-bedded steep streams where widely differing sediment supply, bed stability, and complex flow hydraulics greatly affect amounts and sizes of transported gravel particles. This study explains how properties of bed material surface and subsurface size distributions are directly related to gravel transport and may be used for prediction of gravel transport and flow competence relations.\nGravel transport, flow competence, and bed material size were measured in step-pool and plane-bed streams. Power functions were fitted to gravel transport QB=aQb and flow competence Dmax=cQd relations; Q is water discharge. Frequency distributions of surface FDsurf and subsurface FDsub bed material were likewise described by power functions FDsurf=hD j and FDsub=kDm fitted over six 0.5-phi size classes within 4 to 22.4 mm. Those gravel sizes are typically mobile even in moderate floods.\nStudy results show that steeper subsurface bed material size distributions lead to steeper gravel transport and flow competence relations, whereas larger amounts of sediment contained in those 6 size bedmaterial classes (larger h and k) flatten the relations. Similarly, steeper surface size distributions decrease the coefficients of the gravel transport and flow competence relations, whereas larger amounts of sediment within the six bed material classes increase the intercepts of gravel transport and flow competence relations. Those relations are likely causative in streams where bedload stems almost entirely from the channel bed as opposed to direct (unworked) contributions from hillslopes and tributaries. The exponent of the subsurface bed material distribution m predicted the gravel transport exponent b with r2 near 0.7 and flow competence exponent d with r2 near 0.5. The intercept of bed surface distributions h increased the intercept a of gravel transport and c of the flow competence relations with r2 near 0.6.",

            "abstract": "Melt pond formation atop Arctic sea ice is a primary control of shortwave energy balance and light availability for photosynthesis in the upper Arctic Ocean. The initial formation process of melt ponds on first year ice typically requires that melt water be retained on the surface of ice several to tens of centimeters above sea level for several days. Albedo feedbacks during this time period create below-sea-level depressions which remain ponds later in summer. Both theory and observations, however, show that sea ice is so highly porous and permeable prior to the formation of melt ponds that retention of water tens of centimeters above hydraulic equilibrium for multiple days should not be possible. Here we present results of percolation test experiments that identify the mechanism allowing above-sea level melt pond formation. The infiltration of fresh water from snowmelt into the pore structure of the ice is responsible for plugging the pores with fresh ice, sealing the ice against further water percolation, and allowing water to pool above freeboard. Fresh meltwater availability and desalination processes, therefore, exert considerable influence over the formation of melt ponds. The findings demonstrate another mechanism through which changes in snowfall on sea ice, already being observed, are likely to alter ice mass balance and highlight the importance of efforts to improve treatment of ice salinity in models.",

            "abstract": "From the AMMA-CATCH Observatory located in West Africa, a complete data set of surface exchanges over various vegetation landcovers is analysed. It is shown these exchanges, especially the Evapo-transpiration (ETR), primarily rely on surface soil moisture at annual time scales because of the seasonal cycle of the West African monsoon and the corresponding precipitation. However, at finer time scales, soil moisture dependencies are much more complex and no simple relation exists between ETR and soil moisture, especially when vegetation has developed. If the presence of adequate soil moisture is a prerequisite for any ETR rate, the interactions between all surface processes render the use of simple models inadequate.\nSeveral illustrations will be presented based on data analysis and ALMIP experiments. One of them concerns the surface model response at daily time step after a rain event. It is shown that, for all the experimental sites, the immediate surface response is mainly dependent on the soil moisture content especially for bare soil conditions. The ALMIP model ensemble broadly reproduce the ETR annual cycle but depicts a broad range of relationships between Evaporative Fraction and soil moisture, with the worst results for the driest sites.\nThe second illustration concerns a comparison of local modelling results with in situ data. It is shown that the CLM model parameterisations are able to reproduce surface conductances. For bare soil conditions, the soil moisture dependency follows the Sakagushi law. During the vegetated period (over fallow), the evaporation rate is no longer controlled by soil moisture but by the radiative budget of the canopy and the amount of energy that reaches the ground. Finally, the Ball & Berry conductance model is able to reproduce transpiration rate reasonably well. This model is a function of incoming radiation and soil moisture, but also leaf temperature which impacts all of the surface energy exchanges.",

Here we show that heat capacity of metals can be measured to the 10-100 GPa range by using AC electrical heating inside diamond anvil cells. Frequencies of f ≈ 1-100 MHz must be used to contain the heat within the sample of interest, as evidenced by numerical and physical models of heat flow: f > DinsCins2/(Csamdsam)2, where Dins is the thermal diffusivity of the insulation, Cins and Csam are specific heat capacities of insulation and metal sample, and dsam is sample thickness. Heat must be deposited uniformly (e.g. skin depth > sample thickness) for the most accurate and unambiguous measurements, thereby allowing measurement of the energetics of pre-melting, melting and partial melting of metals, including iron and its alloys. In principle, high-pressure calorimetry can be used to independently determine melting at high pressures, and also to quantify latent heats of fusion, thereby revealing the density of liquid metals at Earth core conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Somali cross-equatorial jet is estimated to contribute up to half of the mass flux crossing the equator during the Asian monsoon season. Previous studies have argued that the Somali jet is strengthened by the East African Highlands, which act as a wall and accelerate the flow (e.g., Krishnamurti et al. 1976, Sashegyi and Geisler 1987). Besides, observational studies have shown a positive correlation between the strength of the Somali jet and the South Asian Monsoon (SAM) precipitation (e.g., Findlater 1969, Halpern and Woiceshyn 2001). These imply that the existence of the topography would relate to a stronger SAM. However, in a more recent study, Chakraborty et al. (2002) found that if the African topography is removed in a comprehensive general circulation model (GCM), the SAM strengthens.\nIn this study, we use the GFDL AM2.1 GCM to conduct experiments with and without topography in Africa, to further examine its influence on the cross-equatorial Somali jet and the SAM. We find that when the African topography is removed, the SAM precipitation increases, consistent with the results in Chakraborty et al. (2002). Interestingly, our results also show that the cross-equatorial Somali jet does weaken in the absence of the African topography, in agreement with previous studies. The moisture budget shows that the increase in precipitation in the no-African topography experiment is primarily due to stronger wind convergence. The dynamics of the cross-equatorial Somali jet is investigated within the framework of the Potential Vorticity (PV) budget, showing the contribution of the changes in friction and diabatic heating to the circulation as the topography is removed. A backward trajectory analysis is also conducted to further examine the influence of topography on both the material tendencies of the PV budget and trajectories of parcels reaching the Indian subcontinent.",

            "abstract": "The critical zone (CZ) represents a major life-sustaining realm of the terrestrial surface. The processes controlling the development and transformation of the CZ are important to continued health of the planet as human influence continues to grow. The CZ encompasses the shallow subsurface, a region of reaction, unsaturated flow, and transport. Chemical weathering in the subsurface is one of the important processes involved in the formation and functioning of the CZ. We present two case studies of reactive transport modeling to investigate the influence of subsurface heterogeneity and unsaturated flow on chemical weathering processes in the CZ. The model is implemented using the reactive transport code PFLOTRAN. Heterogeneity in subsurface flow is represented using multiple realizations of conductive fracture networks in a hillslope cross-section. The first case study is motivated by observations at the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (BCCZO) including extensive hydrologic and geochemical datasets. The simulations show that fractures greatly enhance weathering as compared to a homogeneous porous medium. Simulations of north-facing slope hydrology with prolonged snowmelt pulses also increases weathering rates, showing the importance of slope aspect on weathering intensity. Recent work elucidates deteriorating water quality caused by climate change in the CZ of watersheds where acid rock drainage (ARD) occurs. The more complex reactions of ARD require a customized kinetic reaction module with PFLOTRAN. The second case study explores the mechanisms by which changes in hydrologic forcing, air and ground temperatures, and water table elevations influence ARD. For instance, unreacted pyrite exposed by a water table drop was shown to produce a 125% increase in annual pyrite oxidization rate, which provides one explanation for increased ARD.",

            "abstract": "High-quality ocean color measurements are needed to characterize water quality and phytoplankton functional types in the coastal zone. Accurate ocean color retrievals are often confounded by inadequacies in atmospheric correction. The recent NASA COAST, HyspIRI, and OCEANIA suborbital missions over Monterey Bay, CA have used novel instruments in a multi-sensor, multi-platform approach to collect above- and in-water measurements to better characterize ocean color through improvements in instrument dynamic range and attention to atmospheric correction. High-level objectives of these missions are to characterize the coastal ocean through end-to-end assessment of image acquisition, atmospheric correction, algorithm application, and sea-truth observations to improve vicarious calibration and validation of satellite ocean color products. We present results from COAST, HyspIRI, and OCEANIA to demonstrate the importance of coincident atmospheric and sea-truth measurements to improve atmospheric correction. Our specific objective was to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the atmospheric correction algorithm, Tafkaa, on Headwall Imaging Spectrometer data using input parameters of atmospheric aerosol optical depth spectra and column water vapor obtained from the Ames Airborne Tracking Sunphotometer (AATS-14) collected on the CIRPAS Twin Otter during COAST (2011). Use of the high dynamic-range, in-water Compact-Optical Profiling System (C-OPS) and above-water Coastal Airborne In-situ Radiometers (C-AIR) with matched wavelength channels enabled accurate observations of exact water-leaving radiance to use in validating imagery. Results from HyspIRI and OCEANIA (October 2013) flown on the NASA ER-2 and CIRPAS Twin Otter will be presented. Knowledge gained from these missions will improve vicarious calibration and validation of legacy (MODIS) and future (PACE & GEO-CAPE) satellite sensors to better characterize coastal ecosystems using ocean color observations.",

            "abstract": "BayesLoc is a Bayesian multiple-event seismic locator that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample possible seismic hypocenters, travel-time corrections, and the precision of observed arrival data (absolute picks and differential times based on cross-correlated waveforms). By simultaneously locating multiple seismic events, regional biases in the assumed travel-time model (e.g., ak135) can be estimated and corrected for, and data from different seismic stations and phases can be weighted to reflect their accuracy/precision for an event cluster. As such, multiple-event locators generally yield more accurate locations than single-event locators, which lack the data to resolve the underlying travel-time model and adaptively “weight” the arrival data differently for each station and phase. On the other hand, single-event locators are computationally more attractive, making them more suitable for rapid (realtime) location of seismic activity. We present a novel approach to approximate the location accuracy of the BayesLoc multiple-event analysis at a computational cost that is comparable to BayesLoc single-event analysis. The proposed approach consists of two steps: a precomputed multiple-event training analysis and subsequent real-time, single-event location for new events. The precomputed training analsysis consists of carrying out a multiple-event BayesLoc run in a given target event cluster, yielding a posterior sample of travel-time corrections and weights. Given a new event in the vicinity of the training cluster, a BayesLoc single-event run is carried out which samples the travel-time corrections and weights from the multiple-event training run. Hence, it has all the benefits of the multiple-event run at the cost of a single-event run. We present the theoretical underpinnings of the new approach and we compare event location results for the full multiple-event, single-event, and the new approaches.

            "abstract": "Persistent societal interest in improving water quality and recovering imperiled, native, aquatic species has expanded the scope of stream restoration to include the hyporheic zone as a focus. Despite the lack of detailed studies, hyporheic restoration is often invoked as a means to achieve multiple objectives including moderation of water temperature, delay of seasonal flows and increasing the localized volume of floodplain water. We present interim results from an ongoing case study that monitors the changes as a result of stream restoration of the hyporheic zone of a 4th order, alluvial floodplain in northeast Oregon, USA, Meacham Creek. Active and passive restoration of 2.5 km of Meacham Creek has altered the creek from a single-threaded, incised and bedrock-dominated channel to a perched, alluvial channel that seasonally exchanges overbank flows with the surrounding floodplain. Our results suggest that the stream restoration effort on Meacham Creek has increased the volume of annual hyporheic storage and created a more diverse distribution of flowpath lengths within the restoration site. Furthermore, our monitoring indicates that hyporheic process response to stream restoration, analogous to other geomorphic processes, conforms to a systematic hierarchy where nested flow paths range in length and residence time from meters and hours at the habitat scale to tens of meters and months at the floodplain scale. We assert that scale-explicit and measurement-focused restoration planning has a greater likelihood of meeting the stated objectives and result in improved water quality and encourage recovery of many native aquatic species.",

            "abstract": "The Marum ophiolite in Papua New Guinea described an ultra-depleted mantle made by dunite and harzburgite showing compositions of supra-subduction zone peridotite. This depleted mantle has been fertilised by diffuse crystallisation of a low proportion of clinopyroxene in the dunite and formation of ol-websterite and ol-clinopyroxenite at cm scale cross-cutting the foliation and the primary pyroxenite layering. This percolating melt shows silica-rich magnesian affinities (boninite-like) related to supra-subduction zone in a fore-arc environment. The peridotite has also been percolated by a melt with more tholeiite affinities precipitating plagioclase-rich wehrlite and thin gabbroic veins.\nCrystallographic preferred orientations of minerals show that clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene in the harzburgite and orthopyroxenite veins crystallized under the same deformation constraints as the depleted dunite. However, for low melt proportion, such as the clinopyroxenes in the dunite, their crystallization can be governed by epitaxial growth. Epitaxial growth is also possible in the ol-websterite where an area with low melt fraction (5% of clinopyroxenes), clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene <001> axes are parallel to olivine <100> axes, while in an area with higher melt fraction (28% of clinopyroxenes) clinopyroxenes record their own orientation with <001> axes at nearly 90˚ to the olivine <100> axes suggesting a reorientation of the constraints. The same relationship has been observed within the plagioclase-rich wehrlite suggesting the same deformation conditions during percolation of boninitic affinities melt and a more tholeiitic affinities melt.\nThe major inferred slip system in olivine is (001)[100] E-type slip with the possible activation of both (001)[100] E-type and (010)[100] A-type slip systems, which are activated at high-temperature low-stress conditions. Olivine E-type slip is predicted to operate within the mantle wedge in a back-arc position however the Marum peridotite has a fore-arc geodynamic position and chemical composition similar to mantle from SSZ. As a consequence, the Marum peridotite is considered as mantle in front of the arc located near the E-type to B-type transition.",

            "abstract": "Classical dual-porosity models and homogenization approaches fail to represent the permeability scaling, the high flow channeling and the broad variability observed in natural fractured media. More critically, most modeling frameworks cannot restitute simultaneously the permeability increase with scale and the persistence of channeling. In fact, channeling enhances the impact of bottlenecks, reduces permeability, and increases permeability variability with scale. It is the case of percolation theory but also of more advanced large-range correlated theories including power-law scaling of some of the fracture properties including their length or their mutual distances.\nMore generally, we show with extensive numerical studies on 3D Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) that hydraulic behaviors come from a number of local and global fracture characteristics. The concept of effective properties like effective permeability itself appears quite weak and should be replaced by new modeling frameworks. We propose three alternative approaches combining the specificies of fracture flow and transport of DFNs and the simplicity of continuum approaches:\n1- Discrete dual porosity media for high flow localization in a subset of the fracture network.\n2- Structured Interacting Continua for highly organized diffusive processes in poorly connected fracture structures.\n3- Multiple-scale permeability models for hierarchically structured fractured media with 3D concurrent fracture percolating networks.\nThese different approaches can be combined and specified with a limited number of parameters. They are also efficient in representing the potentially large hydraulic impact of minor modification of the fracture network geometry and local connectivity.",

            "abstract": "Chondrites are considered as the building rocks of the Earth as they represent remnants of the protoplanetary accretion stage. Among all chondritic classes, heavy noble gases are mainly concentrated in phase Q [1] hence it represents a likely primordial composition of the Earth. This is supported by the observation of [2] who detected this peculiar composition in CO2 well gases thanks to Kr isotopes. As CO2 well gases are supposed to derive from the same reservoir as MORBs [3], this signature should be observed in MORBs and OIBs as well. In this perspective, we will present analyses performed by mass spectrometry of MORBs and OIBs samples for all noble gases. Preliminary results are quite promising as the same trend seems to appear into OIB and MORB data for Kr isotopes.\nHowever, our analyses show that this primordial composition isn’t displayed for stable isotopes of Xe as already observed by [4-5] and remains a trace in the mantle signature, which appears at first sight atmospheric. We thus propose that subduction of atmospheric noble gases has gradually covered this meteoritic imprint. In order to test this scenario, we will present a modelling performed for Ar and Xe in three distinct reservoirs: mantle, atmosphere and continental crust. The mantle is considered as homogenized by convection and similar to the MORB reservoir. Its degasing is divided in two stages: a massive early degasing followed by a decreasing one describing the cooling of the Earth’s interior. Extraction of parent elements from the mantle to the continental crust is also taken into account as well as distillation of atmospheric Xe needed to explain the missing Xe paradox and the present Xe isotopic signature of the atmosphere. Finally, subduction of noble gases is assimilated to simple incorporation into the mantle of elementally fractionated air, enriched in heavy noble gases as supported by [6]. Thus, we show that starting with a chondritic composition, the present mantle composition can be reproduced and that subduction plays a major role as it explains the nearly atmospheric signature of the mantle for Xe stable isotopes and considerably lowers the radiogenic isotopic ratios.\n[1] Huss et al., GCA (1996) [2] Holland et al., Sci.

            "abstract": "In this work we present an approach to perform electromagnetic (EM) monitoring using surface magnetotelluric (MT) data. The proposed methodology, called layer stripping, is based on the analytical solution of the one-dimensional MT problem and the fact that resolution to resistivity changes produced at a given depth increase when increasing the depth at which data are acquired. Thus, giving a well-known geoelectrical baseline model of a reservoir site, the layer stripping approach aims to remove the effect of the upper, unchanging, structures in order to obtain the time-varying MT responses at the target depth.\nIn this paper the proposed method is tested and validated using the 3D geoelectrical baseline model of the Hontomín site (Spain) for CO2 geological storage in a deep saline aquifer. The 3D resistivity model of Hontomín defines the subsurface in the pre-injection state, showing the dome-like structure of the saline aquifer and imaging the principal set of faults. For monitoring purposes, the model allows obtaining the MT responses at the main reservoir depth using the layer stripping approach to remove the upper structures not affected by the injection of the gas.\nThe results obtained in this work suggest that the layer stripping method improves the resolution of surface MT responses being able to detect smaller resistivity changes.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental and a comprehensive understanding of trapping and leakage processes will be of value to develop strategies for efficient and secure storage of CO2 in deep geologic formations and assess environmental and ecological risks associated with potential leakage. It is our contention that to make observations and collect data to obtain a fundamental understanding of how the natural formation heterogeneity manifested at all scales affects trapping is highly challenging or impossible to obtain in real field settings in deep geologic formations. A test scale intermediary between small laboratory columns and field scales that is referred to as “intermediate scale” provides an attractive alternative to investigate these processes under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Heterogeneities at all needed test scales can be designed using soils with known properties and experiments can be conducted under controlled conditions to obtain accurate data. Conducting intermediate scale laboratory experiments under ambient pressure and temperature conditions to understand the processes that occur in deep formations with very higher pressures and drastically different temperatures pose many challenges. This paper presents the approaches that were used to conduct multi-scale experiments from column to intermediate scale to understand the factors that contribute to capillary and dissolution trapping using surrogate fluids for supercritical CO2 and saline water combination. In addition, experiments were conducted in soil columns and two-dimensional tanks to study the effects of formation heterogeneity on CO2 gas evolution during leakage of water with dissolved CO2. The results from these experiments are presented to show how the new insights have helped to improve the conceptual understanding of effects of heterogeneity on CO2 trapping and leakage. This understanding has helped to improve numerical models that can be used to better engineer CO2 storage systems for permanence and evaluate possible failure risks.",

The experiment will also involve the partners in IWRSS (Integrated Water Resources Science and Services), which include the USGS, the Corps of Engineers and FEMA. The experiment will address the following questions: (1) How can near-real-time hydrologic forecasting at high spatial resolution, covering the nation, be carried out using the NHDPlus or next generation geofabric (e.g. hillslope, watershed scales)? (2) How can this lead to improved emergency response and community resilience? (3) How can improved an improved interoperability framework support the first two goals and lead to sustained innovation in the research to operations process? The experiment will run from September 2014 through August 2015, in two phases. The mobilization phase from September 2014 until May 2015 will assemble the components of the interoperability framework. A Summer Institute to integrate the components will be held from June to August 2015 at the National Water Center involving faculty and students from the University of Alabama and other institutions coordinated by CUAHSI. It is intended that the insight that arises from this experiment will help lay the foundation for a new national scale, high spatial resolution, near-real-time hydrologic simulation system for the United States.",

            "abstract": "The effect of relative humidity (RH) on the extent of semisolidity of particulate matter during GoAmazon 2014 was investigated through the use of particle rebound (or lack thereof) during impaction. Particle rebound measurements from the same region during the 2013 dry and wet season are also presented. The physics governing particle rebound has been previously modeled and can be attributed to the surface and material properties. Recent studies suggest that a particle phase transition from liquid to semisolid or solid phase states can alter chemical reaction pathways by shifting from absorption to adsorption mechanisms. The phase state of secondary organic material is regulated by the local relative humidity (RH), the recent history of RH in the case of hysteresis, and chemical composition, among other factors. Across the range of atmospheric RH, hygroscopic water uptake can occur and transitions from higher to lower viscosity phases are possible.\nBy varying the particulate matter water content and observing particle rebound as a function of RH, the phase state of the organic material under investigation can be determined. Custom made impactors were employed to study the effects of RH (up to 95%) on the particle phase. Results inferred from the particle rebound measurements indicate that under ambient conditions (RH > 70%) particles in Amazonia can be considered in a liquid phase state. However, during certain time periods, a small fraction (10 - 20 %) of particles are found to rebound during the highest RH conditions, an indication of a semi-solid or solid phase state. The possible chemical composition of this fraction of particles is investigated and correlated with additional measurements from the GoAmazon 2014 campaign.",

            "abstract": "Northern wetlands are thought to account for one third of the naturally emitted CH4. However, methane production pathways in northern peatlands are poorly understood, yet are predicted to change in response to vegetation shifts due to warming. Previous studies noted that acetate conversion to methane (acetoclastic methanogenesis, AM) in northern wetlands is largely impeded and acetate accumulates, however AM tends to increase with minerotrophy. To understand methanogenic pathways and to provide linkage among pathways, we studied Alaskan wetlands in 2013 and 2014. In 2013, laboratory incubations were conducted in three peatlands representing trophic gradients from bogs to fens. During 2014, 37 different sites in Fairbanks and Anchorage were studied that represented wetlands with pH values from 3.5 to 5.5 and vegetation from primarily Sphagnum to sedges. Measurements in 2014 included vegetation composition, gases (CH4, CO2, H2, and CO), 13CH4 and 13CO2, volatile fatty acids, DOC, other electron acceptors. Further incubation studies are being conducted to decipher controls on decomposition pathways. Gene sequencing was used to characterize microbial community composition, and metagenomic and transcriptomics were conducted to describe community activity. Results showed that methanogenesis was higher in fens than bogs, but hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (HM) was dominant at all sites. End product ratios showed that AM was occurring in fens, albeit slowly. Fermentation was an important end-point in decomposition and microbial syntrophy was weak. These data, regardless of trophic status, differed greatly from data obtained from temperate wetlands in which terminal respiratory processes were strong and C flow through syntrophy was important. Trophic status influenced C flow in the Alaskan sites, but terminal processes were weak and end product formation tended to end at primary fermentation, which dominated as the terminal step in decomposition.",

            "abstract": "Despite years of measurements, ice clouds remain one of the largest uncertainties in climate models. In part, because individual cloud ice remote sensing techniques or instruments observe only portions of the complete ice particle size distribution (PSD) and therefore, to deduce cloud ice water, the retrievals need to assume a given PSD. Uncertainty in such knowledge currently accounts for most of the factor of two or greater uncertainties in satellite based cloud ice water content measurements. The Aura-Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observes limb microwave emissions from the Earth’s atmosphere at 118, 191, 240, 640 and 2500 GHz enabling cloud ice measurements across a large range of particle sizes.\nThis study explores the synergy of collocated A-train radar backscatter CloudSat measurements and MLS radiances in search of a better understanding of cloud ice PSDs. For each “scene” jointly observed by CloudSat and MLS, we quantify the ability of each of several candidate PSDs to account for the observed signals. First, a CloudSat retrieval is used to determine the cloud altitude and location along the MLS line of sight as well as the cloud ice water content that, for a given PSD, would give rise to the observed CloudSat signal. Then, for each PSD, estimated MLS measurements are reconstructed, compared to those actually observed and a chi-squared metric is used to determined which PSD gives the best fit. We will discuss potential applications of this technique to studies of convection and the impacts of aerosol pollution on ice PSD.",

            "abstract": "At present, surface ages of bodies in the Outer Solar System are determined only from crater size–frequency distributions (a method dependent on an understanding of the projectile populations responsible for impact craters in these planetary systems). To derive accurate ages using impact craters, the impactor population must be understood. Impact craters in the Outer Solar System can be primary, secondary or sesquinary. The contribution of secondary craters to the overall population has recently become a “topic of interest.”\nOur objective is to better understand the contribution of dispersed secondary craters to the small crater populations, and ultimately that of small comets to the projectile flux on icy satellites in general. We measure the diameters of obvious secondary craters (determined by e.g. irregular crater shape, small size, clustering) formed by all primary craters on Ganymede for which we have sufficiently high resolution data to map secondary craters. Primary craters mapped range from approximately 40 km to 210 km. Image resolution ranges from 45 to 440 m/pixel. Bright terrain on Ganymede is our primary focus. These resurfaced terrains have relatively low crater densities and serve as a basis for characterizing secondary populations as a function of primary size on an icy body for the first time.\nAlthough focusing on Ganymede, we also investigate secondary crater size, frequency, distribution, and formation, as well as secondary crater chain formation on icy satellites throughout the Saturnian and Jovian systems principally Rhea. We compare our results to similar studies of secondary cratering on the Moon and Mercury.\nUsing Galileo and Voyager data, we have identified approximately 3,400 secondary craters on Ganymede. In some cases, we measured crater density as a function of distance from a primary crater. Because of the limitations of the Galileo data, it is necessary to extrapolate from small data sets to the global population of secondary craters. Nonetheless, we confirm that secondary craters on Ganymede have narrow size–frequency distributions and that they correlate with primary crater diameter. From these data we will evaluate the contribution of secondary craters over a range of crater diameters.",

However, rapid population growth and urbanization have placed stress on the rural sector causing the use of land that is more prone for flood and drought. In addition, increased population and farming have stressed the availability of fresh water both from rivers and aquifers. Additionally, rapid urbanization has severely reduced water quality within the great rivers. Added to these problems is delta subsidence from water withdrawal that, at the moment far surpasses sea level rise from both natural and anthropogenic effects. Finally, there appear to be great plans for river diversion that may reduce fresh water inflow into the Brahmaputra delta. \nAll of these factors fall against a background of climate change, both anthropogenic and natural, of which there is great uncertainty.

DART provides a comprehensive suite of software, documentation, examples and tutorials that can be used for ensemble data assimilation research, operations, and education. Scientists and software engineers from the Data Assimilation Research Section at NCAR are available to actively support DART users who want to use existing DART products or develop their own new applications. Current DART users range from university professors teaching data assimilation, to individual graduate students working with simple models, through national laboratories doing operational prediction with large state-of-the-art models. DART runs efficiently on many computational platforms ranging from laptops through thousands of cores on the newest supercomputers.\nThis poster focuses on several recent research activities using DART with geophysical models. First, DART is being used with the Community Atmosphere Model Spectral Element (CAM-SE) and Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) global atmospheric models that support locally enhanced grid resolution. Initial results from ensemble assimilation with both models are presented. DART is also being used to produce ensemble analyses of atmospheric tracers, in particular CO, in both the global CAM-Chem model and the regional Weather Research and Forecast with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model by assimilating observations from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments. Results from ensemble analyses in both models are presented. An interface between DART and the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model has been completed and ensemble land surface analyses with DART/CABLE will be discussed. Finally, an update on ensemble analyses in the fully-coupled Community Earth System (CESM) is presented. The poster includes instructions on how to get started using DART for research or educational applications.",

Thickness of the lithosphere varies from 43 to 89 km. The largest values are found at stations located east of Sierra Madre Occidental, and are consistent with a continental lithosphere. The thinner lithosphere is found at station NE70 (Mexicali, Mexico), consistent with a pre-rift region that has experimented serveral extension episodes.

            "abstract": "The vertical distribution of particles in the atmospheric column can have a large impact on the radiative forcing and cloud microphysics. A recent climatology constructed using data collected by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) suggests elevated layers of aerosol are quite common near the North American east coast during both winter and summer. The Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP), conducted from June 2012 through June 2013, was a unique study utilizing both in situ and remotely sensed measurements designed to provide a comprehensive data set that can be used to investigate science questions related to aerosol radiative forcing and the vertical distribution of aerosol. The study sampled the atmosphere at a number of altitudes within two atmospheric columns; one located near the coast of North America (over Cape Cod, MA) and a second over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred kilometers from the coast. TCAP included the yearlong deployment of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) located at the base of the Cape Cod column, as well as summer and winter aircraft intensive observation periods (IOPs) using the ARM Aerial Facility. One important finding from the TCAP summer IOP is the relatively common occurrence (during four of the six nearly cloud-free flights) of elevated aerosol layers in both the Cape Cod and maritime columns that were detected using the nadir pointing second-generation NASA Langley Research Center High-Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-2). These elevated layers contributed up to 60% of the total observed aerosol optical depth (AOD). Many of these layers were also intercepted by the aircraft configured for in situ sampling, and the aerosol in the layers was found to have increased amounts of biomass burning material and nitrate compared to aerosol found near the surface. Both the in situ and remote sensing observations have been compared to simulations from the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem). The model simulated the observed layers well in some cases, but in other instances there were differences in the altitude, mass loading, and aerosol water associated with regional scale transport and the representation of the aerosol lifecycle.",

            "abstract": "How the Colorado Plateau reached its current elevation with little internal deformation compared to surrounding regions has perplexed researchers for nearly a century. Hypotheses to explain the two kilometers of uplift since the Late Cretaceous range from delamination of the Farallon plate following flat slab subduction, thermal expansion of upwelling mantle, dynamic topography in response to mantle upwelling, mid-crustal flow from over-thickened crust, and foundering of a dense lower crustal root. Many of these hypotheses are constrained by geodynamic modelling with limited evidence from the rock record. We report here the petrologic and geochemical makeup of lower crustal xenoliths from the Transition Zone in Arizona between the southern Basin and Range Province and the Colorado Plateau. This xenolith suite erupted within a ~25 Ma volcanic host and is dominated by garnet pyroxenite with minor gabbro and amphibolite. Major and trace element geochemistry, petrography, and thermobarometry suggest these rocks represent deep-seated (12–25 kb) cumulates formed during arc magmatism. A preliminary U-Pb sphene age of ~50 Ma suggests that the cumulates formed during the end of the Laramide orogeny. Calculated compositional densities for these cumulates are up to 10% greater than the mantle, suggesting that early to mid-Tertiary arc magmatism generated a dense and unstable lower crustal root. Because these rocks are cold (580–840 °C), thermal contraction may further increase the density contrast. Foundering of this dense root could cause significant uplift. Isostatic calculations show that two kilometers of uplift may be explained by removal of a 20-km-thick root that is 10% denser than the underlying mantle. If lower crustal foundering is indeed responsible for uplift of the Colorado Plateau, the eruption age of the xenolith suite constrains uplift to be younger than ~25 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Evidence of seabed methane venting along the US Mid-Atlantic Margin is confirmed by the presence of authigenic carbonates and methantrophic deep-sea mussels, Bathymodiolus childressi, collected near areas of methane seepage. The biological indicators of methane venting presented here expand the understanding of widespread seepage identified by previous geophysical data. Both dead and living chemosynthetic mussels as well as authigenic carbonate samples were collected from Baltimore Canyon (360-430 m) and on the Virginia outer continental shelf (1600-1475 m). Stable isotope (carbon and sulfur) composition of mussel tissue material illustrates that the chemosynthetic communities are metabolically-dependent on methane rather than sulphide-oxidizing microbial symbionts. Average δ13C from tissue material was -62.80 ‰ and average δ34S was 12.58 ‰. Shell δ13C values were depleted relative to seawater dissolved inorganic carbon, highlighting the influence of methane concentration from cold seeps on shell growth. Lighter stable oxygen isotope values from shells collected at Baltimore Canyon reflect warmer temperatures relative to the colder and deeper Virginia seep site. However, at both sites isotopic disequilibrium relative to seawater δ18O suggests influence of enriched δ18O pore water. The chemical composition of the authigenic carbonates at both sites is dominated by aragonite rather than calcite, with an average δ13C signature of -46 ‰, a value expected from the microbially driven anaerobic oxidation of methane-rich fluids occurring at or near the sediment-water interface. This interpretation is supported by strontium isotope values close to modern seawater values. U/Th data are also reported from the authigenic carbonate stratigraphy to assess the timing and duration of methane venting along the US Mid-Atlantic Margin.",

            "abstract": "As part of the US DOE, Office of Science, Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment-Arctic project, we have been using environmental tracers (naturally occurring stable isotopes and geochemical species) to understand hydrological and geochemical processes within polygonal ground in a continuous permafrost area in the Arctic coastal plain. The study site is characterized by a thin zone of active layer development (typically <50 cm). This condition makes it difficult to understand development of geochemical gradients between the near surface and the frost line because traditional sampling using pumping causes mixing which can obscure depth gradients. We have applied a passive approach by using a series of diffusion cells that are installed at different depths within the active zone. The cells are filled with deionized water and over time, they equilibrate with the adjacent active layer water chemistry (ions diffuse into the cell, but the water in the cell does not exchange). Using this approach we have collected a series of fine resolution depth profiles within saturated zones in the active layer. Results over the last three years often show well-developed and sometimes substantial geochemical gradients for multiple analytes. Such gradients imply minimal vertical mixing within the active zone. Reductions in permeability with depth and lack of strong hydrological gradients likely limit vertical mixing. We also noted that the strength of the depth gradients varies across the landscape reflecting differences related to microtopography and drainage conditions. These results suggest that there are likely to be substantial fine-scale depth variations in biogeochemical processes such as methane and carbon dioxide production. Hydrological models should also reflect limited mixing with depth.",

            "abstract": "Plant macrofossils from packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens provide evidence of vegetation changes that have been used to infer aspects of differences between modern and past climates in the southwestern United States (the \"Southwest\"). This is a dry region of complex physiography with sharp elevational changes resulting in diverse microclimates over short distances.\nAlthough it is a relatively straightforward process to obtain quantitative estimates from plant macrofossil assemblages, it can be difficult to assess associated uncertainties. For the Southwest we evaluated aspects of potential uncertainties by comparing observed climates with estimates based on modern midden assemblages, and on virtual assemblages from gridded modern plant distribution data. We compared anomalies (estimated minus observed values) produced by four quantitative estimation approaches for winter temperature, summer temperature, and annual precipitation; presenting these results as correlations, average absolute anomalies, and the degrees of bias. In addition, we assessed the influences on anomalies of: 1) the number of taxa in an assemblage, and 2) the geographic, elevational, and vegetational context of the assemblages. \nOur findings indicate that much of uncertainty in climatic estimates is related to how modern climate is depicted and how it is then estimated at individual locations. Important issues here include: what time span in the historic record is selected to represent interannual and interdecadal variability, and how is climate interpolated to a specific location. Other results include: 1) modern assemblages with relatively few plant taxa provide estimates with larger anomalies and more bias; and, 2) none of the approaches can accurately estimate true extreme values in the climate data. Overall, as a very rough guide, the range of uncertainty for climate estimates from modern plant assemblages is ± 2°C for temperature, and ± 50mm for annual precipitation. Climatic estimates from Holocene middens largely fall within these bands of uncertainly, whereas those from the Last Glacial Maximum exceed these bands and are colder and generally wetter than today.",

            "abstract": "Globally secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is mostly formed from biogenic vegetation emissions and as such is regarded as natural aerosol that cannot be reduced by emission control legislation. However, recent research implies that human activities facilitate SOA formation by affecting the amount of precursor emission, the chemical processing and the partitioning into the aerosol phase. Among the multiple human influences, nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx) have been assumed to play a critical role in the chemical formation of low volatile compounds. The goal of this study is to improve the SOA scheme in the global NCAR Community Atmospheric Model version 4 with chemistry (CAM4-Chem) by implementing an updated 4-product Volatility Basis Set (VBS) scheme, and apply it to investigate the impact of anthropogenic NOx on SOA. We first compare three different SOA parameterizations: a 2-product model and the updated VBS model both with and without a SOA aging parameterization. Secondly we evaluate predicted organic aerosol amounts against surface measurement from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) network and Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) measurements from 13 aircraft-based field campaigns. We then perform sensitivity experiments to examine how the SOA loading responds to a 50% reduction in anthropogenic NOx in different regions. We find limited SOA reductions of -2.3%, -5.6% and -4.0% for global, southeastern U.S. and Amazon NOx perturbations, respectively. To investigate the chemical processes in more detail, we also use a simplified box model with the same gas-phase chemistry and gas-aerosol partitioning mechanism as in CAM4-Chem to examine the SOA yields dependence on initial precursor emissions and background NOx level. The fact that SOA formation is almost unaffected by changes in NOx can be largely attributed to buffering in chemical pathways (low- versus high-NOx pathways, OH versus NO3-initiated oxidation) and to offsetting tendencies in the biogenic versus anthropogenic SOA responses.",

            "abstract": "For 3 consecutive years, terrestrial laser scanning surveys have been conducted in the glacier basin of Austre Lovénbreen (Svalbard, 79°N). Each year, high density point clouds were acquired on the glacier surface and on the surrounding slopes. Two yearly scanning sessions were required in order to spatialize and quantify snow cover. The first session was done late April at the expected annual snow maximum. The second session was done in August near the end of the melting season and before the first potential significant snow falls.\nOn the glacier itself, laser scans were produced on the glacier snout, in the area close to the equilibrium line, and in the upper reaches of the glacier. Manual snow drilling measurements and glacier mass balance data were subsequently used to validate snow cover results.\nIn the steep slopes surrounding the glacier, scans were acquired on slopes at various altitudes and orientations in order to get a representative view of different snow cover settings. Particular attention was granted to snowdrift and avalanche processes, and their consequences on remaining packed snow stored in perennial snow accumulation at the bottom of slopes.\nA good knowledge of the dynamics of the snow cover is of particular interest in a glacier undergoing a clear retreat. Snow is slowing the melting of the ice for part of the season, and snow is also providing what will constitute future glacier ice in the upper reaches of the basin.\nSnow on slopes is also of importance as avalanches reaching on the glacier can contribute to the overall mass balance. Snow cover, by keeping the slopes permafrost from thawing early in the season, or by providing liquid water affecting it later in the season, is also playing a key role in the glacier basin morphology and its interactions with the glacier body.",

            "abstract": "Convergent margins become congested when they try to swallow buoyant, exotic crust or an oceanic swell associated with anomalously buoyant plume material. Mountain belts (orogens) that form at these convergent plate margins are the sites of significant lateral continental growth. Modern examples of accretionary margins are the North American Cordillera and southwest Pacific. The geologic record is riddled with accretionary orogens, such as the Tasmanides along the eastern margin of the supercontinent Gondwana and the Altaides that formed on the southern margin of Laurasia. In modern and ancient examples of long lived accretionary orogens, the overriding plate is subjected to episodes of crustal extension and back arc basin development, often related to subduction roll back and transient episodes of orogenesis and crustal shortening, coincident with accretion of exotic crust.\nIn previous work, (Mason et al, 2010), we found that buoyant material ingested by a subduction zone produces a relative advance of the local region of the trench (either reduced rollback or absolute advance) naturally leading to the characteristic indentation of the plate boundary by the plateau. Depending on the strength and buoyancy of the incoming anomaly relative to the oceanic lithosphere, it may be subducted or it may be accreted with the associated formation of a slab window. Extending this model to ocean-continent convergent zones (Moresi et al, 2014), we show how the indentation of buoyant exotic material also dominates terrane accretion.\nWhen large blocks of material congest a subduction zone, the subduction zone needs to undergo signficiant re-arrangement for convergence to continue. We have modelled this process and observe characteristic patterns in the deformation of the over-riding plate, in the timing of the escape of material from behind the indenter, and in the oroclinal geometry that remains once the collision has completed.\n",

            "abstract": "The environmental benefits of CO2 sequestration in geological formations are well established; however, the process has significant operational and maintenance challenges. Primarily, cement well plugs are vulnerable to deterioration in high temperature and high pressure underground storage settings, and the ability to accurately predict their service performance in these unfavorable conditions is necessary for successful implementations. In this work, a coupled reactive transport model is developed using the finite element method to investigate Portland Class H cement deterioration under both CO2 and CO2-O2 co-sequestration in high pressure and temperature downhole conditions. The numerical model involves the solution of Nernst-Planck equations for transport of relevant ionic and gaseous species in hydrated cement in the presence multiple reactive processes (e.g. carbonation and secondary mineral formation) which also affect microstructural properties. The predictions of the developed model are compared with available experimental data and benchmarked with existing models. Parametric investigations are conducted to study the effects of operational pressure and temperatures, cement composition, brine composition, and CO2 gas exposure.",

            "abstract": "Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are being aggressively deployed at residential, commercial, and utility scales to complement power generation from conventional sources. This is motivated both by the desire to reduce carbon footprints and by policy-driven financial incentives. Although several life cycle analyses (LCA) have investigated environmental impacts and energy payback times of solar PV systems, most results are based on hypothetical systems rather than actual, deployed systems that can provide measured performance data. Over the past five years, Desert Research Institute (DRI) in Nevada has installed eight solar PV systems of scales from 3 to 1000 kW, the sum of which supply approximately 40% of the total power use at DRI’s Reno and Las Vegas campuses.\nThe goal of this work is to explore greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts and examine the economic performance of DRI’s PV systems by developing and applying a comprehensive LCA and techno-economic (TEA) model. This model is built using data appropriate for each type of panel used in the DRI systems. Power output is modeled using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) model PVWatts. The performance of PVWatts is verified by the actual measurements from DRI’s PV systems. Several environmental and economic metrics are quantified for the DRI systems, including life cycle GHG emissions and energy return. GHG results are compared with Nevada grid-based electricity.\nInitial results indicate that DRI’s solar-derived electricity offers clear GHG benefits compared to conventional grid electricity. DRI’s eight systems have GHG intensity values of 29-56 gCO2e/kWh, as compared to the GHG intensity of 212 gCO2e/kWh of national average grid power. The major source of impacts (82-92% of the total) is the upstream life cycle burden of manufacturing PV panels, which are made of either mono-crystalline or multi-crystalline silicon. Given the same type of PV panel, GHG intensity decreases as the scale of the system increases. Energy payback times of DRI’s solar PV systems range from 0.5 to 1.5 years. The cost payback time for the DRI PV systems and the cost per ton of CO2 avoided by replacing Nevada-specific electrical power will be determined. The sensitivity of these environmental and economic impacts with respect to specific model parameters is being investigated.",

            "abstract": "HCFC-22 (CHClF2) and HFC-134a (CH2FCF3) are two major gases currently used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration and air conditioning. HCFC-22 contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion and both species are potent greenhouse gases, and their global emissions continue to rise at the present. In this work, we study aircraft based in-situ observations of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a over the Pacific Ocean in a three-year span (HIaper Pole-to-Pole Observation of carbon cycle and greenhouse gases study, HIPPO 2009-2011) and combine these data with long-term observations from global surface sites (NOAA and AGAGE networks). We find a steady increase in global annual emissions of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a for the past two decades (on average 3% and 4% per year, respectively). Emissions of HFC-134a since 2000 are consistently higher, with 60% more in recent years (2009-2011), compared to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventory. Using both HIPPO and surface data, we quantify and verify enhanced summertime emissions of HFC-134a and HCFC-22 that are about three times those in the wintertime. This unforeseen large seasonal contribution indicates unaccounted mechanisms controlling refrigerant gas emissions, missing in the existing inventory estimates. Possible mechanisms for greater refrigerant leakages in the summer are: 1) higher vapor pressure in the sealed compartment of the system at summer high temperatures (saturated vapor pressure is ~ 3 times at 303 K compared to that at 273 K for both species), and 2) more frequent use of refrigeration and air conditioners in the summer (vapor pressure in the compressor line is higher when in use than not in use). Our results suggest that the engineering of the refrigeration and air conditioning systems can greatly influence the release of these two species to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Signs of convective downwelling in non-subduction environments have been increasingly prevalent in recent studies. From seismic images of the “Isabella Anomaly” beneath the southern Sierra Nevada, to studies on the origin of the Columbia River flood basalts, to long standing speculation on the state of the lithosphere beneath the Colorado Plateau, the lithospheric delamination hypothesis potentially accounts for a substantial amount of otherwise anomalous topographic uplift and magmatism in western North America and elsewhere.\nEfforts to model numerically the underlying processes behind such events have also been gaining popularity. Typically, such models have relied on drastically weakened lithosphere or highly non-linear rheologies at the boundaries of dense regions to allow the propagation of delamination in reasonable timescales. However, these low viscosities are rarely justified by a systematic investigation of mantle rheology.\nBased on suspected cases of delamination, the process seems to be commonly associated with localized magmatism. For instance, the Columbia River flood basalts, the renewed magmatism in the southern Sierras, and the radially converging magmatism propagating though the Colorado Plateau, all match well temporally with suspected delamination cases. Geochemical signatures are consistent with delamination in all of these cases.\nBecause of the spatial and temporal correlations between delamination and magmatism, we are interested in investigating the rheological role that melt might play in the initiation and propagation of delamination. Moderate melt fraction in the asthenosphere is a potential source for the low viscosity necessary to appropriately predict timescales of these events. To that end, we are working on tracking melt generation and migration though geodynamic models using the Eulerian finite element code, ASPECT. Preliminary results predict melt being generated during delamination events but the magnitudes and rheological implications remain unclear.",

            "abstract": "Stromatolites are laminated sedimentary structures that are commonly thought to be created by cyanobacteria, either through the trapping and binding of sediment, or through metabolically-induced precipitation. However, stromatolite formation is poorly understood. In general, stromatolite abundance was higher in the Proterozoic than the Phanerozoic, but notable increases in stromatolite abundance occur in association with Phanerozoic mass extinction events. Here, we focus on stromatolites from the latest Triassic Cotham Marble (United Kingdom) that are associated with the extinction interval. The end-Triassic mass extinction is coincident with large-scale volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the associated breakup of Pangea. Some hypothesize that CAMP-associated increases in atmospheric CO2 led to a rise in global temperatures and ocean acidification that caused or enhanced the extinction. In order to quantify the role of climate change with respect to the end-Triassic mass extinction, we applied the carbonate “clumped” isotope paleothermometer to the well-preserved Cotham Marble stromatolites. The stromatolites were deposited in the shallow Tethys Sea, and today occur in several localities across the southwestern UK. The stromatolites alternate on the cm scale between laminated and dendrolitic microstructures and each was microdrilled for clumped isotope analysis. The two microstructures display different temperatures of formation, where the dendrolitic portions apparently grew under cooler conditions than laminated layers, and younger layers grew in cooler conditions than older layers. Our results suggest that temperature fluctuated and potentially trended towards amelioration of the warm temperatures during the deposition of the Cotham Marble.",

            "abstract": "Forests cover over 40% of the seasonally snow-covered regions in North America. However, operational snow networks are located primarily in forest clearings, and optical remote sensing cannot see through tree canopies to detect forest snowpack. Due to the complex influence of the forest on snowpack duration, ground observations in forests are essential. We therefore consider the effectiveness of different strategies to observe snow covered area under forests. At our study location in the Pacific Northwest, we simultaneously deployed fiber-optic cable, stand-alone ground temperature sensors, and time-lapse digital cameras in three different forest treatments: control second-growth forest, thinned forest, and forest gaps (one tree height in diameter). We derived fractional snow covered area and snow duration metrics from the co-located instruments to assess optimal spatial resolution and sampling configuration. The fiber-optic cable and the camera detected a significant difference of 8 days in mean snow duration between the gap and control plots. Monte Carlo experiments based on our results suggest that 10 m spacing of self-recording ground temperature sensors across a 40 m forest plot will capture mean snow duration to ± 5 days whereas 6 m spacing reduces the 95% confidence interval to ± 3 days. We further tested the representativeness of sampling one plot per treatment group by observing snow duration across replicated forest plots at the same elevation, and at a set of forest plots 250 m higher. Relative relationships between snow duration in the forest treatments are consistent between replicated plots, elevation, and two winters of data.",

            "abstract": "Isotopic measurements of sulfate and sulfide phases preserved in carbonates document secular changes in the sulfur cycle and help shape our understanding of the redox evolution of Earth’s surface over geologic time. However, as the isotopic record of ancient oceanic conditions becomes better resolved, reports of coeval but discordant geochemical/isotopic proxies are becoming increasingly common. Such varied data could arise from (i) primary differences in the chemistry of the water column from which these sediments were deposited; (ii) geochemical alteration during physical reworking as sediments are being deposited; or (iii) as the result of secondary alteration of geochemical signals after deposition and lithification. As a bulk-rock proxy, d34S signals can consist of multiple origins of sulfate and sulfide within carbonate minerals. Deciphering these phases is critical in order to extract meaningful information about the depositional and diagenetic environment in which the samples formed.\nHere, we use X-ray spectromicroscopy to map the distribution of primary and secondary S-bearing sedimentary phases at the micron-scale in a well-characterized suite of Ordovician-aged (∼444 million years ago) carbonate strata from Anticosti Island, Quebec. The high-resolution maps of sulfate variability show differences between major phases (e.g., clasts vs. cement), as well as subtle differences in sulfate concentrations between fossil clades (e.g., crinoids vs. gastropods). Further, we can distinguish the sulfate content of different stages of calcite cement, helping to constrain the diagenetic history and relate specific cements with the chemistry of the waters from which they formed. In conjunction with secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) δ34S measurements, this work can distinguish isotopic signatures between primary and diagenetic phases, enhancing our ability to reconstruct biogeochemical sulfur cycling over Earth history using δ34S isotopic signatures.",

This increased use of ionospheric data assimilation models coincides with the increase in data suitable for assimilation. At USU we have developed several different data assimilation models, including the Global Assimilation on Ionospheric Measurements Gauss-Markov (GAIM-GM) and Full Physics (GAIM-FP) models. Both models assimilate a variety of different data types, including ground-based GPS/TEC, occultation, bottomside electron density profiles from ionosondes, in-situ electron densities, and space-based UV radiance measurements and provide specifications and forecasts on a spatial grid that can be global, regional, or local. The GAIM-GM model is a simpler model that uses the physics-based Ionosphere Forecast Model (IFM) as a background model but uses a statistical process in the Kalman filter. This model is currently in operational use at the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) in Omaha, NE. The GAIM-FP model is a more sophisticated model that uses a physics-based ionosphere-plasmasphere model (IPM) and an Ensemble Kalman filter. The primary GAIM-FP output is in the form of 3-dimensional electron density distributions from 90 km to near geosynchronous altitude but also provides auxiliary information about the global distributions of the self-consistent ionospheric drivers (neutral winds and densities, electric fields). The current status of these models is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Due to the diminishing availability of good quality water for irrigation, it is increasingly important that irrigation and salinity management tools be able to target submaximal crop yields and support the use of marginal quality waters. In this work, we present a steady-state irrigated systems modeling framework that accounts for reduced plant water uptake due to root zone salinity. Two new explicit, closed-form analytical solutions for the root zone solute concentration profile are obtained, corresponding to two alternative functional forms of the uptake reduction function. The solutions express a general relationship between irrigation water salinity, irrigation rate, crop salt tolerance, crop transpiration, and (using standard approximations) crop yield. Example applications are illustrated, including the calculation of irrigation requirements for obtaining targeted submaximal yields, and the generation of crop-water production functions for varying irrigation waters, irrigation rates, and crops. Model predictions are shown to be mostly consistent with existing models and available experimental data. Yet the new solutions possess clear advantages over available alternatives, including: (i) the new solutions were derived from a complete physical-mathematical description of the system, rather than based on an ad hoc formulation; (ii) the new analytical solutions are explicit and can be evaluated without iterative techniques; (iii) the solutions permit consideration of two common functional forms of salinity induced reductions in crop water uptake, rather than being tied to one particular representation; and (iv) the utilized modeling framework is compatible with leading transient-state numerical models.",

            "abstract": "Paddy rice is an important cereal crop and main grain source for more than half of the global human population. However, knowledge about its area and spatial pattern is still limited due to large changes in agriculture in different regions; for example, higher latitude areas underwent increase (e.g., northeastern China) and decrease (e.g., South Korea) of paddy rice planting areas due to climatic warming, urbanization and other drivers. It is necessary to track paddy rice planting area changes in these regions in the past decades. We developed a pixel- and phenology-based image analysis system, Landsat-RICE, to map the paddy rice by using Landsat imagery. The algorithm was based on the unique physical and spectral characteristics of paddy rice fields during the flooding and transplanting phases. First, Landsat images are preprocessed and time series vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, and LSWI) are generated. Second, MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data were used to define thermal plant growing season (0 oC, 5 oC and 10 oC), which provides a guide for selection of Landsat images within the period of flooding and transplanting. Third, several non-cropland land cover maps (e.g., permanent water bodies, built-up and barren lands, sparsely vegetated lands, and evergreen vegetation) are produced through analysis of Landsat-based vegetation indices within the plant growing season and combined as a mask. Fourthly, vegetation index data within the time window of flooded and rice transplanting were analyzed to identify flood/transplanting signals. Finally, the maps of paddy rice planting areas were generated through overlying the results from Step 3 and 4. Paddy rice planting area changes were investigated in some hotspots of Northeastern Asia from 1986 to 2014 at 30-m spatial resolution and 5-year interval. This study has demonstrated that our newly developed Landsat-Rice system is robust and effective for tracking paddy rice changes in cold temperate and temperate zones.",

Calculating the trajectories of whistler mode waves, so called ray tracing, has been exclusively based on cold plasma theory. Here we have extended previous works to include ions in the fully adiabatic warm plasma theory. Using a finite electron and ion temperature refractive index surfaces are calculated for 1-10 kHz whistler mode waves in the inner magnetosphere. A finite ion temperature is found to have a greater effect on the refractive index surface than the electron temperature and the primary effect is to close an otherwise open refractive index surface. Including a finite ion temperature is especially important when the wave frequency is just above the local lower hybrid resonance frequency. The results are used to assess previous conclusions on the efficacy of using in situ whistler-mode sources to precipitate energetic electrons. It is found that the number of in situ sources needed to illuminate the plasmasphere with whistler-mode energy is greater than previously predicted.",

            "abstract": "Pollen-based vegetation reconstructions are the primary source of information about spatio-temporal trends in vegetation dynamics at timescales of centuries to millennia. Pollen samples from individual lakes, bogs, and small hollows provide information about the vegetation within their respective source areas, which when mapped together generate vegetation reconstructions across spatial and temporal scales. Climate histories also can be reconstructed using empirical taxa-climate relationships. A fundamental need in these reconstructions is to estimate the pollen source area and account for the effects of intertaxonomic differences in pollen production and dispersal. Mechanistic pollen-vegetation models have continuously evolved for nearly a century, with recent advances culminating in the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm. However, most applications of the LRA do not account for anisotropies in pollen source area introduced by atmospheric variations.\nGiven that wind direction is often anisotropic and variable we investigate the effects of wind speed, wind direction, and a simple treatment of wet versus dry deposition on vegetation reconstruction from pollen. We obtained long term estimates of dominant wind patterns using North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) weather data for 1979-2012. However, because contemporary vegetation and pollen distributions have been heavily affected by Euro-American land use, we use pre-settlement (ca. 1810-1904) forest composition across the prairie-forest ecotone in the upper Midwestern United States and a dataset of settlement-era pollen samples compiled by the PalEON project to model pollen-vegetation relationships. Comparisons of our modelled results with those of a unidirectional, homogenous model shows a substantial effect of regionally varying winds on vegetation reconstructions. In addition to variable wind speed and direction, other atmospheric effects including precipitation and instability play an important role in pollen transport and deposition. By better accounting for these effects we can improve the predictive capacity of pollen-vegetation models and reduce uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "GPS data show that the northern portion of the Hikurangi subduction thrust fault beneath the eastern North Island of New Zealand is creeping steadily, while the southern segment is locked and appears capable of producing great earthquakes. This change is mirrored by variations in fluid chemistry from springs and seeps, with faster fluid expulsion and less water-rock interaction in the central and northern margin compared to the southern margin. Wedge morphology and deformation also change along-strike, with a wide accretionary imbricate wedge in southern and central Hikurangi transitioning to a non-accreting, steep wedge in the north that experiences periodic subduction erosion from seamount subduction.\nWe use results from restoration of depth-converted seismic sections along the margin to constrain the initial conditions for numerical models that link mechanical wedge development to fluid flow. These models are used to investigate the effect of sediment inputs, lower plate roughness (including seamounts), and fracture permeability on megathrust strength. We test model predictions for wedge morphology, fault development, and fluid-flow rates along localised pathways over time against current wedge structure and fluid chemistry.\nOur preliminary results show that the central and southern Hikurangi accretionary wedges approximate growth of a critical wedge geometry, while northern Hikurangi margin morphology episodically cycles as seamounts enter the margin. Sediment subducted around the seamounts provides a fluid source that can drive fluid overpressure on and around the subduction interface. Whether this overpressure causes significant frictional weakening of the megathrust depends on the development of fracture permeability and its interactions with upper plate faults. To produce high rates of fluid flow consistent with fluid chemistry in the central and northern margin, significant permeable pathways must develop, locally limiting megathrust overpressure.",

            "abstract": "With current knowledge of sources and sinks for marine Ni, as compiled recently by Gall et al. [1], it is not possible to construct a balanced steady-state mass balance model for Ni in the global oceans. The recent discovery of considerable Ni stable isotope variations among seawater and the various inputs and outputs implies that Ni isotopes may be able to aid construction of a valid mass balance model, since the isotope systematics provide an additional dimension of constraints that must be balanced to close the budget. However, much work remains to be done to measure and especially to understand the controls on Ni isotope distribution among marine reservoirs.\nFerromanganese sediments represent a major sink for Ni, and most of these rocks are variably enriched in heavier isotopes of Ni relative to seawater [1]. In an effort to understand why that is the case, we undertook experiments to quantify Ni isotope fractionation during sorption to birnessite, the dominant Mn phase in ferromanganese crusts, at low and high ionic strength. At low ionic strength we observed lighter isotopes of Ni preferentially sorbed, with an average magnitude of Δ60/58Nisorbed-dissolved = -1.38 ±0.16 ‰. The isotopic compositions of dissolved and sorbed Ni define parallel, linear trends as a function of fraction of Ni sorbed, indicating a reversible, equilibrium isotope effect. In simplified, synthetic seawater, the observed fractionation are even larger, up to Δ60/58Nisorbed-dissolved= -4‰. The large magnitudes of fractionation observed in this system are surprising, but the most puzzling aspect of these results is that, in our experiments, lighter isotopes are preferentially sorbed, while in the natural system Ni in ferromanganese crusts is quite heavy relative to seawater. Likely reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed, as well as possible causes of this surprisingly large metal isotope effect.\n[1] Gall et al. (2013, EPSL 375, 148)",

DC3 employed ground-based radars, lightning mapping arrays, and weather balloon soundings in conjunction with aircraft measurements sampling the composition of the inflow and outflow of a variety of thunderstorms in northeast Colorado, West Texas to central Oklahoma, and northern Alabama. A unique aspect of the DC3 strategy was to locate and sample the convective outflow a day after active convection in order to measure the chemical transformations within the UT convective plume. The DC3 data are being analyzed to investigate transport and dynamics of the storms, scavenging of soluble trace gases and aerosols, production of nitrogen oxides by lightning, relationships between lightning flash rates and storm parameters, and chemistry in the UT that is affected by the convection. In this presentation, we give an overview of the DC3 field campaign and highlight results from the campaign that are relevant to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region. These highlights include stratosphere-troposphere exchange in connection with thunderstorms, the 0-12 hour chemical aging and new particle formation in the UT outflow of a dissipating mesoscale convective system observed on June 21, 2012, and UT chemical aging in convective outflow as sampled the day after convection occurred and modeled in the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with Chemistry model.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon (C) cycling can slow or accelerate in response to new C inputs from fresh organic matter. This change in native C mineralization, known as the “microbial priming effect,” is difficult to predict because the underlying mechanisms of priming are still poorly understood. We hypothesized that soil mineral assemblage, specifically short-range-order (SRO) minerals, influences microbial responses to different quality C substrate inputs. To test this, we added 350 μg C g-1soil weekly of an artificial root exudates mixture primarily comprised of glucose, sucrose, lactate and fructose (a simple C source) or ground ponderosa pine litter (a complex C source) for six weeks to three soil types from similar ecosystems derived from different parent material. The soils, from andesite, basalt, and granite parent materials, had decreasing abundance in SRO minerals, respectively. We found that the simple C substrate induced 63 ±16.3% greater positive priming than the complex C across all soil types. The quantity of soil SRO materials was negatively correlated with soil respiration, but positively correlated with priming. The lowest SRO soil amended with litter primed the least (14 ± 11 μgCO2-C g-1), while the largest priming effect occurring in the highest SRO soil amended with simple substrate (246 ± 18 μgCO2-C g-1). Our results indicate that higher SRO mineral content could accelerate microorganisms’ capacity to mineralize native soil organic carbon and respond more strongly to labile C inputs. However, while all treatments exhibited positive priming, the amount of C added over the six-week incubation was greater than total CO2 respired. This suggests that despite a relative stimulation of native C mineralization, these soils act as C sinks rather than sources in response to fresh organic matter inputs.",

            "abstract": "SWPC has been evaluating various approaches for ensemble forecasting of Earth-directed CMEs. We have developed the software infrastructure needed to support broad-ranging CME ensemble modeling, including composing, interpreting, and making intelligent use of ensemble simulations. The first step is to determine whether the physics of the interplanetary propagation of CMEs is better described as chaotic (like terrestrial weather) or deterministic (as in tsunami propagation). This is important, since different ensemble strategies are to be pursued under the two scenarios. We present the findings of a comprehensive study of CME ensembles in uniform and structured backgrounds that reveals systematic relationships between input cone parameters and ambient flow states and resulting transit times and velocity/density amplitudes at Earth. These results clearly indicate that the propagation of single CMEs to 1 AU is a deterministic process. Thus, the accuracy with which one can forecast the gross properties (such as arrival time) of CMEs at 1 AU is determined primarily by the accuracy of the inputs. This is no tautology – it means specifically that efforts to improve forecast accuracy should focus upon obtaining better inputs, as opposed to developing better propagation models. In a companion paper (deKoning et al., this conference), we compare in situ solar wind data with forecast events in the SWPC operational archive to show how the qualitative and quantitative findings presented here are entirely consistent with the observations and may lead to improved forecasts of arrival time at Earth.",

            "abstract": "Isotope-based evidence for the timing of the uplift of the Sierra Nevadas comes to conflicting conclusions with those from other lines of geologic evidence. The geologic evidence suggests that the Sierras uplifted >1 km 8 to 3.5 Ma, whereas isotope-based evidence suggests that there has been no significant uplift in the last 16 Ma. Recent studies have demonstrated that air trajectories in the Sierras are not consistent with the underlying two-dimensional assumptions used in the isotope-based approach and therefore the technique may not be applicable to the region. We suggest that due to the three-dimensionality of the Sierras, determining paleoaltimetery from lee-side isotope-based proxy records may not be applicable and that the complexity of the terrain accounts for the discrepancies between the geologic and isotope proxy records. Using idealized three-dimensional WRF v3.5.1 simulations of smoothed complex terrain we constrain and quantify the sensitivity of air masses to low-level flow deflection around a ridge with laterally varying elevation. The simulations are run in a domain of 560 points in the x direction and 250 points in the y direction with 4 km grid spacing and 121 unevenly spaced vertical points in a 30-km-high domain with open lateral boundaries with constant horizontal and vertical diffusion. Rayleigh damping is applied to the upper 15 km of the domain. The topography consists of a single idealized Sierran-type ridge with laterally varying elevation that encompasses both high and low values for the nondimensional number Nh/U, where N is the buoyancy frequency, h is the mountain height, and U is the horizontal wind speed. Our results indicate that flow is not two-dimensional as is assumed in interpretations of isotope-based proxies. Instead streamlines and trajectory paths are deflected around the highest topography and over the lower parts of the range. Although lee-side isotope-based paleoaltimetry sites may not be applicable to the Sierras, the technique might still apply to other mountain ranges which exhibit more two-dimensional flow or where the three-dimensional flows can be better constrained.",

            "abstract": "Northern Eurasia covers 20% of the global land mass and contains 70% of the boreal forest. During certain times of the year, black carbon (BC) in smoke plumes in high latitudes may be transported and deposited on Arctic ice and accelerate ice melting. It is thus imperative to better understand daily sources, transport, and deposition of BC in Northern Eurasia. We examined daily BC emissions from fires over different land cover types in Northern Eurasia at a 500 m x 500 m resolution from 2002 to 2012. Black carbon emissions were estimated based on the MODIS land cover maps and detected burned areas, the Forest Inventory Survey of the Russian Federation, and emission factors of BC for different types of vegetation fires. Our estimated annual burned areas in Northern Eurasia varied considerably from 1.6 × 105 km2 (2011) to 4.9 × 105 km2 (2003) with an average of 2.6 × 105 km2. Grassland dominates the total burned area (61%) and followed by forest (27%). For grassland fires, about three-quarters of the burned area occurred in Central and Western Asia and about 17% in Russia. More than 90% of the forest burned area was in Russia. Annual BC emissions from fires varied enormously from 4.1 ×108 kg in 2010 to 2.1 × 109 kg in 2003 with an average of 8.5×108 kg. In contrast to burned area, BC emissions were dominated by forest fires which accounted for about two-thirds of the emissions, followed by grassland fires (15%). More than 90% of the BC emissions from forest fires occurred in Russia. Central and Western Asia is the major region for BC emissions from grassland fires (53%), followed by Russia (34%). There are no apparent trends in area burned or BC emissions from 2002 to 2012. Overall, Russia contributed 83% of the total BC emissions from fires in Northern Eurasia. These results are critical in understanding the future impacts of climate change on the fire dynamics in Northern Eurasia and the contribution of black carbon to accelerated melting of Arctic ice.",

            "abstract": "The recent Deepwave field project in New Zealand ran from May 25 to July 28, 2014. Its objectives were to observe, understand and predict the deep propagation of gravity waves from the Troposphere into the Stratosphere, Mesosphere and Thermosphere. In addition to surface and satellite-borne sensors, the project used two research aircraft with airborne sensors; the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) and the German DLR Falcon. The GV was uniquely instrumented to observe wave launching (dropsondes), waves properties in the low stratosphere (flight level winds, pressure and temperature), waves in the middle stratosphere (MTP and Rayleigh Lidar) and waves near the mesopause (Sodium Lidar and OH IR mapper). In this report, we describe GV flight level wave energy flux statistics from the 97 aircraft legs (49.1 hours) over the terrain of New Zealand and the 157 aircraft legs (84.3 hours) over the Southern Ocean. For example, the vertical energy flux at Z=12km for the terrain flights varied from zero to 27 W/m2 with an average value of about 4W/m2. Wavelet co-spectral analysis of flight level data is used to determine the dominant location and wavelength of the flux-carrying gravity waves. Dominant horizontal wavelengths for the flux-carrying waves over terrain varied from 30 to 200km. Using a high resolution WRF simulation, the various mechanisms for the decrease of energy flux with height are examined including dissipation, dispersion, refraction, reflection and secondary wave generation.",

            "abstract": "EarthScope’s Education and Outreach (E&O) program aims to increase public awareness of Earth science and enhance geoscience education at the K-12 and college level. The program is distinctive among major geoscience programs in two ways. First, planning for education and public engagement occurred in tandem with planning for the science mission. Second, the NSF EarthScope program includes funding support for education and outreach. In this presentation, we highlight key examples of the program’s accomplishments and identify emerging E&O opportunities.\nE&O efforts have been collaboratively led by the EarthScope National Office (ESNO), IRIS, UNAVCO, the EarthScope Education and Outreach Subcommittee (EEOSC) and PI-driven EarthScope projects. Efforts by the EEOSC, guided by an EarthScope Education and Outreach Implementation Plan that is periodically updated, focus EarthScope E&O. EarthScope demonstrated early success in engaging undergraduate students (and teachers) in its mission through their involvement in siting USArray across the contiguous U.S. Funded E&O programs such as TOTLE, Illinois EarthScope, CEETEP (for K-12), InTeGrate and GETSI (for undergraduates) foster use of freely available EarthScope data and research findings.\nThe Next Generation Science Standards, which stress science and engineering practices, offer an opportunity for alignment with existing EarthScope K-12 educational resources, and the EEOSC recommends focusing efforts on this task.\nThe EEOSC recognizes the rapidly growing use of mobile smart devices by the public and in formal classrooms, which bring new opportunities to connect with the public and students. This will capitalize on EarthScope’s already prominent social media presence, an effort that developed to accomplish one of the primary goals of the EarthScope E&O Implementation Plan to “Create a high-profile public identity for EarthScope” and to “Promote science literacy and understanding of EarthScope among all audiences through informal education venues” Leveraging ESNO, IRIS, and UNAVCO resources has exceeded the capabilities of any single entity, thereby amplifying the impact of EarthScope’s education and outreach effort.",

            "abstract": "In this research we seek to understand damage mechanisms governing the behavior of geo-materials in the explosion source region, and the role they play in seismic-wave generation. Numerical modeling tools can be used to describe these mechanisms through the development and implementation of appropriate material models. Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) have been working on a novel continuum-based-viscoplastic strain-rate-dependent fracture material model, AZ_Frac, in an effort to improve the description of these damage sources. AZ_Frac has the ability to describe continuum fracture processes, and at the same time, to handle pre-existing anisotropic material characteristics. The introduction of fractures within the material generates further anisotropic behavior that is also accounted for within the model. The material model has been calibrated to a granitic medium and has been applied in a number of modeling efforts under the SPE project. In our modeling, we use a 2D, axisymmetric layered earth model of the SPE site consisting of a weathered layer on top of a half-space. We couple the hydrodynamic simulation code with a seismic simulation code and propagate the signals to distances of up to 2 km. The signals are inverted for time-dependent moment tensors using a modified inversion scheme that accounts for multiple sources at different depths. The inversion scheme is evaluated for its resolving power to determine a centroid depth and a moment tensor description of the damage source. The capabilities of the inversion method to retrieve such information from waveforms recorded on three SPE tests conducted to date are also being assessed.",

            "abstract": "In the US, nationwide processing of historic Landsat data has recently been completed to provide a comprehensive annual, wall-to-wall analysis of US disturbance history and cause 1982-2011. Here, we present new methodology used in this effort that involves fitting nonparametric shape-restricted regression splines to Landsat spectral trajectories which are sensitive to both forest structure (eg., Band 5) and leaf area (eg., NDVI ). The functions, developed in R and automated for nationwide processing, deliver a series of parameters for each pixel and band that identify the best (of seven possible) shapes of the spectral pattern, year(s) of inflection, magnitude, and pre- and post- inflection rates of growth or recovery. Parameters from model fits are then fed into random forests models along with static bioclimatic and vegetation data layers to predict causal agent through time. Results indicate shape parameters are the driving predictors in diverse Landsat scenes across the US, and are able to capture subtle patterns produced by low magnitude or slow change such as insect and disease. We discuss the interaction between shape parameters in the empirical models, and illustrate how the intermediate product of the fitted trajectories themselves can be used as ancillary data in model-assisted estimates of forest attributes through time.",

            "abstract": "The Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO), occurring roughly 52 million years ago, represents an Earth system response to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and potentially serves as an analog for the Earth system response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the next several centuries. During EECO, global temperatures were 12-15 ºC warmer than modern, with the majority of warming occurring at high latitudes, effectively reducing the Earth’s latitudinal temperature gradient. Despite a wealth of studies, there remain discrepancies between proxy records and global climate models as to the magnitude of this reduction in temperature gradients. In particular, proxy records of isotopes in precipitation appear to indicate shallower temperature gradients than models are able to simulate; however, many of these studies utilize empirical relationships between precipitation isotopes and temperature gradients that likely do not hold under different climate regimes. Here we present 5 new proxy records of EECO precipitation isotopes from British Columbia (BC), Canada spanning 49 – 55 ºN, a crucial latitudinal gap in existing records. We observe similar to slightly increasing δ18O values with increasing latitude, likely representative of a topographic highland in southern BC with decreasing elevations to the north. We incorporate this new data into a global compilation of proxy records of precipitation isotopes and compare these to a one dimensional, isotope-enabled mechanistic model of latitudinal water vapor transport. Using this model, we test the sensitivity of latitudinal isotopic gradients to varying latitudinal temperature gradients, mid-latitude eddy strengths, and latitudinal extents of vapor recharge zones via surface ocean evaporation. Finally, we analyze the implications for pole-ward latent heat transport in a high-CO2, globally warmer climate.",

As competition for water becomes more complex, the use of technology to maximize finite water resources becomes increasingly critical. Therefore, accurate methods of gauging relevant data streams must be developed and improved at every level, from basic and applied research to water management to policy oversight.\nHow can the relative value for answering critical hydrologic questions of prospective data streams be gauged? Advancements in technology are producing multiple new sources of hydrological data from in-situ platforms and the developing resource of remote sensing platforms. The in-situ and remote sensing data available from these new sources can be used complementarily to provide answers to critical water resource management questions. Analyses that identify which combination of data resources will offer the most effective methodology for quantifying hydrological variables will establish new best practices for water management. We are going to use new techniques of data assimilation to establish a process for identifying and evaluating the method that provides the most quantitative means for answering key hydrological questions.\nThis research will outline a method for evaluating specific in-situ and remote sensing data sets for complementary use in managing flood hazards, assessing water flows, and improving irrigation practices, to name a few. This will result in improved understanding of multisensory data and its analysis which, in turn, will lead to better informed decision-making, improved policy development and future governance regarding hydrological systems in any given watershed scenario.\n***\nImage: Preliminary Research Road Map / Poster will highlight Quantitative Research (step 1)",

High resolution air photos, lidar and other satellite images are very useful in areas where the landslides can be fatal. Recently, radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques using more rapid revisit images from several radar satellites are increasingly being used in active deformation monitoring. The Canadian RADARSAT Constellation (RCM) is a three-satellite mission that will provide rapid revisits of four days interferometric (InSAR) capabilities that will be very useful for complex deformation monitoring. For instance, the monitoring of surface deformation due to permafrost activity, complex rock slide motion and steam assisted oil extraction will benefit from this new rapid revisit capability. This paper provide examples of how the high resolution (1-3 m) rapid revisit InSAR capabilities will improve our monitoring of surface deformation and provide insights in understanding triggering mechanisms. We analysed over a hundred high resolution InSAR images over a two year period on three geologically different sites with various configurations of topography, geomorphology, and geology conditions. We show from our analysis that the more frequent InSAR acquisitions are providing more information in understanding the rates of movement and failure process of permafrost triggered retrogressive thaw flows; the complex motion of an asymmetrical wedge failure of an active rock slide and the identification of over pressure zones related to oil extraction using steam injection.\nKeywords: High resolution, InSAR, rapid revisits, triggering mechanisms, oil extraction.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic jumps, or bores, are formed when a flow rapidly thickens and slows down, passing from a Froude number defined super to subcritical state. Such transitional behaviour occurs as a flow responds to changes in bed slope or channel geometry. Hydraulic jumps are thought to be ubiquitous features formed in submarine channelized flows, as well as in river channels.\nHere, for the first time, we present integrated velocity and density measurements across an array of hydraulic jumps. The velocity data were collected using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)), and the density data were collected using a Conductivity, Temperature Depth (CTD) probe. The hydraulic jumps were generated by scour features, in a channelized, density stratified flow exiting the Bosphorus Strait onto the continental shelf region in South West Black Sea. It is observed that with stratification of the flow the dilute upper layer completely bypasses any forcing arising from the changing bed slope, whilst the denser lower layer responds by generating an internal hydraulic jump. Such flow behaviour is distinct to that observed in open-channel systems, where flows are rarely sufficiently stratified to generate internal hydraulic jumps.\nThis direct field evidence supports previous experimental and theoretical analysis of hydraulic jumps in stratified shear flow. However, the field data raise several fundamental physical questions relating to the mechanics of internal hydraulic jumps. Firstly, it is observed that surface rollers, resulting in upstream flow velocity, are consistently found hundreds of metres before the slope break initiating the hydraulic jump. Secondly it is observed that the Froude criticality of the upper dilute layer is inversely related to that of the lower layer. Thirdly, it is noted that with a bypassing upper flow layer, sediment transport dynamics of coarse versus fine grained sediment past the slope break will be significantly different, resulting in characteristic depositional features unique to stratified flow conditions.",

Most, if not all, of these eruptions have in common the paradoxical coexistence of (1) eruptive styles which are inferred to be sustained in nature (subplinian and plinian), with (2) a pulsatory behavior displayed by the resulting fall deposits, and (3) the coeval ejection of vesicular tephra and pyroclastic obsidian. Through two case studies, we explore this apparent set of paradoxes, and their significance in understanding transitions from explosive to effusive behavior.\nIn this first case study (also cf. Leonhardi et al., same session), we present a new detailed stratigraphy of the AD1100 Big Glass Mountain eruption (Medicine Lake Volcano), along with a series of density measurements of tephra collected from several key units identified in the proximal fall deposits. The geochemical character of pumice and obsidian clasts from both the tephra and the obsidian flow is used to trace the origins of the different lithologies involved. We find that tens of waxing and waning cycles occurred during this eruption with at least two protracted phases, and that perhaps the term (sub)plinian may not be completely adequate to describe this particular eruption style.

            "abstract": "2014 HQ124 was discovered by the NEOWISE spacecraft on 2014 April 23, about six weeks before the asteroid made a very close Earth flyby within 0.0084 au (3.2 lunar distances) on June 8. Prior to the encounter, A. K. Mainzer used NEOWISE data and a thermal model to estimate a diameter of 330 +- 90 m. The NEOWISE data and photometry obtained by J. T. Pollock yielded a rotation period of ~20 h and a large lightcurve amplitude of 0.8 mag. The close approach, diameter, and slow rotation period indicated that this object would provide an outstanding opportunity for radar imaging, physical characterization, and orbit refinement. We observed 2014 HQ124 on June 8 and 10 with radar at Goldstone, Arecibo, and elements of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We conducted monostatic radar imaging observations at X-band (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) with the 70 m DSS-14 antenna and at S-band (2380 MHz, 13 cm) with Arecibo; bistatic X-band observations using DSS-14 to transmit and Arecibo and the 34 m DSS-13 antenna to receive; and S-band radar speckle observations to constrain the spin state using Arecibo as a transmitter and the Pie Town, Los Alamos, Ft. Davis, and Kitt Peak VLBA facilities as receivers. Radar astrometry improved the orbit significantly and increased the interval of reliable orbit estimation by a factor of two to ~900 years. The images achieve a resolution of 3.75 m x 0.00625 Hz and provide some of the most detailed radar views ever obtained for any near-Earth object. 2014 HQ124 is elongated, angular, and bifurcated with a long axis of at least 400 m. The asteroid has at least one large concavity, possible ridges, and small-scale surface features such as numerous radar-bright spots that are candidates for boulders. The larger lobe has a narrow, sinuous, ~100-m-long radar-dark feature that may be a scarp or perhaps a fault. These observations were the first test of new data taking equipment at Arecibo that can acquire dual-polarization images at 3.75 m resolution, which is twice as fine as the highest range resolution that Arecibo can achieve with monostatic observations. Receiving echoes at Arecibo using transmissions from Goldstone also boosts the signal-to-noise ratio by about a factor of five relative to monostatic Goldstone observations and is ideal for resolving very close and/or small near-Earth objects with slow spin states.",

Along the western flank of the central cordillera outcrops two different stratigraphic units with notable differences in the provenance and timing of accumulation.\nThe Abejorral Formation is the oldest sedimentary sequence (Albian-Aptian) that discordantly overlies the Triassic continental margin. this unit include two lithofacies clearly distinguishable, a lithofacies consist mostly of conglomerate, characterized by abundant quartz content , low compaction, rounded clasts and moderate sorting ; and the other is a interbedded of fine size sandstone, mudstone and chert; also with abundant quartz content further muscovite, containing basement and volcanic material .\nTo the west, sedimentary rocks including within the Quebradagrande Formation conform a turbidite sequence with a well defined Bouma type succession that concordantly overlied a Campanian marine volcanic arc succession. The conglomerates associated to this unit are characterized by containing mainly sedimentary and volcanic rock fragments ,high compaction, subrounded clast, and low sorting. This sequence is overlying by the volcanic component in a concord contact.\nWhereas the Albian-Aptian record of the Abejorral Formation exhibit the unroofing of the continental basement and deepening of an extensional basin that end up with effusive volcanism, the turbidite record with mixed continental and arc provenance associated to the Quebradagrande Formation is interpreted as the sedimentary marker of the arc-continent collision, marking the initiation of the Andean orogeny in the Northern Andes.",

            "abstract": "New insights into ages for sinistral-slip faults and how they operate in simple slip mode even after 60 degrees of vertical axis rotation are revealed by study of coarse gravels in the area within ~40 km of Barstow, CA. Using 31 new U-Pb dates of opaline soil precipitates and crosscutting veins in faults, we demonstrate that many deposits are in the 1-4 Ma age range. Clast provenance and transport direction from sedimentary structures indicate that in the Pliocene a line of uplifts lay from western Fort Irwin to the Daggett Ridge area SE of Barstow, forming an irregular north-trending divide. East of the divide, deposition occurred in broad east-flowing (in modern coordinates) stream valleys coincident with sinistral faults. This relation is best demonstrated from the Manix fault northward into Fort Irwin, and is also suggested for the Cady fault. West of the divide, data are limited but consistent with the interpretation that north-and south-flowing streams met in a central, W- or WSW-flowing system in an axial valley near the modern Mojave River. Folded Pliocene deposits and the paleogeography indicate that strain was partitioned into sinistral fault slip and folds parallel to faults, with synclines forming valleys 7-10 km wide. Folds associated with the dextral faults west of the divide are much broader, with wavelengths of ~50 km and ~westerly trends. Pliocene uplifts that formed the divide have mostly persisted as topographic highs that lie roughly along the boundary between sinistral and dextral domains. The uplifts may reflect block interactions along the boundary including differential vertical-axis rotation of blocks in the sinistral domain. Partitioning of strain into folds and faults helps resolve the conundrum of why sinistral faults that rotated ~60 degrees out of Coulomb failure orientation, and have little resolved shear stress, persist as simple strike-slip faults. It may also explain why the central Mojave Desert is more mountainous than the western Mojave Desert, where there are few sinistral faults. U-Pb ages of fault-related opal demonstrate that strike-slip faulting in both domains began well before 4 Ma, preceding the uplift of the eastern Transverse Ranges.",

            "abstract": "Over the past several years we have used Large Scale Kinetic (LSK) simulations in which the trajectories of millions of test particles are calculated in the electric and magnetic fields from a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere system to evaluate the effects of the large scale fields on particle motion and dynamics. By collecting the particles at “virtual detectors” placed throughout the magnetosphere we can get direct comparisons between the simulation results and observations. The LSK calculations, though not self-consistent, are a powerful tool for determining the effects of the large scale fields. Recently we have developed a new technique in which we model magnetospheric dynamics by using an implicit particle in cell simulation (iPIC3D) code in which the initial and boundary conditions are determined by the global MHD model. This provides a self-consistent calculation of particle dynamics including waves and instabilities not included in MHD.\nWe have applied the MHD plus PIC approach to a substorm on February 15, 2008. In the magnetotail we found that a series of dipolarizations formed due to unsteady reconnection. We also found that the largest electron acceleration occurred in the separatrices far from the x-point. We attributed the acceleration to a streaming instability in the separatrices. To further evaluate the acceleration mechanisms operating in this substorm we have applied the LSK technique to the electric and magnetic fields from the PIC simulations. Electrons are already included in the PIC simulation, but the LSK simulations will allow many more to be followed and analyzed. We will use the results to evaluate acceleration mechanisms in the PIC results and will present a comparison of LSK results in the MHD fields with those from the PIC fields.",

            "abstract": "Drylands of the Southwestern US are predicted to experience greater water limitations with climate change due to changes in precipitation and increased warming. Certain plants may be living at or near their tolerance thresholds in these ecosystems and thus subtle changes in water availability may have dramatic effects on their performances. We imposed a four-year experiment in the Colorado Plateau to assess the vulnerability of this dryland ecosystem to chronic, but subtle drought using 40 sites varying in plant communities, parent materials and soil textures. Within a site, two plots were selected with matching cover of target species, which were randomly assigned to either control (ambient precipitation) or drought (35% reduction) treatments. Drought treatments were imposed year-round from 2011 through 2014. Over the course of the experiment, we examined plant cover changes and mortality of four dominant plant functional types (PFT’s): C3 grasses, C4 grasses, C3 shrubs and C4 shrubs. We hypothesized that overall, grasses would be more sensitive to drought than shrubs, and that within these two groups, plants with C3 photosynthesis would be more sensitive than plants with C4 photosynthesis.\nDuring three of the four years, precipitation inputs were either near average (50th percentile, control) or dry (25th percentile, drought). However in 2012, both treatments experienced extremely dry growing season precipitation with the control and drought below the 5th and 1st percentiles, respectively. We observed three general responses to drought in this experiment: 1. change in cover with mortality (C3 grasses), 2. change in cover without mortality (C4 grasses and C4 shrubs) and 3. no change in cover or mortality (C3 shrubs). The dramatic responses of the C3 grasses suggest that this PFT is very sensitive to drought and it is living at or near its tolerance threshold in this region. While the C4 grasses also experienced cover changes, they did not experience widespread mortality and thus have higher tolerance to drought than the C3 grasses. Finally, contrary to our hypothesis, C3 shrubs were more drought tolerant than C4 shrubs. These results suggest that subtle changes in water availability may differentially impact key plant functional types and potentially alter the structure and function of this ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the phenomenon of asymmetric alluvial fan morphology along strike-slip faults. From analysis of high-resolution topographic data, we find that asymmetric alluvial fans are common along several strike-slip faults in the western United States. Affected fans are steeper in the direction of translation of the sediment source, often resulting in stream deflections counter to that expected from the sense of fault slip (e.g. left deflected streams along dextral faults). We hypothesize that fan asymmetry results from lateral translation of the sediment source relative to the depocenter. This relative motion changes the accommodation space in such a way that one side of the alluvial fan continuously progrades while the other is gradually abandoned. Therefore, lateral translation results in radial asymmetry of slopes about the fan apex. As a first approximation, we model this asymmetry as a result of diffusive sediment transport down fan. From this analysis, we predict that the degree of asymmetry of the alluvial fan is controlled by the ratio of sediment flux to fault slip rate. Qualitatively, more rapidly slipping faults should host more highly asymmetric fans; conversely, high sediment flux will obscure asymmetry. By measuring the sediment flux, through catchment-average concentration of cosmogenic isotopes or other means, we show that it is theoretically possible to quantify strike-slip fault slip-rates and alluvial-fan sediment transport rates using alluvial fan morphometry.",

This Kumano-nada coastal area has been repeatedly striked by historical great tsunamis. For the 1854 Ansei-Tokai earthquake and its tsunami, there are comparatively many historical records including historical documents and oral traditions for tsunami behavior and damages along the coast.\nBased on these records, a total of 42 tsunami heights were measured by using a laser range finder and a hand level on the basis of spot elevation given by 1/2500 topographical maps. The average inundation height of whole bay area was approximately 4 - 5 m. On the whole, in the closed-off section of the bay, large values were obtained. For example, the average value in Gokasho-ura town area was 4 m, and the maximum run-up height along the Gokasho river was 6.8 m. Particularly in Konsa, located in the most closed-off section of the bay, tsunami heights ranged between 4 - 11 m, and were higher than those in other districts. It was comparatively high along the eastern coast and eastern baymouth.\nWe simulate the distribution of the tsunami wave heights using numerical modeling, and compare the simulation results and above-mentioned actual historical data and results of our field survey. Based on fault models by Ando (1975), Aida (1981), and Annaka et al. (2003), the tsunami simulation was performed.\nAfter comparing the calculated results by three fault models, the wave height based on the model by Annaka et al. (2003) was found to have better agreement with observations. Moreover, the wave height values in a closed-off section of bay and at the eastern baymouth are high consistent with our survey data.",

The impact of burning on event hydrologic and erosion responses is strongly related to the degree to which burning alters vegetation, ground cover, and surface soils and the intensity and duration of precipitation. Fire impacts on hydrologic and erosion response may be intensified or reduced by inherent site characteristics such as topography and soil properties. Parameterization of these diverse conditions in predictive tools is often limited by a lack of data and/or understanding for the domain of interest. Furthermore, hydrologic and erosion functioning change as vegetation and ground cover recover in the years following burning and few studies track these changes over time. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of prescribed fire on vegetation, ground cover, soil water repellency, and hydrologic and erosion responses 1, 2, and 5 yr following burning of a mountain big sagebrush community on steep hillslopes with fine-textured soils. The study site is within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, southwestern Idaho, USA. Vegetation, ground cover, and soil properties were measured over plot scales of 0.5 m2 to 9 m2. Rainfall simulations (0.5 m2) were used to assess the impacts of fire on soil water repellency, infiltration, runoff generation, and splash-sheet erosion. Overland flow experiments (9 m2) were used to assess the effects of fire-reduced ground cover on concentrated-flow runoff and erosion processes. The study results provide insight regarding fire impacts on runoff, erosion, and soil water repellency in the immediate and short-term post-fire recovery years for steeply-sloped sagebrush sites with fine-textured soils. The study results also serve to inform development and enhancement of the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model for predicting runoff and erosion responses from disturbed and undisturbed sagebrush rangelands.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 Pisagua, Chile earthquake sequence, which struck the famous northern Chilean seismic gap, started with a Mw 6.7 earthquake on March 16th. This was followed by a 15 day-long earthquake swarm, including multiple Mw>6 earthquakes migrating northward on the plate interface, eventually resulting in a Mw 8.1 megathrust on April 1st. This produced an energetic aftershock sequence with one Mw 7.7 aftershock occurring on April 3rd. We have studied this interesting earthquake sequence by jointly inverting teleseismic data as well as strong motion data from the IPOC/CSN network. The initial efforts focused on the kinematic rupture parameters of the Mw 6.7 foreshock, Mw 8.1 mainshock, and Mw 7.7 aftershock. Our results show that the Mw 6.7 foreshock was a shallow intraplate event with a major asperity at ~12 km depth. Although its rupture was entirely within the overriding plate, this event created a strong static Coulomb stress perturbation on the plate interface, with a maximum value of ~0.2 MPa. We find that the hypocenters of its two largest earthquakes, Mw 6.4 on March 17th and Mw 6.2 on March 23rd are both located right on the plate interface where the Coulomb stress was increased. The rupture of the Mw 8.1 mainshock, spanning about 120 km along strike, initially travels down dip, roughly N100°E, with an apparent speed of 2.5 km/s for the first 25 seconds. Between 25 and 40 seconds, the rupture travels mainly southward (~N150°E) with an apparent speed of ~3 km/s, and more than 50% of the total seismic moment release in two major asperities. The third stage of the earthquake took place between 40 and 70 seconds with the rupture propagating slowly (<2 km/s) towards the northern end of the coseismic rupture zone. The slip of the Mw 7.7 aftershock is heterogeneous, with three well-resolved asperities, visually complementary to the rupture of the mainshock. We also notice that the complex rupture patterns associated with this interesting earthquake sequence apparently correlate well with the local gravity anomaly and geological settings, which will be further explored.",

Unintended migration of fluids from carbon storage formations not only compromises the goal of long-term carbon storage efficiency, but also leads to increased risks and liabilities. To fully characterize all attributes of leakage events (e.g., leak location and onset time), a leak detection tool must possess sufficient sensitivity and reliability. In this study, we demonstrate a novel leakage detection method based on harmonic pulse testing (HPT), in which a sinusoidal injection pattern is applied to probe potential leaks in carbon storage formations. Although HPT has been used for reservoir characterization, its efficacy for leakage detection requires further theoretical, numerical, and experimental validation. Our theoretical analysis and single- and multiphase modeling show that HPT is a viable and cost-effective method for pressure-based leakage diagnosis. Mega-scale laboratory experiments are being conducted using a 1-m diameter and 0.77m tall stainless tank to validate theoretical and numerical models. The results from numerical modeling, as well as from early experiments, will be presented.",

            "abstract": "In reason of inland freshwaters sensitivity to Harmful algae blooms (HAB) development and the limits coverage of standards monitoring programs, remote sensing data have become increasingly used for monitoring HAB extension. Usually, HAB monitoring using remote sensing data is based on empirical and semi-empirical models. Development of such models requires a great number of continuous in situ measurements to reach an acceptable accuracy. However, Ministries and water management organizations often use two thresholds, established by the World Health Organization, to determine water quality. Consequently, the available data are ordinal «semi-qualitative» and they are mostly unexploited. Use of such databases with remote sensing data and statistical classification algorithms can produce hazard management maps linked to the presence of cyanobacteria. Unlike standard classification algorithms, which are generally unstable, classifiers based on ensemble systems are more general and stable. In the present study, an ensemble based classifier was developed and compared to a standard classification method called CART (Classification and Regression Tree) in a context of HAB monitoring in freshwaters using MODIS images downscaled to 250 spatial resolution and ordinal in situ data. Calibration and validation data on cyanobacteria densities were collected by the Ministère du Développement durable, de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques on 22 waters bodies between 2000 and 2010. These data comprise three density classes: waters poorly (< 20,000 cells mL‑1), moderately (20,000 - 100,000 cells mL‑1), and highly (> 100,000 cells mL‑1) loaded in cyanobacteria. Results were very interesting and highlighted that inland waters exhibit different spectral response allowing them to be classified into the three above classes for water quality monitoring. On the other, even if the accuracy (Kappa-index = 0.86) of the proposed approach is relatively lower than that of the CART algorithm (Kappa-index = 0.87), but its robustness is higher with a standard-deviation of 0.05 versus 0.06, specifically when applied on MODIS images. A new accurate, robust, and quick approach is thus proposed for a daily near real-time monitoring of HAB in southern Quebec freshwaters.",

            "abstract": "In performing autocorrelation of ambient noise, the station acts as both a receiver and a source of seismic waves. This allows for the computation of the crustal reflection response. Two years of broadband data are processed in 10-hour segments from 25 Transportable Array (TA) stations in the central U.S. Multiple bandpass filters are evaluated, and one with corners between 1 and 2.5 Hz is used to remove the greatest range of noise without compromising visibility of the reflections. The power spectrum of the ambient noise (amplitude of the stacked autocorrelations) shows resonant peaks in the frequency domain presumably caused by harmonic sources near the station. These resonance peaks are a source of noise when interpreting the autocorrelations in the time domain, since they are not represented in the structure response. To improve the reflection response, the peaks are removed through a short-term average (sta) and long-term average (lta) algorithm applied to the amplitude spectrum. The data are migrated using a simple 1-D velocity model derived from Catchings (1999) to compute two-way travel times of hypothetical reflectors in the crust. The horizontal components are migrated using the S wave velocities and the vertical component using the P wave velocities to model the expected shear and P wave reflections respectively. Comparing images with the S and P waves reveal similarity in depth of crustal reflectors, which gives confidence that the observations are crustal discontinuities. The data for stations within the Mississippi Embayment reveal a discontinuity at or near the estimated sediment thickness at each station. Reflections in the data are present at the approximate depth of the Moho as obtained from the Earthscope Automated Receiver Survey for each station.",

            "abstract": "Changes in total water thickness in most of California are being estimated using GPS measurements of vertical ground displacement. The Sierra Nevada each year subsides about 12 mm in the fall and winter due to the load of rain and snow, then rises about the same amount in the spring and summer when the snow melts, water runs off, and soil moisture evaporates. Earth's elastic response to a surface load is well known (except at thick sedimentary basins). Changes in equivalent water thickness can thus be inferred [Argus Fu Landerer 2014]. The average seasonal change in total water thickness is found to be 0.5 meters in the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains and 0.1 meters in the Great Basin. The average seasonal change in the Sierra Nevada Mountains estimated with GPS is 35 Gigatons.\nGPS vertical ground displacements are furthermore being used to estimate changes in water in consecutive years of either drought or heavy precipitation. Changes in the sum of snow and soil moisture during California's drought from June 2011 to June 2014 are estimated from GPS in this study. Changes in water in California's massive reservoirs are well known and removed, yielding an estimate of change in the thickness of snow plus soil moisture. Water loss is found to be largest near the center of the southern Sierra Nevada (0.8 m equivalent water thickness) and smaller in the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Klamath Mountains (0.3 m).\nThe GPS estimates of changes in the sum of snow and soil moisture complement GRACE observations of water change in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River basin. Whereas GPS provides estimates of water change at high spatial resolution in California's mountains, GRACE observes changes in groundwater in the Central Valley. We will further compare and contrast the GPS and GRACE measurements, and also evaluate the finding of Amos et al. [2014] that groundwater loss in the southern Central Valley (Tulare Basin) is causing the mountains on either side to rise at 1 to 3 mm/yr.",

            "abstract": "All we know about life and our understanding of its distribution throughout the Universe is based on our understanding of how life originated and evolved, and how it has persisted here on Earth. As we have refined our list of requirements for earth-like organisms and explored the limits of our biosphere, a variety of possible extraterrestrial habitats that could support life have emerged. Although our access to other potentially habitable worlds is limited, we continue to increase our understanding of the environmental conditions on bodies in our solar system which can inform our search for appropriate analogue sites. There is no perfect analogue for other planetary habitable environments on Earth. Earth is a planet with plate tectonics, a hydrological cycle, a thick atmosphere and stronger gravity than most candidate systems. Moreover, present day Earth is a verdant, interconnected system resulting from billions of years of biosphere evolution. Such differences pose a challenge to analogue research and in particular limit the interpretation of the environment under study in important ways. Earth’s extreme environments have been proposed as analogues of planetary environments. A common error is to assume if an environment is extreme or it is cold and dry it will make an excellent analogue site. The value of an analogue site is measured by a good assessment of the relevance of a site with rigorous attention to its Earth-based limitations is necessary and it will have different impacts depending on the question under study. Additionally, modern and ancient systems on earth can also be investigated in order to target a future search for as yet undetected terrestrial features and processes that preserve or indicate signs of past life. Despite any limitations, analogue research is essential and field research at these terrestrial sites represents a growing aspect of planetary science. Those relevant to the search for life are supported by NASA’s Planetary Science, Technology through Analog Research (PSTAR).",

            "abstract": "Beno Gutenberg first identified a seismic low velocity zone in the upper mantle that we now refer to as the asthenosphere that is still the focus of many studies in active tectonic regions. The upper-most mantle is very heterogeneous and occupies the depth range where much of the tectonic action occurs especially in subduction zones and convergent margins. The central South American convergent margin is the result of the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate and includes the Andes, one of the largest actively growing mountain ranges on Earth. The South American subduction zone has two regions of “flat” subduction in Peru and central Chile and Argentina separated by a segment of “normal” subduction and an active magmatic arc. The central Andean plateau has an average elevation of 3-4 km and some of the thickest crust on Earth with deformation reaching ~800 km inland. This active margin is characterized by along-strike variations in magmatism, upper crustal shortening, crustal thickness, and slab geometry that make it an ideal region to study the relationship between the subducting slab, the mantle wedge, and the overriding plate. After 20 years of portable seismic deployments in the Central Andes seismologists have generated unprecedented seismic images spanning ~3000 km of the Andean lithosphere, the subducting Nazca slab, and the surrounding mantle. Seismic travel-time, ambient noise and earthquake surface-wave tomography, receiver function imaging, and joint receiver function - surface wave dispersion inversions have produced along strike images of the Central Andes from the surface to a depth of ~700 km. These new images were made possible by PI-driven portable broadband seismic deployments and data sharing by many international groups. I will highlight images of along-strike variations in crustal properties and thickness, mantle lithospheric structure, and slab geometry. These seismic images allow us to more completely evaluate the role of several tectonic processes in the formation and uplift of the Andes including: (1) overthickened continental crust driven by crustal shortening, (2) changes in slab dip and coupling with the overlying plate (3) localized lithospheric foundering, and (4) large-scale mantle and crustal melting leading to magmatic addition and/or crustal flow.",

Polar Portal is a single web portal presenting a wide range of near real-time information on both the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic sea-ice in a format geared for non-specialists.\nPolar Portal aims to meet widespread public interest in a diverse range of climate-cryosphere processes in the Arctic: What is the present Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise? How quickly are outlet glaciers retreating or advancing right now? How extensive is Arctic sea-ice or how warm is the Arctic Ocean at this moment? Although public interest in such topics is widely acknowledged, an important primary task for the scientists behind Polar Portal was collaborating with media specialists to establish the knowledge range of the general public on these topics, in order for Polar Portal to appropriately present useful climate-cryosphere information. Consequently, Polar Portal is designed in a highly visual exploratory format, where individual data products are accompanied by plain written summaries, with hyperlinks to relevant journal papers for more scrutinizing users. Numerous satellite and in situ observations, together with model output, are channeled daily into the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic sea-ice divisions of Polar Portal.",

            "abstract": "Simulations of Polar Mesospheric Cloud (PMC) brightness and ice water content (IWC) are used to develop a simple robust method for IWC retrieval from UV satellite observations. We compare model simulations of IWC with retrievals from the UV Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) experiment on board the satellite mission Aeronomy for Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM). This instrument remotely senses scattered brightness related to the vertically-integrated ice content. Simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), a chemistry climate model, is combined with a sectional microphysics model based on the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA). The model calculates high-resolution three-dimensional size distributions of ice particles. The internal variability is due to geographic and temporal variation of temperature and dynamics, water vapor, and meteoric dust. We examine all simulations from a single model day (we chose northern summer solstice) which contains several thousand model clouds. Accurate vertical integrations of the albedo and IWC are obtained. The ice size distributions are thus based on physical principles, rather than artificial analytic distributions that are often used in retrieval algorithms from observations. Treating the model clouds as noise-free data, we apply the CIPS algorithm to retrieve cloud particle size and IWC. The inherent “errors” in the retrievals are thus estimated. The linear dependence of IWC on albedo makes possible a method to derive IWC, called the Albedo-Ice regression method, or AIR. This method potentially unifies the variety of data from various UV experiments, with the advantages of (1) removing scattering-angle bias from cloud brightness measurements,(2) providing a physically-useful parameter (IWC),(3) deriving IWC even for faint clouds of small average particle sizes, and (4) estimating the statistical uncertainty as a random error, which bypasses the need to derive particle size.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for significant microbial influences on atmospheric chemistry, cloud condensation, and ice nuclei concentrations, with known health impacts, yet we have a limited understanding of the types, abundances, and spatiotemporal dynamics of bacteria and fungi in the atmosphere. Here we use culture-independent molecular approaches, including targeted gene sequencing and quantitative PCR, to characterize bacterial and fungal community composition and abundance in the atmospheric boundary layer. We present results from 32 air samples, collected via vacuum filtration at 10 m and 250 m on the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory tower (Erie, CO) between November 2013 and April 2014. Samples were collected at night, and each sample was integrated over consecutive nights for approximately two weeks. Significant temporal shifts in bacterial and fungal community composition were observed over the course of the study, corresponding to changing bacterial and fungal concentrations. Within the same sampling time periods, bacterial and fungal communities from the near-surface atmosphere (10 m) were generally similar to those aloft (250 m), although coupled temporal and altitudinal effects were observed in some cases, particularly for fungi. Overall, our results indicate that bacterial and fungal communities exhibit minimal vertical stratification throughout the nocturnal atmospheric boundary layer but show a high degree of variability on two-week timescales. This study paves the way for further research into the connections between boundary layer microbiology, atmospheric dynamics, emissions, and local meteorology.",

The CUAHSI led Hydrological Information Systems (HIS) and supporting products have paved the way to efficient data sharing and discovery in the hydrological sciences. Based on the CUAHSI-HIS framework concepts for hydrologic data sharing we developed a unique system devoted to the George Mason University scientific community to support university wide data sharing and discovery as well as real time data access for extreme events situational awareness. The internet-based system will provide an interface where the researchers will input data collected from the measurement stations and present them to the public in form of charts, tables, maps, and documents. Moreover, the system is developed in ASP.NET MVC 4 using as Database Management System, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, and hosted by Amazon Web Services. Currently the system is supporting the Mason Watershed Project providing historical hydrological, atmospheric and water quality data for the campus watershed and real time flood conditions in the campus. The system is also a gateway for unprecedented data collection of hurricane storm surge hydrodynamics in coastal wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay providing not only access to historical data but recent storms such as Hurricane Arthur. Future research includes coupling the system to a real-time flood alert system on campus, and besides providing data on the World Wide Web, to foment and provide a venue for interdisciplinary collaboration within the water scientists in the region.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake-cycle models for major strike-slip faults suggest that stationary, localized interseismic deformation and large-scale, rapidly decaying postseismic transients may be reconciled if a strong lithosphere, a low-viscosity mantle asthenosphere and a largely aseismic shear zone extending from the brittle-ductile transition to the mantle asthenosphere are incorporated. Localized late interseismic deformation around major strike-slip faults seems to call for a “stiff” shear zone (maintaining shear stresses of at least several MPa) in the lower crust and mantle lithosphere, and rapid postseismic deformation requires that part of the shear zone (likely in the mid crust) should have a low effective viscosity per unit width, at least during the postseismic interval (Yamasaki et al., 2014, Hearn and Thatcher, 2014).\nRecent paleoseismological studies suggest a preponderance of M 7.3 to 7.7 earthquakes during the past 650 years along the 1857 rupture segment of the San Andreas Fault (SAF), with just two events comparable in magnitude to the 1857 earthquake (Scharer et al., 2014). Very low shear stresses (less than 0.001 MPa) and a frictional rheology have also been inferred along the northern part of this segment between depths of 16 and 29 km, based on tidal triggering of low-frequency earthquakes (Beeler et al., 2013). I have refined my 3D viscoelastic finite-element earthquake-cycle models to address whether extremely low SAF-parallel shear stresses in the mid crust can be reconciled with localized and invariant interseismic deformation (and an apparent locking depth of 16-18 km) if earthquakes are smaller and more frequent than assumed by Hearn and Thatcher (2014). Results from models incorporating frictional afterslip and viscous shear zone creep will be presented for a small set of plausible rupture histories that take smaller earthquakes into account.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice is important for assessment of food security, management of water resources, estimation of greenhouse gas (methane) emissions, and understanding avian influenza virus transmission. Over the past two decades, paddy rice cultivation has expanded northward in temperate and cold temperate zones, particularly in Northeastern China. There is a need to quantify and map changes in paddy rice planting areas in Northeastern Asia (Japan, North and South Korea, and northeast China) at annual interval. We developed a pixel- and phenology-based image analysis system, MODIS-RICE, to map the paddy rice in Northeastern Asia by using multi-temporal MODIS thermal and surface reflectance imagery. Paddy rice fields during the flooding and transplanting phases have unique physical and spectral characteristics, which make it possible for the development of an automated and robust algorithm to track flooding and transplanting phases of paddy rice fields over time. In this presentation, we will show the MODIS-based annual maps of paddy rice planting area in the Northeastern Asia from 2000-2014 (500-m spatial resolution). Accuracy assessments using high-resolution images show that the resultant paddy rice map of Northeastern Asia had a comparable accuracy to the existing products, including 2010 Landsat-based National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) of China, the 2010 RapidEye-based paddy rice map in North Korea, and the 2010 AVNIR-2-based National Land Cover Dataset in Japan in terms of both area and spatial pattern of paddy rice. This study has demonstrated that our novel MODIS-Rice system, which use both thermal and optical MODIS data over a year, are simple and robust tools to identify and map paddy rice fields in temperate and cold temperate zones.",

            "abstract": "This paper summarizes lessons learned from an ongoing series of climate change assessments for California, conducted by the scientific community and State and local agencies. A series of three Assessments have considered vulnerability and adaptation issues for both managed and natural systems. California’s vulnerability is many faceted, arising because of an exceptionally drought prone climate, open coast and large estuary exposure to sea level rise, sensitive ecosystems and complex human footprint and economy. Key elements of the assessments have been a common set of climate and sea-level rise scenarios, based upon IPCC GCM simulations. Regionalized and localized output from GCM projections was provided to research teams investigating water supply, agriculture, coastal resources, ecosystem services, forestry, public health, and energy demand and hydropower generation. The assessment results are helping to investigate the broad range of uncertainty that is inherent in climate projections, and users are becoming better equipped to process an envelope of potential climate and impacts. Some projections suggest that without changes in California’s present fresh-water delivery system, serious water shortages would take place, but that technical solutions are possible. Under a warmer climate, wildfire vulnerability is heightened markedly in some areas--estimated increases in burned area by the end of the 21st Century exceed 100% of the historical area burned in much of the forested areas of Northern California Along California coast and estuaries, projected rise in mean sea level will accelerate flooding occurrences, prompting the need for better education and preparedness. Many policymakers and agency personnel in California are factoring in results from the assessments and recognize the need for a sustained assessment process. An ongoing challenge, of course, is to achieve more engagement with a broader community of decision makers, and notably with the private sector.",

We sampled a complete section of gabbros, dikes, and basalts along the Wadi Gideah in the Cretaceous ophiolite of Oman that is regarded as the best example of fast-spread oceanic lithosphere on land. Here we present trace element data displaying systematic compositional trends that are correlated with stratigraphic depth (distance to MOHO) in the plutonic suite. Concentrations of incompatible trace elements Th, Nb, Ta, REE, Zr, Hf show little variation in the layered gabbro section but display a continuous increase from foliated to varitextured gabbros. In contrast, Nb/Ta, Nb/La, Zr/Hf, La/Yb, La/Nd show significant fractionation in the layered and foliated gabbros suggesting in situ crystallization in a lower crustal filter layer and formation of small portions of highly evolved interstitial melt also favoring crystallization of zircon. Further up, fractional crystallization processes in a well-mixed magma chamber control the composition of isotropic gabbros and sheeted dikes where fractionation of HFSE element ratios is minor.",

These models do not cover eastern China uniformly. In this presentation, we report on an effort to generate a complete 3-D model of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath eastern China using the state-of-art surface wave and body wave inversion techniques. Highlights of this effort include: 1) We collect ambient noise cross-correlations for over 1,800 seismic stations from the CEArray, China Array and multiple PASSCAL experiments in northeastern China/Tibet. Based on this data base, we perform a uniform surface wave tomography for the study area. 2) We collect P-wave receiver functions for over 1,000 stations in this area to further constrain crustal structures. 3) We adopt a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion to the Rayleigh wave dispersion maps and produce a uniform 3-D model with uncertainties of the crust and uppermost mantle. 4) In the areas where receiver functions are collected, the surface wave inversion is replaced by a joint inversion of surface waves and receiver functions and the uncertainties of the Moho structure are significantly reduced. As more seismic arrays (e.g., the phase II of the China Array) are added to this area and other seismic observations (i.e., the Rayleigh wave H/V ratio) are obtained in the future, higher resolution models with increasingly reliable structural features will be assimilated into this 3-D model.",

The level of fluctuations is supposed to be high but Langmuir waves generated by the beam instability are supposed to be not trapped inside the density depletions. This system can be considered as a\ngood approximation\nof beam-plasma interaction in the solar wind. We describe the system in terms of\nprobability\ndensity for the density fluctuations that determines the probability density for wave phase\nvelocities\nduring wave propagation. We suppose that at each moment of time an electron can interact only with one single wave having the phase velocity equal to its velocity or do not interact at all. We suppose that the amplitudes and electron distribution functions vary slowly with respect to single wave-particle interaction that allows one to average over a large number of interactions. This allows one to write Smoluhovsky equation for probability for particle having velocity V0 at time t0 to have velocity V at time t. From this description one can obtain Kolmogorov-Feller equation for slow variations of electron distribution function similar to the diffusion equation in quasilinear approximation. This probabilistic approach allows finding out the dependence of diffusion coefficients on statistical distribution of plasma density fluctuations. We use Liouville equation to describe the evolution of the Langmuir wave's spectral power, for each single wave. To describe slow evolution of the wave power we use averaged wave growth rate. It is obtained from the probability for the wave to have the resonant velocity on the interval. The equations obtained are solved numerically. We evaluate the influence of the density inhomogeneities on the beam relaxation time. As a result the length of relaxation of the electron beam in such inhomogeneous plasma is much longer than in homogeneous case and our goal is to determine the dependence of this length on characteristics of the statistical properties of density fluctuations.",

Finally, a lightning density product was introduced to forecasters as a precursor to the new Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) that will be housed on GOES-R, to monitor the most active regions of convection, which might indicate a disruption in the tropical environment and even signal the onset of extratropical transition. This presentation will focus on a few case studies that exhibit extratropical transition and point out the usefulness of these new satellite techniques in aiding forecasters forecast these challenging events.",

            "abstract": "Forest successional theory describes the changes in forest biomass and community composition from forest establishment to climax communities, but the drivers of succession are still widely debated. For example, successional models have related biomass and community change to stand age, species rarity within the community, small-scale disturbance, or the ability of species to survive under low resource conditions. The degree to which these drivers might vary regionally limits our ability to model and predict ecosystem change. Our objective was to assess whether forest successional theory explains observed changes in species biomass and community composition across forests of the U. S. Pacific Northwest. Using remeasurements of 9,700 Current Vegetation Survey (CVS) National Forest inventory plots primarily in Oregon and Washington, we quantified the effects of forest stand age, community composition, disturbance, and moisture (i.e., topography and climate) on changes in species-specific proportional live biomass (ΔB) and species dominance (ΔD). We focused on differences in forest successional patterns in two vegetation zones: the Tsuga heterophylla (TSHE) zone, found at low elevations on the wet, west side of the Cascade Mountains; and the Abies concolor (ABCO) zone, found at mid-elevations on the dry, east side of the Cascade Mountains. Preliminary results indicate that the regional differences in tree species biomass change and dominance appear to be related to responses to climate and disturbance. Strong positive effects of cover change on ΔB were observed in the drier ABCO zone, but not the wetter TSHE zone. ΔB and ΔD were more often sensitive to precipitation and topographic position in the ABCO zone. In both regions, we found that ΔB was strongly negatively related to species biomass and stand age while ΔD was strongly negatively related to relative density, highlighting the importance of both age and community in shaping succession. Given that the importance of different forest successional processes in shaping ecosystem change varied regionally, this work provides valuable insights into potential risks of changing climate and disturbance regimes to species persistence and ecosystem stability across forests of the U.S. Pacific Northwest.",

Rainfall and aerosol samples were collected between June 15, 2011 and July 27, 2013 at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS) located near the eastern end of the island of Bermuda. Collectors were situated near ground level, clear of surrounding vegetation, at a meteorological monitoring station in front of the BIOS laboratory, about 10 m above sea level. This is a Bermuda Air Quality Program site used for ambient air quality monitoring. To quantify the atmospheric deposition of Be-7, plastic buckets were deployed for collection of fallout over ~3 week periods. Wet deposition was collected for trace element analysis using a specially modified “GEOTRACES” N-CON automated wet deposition collector. Aerosol samples were collected with a Tisch TE-5170V-BL high volume aerosol sampler, modified to collect 12 replicate samples on acid-washed 47mm diameter Whatman-41 filters, using procedures identical to those used for the US GEOTRACES aerosol program (Morton et al., 2013). Aerosol and rainfall samples were analyzed for total Na, Mg, Al, P, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr, Cd, Sb, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pb, Th, and U using ICPMS. Confirming earlier data from Bermuda, strong seasonality in rainfall and aerosol loading and chemistry was observed, particularly for aerosol and rainfall Fe concentrations when Saharan dust arrives in July/August with SE trajectories.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean is thought to have played a key role in atmospheric CO2 (CO2,atm) variations, both via its role in bringing carbon-rich deep-waters into contact with the atmosphere, and via its capacity for enhanced biologically mediated carbon export into the deep sea. The governing mechanisms of millennial scale rises in CO2,atm during the last deglacial and glacial periods have been linked controversially either with variations in biological export productivity, possibly driven by fluctuations in airborne dust supply, or to variations in southern high-latitude vertical mixing, possibly driven by changes in westerly wind stress or density stratification across the Southern Ocean water column. However, the impact of these processes on deep, southern high-latitude carbon sequestration and ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange remain ambiguous. We present proxy evidence for the link between deep carbon storage in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic with changes in CO2,atm during the last 70 ka from sub-millennially resolved changes in bottom water oxygenation based on the uranium accumulation in authigenic coatings on foraminiferal shells and the δ13C offset between epibenthic and infaunal foraminifera (Δδ13C). We compare our results with reconstructed opal fluxes and sediment model output data to assess the impact of physical and biological processes on Southern Ocean carbon storage. While variations in sub-Antarctic Atlantic export production are intrinsically linked with changes in airborne dust supply supporting the major impact of dust on the biological soft-tissue pump, they cannot account for observed changes in pore water organic carbon respiration indicated by increasing Δδ13C and therefore, bottom water oxygen changes in the deep sub-Antarctic Atlantic. This is in strong support of millennial-scale fluctuations in deep Southern Ocean carbon storage primarily controlled by the ventilation of the deep ocean by southern-sourced water masses, which emphasize the strong control of vertical mixing and upwelling of CO2-rich water masses in the Southern Ocean on the ocean-atmosphere exchange of CO2 and variation in CO2,atm over both glacial-interglacial and millennial time scales.",

            "abstract": "Stable isotopes can provide considerable insight into enzymatic mechanisms and fluxes in various biological processes. In our studies, we used stable isotopes to characterize both enzyme-catalyzed H2 and N2O production. H2 is a potential alternative clean energy source and also a key metabolite in many microbial communities. Biological H2 production is generally catalyzed by hydrogenases, enzymes that combine protons and electrons to produce H2 under anaerobic conditions. In our study, H isotopes and fractionation factors (α) were used to characterize two types of hydrogenases: [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Due to differences in the active site, the α associated with H2 production for [FeFe]- and [NiFe]-hydrogenases separated into two distinct clusters (αFeFe > αNiFe). The calculated kinetic isotope effects indicate that hydrogenase-catalyzed H2 production has a preference for light isotopes, consistent with the relative bond strengths of O-H and H-H bonds. Interestingly, the isotope effects associated with H2 consumption and H2-H2O exchange reactions were also characterized, but in this case no specific difference was observed between the different enzymes.\nN2O is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 300 times that of CO2, and the concentration of N2O is currently increasing at a rate of ~0.25% per year. Thus far, bacterial and fungal denitrification processes have been identified as two of the major sources of biologically generated N2O. In this study, we measured the δ15N, δ18O, δ15Nα (central N atom in N2O), and δ15Nβ (terminal N atom in N2O) of N2O generated by purified fungal P450 nitric oxide reductase (P450nor) from Histoplasma capsulatum. We observed normal isotope effects for δ18O and δ15Nα, and inverse isotope effects for bulk δ15N (the average of Nα and Nβ) and δ15Nβ. The observed isotope effects have been used in conjunction with DFT calculations to provide important insight into the mechanism of P450nor. Similar experiments were performed with bacterial nitric oxide reductase from Paracoccus denitrificans (cNOR). In this case both Nα and Nβ exhibited inverse isotope effects, while O had a normal isotope effect. Together, these data highlight the utility in using stable isotopes as both tracers and mechanistic probes when studying metabolic processes.",

Based on this proposition, a point-based algorithm, called a homogenous locator (HL), has been developed to invert simultaneously the position (horizontal position and depth) and structural index (SI) of the magnetic sources that generate the total magnetic intensity (TMI) and its gradient and full tensor magnetic gradiometry (FTMG). The algorithm is then tested against point sources (pole and dipoles) and compared with standard Euler deconvolution (SED) using synthetic and field data sets. Cases with sole induction and remnant dipole moment are also investigated and compared. Results show that: (1) Both techniques can predict very accurately the horizontal positions and with less accuracy in depth prediction, but the homogenous locator has higher accuracy; (2) the homogenous locator can produce much few solutions on average for locating each magnetic object; (3) Since homogenous locator inverts SI simultaneously, clusters of SI around different centers can classify the source types accurately. This is a main advantage of the homogenous locator. While for each value of SI as an input to SED, magnetic sources of different types (pole and dipole) are all located, resulting in almost 100% of both commission and omission errors in classification of the types of sources; and (4) the homogenous locator is more sensitive to remnant than SED.",

ANGWIN currently comprises research measurements from five nations (U.S., U.K., Australia, Japan, and Brazil) at seven international stations.

Using infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy to peak pressures of 50-70 GPa at room temperature, we document closure of the electronic energy gaps for both salts as they transition from ionic toward metallic states under compression. The gaps likely reflect the separation between occupied-states primarily associated with the anion, and unoccupied metal-ion states. Room-temperature x-ray diffraction to 80 GPa and first-principles calculations (density functional theory) reveal a continuous displacive transition in PbCl2 (orthorhombic I-II transition), which is expected to become metallic around 100 GPa; metallization of SnCl2 is anticipated near 80 GPa.\nHigh-pressure shock experiments show that fluid SiO2 is metallic at the high temperatures achieved in giant impacts (> 1-2 eV). Thus, the transition to metallic states of several crystalline AX2 analogs suggests that rocky matter may more generally become metallic inside large terrestrial planets. These studies imply a blurring between the traditional concepts of mantle and core, with metallic silicates potentially being present in crystalline form in the mantles and in liquid form in the cores of super-Earths.",

            "abstract": "Absorbing boundary conditions are required for elastodynamic simulations in finite domains. The Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) have become the state-of-the-art method since its introduction (Berenger 1994). PML approaches have been proved to be very efficient and easy to implement. However, sometimes numerical instabilities originated in the PML layers can appear, even for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, it has been proven that PML have an amplifying behaviour, i.e. numerical instabilities (Becache et al. 2003). For delaying the appearance of these PML instabilities, different pragmatic approaches has been proposed (Meza-Fajarado & Papageorgiou 2008; Martin et al. 2008; Etienne et al. 2010). Yet, there are no guarantee for long-term stabilities and one can observe less efficient absorptions for these adhoc approaches. Recently, a new method, called SMART-layer method, has been proposed and has been shown theoretically to be stable even for anisotropic media (Halpern et al. 2011; Metivier et al. 2013). The SMART-layer method is a robust and simple to design method. However boundary conditions are not perfectly matched even for the continuous case for the SMART-layer method while it is for the PML method. Therefore, stronger reflections are observed at the interface between the domain of interest and the absorbing layers.. We implement this absorbing boundary conditions for the elastodynamics equations in a discontinuous Galerkin scheme and we will show that this numerical implementation does not exhibit numerical instabilities when using different mesh designs while the PML method does for the same simulation of wave propagation in isotropic medium. We finally show how SMART-layer method is competitive with respect to the PML method in terms of efficiency and computational cost, opening roads for systematic implementation of such absorbing boundary conditions in available seismic wave propagation tools.",

            "abstract": "Mineral dust transported through the atmosphere affects the radiative balance of the planet, and can also affect climate on glacial-interglacial timescales by stimulating carbon export from the surface ocean. Tracking changes in dust fluxes and sources in paleoarchives, such as polar ice cores, allows us to reconstruct past atmospheric circulation patterns, dust transport pathways, and atmospheric aerosol loadings. The geographic source of mineral dust particles can be identified using geochemical tools, such as trace element chemistry and radiogenic isotope signatures. We extracted mineral particles and analyzed the Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic signatures from eight particle-rich “Megadust” layers in the WAIS Divide ice core in order to determine their sources. We also analyzed tephras from three local West Antarctic volcanoes: Mts. Takahe, Mt. Waesche, and Mt. Berlin.\nThe “Megadust” events occurred between ~60-27ky and deposited mm-cm thick layers of mineral material in the WAIS Divide ice core. Previous hypotheses about the source of the Megadust particles suggested a distal continental source, but our chemical and isotopic analyses, as well as mineralogy, indicate that West Antarctic volcanoes are the dominant source of particles during these events. This further suggests that the active local volcanoes may have contributed to the West Antarctic dust load in discrete events, and that they may be a background source over longer time scales. In addition, these volcanic events may also be useful as stratigraphic markers in other West Antarctic climate archives.",

            "abstract": "Static chambers are often employed to measure soil trace gas fluxes. Gas concentrations (C) in the headspace are sampled at different times (t), and for each group of chamber measurements, flux rates are frequently calculated as the slope of linear regressions of C versus t (ultimately, statistical analyses are performed with the flux rate “data”). While non-linear regressions are recognized to be more accurate than linear regressions, a trade-off with precision can arise due to variability in raw data leading to poor curve fits, and groups of data with too few observations or with poor regression fits (i.e., low R2) are often discarded. We solve these problems via a hierarchical Bayesian approach that fits a simple, dynamic non-linear model of C versus t based on Fick’s law. Data are from the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment (PHACE) study that involves manipulations of atmospheric CO2, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation. CO2, CH4, and N2O gas samples were collected from static chambers bi-weekly during five growing seasons, resulting in >12,000 individual gas samples and >3100 groups of samples and associated fluxes. Using these data, we compare flux estimates from our non-linear model to those obtained from a linear model, and we evaluate the effect of conducting independent regressions for each group of samples versus simultaneously estimating the fluxes for all groups within a hierarchical framework motivated by the PHACE experimental design. The CO2 flux estimates from the hierarchical linear and non-linear models fit the observed CO2 data well (R2 = 0.97) and were highly correlated with each other (r = 0.99), but the linear model resulted in estimates that were ~10% lower than the non-linear model. The hierarchical versus non-hierarchical models also produced similar flux estimates (r = 0.94), but the non-hierarchical version yielded notably less precise estimates (the 95% CIs for its fluxes were 1-2 orders of magnitude wider that the hierarchical model). Hence, the hierarchical, non-linear approach to estimating trace gas fluxes from static chambers is a significant improvement upon the non-hierarchical (independent groups) and linear regression approaches, which tend to produce highly uncertain (non-hierarchical models) and biased (underestimated, linear model) flux estimates.",

            "abstract": "Numerical investigations of surface deformation in response to flat slab subduction began with seminal papers by Bird (1988) and Mitrovica et al. (1989). Recently, a number of numerical studies have begun to explore the complexity in the dynamics of flat-slab subduction initiation and continuation, but did not address the corresponding surface deformation (English et al., 2003; Pérez-Campos et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2011; Arrial and Billen, 2013; Vogt and Gerya, 2014). Herein, we explore the conditions that lead to flat-slab subduction and characterize the resulting surface deformation using a 2D finite-difference marker-in-cell method. We specifically explore how initial model geometry and boundary conditions affect the evolution of the angle at which a slab subducts in the presence/absence of a buoyant oceanic plateau and the resulting surface topography. In our simulations, the surface is tracked through time as an internal erosion/sedimentation surface. The top boundary of the crust is overlaid by a “sticky” (viscous 10^17 Pa.s) water/air layer with correspondingly stratified densities. We apply a coupled surface processes model that solves the sediment transport/diffusion erosion equation at each time step to account for the corresponding crustal mass flux and its effect on crustal deformation. Model results show the initial angle of subduction has a substantial impact on the subduction angle of the slab and hence the evolution of topography. The results also indicate plate velocity and the presence of an oceanic plateau in a forced subduction only have a moderate effect on the angle of subduction.",

The two co-present plasmas were observed for four extended time periods, beginning shortly after the apparent passage of a magnetic cloud with indications of eroding magnetic structure on its sunward side. The observed phase-space distributions are shown to be unstable to several electromagnetic resonances, including the low-beta oblique Alfven II mode, heretofore not directly observed in nature. A spectral analysis of accompanying ion-gyroscale fluctuations in the magnetic field indicates ongoing exchange of energy between the plasma and the magnetized wave field through the local excitation of these modes. We hypothesize that the erosion of the magnetic cloud via reconnection with the trailing high-speed stream is the driver for this unusual observation, and that the de-excitation of beamed ion distributions such as this could be a typical dissipation path for large-scale magnetic reconnection outflows in the interplanetary plasma.",

            "abstract": "We propose a nonlocal multiscale framework that couples grain-scale micro-structural simulations of porous media with a macroscopic continuum-based finite element model at pendular regime. The upshot of this nonlocal coupling model is that it retains the simplicity and efficiency of the continuum-based finite element model, while possessing the original length scale of the microstructure. In particular, the collective mechanical responses of grains at material points are homogenized via a staggered nonlocal operator applied on local regions such that the multiscale simulations exhibit no pathological mesh dependence. Since granular materials may appear to be incompressible at critical state, we employ a one-point quadrature integration rule to relax the solution, while using hourglass control to eliminate the zero-energy modes. Numerical examples are used to analyze the onset and propagation of shear bands in granular materials. Finally, the robustness and accuracy of the proposed multiscale model are verified in comparisons with single-scale benchmark microstructural simulations. The nonlocal multiscale coupling scheme is able to capture the plastic dilatancy and pressure-sensitive frictional responses commonly observed inside dilatant shear bands, and replicate the anisotropy induced by the liquid-bridge and contact fabrics, without employing any phenomenological plasticity model or water-retention curve at macroscopic level.",

            "abstract": "We have analyzed turbine power and concurrent wind speed, direction and turbulence data from surface 10-m flux towers in a large wind farm for experiments during four summer periods as part of the Crop Wind Energy Experiment (CWEX). We use these data to analyze surface differences for a near-wake (within 2.5 D of the turbine line), far wake (17 D downwind of the turbine line), and double wake (impacted by two lines of turbines about 34 D downwind of the first turbine line) locations. Composites are categorized by10 degree directional intervals and three ambient stability categories as defined by Rajewski et al. (2013): neutral (|z/L|<0.05), stable (z/L>0.05) and unstable (z/L<-0.05), where z is the height of the measurement and L is the Monin-Obhukov length.\nThe dominant influence of the turbines is under stably stratified conditions (i. e., mostly at night). A 25% to 40% increase in mean wind speed occurs when turbine wakes are moving over the downwind station at a distance of 2.8 D and 5.4 D (D = fan diameter). For the double wake condition (flux station leeward of two lines of turbines) we find a daytime (unstable conditions) speed reduction of 20% for southerly wind, but for nighttime (stable conditions) the surface speeds are enhancedby 40-60% for SSW-SW winds. The speedup is reduced as wind directions shift to the west. We interpret these speed variations as due to the rotation of the wake and interaction (or not) with higher speed air above the rotor layer in highly sheared nocturnal low-level jet conditions.\nFrom a cluster of flux stations and three profiling lidars deployed within and around a cluster of turbines in 2013 (CWEX-13) we found evidence of mesoscale influences. In particular, surface convergence (wind direction deflection of 10-20 degrees) was observed during periods of low nighttime winds (hub-height winds of 4-6 m/s) with power reduction of 50-75%. This is consistent with a similar range of deflection observed from a line of turbines in CWEX-11, In the mid to late afternoon hours when hub-height wind speeds are between 5-10 m/s convergence periods have been observed, with power enhancements of 20-40% at several locations around the farm.",

Through broadband analysis of P-wave receiver function conversions and topside reflections, we characterize the 410 and 660 seismic discontinuities beneath China (see Shen et al., DI013, this meeting) and simultaneously determine the shear velocity and density jumps, the sharpness of the boundary as well as the gradient immediately above/below the boundary. Within the thermodynamic framework, HeFESTo, we explore these observations with respect to seismic properties predicted in a volatile/melt free mantle, where harzburgite and basalt rock assemblages are either fully equilibrated or mechanically mixed.\nWe find that observed shear velocity (5-6%) and density jumps (1.5-2%) across the 410 are both too low to be consistent with the olivine-wadsleyite phase transition in a pyrolitic mantle; the 410 is sharp (<< 5 km) and it requires Mg-rich harzburgite (Mg# >~ 0.93) in the mantle; the gradient near the 410 is very low, inconsistent with a dry pyrolitic mantle. The observed 660 not only consists of a sharp boundary (<< 5 km) with relatively small shear velocity (3.5-4%) and density jumps (4-4.5%), but it also involves a substantial velocity/density gradient near the boundary (> 0.003 km/s/km; > 0.003 g/cm3/km). These observations coincide very well with the post-spinel and post-garnet phase transitions in a mantle with about 75% harzburgite fully equilibrated with 25% basalt.\nTaking into account of previous mantle triplication analyses and electric conductivity profiles in the region, these results lead us to examine the following hypotheses: The harzburgite assemblage in the mantle transition zone beneath China is probably at least as depleted as Archean cratonic peridotites. Near the 410, the mantle is either relatively dry (e.g., the water content is well below the solubility of olivine) and basalt-enriched (~40%), or extremely wet (e.g., the water content is near or beyond wadsleyite saturation limit) and pyrolitic. While the 660 is consistent with a dry mantle in full equilibrium, we can’t rule out the possibility of a hydrated lower transition zone and uppermost lower mantle that is mechanically mixed.",

Small-scale dynamics have recently been shown to have a strong effect on the RHi of the UT/LS, and therefore on cirrus cloud formation. Until now, there has been insufficient data in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) to investigate these effects. The Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) was a series of campaigns focused on improving our understanding of humidity in the TTL. During this campaign, the NASA Langley/Ames Diode Laser Hygrometer was part of the payload on the NASA Global Hawk, resulting in measurements of humidity with as low as 1-2 m vertical resolution at altitudes up to 19 km. We will present observations from ATTREX describing the small scale spatial variability of water vapor along transects of ISSRs and cirrus clouds, as well as the dynamics driving the formation of ISS regions. These results will be discussed in context with results from prior UT/LS campaigns, such as DC3 and HIPPO.",

            "abstract": "Reservoirs constitute a globally important source of atmospheric methane (CH4). Although it is reasonably well-established that hydrostatic and barometric pressure can influence rates of CH4 release from lake and tidal sediments, the relationship between water-level manipulation and CH4 release from man-made impoundments has not been quantified or characterized. Furthermore, cross-system controls on CH4 production and release to the atmosphere have not been established. We collected CH4 emission (diffusion and ebullition) data for 8 reservoirs in the U.S. Pacific Northwest that are subject to a range of trophic conditions and water level management regimes. Our aim was to: (1) characterize CH4 emissions from these systems, and (2) quantify effects of water level management and eutrophication on CH4 fluxes. Results indicate very high fluxes, in some cases the highest reported reservoir emission rates, and a strong correspondence between lake level reduction and CH4 emissions, including quantitatively important bursts of CH4 bubbling. In one reservoir, drawdown-associated CH4 fluxes accounted for over 25% of annual CH4 emissions in a period of just 16 days (4% of the year). Average CH4 ebullition rates in a reservoir managed for hydropower peaking were nearly three-fold higher than in a paired upstream reservoir managed to maintain a constant water level (528 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 and 187 mg CH4 m-2 d-1 respectively). Highest gas fluxes were observed during the water level drawdown component of the hydropower peaking cycle (14.3 g CH4 m-2 d-1). In addition we observe a strong, positive relationship between eutrophication (as indicated by surface Chl a concentrations) and CH4 production (r2 = 0.88; P<0.001) and between eutrophication and the sensitivity of CH4 emissions to drawdown (r2 = 0.84; P<0.001). This work suggests that manipulation of water levels can significantly affect CH4 emissions from reservoirs to the atmosphere, and that sampling programs that miss drawdown periods may substantially underestimate CH4 fluxes. It also suggests that controlling nutrient loading may reduce greenhouse gas fluxes from surface waters to the atmosphere.",

First, how much methane in total is emitted from the US and Canada? Second, how much methane is emitted from each individual source across these countries? Third, and finally, how have each of these sources changed in magnitude over the past ten to twenty years? To answer these questions, we use a geostatistical model-data fusion framework and spatial data on land use and economic activity. Using this approach, we estimate the contribution of different source types to methane emissions in the US and compare the magnitude of those anthropogenic emissions against natural fluxes from major wetlands like those near Hudson Bay, Canada. Furthermore, we examine the time-evolution of methane concentrations over regions dominated by agriculture and natural gas extraction and investigate what this data indicates about changes in emissions over time.",

This characteristic of regional climate change presents challenges both in the communication of climate change uncertainty and in the need for large initial-condition ensembles that accurately simulate observed natural variability across a range of timescales. In this study we use the new 30-member Community Earth System (CESM) Large Ensemble experiment for the period of 1920-2080 to explore the role of internal variability on probabilistic regional climate change on interdecadal timescales. Focusing on surface air temperature and precipitation, we present a means of expressing and visualizing probabilistic climate change projections as probabilities of threshold trend exceedance that vary with the trend length. We then evaluate the reliability of the CESM Large Ensemble for probabilistic climate change projections over the period of the observational record, which reflects the model’s adequacy in simulating both the forced changes and internal variability. Finally, we compare the results of the CESM Large ensemble with that of a multi-model ensemble from the CMIP5 archive to highlight the roles of model and scenario uncertainty across a range of timescales.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the tropics, high mountain regions have a “buzzcut” appearance, with low-relief spines perched high (>2500m) above deeply incised ridge-and-valley topography. Many of these mountain ranges intersect the local LGM ELA, but few studies have speculated on the role glacial erosion may have played in shaping their perched, low-relief landforms. Instead, multiple studies have invoked an abrupt increase tectonic uplift that switched the orogen from a low-relief, low erosion rate regime to a high-relief, high erosion rate mode. In this model context, perched landscapes are fossil remnants of the low-erosion rate regime, and the presence of glacial/paraglacial landforms is coincidental. However, an alternative interpretation is possible: rather than a tectonically-forced switch in erosion rate regime, low-relief spines were cut by alpine glacial erosion.\nTo assess the influence of glacial/paraglacial processes on the formation of low-relief topography in a tropical mountain range, we conducted fieldwork at Mount Chirripó (3819m), Costa Rica. At Mount Chirripó, the estimated LGM ELA is ~3500m. River profile analysis shows a conspicuous cluster of knickpoints at ~2500m, which has been used to infer a rapid increase in regional tectonic uplift between 1-2 Ma that produced high-relief landscapes fringing ancient, low-relief landscapes. As an alternative, we hypothesize that glacial/postglacial processes acting throughout the Pleistocene played a dominant role in the formation and preservation of Mount Chirripó’s low-relief spine.\nAt Mount Chirripó, we identified glacial erosion features between 3400-3800m, including moraines, striated bedrock, glacial till, glaciofluvial outwash and post-glacial landslides. Additionally, we observed a low-sloping valley floored by angular debris at ~3100m that we interpret to be of glacial origin. We collected samples for surface exposure age dating from erratics, striated bedrock, and landslide debris boulders. Mapping of glacial features, topographic analysis, and surface exposure age dating will inform us of the timing, duration, and spatial extent of glacial/paraglacial erosion above 2500m at Mount Chirripó.",

            "abstract": "The removal of aerosol sized particles by dry forested canopies continues to receive considerable research interest owing to a number of bio-ecological and industrial applications. This removal is generically represented in large-scale meteorological models by a dry deposition velocity Vd defined as the total flux F normalized by the mean concentration C and assumed to vary with the friction velocity. This variation is based on uniform turbulent boundary layers where the vegetation are treated as rough elements and deposition on elements is assumed to occur through a laminar region pinned to the elements. Spatial heterogeneity in the canopy such as the presence of edges and gaps complicates the usage of such representation. Moreover, most forested ecosystems are situated on complex topography further altering the spatial deposition patterns from its flat-terrain counterpart. These problems pose challenges to forecasting dry deposition in climate and large-scale air pollution models. A numerical scheme using a first order turbulent closure model has been formulated to capture the bulk flow patterns within and above vegetation canopies covering complex terrain with a marked heterogeneity such as edges and gaps. Subsequently the deposition pattern of the aerosol sized particles has been studied in terms of spatial patterns of C, Vd and the vertical scalar flux Fc using a turbulent scalar budget. The biases generated in C, Vd and Fc have been discussed relative to both their flat uniformly vegetated terrain (e.g. see fig for coarse mode) and fully vegetation-covered hill counterparts. The effects of different particle sizes are also explored. The biases induced in C, Vd and Fc and consequent variations in deposition patterns due to different modes of deposition such as Nucleation mode (1 to 10 nm), Aitken-mode (10 to 100 nm), Accumulation-mode (100 nm and 1000 nm) and Coarse-mode (1 to 10 micro-m) are subsequently discussed.",

            "abstract": "Hot springs in the Death Valley Region of California lie along the Amargosa River with distinct centers in Saratoga, Tecopa, Shoshone, and Beatty. A geophysical investigation of the hot springs in Tecopa and Saratoga led Wamalwa and other (2011) to hypothesize that deep faults must intersect with a specific orientation relative to the regional stress field in order to support hot springs along the Amargosa River. The inferred that one set of faults parallels the Amargosa River and trends northerly and the other set trends WNW to create an opening in the NW-SE oriented extensional stress field of the region. This research tests that hypothesis in the vicinity of Shoshone using magnetic and gravity data. Three isolated basalt mounds were identified in the area of the Shoshone hot springs. Two of these mounds are characterized by low magnetic and low Bouguer gravity anomalies. The third mound has high Bouguer gravity and high magnetic anomaly. This observation suggests that the basalt mounds were formed at different times and/or from different eruptive sequences. The alignment of the mounds and geophysical trends observed in the data support the earlier hypothesis and suggest there is a pair of faults trending north and west-northwest, respectively, in the area of the Shoshone hot springs. No other hot springs were located in the area but similar intersecting faults with the appropriate orientations were indicated by the geophysical data. We infer that either the basin sediments are sufficiently thick to prevent the springs from flowing to the surface or that the faults are not deep enough to tap the hot water that would produce a hot spring.",

In order to assess the unknown properties of such reservoirs, scientific drilling is used when Earth surface sampled rocks cannot sufficiently explain past geological processes and when geophysical imaging does not sufficiently explain observed phenomena. However, our understanding of structural and dynamic characteristics of geothermal systems can be improved through application of advanced and/or innovative exploration technologies. Unlike resistivity imaging, active and passive seismic techniques have rarely been used in volcanic geothermal areas, because processing techniques were not adapted to geothermal conditions. Recent advances in volcano-seismology have introduced new processing techniques for assessing subsurface structures and controls on fluid flow in geothermal systems. We present here preliminary analyses of seismic records around a geothermal reservoir located both on-land and offshore along the Reykjanes Ridge, SW-Iceland. We deployed on-land stations (20 broad-band and 10 short-period seismometers) and 24 Ocean Bottom Seismometers which are recording since April 2014. Together with existing permanent stations, the complete network comprises 66 stations. The network was designed so that several processing techniques can be used with the data set and address scientific questions concerning geothermal systems and the oceanic ridge. We present the network deployment, our approach and preliminary results from the first months.",

            "abstract": "Two approaches have been used traditionally to screen infrastructure investments in multi-reservoir systems: scenario analysis of a few simulated designs and deterministic optimization, sometimes using hydro-economic models or screening optimization models. Simulation models realistically represent proposed water systems and can easily include multiple performance metrics; however each prospective system operating rules need to be formulated and simulated for each proposed design (time consuming. Optimization models have been used to overcome this burden. Screening optimization models use integer or non-linear programming and can be challenging to apply to large and/or multi-objective systems. Hydro-economic models that use deterministic (implicit stochastic) optimization must be modified to examine each different plan and they cannot always reproduce realistic or politically acceptable system operations.\nIn this presentation we demonstrate the application of a new screening approach to multi-reservoir systems where operating rules and new assets (dams) are simultaneously optimized in a multi-criteria context. Results are not least cost investment plans that satisfy reliability or other engineering constraints, but rather Pareto-optimal sets of asset portfolios that work well under historical and/or future scenarios. This is achieved by using stakeholder-built simulation models linked to multi-criteria search algorithms (e.g. many objective evolutionary algorithms, MOEA). Typical output is demonstrated through two case-studies on the Tana and Blue Nile rivers where operating rules and reservoir assets are efficiently screened together considering stakeholder-defined metrics. The focus on the Tana system is how reservoir operating rules and new irrigation schemes should be co-managed to limit ecological damages. On the Nile system, we identify Blue Nile river reservoir capacities that least negatively impact downstream Nile nations. Limitations and new directions of research in the application of search-based system planning approaches are surveyed. Current limitations include the need to integrate investment scheduling (in addition to suggesting optimal asset bundles) and adaptive planning requirements real stakeholders have into the planning problem formulation.",

We find that uplift rates above the horizontal injector wells are strongly correlated with rates of steam injection, even though there is a net fluid loss from the reservoir pore space as oil and water are withdrawn through the production wells. In combination with available steam injection and bitumen production data at four sites, we use numerical reservoir flow models to explain how the thermal and geomechanical effects of steam injection on an oil sand reservoir can generate uplift at the surface. Results of our numerical experiments show that persistent surface heave consistent with observed rates can be driven by stress changes in the reservoir due to porous flow and thermal expansion.",

We show that the local Fourier space ratios of nonlinear-to-linear accelerations can show significant departures from what is expected from the general global measure. We find that high cross helicity systems that are traditionally believed to be weakly nonlinear can show strong nonlinearities in parts of the Fourier space. These nonlinearities can exceed in strength the level of nonlinearities recovered from low cross helicity systems. If these Fourier space regions are energetically significant then nonlinear effects can govern parts of the spectrum while the other parts remain subject to linear effects.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific-North America plate boundary in Southern California extends far west of the coastline, and a 12-month ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) array spanned the western side of the plate boundary in order to image seismic velocities in the lithosphere. Velocities are modeled through stacked cross correlations of ambient noise data. The offshore data come primarily from the OBS array that collected 12 months of continuous data during 2010-2011, combined with Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) station data. The cross correlations were stacked for noise correlation functions and examined using standard time- and frequency-domain methods to determine phase velocity and group velocity dispersion curves. Signals between the vertical-component OBS and co-located horizontal-component OBS observations associated with tilt noise, and pressure gauge observations associated with infragravity waves, were examined to further improve signals. The non-elastic noise was estimated by calculating the transfer functions between the vertical-to-horizontal and vertical-to-pressure components, and subtracting the coherent signal between the two from the vertical-component time series. We find that these effects are small in our dataset. We are simultaneously inverting all measureable dispersion curves to solve for 3D crustal velocity structure. Shear-wave velocities comprise the direct solution, and Vp/Vs ratios are constrained as much as the data allow. Calculations on data from 780 OBS-OBS, SCSN-SCSN, and OBS-SCSN pairs filtered around multiple narrow bands between 5 and 50 s show clear propagating waves traveling at group velocities between 1.2 and 3.5 km/s. The longer-term outcome of this work will comprise a 3D crustal and uppermost mantle velocity model with areal coverage not attainable before the deployment of the ocean bottom seismometers. The results define the transition in three dimensions from continental lithospheric structure in the near-shore region to oceanic structure west of the continental borderland, and will provide new constraints for determination of earthquake relocations and rupture styles, and in particular the degree to which offshore faults produce dip-slip rupture.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic areas present a lower effective viscosity than usually in the Earth's crust. Both the elastic-gravitational and the viscoelastic-gravitational models allow the computation of gravity, deformation, and gravitational potential changes in order to investigate crustal deformations of Earth (see for instance Battaglia & Segall, 2004; Fernández et al. 1999, 2001; Rundle 1980 and 1983). These models can be represented by a coupled system of linear parabolic (for the elastic deformations), hyperbolic (for the viscoelastic deformations) and elliptic partial differential equations (for gravitational potential changes) (see for instance Arjona et al. 2008 and 2010). The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for both the elastic-gravitational and viscoelastic-gravitational problem was demonstrated in Arjona et al. (2008 and 2014). The stabilization to solutions of the associated stationary system was proved in Arjona and Díaz (2007). Here we consider the internal source as response to the effect of a pressurized magma reservoir into a multilayered, elastic-gravitational and viscoelastic-gravitational earth model. We introduce the numerical analysis of a simplified steady elastic-gravitational model, solved by means of the finite element method. We also present some numerical tests in realistic situations that confirm the predictions of theoretical order of convergence. Finally, we describe the methodology for both the elastic-gravitational and the viscoelastic-gravitational models using 2D and 3D test examples performed with FreeFEM++.",

            "abstract": "H-k stacking method [Zhu and Kanamori, 2000] is a widely used grid search technique for estimating the Moho depth (H) and Vp/Vs (k) beneath a given station. The H-k surface reaches a maximum when the optimum H and k values are used, which is assumed to be the average crustal structure beneath the seismic station. In general, the method is employed in conjunction with P-wave receiver functions. Here, we investigate the usability of H-k stacking method with S-to-P (Sp) conversions and S-wave reverberations within the crust, employing an extended multi-taper deconvolution. We apply the method to southern California, using data recorded between 1990-2011. We compare results with those of prior studies that used P-to-S (Ps) conversions [Zhu and Kanamori, 2000; Yan and Clayton, 2007], applying a smoothing length of 0.5 degrees to reflect lateral Sp sensitivity.\nP-waves have better potential to resolve lateral variations in Moho depth owing to the higher frequency content and the geometry of Ps ray path. Our results from Sp conversions are in broad agreement with those from Ps, affirming that S-wave receiver functions can be used in conjunction with the H-k stacking method. Consistent with the P-wave receiver function results, crust is thinner beneath the central Transverse Range (30 km) with respect to eastern Transverse Range (33 km) and Peninsular Region (35 km). Our Moho depth observations (35 km) are more compatible with those of Yan and Clayton [2007] (~35 km) than Zhu and Kanamori [2000] (~30 km) beneath Sierra Nevada, most probably due to a larger data set this study and Yan and Clayton [2007] use. Also, results from this study are deeper than those from Ps for the Salton Trough (30-35 km vs. 25 km). In this case, broad receiver function waveform characteristics suggest a more gradual impedance change across the Moho discontinuity and/or a multi-layered crust. We suggest that a combination of P- and S-wave receiver functions can yield more robust crustal thickness estimates, providing additional constraints in areas where data coverage is not sufficient, Ps results become complicated due to multiple crustal layers, or velocity gradients are gradual.",

            "abstract": "Developments in the last year, including the President's new plan for reducing CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, and the recent launch of OCO-2, provide more urgent incentive to develop reliable methods for determination of greenhouse gas emissions from urban environments. It is clear that the requirements for measurable, reportable, and verifiable emission rates for point sources and area sources, including individual urban environments, challenge the capabilities of the scientific community. The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) was established in 2010 as a multi-institution collaborative effort aimed at development of new tools for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from fine (~1km2) scale to urban area-wide scales, with accuracy and precision ideally approaching 10%. In the past year, INFLUX has seen a number of new developments and achievements. Among these are: expansion of the bottom-up emissions data product (Hestia) to include a wider domain and more contemporary years (up to 2012); new experiments to assess precision in the aircraft mass balance measurement for both CO2 and CH4; improved source apportionment for CH4 emission sources around the city, including quantitative measurements for several point sources; continued data acquisition for CO, CO2, CH4, and 14CO2 at 12 towers around the city; inverse modeling determinations of spatially resolved CO2 and CH4 fluxes relying in part on the updated Hestia emissions priors. We developed an improved understanding of the role of the biosphere in the urban CO2 measurements, observations of the \"urban dome\" column concentrations from a TCCON, and improved understanding of the temporal scale boundary layer dynamics from radiosonde launches, aircraft vertical profiles, and Doppler LIDAR measurements of winds and boundary layer heights. The INFLUX efforts are producing a relatively well-understood urban environment, which should provide a useful reference point for OCO-2 and other satellite-based determinations of greenhouse gas emission rates and trends in those rates. Here we will summarize the state of the INFLUX project and its achievements, and lay out some of the challenges to be tackled in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "The advent of hyperspectral infrared instruments orbiting the Earth has allowed for detecting and measuring numerous trace gas species that play important roles in atmospheric chemistry and impact air quality, but for which there is a dearth of information on their distribution and temporal variability. Here we will present global and regional comparisons of measurements from the NASA TES and the European MetOp IASI instruments of three of these gases: ammonia (NH3), formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH). Ammonia is highly reactive and thus very variable in space and time, while the sources and sinks of methanol and formic acid are poorly quantified: thus space-based measurements have the potential of significantly increasing our knowledge of the emissions and distributions of these gases.\nIASI and TES have many similarities but some significant differences. TES has significantly higher spectral resolution (0.06 cm-1), and its equator crossing times are ~1:30 am and 1:30 pm, local time, while IASI has lower resolution (0.5 cm-1) and an earlier equator crossing time (9:30 am and 9:30 pm), which leads to lower thermal contrast; however IASI provides much greater temporal and spatial coverage due to its cross-track scanning. Added to the instrumental differences are the differences in retrieval algorithms. The IASI team uses simple but efficient methods to estimate total column amounts of the species above, while the TES team performs full optimal estimation retrievals.\nWe will compare IASI and TES total column measurements averaged on a 2.5x2.5 degree global grid for each month in 2009, and we will examine the seasonal cycle in some regions of interest, such as South America, eastern China, and the Midwest and the Central Valley in the US. In regions where both datasets are in agreement this analysis will provide confidence that the results are robust and reliable. In regions where there is disagreement we will look for the causes of the discrepancies, which will lead to better algorithms, most immediately for the NPP CrIS instrument, which combines the coverage of IASI with the equator crossing time of TES.",

The absolute TEC perturbations maximize at ~1400-1800 LT with amplitude of ~9 (~7) TECU in the southern (northern) hemisphere, which account for ~16% (~10%) of the background TEC. Larger relative TEC perturbations of ~20% are found at 0200-0400 LT.

            "abstract": "Our new results from teleseismic, finite-frequency, body-wave tomography analysis reveal a relatively steep east-dipping fast velocity anomaly beneath the Southeastern US. The resolving power of our dataset is good enough to retrieve major mantle anomalies, such as this fast velocity body, owing to the dense receiver coverage provided by US Transportable Array (TA) and the SouthEastern Suture of the Appalachian Margin Experiment (SESAME). Various resolution and recovery tests demonstrate the robustness of this anomaly in our tomographic model between the depths of 60 and 660 km. Our images reveal that the dip of this structure decreases significantly in the mantle transition zone where it terminates. We also observe major gaps in the lateral continuity of this structure.\nBased on the amplitude, location and geometry of the velocity perturbation, we interpret this anomaly as remnant subducted lithosphere, suspended in the upper mantle after a subduction phase as young as 100-110 Ma or as old as 1Ga. Basic calculations and evaluations on the geometry and location of this anomaly help us to narrow down the origin of this slab to the Farallon flat-slab subduction in the west and Grenville Subduction during assembly of supercontinent Rodinia. Our images reveal possible mechanisms that would allow this slab to remain in the upper mantle without sinking into deeper mantle for such extended periods of time. We believe the flat geometry of the slab near the transition zone and the fragmented nature provide important clues about processes that could delay/resist the sinking while providing necessary time for it to transform into a more neutrally buoyant state. In this respect, we believe our results have broad implications for subduction processes and piece-meal slab failure, as well as tectonic implications for characteristics of former subduction zones that help shape North American Plate.",

            "abstract": "The built environment often changes quickly in response to human activities, thus contributing to an evolution of stream chemistry over time. Depending upon development and management strategies, these changes can result in pulses and/or long-term trends. Here, we explore patterns of evolving salinization of fresh water over time, and we evaluate the potential water quality implications of fresh water salinization. We show that there has been global salinization of freshwater across urbanizing landscapes over a century. We also show that human-accelerated weathering in watersheds and river alkalinization can further influence regional rates of salinization (in addition to anthropogenic sources such as road salts, sewage leaks, etc.). Finally, we investigate how salinization of fresh water can impact stream sediment fluxes of carbon, nutrients, and sulfate in watersheds across a land use gradient at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site. The impacts of salinization on mobilization and uptake of carbon, nutrients, and sulfate in streams warrant further consideration in water quality management strategies. Overall, we propose that salinization can be a \"universal tracer\" of watershed urbanization globally with major regional consequences for drinking water and evolution of biogeochemical cycles in freshwater ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol plays an integrated role in the Earth’s weather and climate system. It alters the atmospheric heating profiles through absorbing and/or scattering solar radiation that leads to changes in temperature, wind, and humidity. It also serves as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei to modify cloud properties and precipitation. The aerosol-induced changes in local/regional weather pattern and planetary boundary layer structure would subsequently impact atmospheric composition and air quality. Before the advent of the fully coupled air quality models, the feedbacks among aerosol, cloud, and radiation (ACR) are often ignored, and the impact of such feedbacks on air quality is less understood.\nThe principle purpose of this work is to assess the impact of ACR interactions on U.S. regional air quality, focusing on ozone and PM2.5, using the NASA Unified WRF (NU-WRF) modeling system. NU-WRF builds on the community WRF model with integrations of several NASA components. Specifically it couples with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model to account for ACR effects explicitly. A series of three month long simulations spanning from spring to early summer, a season laden with both local and long-range transported aerosols, have been carried out to explore the effect of ACR interactions on U.S. air quality, in which the factor separation method has been applied in order to isolate the contribution from aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud effect.",

            "abstract": "The effect of nitrogen cycling on release of carbon from tundra ecosystems is being studied as part of the US Department of Energy Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment – Arctic project. Sampling and analysis of active layer soil water at the Barrow Environmental Observatory (Alaska, USA) was performed in ancient drained thaw lake basins (DTLBs), drainages, and in polygonal terrain associated with inter-DTLB tundra. Within active layer soils, nitrate was most commonly found above analytical limits of detection in pore water from the unsaturated centers of high-centered polygons. Nitrate has also been detected, though less frequently, in soil water immediately above the frost table of an ancient (14C age of 2000 – 5500 BP) DTLB and in a small drainage adjacent to high-centered polygonal terrain.\nNitrate from high-centered polygons had δ15N ranging from -9.2 to +8.5 ‰ and δ18O ranging from -8.4 to +1.4 ‰. The δ15N isotopic range is consistent with microbial mineralization and nitrification of reduced nitrogen sources including ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen, and soil organic nitrogen. The range in δ18O of nitrate is also consistent with nitrification based on the δ18O of site waters. No evidence for an atmospheric nitrate signal, as defined by δ15N and δ18O of nitrate in snow and snowmelt, is seen.\nIn contrast, nitrate in permafrost appears to be a mixture of pre-industrial atmospheric nitrate (with higher δ15N than modern atmospheric nitrate) and nitrate that is microbial in origin. Massive ice wedges appear to contain larger proportions of snowmelt (based on δ18O of ice) and atmospheric nitrate, whereas textural ice appears to contain a greater proportion of summer precipitation and microbially-derived nitrate. Nitrate from the ancient DTLB and drainage samples also has isotopic signatures that appear to represent a mixture of pre-industrial atmospheric nitrate and nitrate from microbial nitrification, and may, at least in part, be derived from degraded permafrost.",

In this letter, we propose that the electron halo is produced by the kinetic-scale turbulence driven by the nanoflare-accelerated keV electrons in the inner solar corona. The solar wind advects the core-halo feature of EVDFs and kinetic fluctuations from the corona into interplanetary plasma through open field lines. Based on the heating mechanism proposed, we find the location of the velocity ``break\" discerning the core and halo is at three times of the thermal velocity of core; the ratio of halo-core temperature is about 6; and a relic relative drift that is comparable to the core thermal velocity exists between the core and the halo, a signature of two stream instability. These predictions are consistent with existing observations of solar wind EVDFs.",

            "abstract": "The use of multi-constellation GNSS receivers has been assumed as a way to increase system integrity both by increased coverage during normal operations and failover redundancy in the event of a constellation failure. At approximately 21:00 UTC on April 1st the entire GLONASS constellation was disrupted as illegal ephemeris uploaded to each satellite took effect simultaneously. The outage continued for more than 10 hours.\nWhile ephemeris were incorrect, pseudoranges were correctly broadcast on both L1 and L2 and carrier phases were not affected; in the best case, GNSS receivers could be expected to continue to track all signals including GLONASS and at the worst to continue to track GPS and other constellations.\nIt became clear to operators of the GeoNet network in New Zealand that the majority of their 79 GLONASS-enabled receivers experienced total tracking failures. Further detailed analysis of data from these and 315 additional GLONASS-enabled stations worldwide showed that receiver tracking behavior was affected for most receiver brands and models, both for GLONASS and GPS.\nFindings regarding the impacts of the GLONASS outage on receiver behavior will be highlighted. We use data recorded by GLONASS enabled global sites for the days during, preceding and following the outage to evaluate the impact of the outage on tracking and positioning performance. We observe that for some receiver types the onboard receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) failed to ignore the incorrect messages, resulting in degraded GLONASS and GPS tracking and in some cases complete tracking failures and significant data loss. In addition, many of the receivers with clock steering enabled showed outliers in their receiver clock bias estimates that also coincided with the outage. Our results show in detail how different brands, configurations, and distributions of receivers were affected to varying extents, but no common factors are apparent.\nThis event shows that many manufacturers' current receiver technology was not yet ready for all failure scenarios and that tracking multiple constellations hindered rather than helped during this outage. Network operators should reevaluate their system configuration and GNSS upgrade strategies while receiver manufacturers work to ensure that systems behave properly in the future.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, planar optodes have demonstrated to be a useful non-invasive tool to monitor real time oxygen concentrations in a wide range of applications. However, only limited investigations have been carried out to explore the use of optodes in plant respiration studies. In particular, their use to study plant-pathogen interactions has been not deeply investigated. Here, we present for the first time an in vitro experimental setup capable to depict the dynamical effects of the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Fol) on tomato roots by the use of a recently developed optical non-invasive optode oxygen sensor (Visisens, Presens, Germany). Fol is a soil-borne pathogen and the causal agent of wilt in tomato plants, a destructive worldwide disease. The interaction Fol-tomato is widely accepted as a model system in plant pathology. In this work, oxygen concentrations are monitored continuously in time and considered a proxy for root respiration and metabolic activity. The experimental procedure reveals three different dynamic stages: 1) a uniform oxygen consumption in tomato roots earlier before pathogen colonization, 2) a progressive decrease in the oxygen concentration indicating a high metabolic activity as soon as the roots were surrounded and colonized by the fungal mycelium, and 3) absence of root respiration, as a consequence of root death. Our results suggest the ability of the fungal mycelium to move preferentially towards and along the root as a consequence of the recognition event.",

The Mattole River does not follow the classic river “concave-up” profile. Instead, the river headwaters have low gradients with broad strath terraces and deeply incised channels. In fact, it could be stated that the river has a “convex-up” profile with a low gradient headwater leading to a higher gradient midcourse. Strath terrace formation in the upper headwater region of the Mattole River records times of disequilibrium of channel profile and bedrock incision. In order to investigate the distribution and relative ages of strath terraces, a detailed survey of the terrace surface and bedrock strath position was conducted along several headwater tributaries. Additionally, hand borings were excavated across the terraces to bedrock to provide a three dimensional image of terrace thickness. Terrace morphology and stratigraphy provide information on terrace forming mechanisms and timing. This study includes high-resolution geomorphic data regarding the relation of Mattole headwater terraces to the MTJ, as well as provides more temporal information about the relation between a fluvial system’s response to the ongoing northward migration of the MTJ.",

We built our catalogue of 393 events starting from the CSN catalogue, which has a completeness of magnitude Mw > 3.0 in Northern Chile. We re-located and computed moment magnitude for each event. We also computed Early Warning (EW) parameters - Pd, Pv, τc and IV2 - for each event including 13 earthquakes of Mw>6.0 that occurred between 2007-2012. We also included part of the seismicity from March-April 2014 period. We find that Pd, Pv and IV2 are good estimators of magnitude for interplate thrust and intraplate intermediate depth events with Mw between 4.0 and 6.0. However, the larger magnitude events show a saturation of the EW parameters.\nThe Tocopilla 2007 and Iquique 2014 earthquake sequences were studied in detail. Almost all events with Mw>6.0 present precursory signals so that the largest amplitudes occur several seconds after the first P wave arrival. The recent Mw 8.1 Iquique 2014 earthquake was preceded by low amplitude P waves for 20 s before the main asperity was broken. The magnitude estimation can improve if we consider longer P wave windows in the estimation of EW parameters. There was, however, a practical limit during the Iquique earthquake because the first S waves arrived before the arrival of the P waves from the main rupture. The 4 s P-wave Pd parameter estimated Mw 7.1 for the Mw 8.1 Iquique 2014 earthquake and Mw 7.5 for the Mw 7.8 Tocopilla 2007 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Salt-gradient solar ponds are artificial thermohaline environments that collect and store thermal energy for long time-periods. A solar pond consists of three distinctive zones: the upper convective zone, which is a thin layer of cooler, less salty water; the non-convective zone that has gradients in temperature and salinity; and the lower convective zone, a layer of high salinity brine where temperatures are the highest. The solar radiation that penetrates the upper layers of the pond reaches the lower convective zone and heats the high salinity brine, which does not rise beyond the lower convective zone because the effect of salinity on density is greater than the effect of temperature. The sediments beneath the pond are also heated due to the temperature increase in the lower convective zone, providing an additional volume for energy storage. To study the different physical processes occurring within a solar pond and its surroundings, we deployed a helicoidally wrapped distributed-temperature-sensing (DTS) system in a small-scale solar pond (1-m deep, 2.5-m long and 1.5-m width). In this installation, the pond is surrounded by a sandy soil that serves as an additional energy storage volume. The thermal profile is observed at a spatial sampling resolution of 1.1 cm (spatial resolution of 2.2. cm), a temporal resolution ranging from 15 s to 5 min, and a thermal resolution ranging from 0.05 to 0.5°C. These resolutions allow closing the energy balance and inferring physical processes such as double-diffusive convection, solar radiation absorption, and heat conduction through the sediments or through the non-convective zone. Independent thermal measurements are also being made to evaluate strengths and limitations of DTS systems in thermohaline environments, and to assess different calibration algorithms that have been proposed in the past.",

In winter and early spring, instabilities of this slope current are intense and can generate eddies, meanders and filaments. The study of mesoscale structures is crucial in the coastal area because of their physical and biogeochemical impact on ecosystems. They play a role in water, chemicals and nutrients transport, vertical mixing and possible trapping of biological materials.\nResults from a combined observational effort put forth in March 2012 during the IMEDIA cruise dedicated to eddy tracking are presented. This work aims at providing experimental evidence of the effects that mesoscale exerts on the NC dynamics via an innovative and complementary data set. A Slocum Glider equipped with a CTD was deployed along the French coast from Nice to Toulon for one month and performed cross-current sections down to 600m depth. Drifters were deployed before the cruise in the Corsica Channel and close to Italy. Concurrent observations were obtained along the vessel track by a thermosalinograph and a fluorometer (subsurface measurements), and using a CTD and a Vessel-Mounted ADCP during the 11-day oceanographic cruise on board of the Research Vessel Tethys II. Additional water profiling was performed using a Moving Vessel Profiler (MVP) equipped with a CTD and capable of profiling down to 400m depth at a speed of 4 knots.\nThe combined use of data from the MVP and the ship-based ADCP measurements reveals the presence of an instability of the NC north of the Corsica Island. The main branch of the current is moved westward and forms a meander. It is characterized by a density decrease down to 350m of the water column, associated with a salinity decrease of 0.4-0.6 psu (see Figure).

            "abstract": "We examined whether people living under significant temperature anomalies connect their sensory experiences to climate change and the role that media plays in this process. We used Twitter messages containing words “climate change” and “global warming” as the indicator of attention that public pays to the issue. Specifically, the goals were: (1) to investigate whether people immediately notice significant local weather anomalies and connect them to climate change and (2) to examine the role of mass media in this process. Over 2 million tweets were collected for a two-year period (2012 – 2013) and were assigned to 157 urban areas in the continental USA (Figure 1). Geographical locations of the tweets were identified with a geolocation resolving algorithm based the profile of the users. Daily number of tweets (tweeting rate) was computed for 157 conterminous USA urban areas and adjusted for data acquisition errors. The USHCN daily minimum and maximum temperatures were obtained for the station locations closest to the centers of the urban areas and the 1981-2010 30-year temperature mean and standard deviation were used as the climate normals. For the analysis, we computed the following indices for each day of 2012 – 2013 period: standardized temperature anomaly, absolute standardized temperature anomaly, and extreme cold and hot temperature anomalies for each urban zone. The extreme cold and hot temperature anomalies were then transformed into country-level values that represent the number of people living in extreme temperature conditions.\nThe rate of tweeting on climate change was regressed on the time variables, number of climate change publications in the mass media, and temperature. In the majority of regression models, the mass media and temperature variables were significant at the p<0.001 level. Additionally, we did not find convincing evidence that the media acts as a mediator in the relationship between local weather and climate change discourse intensity. Our analysis of Twitter data confirmed that the public is able to recognize extreme temperature anomalies and connects these anomalies to climate change. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of social network data for research on public climate change perception.",

            "abstract": "The Southeast (SE) Pacific has experienced a marked cooling since the late 70's, as detected in stations along the west coast of South America and satellite derived SST observations. The observed cooling further extends into the tropical Pacific where it has been mostly interpreted as natural variability and related to the negative phase of the PDO. While the CMIP-5 historical simulations in general fail to detect the cooling over the Pacific during the last few decades, the multi-model trend does shows a minimum warming over the SE Pacific and a few models do show a cooling there, suggesting that some of this trend can be a interpreted as a forced response to increase greenhouse gas concentrations.\nConsidering the CMIP5 historical runs and reanalysis data we show that the cooling trend over the SE Pacific is related with the enhanced anticyclonic circulation in this region but exhibits no correlation with the trends of the trade winds. The reinforced SE Pacific anticyclone -seen both in the reanalysis and models- drives stronger low-level southeasterly winds which can cool the ocean surface through enhanced latent heat flux (evaporation), particularly over the extremely dry SE Pacific.\nWe finally show that the increase in sea-level-pressure over the southern fringe of the SE Pacific can be associated with the expansion of the Hadley Cell, a trend that has been observed and projected to continue in the future in concert with the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations. Therefore, the resulting cooling over a vast region of the SE Pacific can in turn act as a negative dynamical feedback on global warming. Indeed, the regional anomaly cooling off the west coast of South America appears as a robust feature in future climate prediction that also scale with the greenhouse gas concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Due to recent large tsunami events (e.g., Chile 2010 and Japan 2011), the insurance industry is very aware of the importance of managing its exposure to tsunami risk. There are currently few tools available to help establish policies for managing and pricing tsunami risk globally. As a starting point and to help address this issue, Risk Management Solutions Inc. (RMS) is developing a global suite of tsunami inundation footprints. This dataset will include both representations of historical events as well as a series of M9 scenarios on subductions zones that have not historical generated mega earthquakes. The latter set is included to address concerns about the completeness of the historical record for mega earthquakes. This concern stems from the fact that the Tohoku Japan earthquake was considerably larger than had been observed in the historical record.\nCharacterizing the source and rupture pattern for the subduction zones without historical events is a poorly constrained process. In many case, the subduction zones can be segmented based on changes in the characteristics of the subducting slab or major ridge systems. For this project, the unit sources from the NOAA propagation database are utilized to leverage the basin wide modeling included in this dataset. The length of the rupture is characterized based on subduction zone segmentation and the slip per unit source can be determined based on the event magnitude (i.e., M9) and moment balancing. As these events have not occurred historically, there is little to constrain the slip distribution. Sensitivity tests on the potential rupture pattern have been undertaken comparing uniform slip to higher shallow slip and tapered slip models. Subduction zones examined include the Makran Trench, the Lesser Antilles and the Hikurangi Trench. The ultimate goal is to create a series of tsunami footprints to help insurers understand their exposures at risk to tsunami inundation around the world.",

            "abstract": "This talk discusses the future utilization of two-look polarimetric (2LP) microwave radiometers for measuring the ocean surface wind vector. Potentially, these 2LP satellite radiometers offer two advantages over conventional scatterometers: unambiguous wind vector retrievals and low-cost. One concept for a 2LP radiometer is being developed by JPL and is called the Compact Ocean Wind Vector Radiometer (COWVR). A space demonstration of COWVR is planned for 2016 timeframe.\nTo explore the potential of 2LP radiometers, we use the 11 years of WindSat observations as a testbed. We only use that portion of the WindSat swath that has both fore and aft observations. WindSat provides fully polarimetric observations (all four Stokes parameters) at 11, 19, and 37 GHz. This represents 12 independent channels for each of the two azimuth directions. A wind vector retrieval algorithm is developed to fully utilize this wide assortment of information. Since this analysis is based on actual observations, it provides a realistic picture of what to expect from future 2LP radiometers. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the combination of WindSat’s fore and aft observations has been fully utilized for wind vector retrievals.\n In our talk we compare the 2LP wind vector retrieval performance with that of single-look polarimetric radiometers (i.e., WindSat standard product) and scatterometers. We provide basic statistics from a triple collocation between winds from WindSat, QuikScat, and NDBC/PMEL ocean moored buoys. The statistics include the standard deviation of the first ranked ambiguity direction, skill rate, and number of ambiguities. All available data from the common period of operation between WindSat and QuikScat (2003-2009) are used. We characterize the wind direction accuracy as a function of wind speed, and show how 2LP retrievals are able to extend the wind vector accuracy to lower wind speeds than previously considered possible for radiometers.",

            "abstract": "The Eastern Sardinian margin formed during the opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea, a back-arc basin created by continental rifting and oceanic spreading related to the eastward migrating Apennine subduction system from middle Miocene to Pliocene times. We carried out the “METYSS” project aiming at better understanding the Miocene-Pliocene relationships between crustal tectonics and salt tectonics in this key-area, where rifting is pro parte coeval with the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC, 5.96-5.33 Ma) and Messinian salt décollement creates thin-skinned tectonics. Thereby, we use the MSC seismic markers and the deformation of viscous salt and its brittle overburden as proxies to better delineate the timing of rifting and post-rift reactivation, and especially to quantifying vertical and horizontal movements. Our mapping of the Messinian Erosion Surface and of Messinian Upper and Mobile Units shows that a rifted basin already existed by the Messinian times, revealing a major pre-MSC rifting episode across the entire domain. Because salt tectonics can create fan-shaped geometries in sediments, syn-rift deposits have to be carefully re-examined in order to decipher the effects of crustal tectonics (rifting) and salt tectonics. Our data surprisingly showed that there are no clues for Messinian syn-rift sediments along the East-Sardinia Basin and Cornaglia Terrace, hence no evidence for rifting after Late Tortonian times. Nevertheless, widespread deformation occurred during the Pliocene and is attributed to post-rift reactivation. Some Pliocene vertical movements have been evidenced by discovering localized gravity gliding of the salt and its Late Messinian (UU) and Early Pliocene overburden. To the South, crustal-scale southward tilting triggered along-strike gravity gliding of salt and cover recorded by upslope extension and downslope shortening. To the North, East of the Baronie Ridge, there was some post-salt crustal activity along a narrow N-S basement trough, bounded by crustal faults. The salt geometry would suggest that nothing happened after Messinian times, but some structural features (confirmed by analogue modelling) show that basement fault slip was accommodated by lateral salt flow, which thinned upslope and inflated downslope, while the overlying sediments remained sub-horizontal.",

            "abstract": "Increasing water needs for agriculture, industry and cities mean effective and flexible water resource system management tools will remain in high demand. Currently many regions or countries use simulators that have been adapted over time to their unique system properties and water management rules and realities. Most regions operate with a preferred short-list of water management and planning decision support systems. Is there scope for a simulator, shared within the water management community, that could be adapted to different contexts, integrate community contributions, and connect to generic data and model management software? What role could open-source play in such a project? How could a genericuser-interface and data/model management software sustainably be attached to this model or suite of models? Finally, how could such a system effectively leverage existing model formulations, modeling technologies and software? These questions are addressed by the initial work presented here. We introduce a generic water resource simulation formulation that enables and integrates both rule-based and optimization driven technologies. We suggest how it could be linked to other sub-models allowing for detailed agent-based simulation of water management behaviours. An early formulation is applied as an example to the Thames water resource system in the UK. The model uses centralised optimisation to calculate allocations but allows for rule-based operations as well in an effort to represent observed behaviours and rules with fidelity. The model is linked through import/export commands to a generic network model platform named Hydra. Benefits and limitations of the approach are discussed and planned work and potential use cases are outlined.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 Mw 8.1 Pisagua, Chile earthquake featured a remarkable foreshock sequence. Foreshock migration at speed similar to 2011 Tohoku foreshocks and slow slip events has been interpreted as driven by aseismic slip, instead of a cascade (possibly mediated by aseismic afterslip). However, current analyses of geodetic and tiltmeter data illustrate the challenge to discriminate between pre-slip and cascade models through in-land deformation observations. Here we attempt to distinguish these models via seismic observations only, identify evidence of a large nucleation process and discuss its implications for fault friction and earthquake predictability.\nWe analyze patterns of foreshock activity, including repeating earthquake sequences identified via waveform similarity on the nearest IPOC stations. We find that repeaters accelerate close in time and space to large foreshocks and their recurrence times decay following Omori’s law. This favors the cascade model, in which repeaters are aftershocks of foreshocks. Limitations of current catalogs impede more quantitative tests.\nDirect evidence of large-scale nucleation is a separate foreshock cluster north of the mainshock hypocenter whose activity is independent of the dominant southern swarm. Over almost one year, swarms occurred near the southern and northern tips of the mainshock rupture and near the southern end of the largest aftershock. These clusters are located near boundaries of relatively high seismic coupling inferred from geodesy.\nA picture of a segmented megathrust emerges where regions of aseismic deformation mark the boundaries between fault segments and produce earthquake swarms. Earthquake cycle models indicate aseismic slip slowly penetrates from segment boundaries into locked regions, until a critical distance is reached and unstable rupture (seismic or aseismic) follows. This view is further supported by temporal changes of foreshock swarm migration speed. The early swarm migration distance provides constraints on friction parameters and effective normal stress.\nSuch large-scale nucleation process, while appealing for earthquake predictability, is rare at a global scale. The predictability of final rupture size based on foreshock swarms is also limited by poor quantification of the likelihood of multi-segment rupture.",

            "abstract": "Developing scientific software is a continuous balance between not reinventing the wheel and getting fragile codes to interoperate with one another. Binary software distributions such as Anaconda provide a robust starting point for many scientific software packages, but this solution alone is insufficient for many scientific software developers. HashDist provides a critical component of the development workflow, enabling highly customizable, source-driven, and reproducible builds for scientific software stacks, available from both the IPython Notebook and the command line.\nTo address these issues, the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory at the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center has funded the development of HashDist in collaboration with Simula Research Laboratories and the University of Texas at Austin. HashDist is motivated by a functional approach to package build management, and features intelligent caching of sources and builds, parametrized build specifications, and the ability to interoperate with system compilers and packages. HashDist enables the easy specification of \"software stacks\", which allow both the novice user to install a default environment and the advanced user to configure every aspect of their build in a modular fashion. As an advanced feature, HashDist builds can be made relocatable, allowing the easy redistribution of binaries on all three major operating systems as well as cloud, and supercomputing platforms. As a final benefit, all HashDist builds are reproducible, with a build hash specifying exactly how each component of the software stack was installed.\nThis talk discusses the role of HashDist in the hydrological sciences, including its use by the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory in the development and deployment of the Proteus Toolkit as well as the Rapid Operational Access and Maneuver Support project. We demonstrate HashDist in action, and show how it can effectively support development, deployment, teaching, and reproducibility for scientists working in the hydrological sciences.\nThe HashDist documentation is available from: http://hashdist.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ HashDist is currently hosted at: https://github.com/hashdist/hashdist",

            "abstract": "We investigate the shear wave structure of the crust and uppermost mantle across the Northern and Central Mariana trench using ambient seismic noise recorded by land and ocean bottom seismographs (OBSs). The main goal of this study is to constrain velocity variations resulting from possible serpentinization of the incoming plate or the forearc mantle. Vertical component waveforms from 20 OBSs and 7 island stations deployed in 2012-2013 are correlated to reveal the empirical green functions. Due to the distinct structure difference across the trench, we adopt two different lithosphere models when calculating the phase velocity predictions. For each station pair, water depth estimated by averaging values along the great circle path connecting two stations is also introduced to predict the phase velocity. For each frequency, only high quality station pairs (SNR > 5) with distance larger than twice the wavelength are included. The dispersion curves are then interpolated to obtain the 2-D phase velocity map for period from 8 s to 32 s. Phase velocity maps from short periods (< 15 s) are strongly affected by the water depth. For periods between 15 s - 18 s, extremely low phase velocities near the trench result from water depth up to 9 km. Longer period results show fast phase velocity anomalies in the incoming plate and slow anomalies beneath the forearc, consistent with faster mantle velocities expected for the incoming plate. We will also show the results of inverting this phase velocity dataset for 3-D shear velocity structure. We are also investigating the use of higher mode Rayleigh waves, because in deep water regions the fundamental mode results fail to constrain the velocity structure of the shallowest part of the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Estimating maximum sustainable groundwater extraction rates in the hydrologically interconnected watersheds of the Deep Regional Carbonate Aquifer (DRCA) of the southwestern United States is difficult as water enters fractured aquifers via a combination of local recharge and interbasin flow. As a result, over-extraction may impact water availability on local and regional scales. In this study, a combination of geochemical data from groundwater and vein calcite samples enabled rate of local recharge and interbasin flow in the remote Tule Desert watershed in southeastern Nevada to be quantified. Groundwater 14C age gradients below the water table in 3 multi-level well clusters indicate recharge rates of 1 mm/yr to 2 mm/yr which correspond to a maximum sustainable yield of 5 x 10-4 km3/yr to 1 x 10-3 km3/yr. This is less than previous estimates derived from different methods (e.g., Cl mass balance, water budget modeling) and probably reflects uncertainties in the applied effective porosity values and increasing horizontal interbasin flow components at greater depths below the water table. The deviation of the groundwater 𝛿18O time-series pattern for the Pleistocene-Holocene transition from that of the Devils Hole vein calcite (which is considered a reliable proxy for local climate change) combined with the regional groundwater 𝛿18O gradient allows interbasin flow rates of northerly derived groundwater to be estimated. The reported rates (61.2 m/yr – 101 m/yr) are slightly higher than those derived upon Darcy’s Law, but indicate hydraulic conductivity values strikingly similar to those obtained from pump tests conducted elsewhere in the DRCA province. These data may therefore provide the unique opportunity to predict basin-wide groundwater recharge (and sustainable yield) via groundwater flow model calibration based on set hydraulic gradient and conductivity parameters.",

            "abstract": "Extreme heat events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity in the coming decades [1]. The physical effects of extreme heat on human populations are well-documented, and anticipating changes in future exposure to extreme heat is a key component of adequate planning/mitigation [2, 3]. Exposure to extreme heat depends not only on changing climate, but also on changes in the size and spatial distribution of the human population. Here we focus on systematically quantifying exposure to extreme heat as a function of both climate and population change.\nWe compare exposure outcomes across multiple global climate and spatial population scenarios, and characterize the relative contributions of each to population exposure to extreme heat. We consider a 2 x 2 matrix of climate and population output, using projections of heat extremes corresponding to RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 from the NCAR community land model, and spatial population projections for SSP 3 and SSP 5 from the NCAR spatial population downscaling model. Our primary comparison is across RCPs - exposure outcomes from RCP 4.5 versus RCP 8.5 - paying particular attention to how variation depends on the choice of SSP in terms of aggregate global and regional exposure, as well as the spatial distribution of exposure. We assess how aggregate exposure changes based on the choice of SSP, and which driver is more important, population or climate change (i.e. does that outcome vary more as a result of RCP or SSP). We further decompose the population component to analyze the contributions of total population change, migration, and changes in local spatial structure.\nPreliminary results from a similar study of the US suggests a four-to-six fold increase in total exposure by the latter half of the 21st century. Changes in population are as important as changes in climate in driving this outcome, and there is regional variation in the relative importance of each. Aggregate population growth, as well as redistribution of the population across larger US regions, strongly affects outcomes while smaller-scale spatial patterns of population change have smaller effects.\n[1] Collins, M. et al.

            "abstract": "We investigate transport pathways of water vapor associated with landfalling atmospheric river (AR) events that result in precipitation along the west coast of the U.S. for winter of 1997–2010. The water vapor transport pathways are determined by computing back-trajectories with a trajectory model using the MERRA reanalysis dataset. The majority of AR events (about 86%) over the west coast of the U.S. are associated with three trajectory types. We designate the first type as Ascending near landfall and of Tropical Origin (AT), the second type as Ascending near landfall and of Extratropical Origin (AE), and the third type as Descending or parallel near landfall and of Extratropical Origin (DE). The magnitude and spatial distribution of precipitation of a given AR event are found to be strongly determined by the mixture of its type of trajectories. AR events composed of both AT and AE trajectories have more frequent and intense precipitation over a broad region of the western U.S. (particularly in the northern California) than AR events dominated by a single trajectory type (AT) or other combinations (e.g. AT and DE). In addition, different patterns of trajectory types among AR events are closely linked to the location and the shape of potential vorticity intrusions near the tropopause, which emphasizes that lower tropospheric air is interacting with upper tropospheric air during the developing rainfall system.",

            "abstract": "Impact events forming large craters (or, impact basins) several hundreds of kilometers in diameter have profoundly affected the evolution of the terrestrial planets. Previously acquired gravity and topography data of the Moon have shown evidence of crustal thinning in the central regions of these basins, which is a consequence of the basin formation process. High-resolution crustal thickness maps derived from the Gravity Recovery And Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) and Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data afford an unambiguous measure of the lateral extent of crustal thinning in lunar basins (protobasins, peak-ring and multi-ring basins). This region of crustal thinning can be used as a measure of basin size. In this work, we used the iSALE-2D numerical shock physics hydrocode to model the formation of lunar basins. We tested our simulations against crater structures observed by GRAIL. As a result, a new scaling law for impact basins on the Moon is derived. We show relationships between the transient crater size (including the impactor properties) as calculated by the hydrocode and the final crustal thinning diameter of an impact basin as well as an approximate relationship to the location of the basin rings, as mapped by LOLA and GRAIL. These scaling laws include lateral variations in the target properties, namely between the Procellarum KREEP Terrane on the nearside and the lunar highlands on the farside hemisphere. This work provides additional constraints on the extent of the Late Heavy Bombardment epoch.",

            "abstract": "Microbial processes that regulate availability of nutrients play key roles in shaping community composition. All life requires fixed nitrogen (N), and its bioavailability is what often limits ecosystem productivity. Biological nitrogen fixation, or the reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3), is a keystone process in N limited ecosystems, providing nitrogen for members of the community. N2 fixing organisms likely represent a ‘bottom up control’ on the structure of communities that develop in N limited environments. N2 fixation is catalyzed by a limited number of metabolically diverse bacteria and some methanogenic archaea and occurs in a variety of physically and geochemically diverse environments. Nitrification, or the sequential oxidation of NH4+ to nitrite (NO2-) and ultimately nitrate (NO3-), is catalyzed by several lineages of Proteobacteria at temperatures of < 62°C and by members of the Thaumarcheota at temperatures up to 90°C. Nitrification can thus be considered a ‘top down control’ on the structure of communities that develop in N limited environments.\nOur research in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) reveals a strong correspondence between the distribution of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and nitrogen fixing aquificae (NFA) in nitrogen-limited geothermal hot springs over large environmental gradients. Based on the physiology of AOA and NFA, we propose that the strong co-distributional pattern results from interspecies interactions, namely competition for bioavailable ammonia. Our recent work has shown that in springs where the niche dimension of AOA and NFA overlap (e.g., Perpetual Spouter; pH 7.1, 86.4°C), the dissimilar affinities for NH4 result in AOA metabolism maintaining a low NH4(T) pool and selecting for inclusion of NFA during the assembly of these communities. Here, we examine in situ physiological interactions of AOA and NFA, tracking changes in transcript levels of key genes involved in nitrogen metabolism and carbon fixation of these organisms in springs where the niche dimension of AOA and NFA overlap (e.g., Perpetual Spouter). These data suggest affinity for substrate and electron donor use play key roles in structuring the biodiversity of this hydrothermal community, and likely influences the structure of other N limited hydrothermal and non-hydrothermal ecosystems.",

In this study we demonstrate that he Montreal\nProtocol will also be very effective in mitigating the potential\nintensity (PI) of hurricanes in the coming half century.\nWe accomplish this by comparing the projections of a standard CMIP5\nRCP4.5 scenario to those of the so-called \"World Avoided\" scenario, in\nwhich ODS grow unabated in the absence of regulations.

They constitute a roughly east-west trending emergent ridge uplifted as a result of south-vergent shortening and left-lateral slip, mostly on west-striking, north-dipping faults. Late Quaternary uplift of these islands is recorded by two prominent wave-cut platforms, which occur at elevations of ~5-7 and ~6-24 meters above sea level, have been attributed by previous workers to Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5a (~80ka) and 5e (~120 ka), and indicate low and somewhat spatially variable, uplift rates of 0.1-0.2 mm/yr. We have documented evidence of older, higher marine features, such as shoreline angles, beveled surfaces buried by aeolian sand, and pholad borings, in the interior of Santa Rosa Island. Our simple steady uplift models indicate that the highest of these paleo shore line markers, which occur at ~275 m, could be anywhere from ~1.2 Ma to ~2.7 Ma. However, despite their importance for understanding longer term uplift rates associated with the Santa Rosa Island fault and/or other faults, their ages remain unknown.\nAs part of a cooperative effort with the National Park Service to complete a new Quaternary geologic map of the northern Channel Islands, we collected samples of quartz-bearing rock and sediment at seven locations on Santa Rosa Island, representative of 6 paleo shorelines spanning elevations between ~65 and ~275 meters above sea level, from both sides of the Santa Rosa Island fault. Rock samples were collected from moderately indurated fossiliferous marine sands that either contain pholad-bored clasts or overlie a beveled bedrock surface in order to determine 10Be exposure ages. Sediments were collected from where they directly overlie shoreline angles for determination of 10Be-26Al burial ages. Ages of these paleo sea level markers will enable us to test previous assumptions of steady island uplift, as well as allow us to test hypotheses related to the timing of differential uplift across the Santa Rosa Island fault as documented by differential GPS surveys of the MIS platform edges. The timing and distribution of long-term uplift rates will allow us to distinguish between ramp-flat or listric models of deep, low-angle thrusts responsible for the long-term uplift of Santa Rosa Island.",

They range from trachyte (66% SiO2) to trachyandesite (60%), with the youngest lava being the most mafic. Mixing features are pervasive, with enclaves, kspar megacrysts, crystal clots of various grain sizes, compositions, and degrees of resorption indicating multiple episodes of mafic injection, mobilization of young granitic material, and mixing/mingling of alkali basalt with trachyte to alkali rhyolite magmas similar to those at Mammoth Mountain. Enclaves range from 49 to 57% SiO2 and form a mixing line with a felsic end member at 67% SiO2. In order to quantify the distribution of enclaves and large (1-4 cm), resorbed, kspar megacrysts, outcrop-scale point counting was performed at >200 locations on the lavas. Contour maps show that kspar content is highest at the vent, but mafic-intermediate enclaves are irregularly distributed. Fe-Ti oxide temperatures for the host trachytic magmas are 915-1080°C, with the coolest temperatures at flow termini. Enclave temperatures are similar, 950-1120°C, with cooler temperatures in more felsic enclaves that are typically located near flow termini, indicating prolonged thermal and chemical interaction with the host magma. Calculated pressures are 2-4 kbar for host magmas, but some mafic crystal clots yield pressures up to 12 kbar, near the Moho at Long Valley. The kspar megacrysts match the composition of phenocrysts in late-erupted Bishop Tuff, suggesting that the megacrysts originated from solidified equivalents of magma remaining after eruption of the Bishop Tuff at 760 Ka. These data suggest a model in which alkali basalts are generated in the uppermost mantle and, through AFC, evolve into trachytes. Repeated basaltic injections keep the trachyte hot and partially melt young granites, resulting in entrainment of kspar megacrysts.\nThe most mafic enclaves in the NW domes match the alkali basalt compositions of the most mafic enclaves in Mono Craters Dome 12, 20 km to the north. This could indicate a shared mafic source at depth. Dome 12 is considerably more eroded than the rest of the 10- to 0.6-Ka Mono Craters, and may be about the same age as the NW domes. If so, there was a major mafic intrusion event along the N-S Mono Basin/ Mammoth Mountain trend at 27-41 Ka.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties surrounding vegetation response to increased disturbance rates associated with climate change remains a major global change issue for Amazon forests. Additionally, turnover rates in the Western Amazon are doubled compared to the Central Amazon, and notable gradients currently exist in specific wood density and aboveground biomass (AGB). This study investigates the extent to which the variation in disturbance regimes contributes to these regional gradients. To address these issues, we evaluated disturbance-recovery processes under scenarios of increased disturbance rates in a Central Amazon forest using first ZELIG-TROP, a dynamic vegetation gap model which we calibrated using long-term inventory data, and second using the Community Land Model (CLM), a global land surface model. Upon doubling the mortality rate in the Central Amazon to mirror the disturbance regime in the Western Amazon of ~2% mortality, the two regions continued to differ in multiple forest processes. With the inclusion of elevated natural disturbances, at steady-state, AGB significantly decreased by 41.9% with no significant difference between modeled AGB and empirical AGB from the western Amazon datasets (104 vs. 107 Mg C ha-1). However, different processes were responsible for the reductions in AGB between the models and empirical dataset. The empirical dataset suggests that a decrease in wood density drives the reduction in AGB. While decreased stand basal area was the driver of AGB loss in ZELIG-TROP, and decreased leaf area index (LAI) was the driver in CLM, two forest attributes that do not significantly vary across the Amazon Basin. Further comparisons found that stem density, specific wood density, and growth rates differed between the two Amazonian regions. This suggests that: 1) the variability between regions cannot be entirely explained by the variability in disturbance regime, but rather potentially sensitive to intrinsic environmental factors; or 2) the models are not accurately simulating all forest characteristics in response to increased disturbances. Next we evaluated the fidelity of elevated tree mortality in CLM. Similar to ZELIG-TROP, CLM predicted a net carbon loss of 49.9%, getting the correct answer for the wrong reason, and the temporal variability in carbon stock and fluxes was not replicated in CLM.",

            "abstract": "Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in many ecological studies, where processes such as evapotranspiration have impacts at temperature gradients less than 1 K. Current errors in standard MODIS and ASTER LST products are greater than 1 K, and for ASTER can be greater than 2 K in humid conditions due to incomplete atmospheric correction of atmospheric water vapor. Estimates of water vapor, either derived from visible-to-shortwave-infrared (VSWIR) remote sensing data or taken from weather simulation data such as NCEP, can be combined with coincident Thermal-Infrared (TIR) remote sensing data to yield improved accuracy in LST measurements.\nThis study compares LST retrieval accuracies derived using the standard JPL MASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, and the Water Vapor Scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction method proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, or HyspIRI, mission with ground observations. The 2011 ER-2 Delano/Lost Hills flights acquired TIR data from the MODIS/ASTER Simulator (MASTER) and VSWIR data from Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instruments flown concurrently. The TES and WVS retrieval methods are run with and without high spatial resolution AVIRIS-derived water vapor maps to assess the improvement using VSWIR water vapor estimates. We find improvement using VSWIR derived water vapor maps in both cases, with the WVS method being most accurate overall. For closed canopy agricultural vegetation we observed canopy temperature retrieval RMSEs of 0.49 K and 0.70 K using the WVS method on MASTER data with and without AVIRIS derived water vapor, respectively.",

            "abstract": "There are seven waves in dynamic theory of elasticity that are named after their discoverers. In 1885, Lord Rayleigh had published a paper where he described a wave capable to propagate along a free surface of an elastic half-space. In 1911, Love had considered a pure shear motion for a model of an elastic layer, bounded by an elastic halfspace. In 1917, Lamb had discovered symmetric and asymmetric waves propagating in an isolated elastic plate. Stoneley (1924) had found that a surface wave can propagate along an interface between two elastic halfspaces for some parameter combinations, and then Scholte had shown in 1942, that in a model where one of the halfspaces is fluid, the surface wave can exist for any parameters. The sixth wave is named after Biot (1956), and it describes a slow diffusive wave in a fluid-saturated poroelastic media. Finally, in 1962 Krauklis had found a dispersive fluid wave in a system of a fluid layer bounded by two elastic halfspaces.\nRemarkably, all but one of the named waves were found and predicted theoretically as the results of mathematical and physical approaches in Nature exploration to be later confirmed in experiments and used in various scientific and practical applications. The only wave, which was not observed neither numerically nor experimentally until now is Stoneley wave. A likely reason for that is in rather restricted combinations of material parameters for this wave to exist. Indeed, the ratio R of shear velocities a model must be inside of the interval (0.8742 – 1). The ratio of the Stoneley wave velocity to the largest share wave velocity must be in the interval (0.8742 – R).\nTo fill the gap, we performed 2D finite-difference simulation for a model consisting of polysterene (with velocities Vp1=2.350 m/s, Vs1=1190. m/s, and density Rho1= 1.06 g/m3) and gold (with velocities Vp2=3.240 m/s, Vs2=1200. m/s, and density Rho2= 19.7 g/m3). A corresponded root of a dispersion equation was found with a help of original analytical solution developed by WaveLab. A point force source oriented along the meadia interfaces was used. A clear localized energy following the both direct shear waves is the Stoneley wave (Figure 1).",

            "abstract": "A confluence of computing power, cost of storage, ease of access to data, and ease of product delivery make it possible to harness the power of multiple remote sensing data streams to monitor land surface dynamics. Change detection has always been a fundamental remote sensing task, and there are myriad ways to perceive differences. From a statistical viewpoint, image time series of the vegetated land surface are complicated data to analyze. The time series are often seasonal and have high temporal autocorrelation. These characteristics result in the failure of the data to meet the assumption of most standard parametric statistical tests. Failure of statistical assumptions is not trivial and the use of inappropriate statistical methods may lead to the detection of spurious trends, while any actual trends and/or step changes might be overlooked. Methods for the analysis of messy satellite data, which are often influenced by discontinuity, missing observations, non-linearity, and seasonality, are still being developed within the remote sensing community. We have found several examples of research that compares trends from different datasets. However, there is a dearth of information on the comparison of trend detection methods themselves for standardized datasets.\nHere we describe three different trend detection methods, and compare their results for a set of synthetic time series exhibiting monotonic trends as well as step changes. We will vary the length of the time series, the number of observations per year and the number of missing values. We will also vary the seasonality and the strength of the autocorrelation. We will then discuss a case study for Eastern Europe and European Russia where we investigate time series of MODIS Nadir BRDF-adjusted (NBAR) data at 8-day and 500m resolution between 2001 and 2013. We investigate basic vegetation indices such as NDVI and EVI but also extend the analysis towards a disturbance index which identifies how pixels differ from comparable regions.",

We have developed a seismogeodetic monitoring system based on GPS technology for real-time observations of large earthquakes that can also be used for structural monitoring. The data analysis method implements in a tightly-coupled Kalman filter to provide absolute estimates of seismic displacement, velocity, and tilt from GPS and accelerometer observations. Tilt is one of the major error sources that prevents accelerometer data from being integrated correctly to displacements. The technology is currently operational and streaming real-time observations from remote SIO Geodetic Module packages containing MEMS accelerometers at 17 GPS sites in southern California for the purposes of earthquake early warning and rapid response. The instruments were run in real-time on a four-story structure at the UCSD NEES shaketable to test an inertial force-limiting floor anchorage system as an emerging technology for new seismically resistant buildings. Observations were made during a series of earthquake simulations at five points on the roof of the structure, at the base, and at two nearby reference sites off the structure. Two of the points were also observed with observatory-grade Kinemetrics Episensor accelerometers to compare the performance of the MEMS sensors. The unique asymmetric design of the engineered structure deliberately induced large out-of-plane torsion and tilts of the building. This tested the performance of anchorage components to motions in two lateral directions even though the shaketable generated motions in only one component. We performed a seismogeodetic combination of the accelerometer and GPS data in which we simultaneously estimated tilts to take into account the impact of the rotations on vertical tilts of the accelerometers. The seismogeodetic combination reliably recovers drift at the rooftop, demonstrated through the agreement with independent string potentiometer measurements of displacement.",

Derivative products are new geophysical data maps, interpretative profiles and displays. An important task of the new processing is to facilitate calibration or leveling between adjacent surveys flown with different systems in different years. The new approach will facilitate integration of the geophysical data in the interpretation and construction of geologic framework, resource evaluations and to geotechnical studies.\nFour helicopter airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys have been flown in the Styx River area by the DGGS; Styx River, Middle Styx, East Styx, and Farewell. The Styx River flown in 2008 and Middle Styx in flown 2013, cover an area of 2300 square kilometers. These data consist of frequency-domain DIGHEM V surveys which have been numerically processed and interpreted to yield a three-dimensional model of electrical resistivity. We describe the numerical interpretation methodology (inversion) in detail, from quality assessment to interpretation. We show two methods of inversion used in these datasets, deterministic and stochastic, and describe how we use these results to define calibration parameters and assess the quality of the datasets.

These two related dynamical systems have been studied previously as chaotic scattering systems with application to the Earth's magnetotail. Both systems exhibit chaotic scattering over a wide range of parameter values. The structure and properties of their respective phase spaces have been used to elucidate potential dynamical signatures that affect spacecraft measured ion distributions. In this work we consider the problem of discrimination between these two magnetic structures using charged particle dynamics. For example we show that signatures based on the well known energy resonance in the current sheet field provide good discrimination since the resonance is not present in the neutral line case. While both fields can lead to fractal exit region structuring, their characteristics are different and also may provide some field discrimination. Application to magnetotail field and particle parameters will be presented",

            "abstract": "We report on progress in our development of a comprehensive real-time GPS-based seismic monitoring system for the Cascadia subduction zone. This system is based on 1 Hz point position estimates computed in the ITRF08 reference frame. Convergence from phase and range observables to point position estimates is accelerated using a Kalman filter based, on-line stream editor. Positions are estimated using a short-arc approach and algorithms from JPL’s GIPSY-OASIS software with satellite clock and orbit products from the International GNSS Service (IGS). The resulting positions show typical RMS scatter of 2.5 cm in the horizontal and 5 cm in the vertical with latencies below 2 seconds. To facilitate the use of these point position streams for applications such as seismic monitoring, we broadcast real-time positions and covariances using custom-built streaming software. This software is capable of buffering 24-hour streams for hundreds of stations and providing them through a REST-ful web interface. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we have developed a Java-based front-end that provides a real-time visual display of time-series, vector displacement, and contoured peak ground displacement. We have also implemented continuous estimation of finite fault slip along the Cascadia megathrust using an NIF approach. The resulting continuous slip distributions are combined with pre-computed tsunami Green’s functions to generate real-time tsunami run-up estimates for the entire Cascadia coastal margin. This Java-based front-end is available for download through the PANGA website. We currently analyze 80 PBO and PANGA stations along the Cascadia margin and are gearing up to process all 400+ real-time stations operating in the Pacific Northwest, many of which are currently telemetered in real-time to CWU. These will serve as milestones towards our over-arching goal of extending our processing to include all of the available real-time streams from the Pacific rim. In addition, we are developing methodologies to combine our real-time solutions with those from Scripps Institute of Oceanography’s PPP-AR real-time solutions as well as real-time solutions from the USGS. These combined products should improve the robustness and reliability of real-time point-position streams in the near future.",

            "abstract": "Low velocity (<1 mm/yr) extensional environments, such as the Rio Grande rift (RGR) in Colorado and New Mexico, are complex but can provide insights into continental dynamics, tectonic processes, and seismic hazards. We use eight years of measurements from 26 continuous GPS stations across the RGR installed as part of a collaborative EarthScope experiment. We combine this data with regional Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) and National Geodetic Survey (NGS) CORS GPS stations, and survey-mode data collected on NGS benchmarks to investigate how deformation is distributed across a broad area from the Great Plains to the Colorado Plateau. The data from over 150 stations are processed using GAMIT/GLOBK, and time series, velocities, strain rates are estimated with respect to realizations of a stable North America reference frame, such as NA12. This study extends our previous analysis, based on 4 years of data, which found an approximately uniform 1.2 nanostrain/yr east-west extensional strain rate across the entire region that was not concentrated on the narrow surface expression of the rift. We expand on this previous work by using a denser network of GPS stations and analyzing longer time series, which reduce horizontal velocity uncertainties to approximately 0.15 mm/yr. We also improve the accuracy of the estimated velocity uncertainties by robustly characterizing time-correlated noise. The noise models indicate that both power-law and flicker noise are present in the time series along with white noise. On average, power law noise constitutes about 90% of the total noise in the vertical component and 60% in the horizontal components for the RGR sites. We use the time series, and velocity and strain-rate estimates to constrain spatial and temporal variations in the deformation field in order to locate possible regions of strain localization and detect transient deformation signals, and to address some of the kinematic and dynamic issues raised by the observation that a broad, low seismic velocity zone underlies the narrow geologic surface expression of the RGR defined by normal fault bounded basins.",

            "abstract": "Deformation is a class of highly non-linear geophysical processes from which one can infer other geophysical variables in a dynamical system. For example, in an ice-dynamic model, deformation is related to velocity, basal sliding, surface elevation changes, and the stress field at the surface as well as internal to a glacier. While many of these variables cannot be observed, deformation state can be an observable variable, because deformation in glaciers (once a viscosity threshold is exceeded) manifests itself in crevasses.\nGiven the amount of information that can be inferred from observing surface deformation, an automated method for classifying surface imagery becomes increasingly desirable. In this paper a Neural Network is used to recognize classes of crevasse types over the Bering Bagley Glacier System (BBGS) during a surge (2011-2013-?). A surge is a spatially and temporally highly variable and rapid acceleration of the glacier. Therefore, many different crevasse types occur in a short time frame and in close proximity, and these crevasse fields hold information on the geophysical processes of the surge.\nThe connectionist-geostatistical approach uses directional experimental (discrete) variograms to parameterize images into a form that the Neural Network can recognize. Recognizing that each surge wave results in different crevasse types and that environmental conditions affect the appearance in imagery, we have developed a semi-automated pre-training software to adapt the Neural Net to chaining conditions.\nThe method is applied to airborne and satellite imagery to classify surge crevasses from the BBGS surge. This method works well for classifying spatially repetitive images such as the crevasses over Bering Glacier. We expand the network for less repetitive images in order to analyze imagery collected over the Arctic sea ice, to assess the percentage of deformed ice for model calibration.",

            "abstract": "The origin of various patterns seen in Galápagos magmatism is investigated using numerical simulations of a mantle plume interacting with the Galapágos Spreading Center (GSC) as its position and geometry evolved over the past 6 Myr. Models predict magma generation and composition from a mantle composed of fusible veins of material enriched in incompatible elements imbedded in a more refractory depleted matrix. Model 1 simulates a low-viscosity plume owing to a temperature-dependent mantle rheology; Model 2 includes the added dependence on water content, which leads to high-viscosities in the dehydrated, shallow upper mantle. Model 1 produces the most favorable results. It shows how a modest crustal thickness anomaly observed along the Western GSC can arise from a plume with large excess temperatures (>100˚C). Model 1 also predicts geographic patterns in magma isotopic compositions generally resembling those observed along the GSC as well as around the Galapágos Archipelago. These patterns are predicted to arise out of the differences in melting depths between the enriched veins and depleted matrix, coupled with spatial variations in the rate of mantle upwelling and decompression melting. The results provide an alternative to traditional explanations involving the plume mixing with or entraining the ambient mantle. The models are still missing some essential factors as indicated by the predicted increases, rather than the observed decrease in incompatible element concentration away from the hotspot along the GSC. Possible factors include a regional-scale zoning in incompatible element and/or water content within the plume, or melt migration that delivers a larger flux of incompatible-element-rich melts to the GSC.\nThis study will be published as one of 18 chapters in The Galapagos: A Natural Laboratory for Earth Sciences, edited by K.

            "abstract": "The northeast coast of New Zealand has a range of embayed intermediate beaches whose cross-shore profiles can vary on time scales extending from individual storms to inter-decadal. Some of these beaches erode and accrete a lot whereas others can remain extraordinarily stable despite exposure to comparable wave climates. Here a profile dataset collected intermittently since 1980, and 6-weekly since 1995, on 19 northeast coast beaches (62 profiles) is used to study variability between sites. Spectral analysis of the profile data showed annual, biannual and interannual energy, with the relative magnitude varying surprisingly between sites. Wave climate information for the sites was provided by a regional SWAN model which had been forced by data extracted from the NOAA WWIII wave database. Waves were modelled from 1980-2008. The wave climate was used to cluster the beaches into those that were likely to behave in a similar way, based on the relative proportions of variability in these time scales in the significant wave height, mean period and alongshore wave energy flux extracted from model output. Beaches with a northward aspect had generally low biannual variability but higher interannual and seasonal variability. In contrast, sites exposed to easterly conditions had a greater biannual contribution. Analysis of climate indicators show that the southern oscillation index and the Pacific decadal oscillation also have variability in seasonal, biannual and interannual scales to different degrees and these are weakly but significantly correlated to beach volume variations. Overall, the degree of correlation appears directly related to beach orientation.",

            "abstract": "The long-wavelength geoid anomalies provide important constraints on mantle dynamics and mantle viscosity structure. Hager and Ricard and their colleagues successfully reproduced the observed geoid using seismically imaged mantle structure as buoyancy force in an isochemical, whole mantle convection model. However, it has been generally agreed that the seismically observed large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) underneath the Pacific and the Africa in the lower mantle are chemically distinct and likely more dense than the ambient mantle. In this study, we investigate how chemically distinct LLSVPs or chemical piles affect the geoid using both time-dependent thermochemical convection model and instantaneous flow model driven by buoyancy derived from seismic models. First, by conducting a series of 3D spherical thermochemical convection calculations, we found that the chemically dense piles above the CMB have a compensation effect on the geoid, and as a result, the total geoid is only controlled by the upper ~1600 km of the mantle. Second, we use buoyancy structure derived from seismic model Smean to study whether the observed geoid can be reproduced by considering the compensation effects of the LLSVPs. The geoid modeling requires a viscosity profile η and a seismic velocity to density scaling f. We define a four-layer viscosity model with viscosities for lithosphere η_lt, the upper mantle η_um, the transition zone η_tz, and the lower mantle η_lm. With a fixed η_lt of 20, we compute the geoid and search for η_um, η_tz, η_lm, and f that lead to the maximum variance reduction for the geoid. For the whole mantle, isochemical model, the best model with variance reduction of ~71% for degrees 2-9 has viscosities of 20, 0.5, 0.5, 35, for η_lt, η_um, η_tz, and η_lm, respectively, and the scaling f is 0.24. For the thermochemical model with the bottom 1000 km of structure removed, the best model has a viscosity profile of 20, 0.5, 0.5, 30 for the four layers from the top to the bottom, respectively, and the scaling f is 0.36. This shows that, compared with the isochemical model, a model with chemically distinct LLSVPs requires a larger seismic velocity to density scaling but similar viscosity structures, in order to reproduce the observed geoid. We also consider other seismic tomography models in our modeling.",

Flying on NASAs's high-altitude ER-2 aircraft since 2010, AirMSPI uses dual photoelastic modulator (PEM)-based technology to provide accurate measurements of the Stokes linear polarization parameters Q and U in the 470, 660, and 865 nm bands, providing unique observing capabilities for aerosol, cloud, and surface studies. We describe the methodologies used for radiometric and polarimetric calibration and characterization of the AirMSPI instrument, which make use of a combination of laboratory and vicarious techniques. A 1.65 m integrating sphere and overflights of Ivanpah Playa, NV are used for radiometric calibration. Radiometric cross-comparisons with the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), also flying on the ER-2, are used to validate the radiometric scale. For polarimetric calibration, a well-calibrated Polarization State Generator is used to provide known polarimetric inputs. A high-extinction rotating wiregrid polarizer is used to derive polarimetric calibration coefficients for each pixel, and the results are then validated using partially polarized light generated using tilted glass plates. Examples of collocated multiangular, polarimetric imagery from AirMSPI and hyperspectral imagery from AVIRIS will be shown, presenting new opportunities for atmosphere and surface remote sensing.",

Unlike surface ships and satellites, submarines have the unique ability to operate and take measurements regardless of sea ice cover, weather conditions, and time of year. This allows for a broad and comprehensive investigation of an entire ocean basin. The goal of the program is to acquire comprehensive data about Arctic sea ice thickness; biological, chemical, and hydrographic water properties; and bathymetry to improve our understanding of the Arctic Ocean basin and its role in the Earth's climate system.\nIce draft is measured with upward looking sonars mounted on the submarine’s hull. The work of collaborators on the SCICEX project compared recent ice draft from the submarines with draft from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) and with ice thickness estimates from ice age and have shown that SCICEX ice draft are consistent with these models. Bathymetry is measured with a bottom sounder. SCICEX bathymetry data from 1993 to 1999 are included in the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO). Collaborators have compared more recent bathymetry data collected through the SCICEX project with other IBCAO data, and they agree well. Water properties are measured with two different types of conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) sensors: one mounted on the submarine’s hull and expendable versions that are deployed through the submarines torpedo tubes. Data from the two different CTD sensors validate one another. The breadth of instrumentation available from submarines along with their ability to be unencumbered by sea ice, weather, and season makes the data they have collected extremely valuable. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) manages this data collection and makes it available through the web at http://nsidc.org/scicex.",

The WSN is a set of sensors integrated into a single instrument to make spatial measurements to capture the landscape variability, and provide both spatially distributed and representative values of snowcover and the energy that drives snowmelt across the basin. Each local WSN has 10 snow-depth, air-temperature and relative-humidity sensors placed in a ~1-km2 area, and is centered on existing snow-pillow, snow-course and meteorological-station. A subset of the nodes are equipped with 15-20 soil-moisture and soil-temperature sensors. The temporal resolution of all measurements are 15-minutes. Results indicate that the aggregate of all measurement nodes are representative of the landscape variability across the American River basin, as well as the three forks of the American River. Snow measurements across elevation gradients and at each local WSN show similar trends but different magnitudes. Across elevation gradients snow amounts can vary as much as 60%-80%, while variability across a 1-km2 10 measurement network range by as much as 60%. Additionally, spatially distributed sensors distinguish temperature and humidity differences across topographic and vegetation variables, which control variable snowmelt rates across the terrain. Snowmelt rates across a 1-km2 can ranged from 8 to 70 mm day-1. The Hydrologic data from the WSN is being used for research, and for modernizing forecasting and decision-support systems through spatially explicit modeling, and by enhancing existing physically and statistically based snowmelt and hydrologic models. Data are available through the American River Hydrologic Observatory (\narho@ucmerced.edu\n) and real-time updates are available through SierraNet (glaser.berkeley.edu/wsn).",

We also speculate that human adaptation to mercury toxicity may occur in remarkably short time spans during the Holocene.\nWe found mercury concentrations in Modern pigeon feathers and llama wool from free foraging birds and animals in Albuquerque, NM, ranging from 0.006 to 0.019 mg/Kg of tissue. The values for Modern Peru ranged from 22.0 to 556 mg/Kg for the same tissues. We discovered, in 64 million-year-old fossilized plants from New Mexico (Paleocene Nacimiento Formation, San Juan Basin), a mercury concentration of 1.11 mg/Kg of fossil, whereas Modern plant material from the Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico contained no mercury.\nProfiling of metal content of these samples suggests that mercury is a proxy for anthropogenic rather than geochemical enrichment in the localities we examined.\nWe found no overt signs of mercury toxicity in contemporaneous inhabitants of Huancavelica4, Peru; one of the ten most mercury-polluted places in the world and the mercury concentration in their hair is well below modern admissible levels. However, assessment of their annual scalp hair growth-rate showed marked reduction in growth (~ 5cm/yr) versus ~ 16cm/year for normal scalp hair from other continents4. This is consistent with a toxic effect of heavy metals on human metabolism and especially autonomic nervous system function in Huancavelica, Peru.\nContemporaneous anthropogenic activities are known to increase heavy metal content in the biosphere with potentially toxic effects on humans. However, signs of human evolutionary adaptation to such toxins might already be evident in Peru4. ",

            "abstract": "The REU site on sustainable land and water resources has a goal of broadening participation in the geosciences by underrepresented groups and particularly Native American students. We are evaluating modifications to the traditional REU model in order to better support these students. First, we review a team research model for REU students, where students are placed on teams and work together in peer groups supported by a team of mentors. Second, the REU takes place in locations that have high populations of Native American students to remove barriers to participation for non-traditional students. Finally, the teams do research on issues related to local concerns with cultural focus. Traditional REU models (1 faculty to 1 student/on campus) have been shown to be effective in supporting student movement into graduate programs but often fail to attract a diverse group of candidates. In addition, they rely for success on the relationship between faculty and student, which can often be undermined by unrealistic expectations on the part of the student about the mentor relationship, and can be exacerbated by cultural misunderstanding, conflicting discourse, or students’ personal or family issues. At this REU site, peer mentorship and support plays a large role. Students work together to select their research question, follow the project to completion and present the results. Students from both native and non-native backgrounds learn about the culture of the partner reservations and work on a project that is of immediate local concern. The REU also teaches students protocols for working on Native American lands that support good relations between reservation and University. Analysis of participant data gathered from surveys and interview over the course of our 3-year program indicates that the team approach is successful. Students noted that collaborating with other teams was rewarding and mentors reported positively about their roles in providing guidance for the student’s future plans. While there are still challenges to this approach (e.g. optimal team size and structure, interpersonal conflicts among team members, geographically dispersed teams), the model has proven effective in recruiting and retaining students from culturally, geographically, and economically diverse backgrounds.",

            "abstract": "Off fault seismic activity associated with the principally strike-slip fault zones of California can be quite hazardous, but difficult to assess. Using cosmogenically derived denudation rates and channel profile analysis, we mapped the spatial and temporal distribution of rock uplift rates along the Mendocino Coast in northern California. Specifically, we used measured 10Be concentrations in river sands to determine catchment-averaged denudation rates, and then used these rates with basin-averaged channel steepness values to infer the erosive properties of the underlying bedrock. We then used the spatial distribution of channel steepness with these erosive properties to map the spatial distribution of local channel incision rate onto this landscape. In so doing, we identified generally lower elevation areas of this landscape that showed high channel steepness (and hence denudation rate) that were distinct from a higher-elevation area that showed systematically lower channel steepness and denudation rate values. These two areas are separated by distinct channel knickpoints, but not lithologic contacts. Assuming that changes in rock uplift rates are manifest in channel steepness values as a headward propagating kinematic wave that separates high and low channel steepness values, we bravely use the distance that this transition has moved upstream to estimate the time at which rock uplift rates increased. This analysis suggests that rock uplift rates along the coast changed from 0.3 to 0.75 mm/yr between 350 and 450 ka. Finally, the preservation and back-tilting of a Pliocene marine sediment package within 5-15 km of the San Andreas Fault supports the patterns suggested by the channel profile analyses, and further suggests that relatively rapid uplift may indicate a zone of elevated off-fault seismic hazard.",

            "abstract": "For the past two decades surface elevation data has been gathered over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) by airborne and satellite laser altimetry. Moreover, surface elevation data and elevation changes have increasingly become available from a variety of stereographic Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), generated, for example from ASTER, SPOT and WorldView imaging sensors. Laser altimeters provide accurate surface elevation measurements, but have relatively low spatial and temporal resolutions over the majority of the GrIS. DEMs, however, have lower vertical accuracy but high spatial resolution. The fusion of these data sets allows for the generation of a detailed and accurate spatio-temporal history of elevation changes.\nRecent studies have shown that mass loss in Northeast Greenland, in particular from the outlet glaciers draining the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), has been increasing. Having an ice plain with a bed situated well below sea level makes Zachariæ Isstrøm, one of the main outlet glaciers of the NEGIS, vulnerable to rapid thinning and retreat.\nThe fusion of multi-sensor surface elevation data over the Zachariæ Isstrøm during the period of 2001-2013 provides an accurate history of elevation changes and demonstrates that the onset of thinning occurred earlier than previously thought. It also allows for improving the predictions of future mass loss and corresponding sea level rise.",

These two sediment cores were analyzed with grain size analyzer, 210Pb and 137Cs. Flood events were reconstructed mainly based on grain size of sediments and were compared with the recorded flood events happened in the drainage. These results demonstrate that only about one third flood events could be rebuiled and all the extreme floods could be identified via this way. This is in accordance with the previous research result gained also in the lower Yangtze River. A partial of floods could not be identified from the sediment cores maybe because the total deposition resulted from relatively small floods was eroded by strong flow during the subsequent extreme flood events whereas only a partial of deposition left by the extreme floods could be eroded by relatively small flood events, resulting in a partial of relatively small floods being invisible in the sediment cores. This needs further study via in-situ investigation or modelling.",

            "abstract": "Grazing profoundly affects climate by altering the exchange of greenhouse gases (GHG; CO2 and CH4) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Little is known about how this disturbance affects the GHG exchange from subtropical pastures although they account for a substantial portion of global grazing lands. Here, we investigated how cattle grazing affect net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and CH4 emissions in subtropical semi-native pasture using the eddy covariance technique. Soil moisture was greater under grazed than ungrazed pastures but soil temperature was similar between treatments. By removing aboveground biomass, grazing reduced gross primary productivity (GPP, 16%). While ungrazed pastures had higher GPP than grazed pastures, they also had higher ecosystem respiration (Re, 20%) along with higher heterotrophic respiration. As a result, annual sums of NEE were similar in grazed and ungrazed pastures and both systems were net sinks for CO2 (-86 ± 5 gC m-2 yr-1 in grazed pasture, and -76 ± 6 gC m-2 yr-1 in ungrazed pasture). Including C removal by grazers in the C budget, grazing reduced the C sink strength (250%) and grazed pasture became a net source of C to the atmosphere. Increased soil wetness and CH4 production from enteric ruminant fermentation enhanced net ecosystem CH4 emissions (16%) in grazed than in ungrazed pastures. The net global warming potential (GWP) was higher (34%) in grazed than in ungrazed pastures, but both systems were net sources of GHGs when accounting for the radiative forcing of CH4. Our results suggest that grazing reduces the net C sink strength and increases the net GWP of subtropical pastures. Improved understanding of how grazing affects ecosystem GHG fluxes is essential to predicting the role of pastures on the global C cycle.",

HGf measurements were conducted for size-selected aerosols with diameters ranging from 46 nm to 151 nm and at relative humidity (RH%) values ranging from 10 to 90%. In addition, we have calculated the CCN activation diameters for the aminium carboxylate aerosols and derived the hygroscopicity parameter (k or kappa) values for all species using three methods, i.e., the mixing rule approximation, HGf, and CCN results. Our results show that variations in the ratio of acid to base directly affect the activation diameter, HGf, and (k) values of the aminium carboxylate aerosols. Atmospheric implications of the variations in the chemical composition of aminium carboxylate aerosols on their cloud forming potential will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Receiver function analysis is a powerful tool widely used to isolate and interpret receiver-side structure effects in teleseismic records. The idea is to deconvolve the vertical component from the horizontal components to produce a time series, thus eliminating the influence of the source and distant path effects.\n The receiver function is usually migrated and directly interpreted by visual inspection. However, deconvolution is a numerically unstable procedure that needs to be stabilized, and the solution depends on the choice of regularization parameters (e.g. water level and the width of a low pass filter). Since the solution is blurred with multiple reflections from the subsurface that produce apparent discontinuities, qualitative interpretation of receiver functions is subjective. Alternatively, waveforms can be directly inverted for a 1D S-wave velocity model beneath the receiver. An inversion procedure is more quantitative, as a forward model will take into account all possible reflections and conversions. If cast in a Bayesian framework, an inversion also enables one to assess model uncertainties and quantify parameter trade-offs. However, seismologists have preferred migration techniques as they are easier to implement, computationally cheaper, and allow construction of 2D or 3D sections. Inversions have been limited thus far to the 1D case.\nIn this work we present a method for inversion of converted waveforms measured at a number of aligned stations. The unknown model is a 2D vertical cross section parameterized with a variable number of discontinuities, although the forward model used to compute synthetics under individual stations is 1D. Body waves are inverted jointly with surface wave dispersion measurements to reduce the range of possible solutions. The problem is solved with a fully non linear Bayesian inversion scheme where the posterior velocity distribution is sampled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithm. Our approach uses the ‘trans-dimensional’ method that simultaneously samples various models with different numbers of parameters. Not only are we able to assess uncertainty in crustal S velocity, we do so over a range of parameterizations, thus solving the model selection problem. We present preliminary results with synthetic tests that demonstrate the applicability of the method.",

            "abstract": "Discovery and identification of Earth Science products should not be the majority effort of scientific research. Search aides based on text metadata go to great lengths to simplify this process. However, the process is still cumbersome and requires too much data download and analysis to down select to valid products. The EOSDIS Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is attempting to improve this process by providing “visual metadata” in the form of full-resolution visualizations representing geophysical parameters taken directly fromt he data. Through the use of accompanying interpretive information such as color legends and the natural visual processing of the human eye, researchers are able to search and filter through data products in a more natural and efficient way.\nThe GIBS “visual metadata” products are generated as representations of Level 3 data or as temporal composites of the Level 2 granule- or swath-based data products projected across a geographic or polar region. Such an approach allows for low-latency tiled access to pre-generated imagery products. For many GIBS users, the resulting image suffices for a basic representation of the underlying data. However, composite imagery presents an insurmountable problem: for areas of spatial overlap within the composite, only one observation is visually represented. This is especially problematic in the polar regions where a significant portion of sensed data is “lost.”\nIn response to its user community, the GIBS team coordinated with its stakeholders to begin developing an approach to ensure that there is \"no pixel left behind.\" In this presentation we will discuss the use cases and requirements guiding our efforts, considerations regarding standards compliance and interoperability, and near term goals. We will also discuss opportunities to actively engage with the GIBS team on this topic to continually improve our services.",

            "abstract": "Deltas and their flat, fertile lands have become the most densely populated places on earth, but, partly because of anthropogenic interactions with fluvial, coastal, and wetland processes, their inhabitants are increasingly susceptible to natural disasters. Humans have decreased sediment supply delivered to rivers and ultimately wetlands and the coast, causing accelerating subsidence. The natural course and processes of many rivers have been altered through channelization, artificial levees, and dams, which ‘perch’ the river above its floodplain. As the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) increases, so will surface aggradation and channel backfilling, resulting in a fluvial system that is more vulnerable to flooding and frequent avulsions. To investigate the effects of increasing RSLR and anthropogenic manipulations on delta morphodynamics, we create new avulsion and floodplain modules to couple with the 3D mode of Sedflux (Hutton and Syvitski, 2008), a stratigraphic basin-filling model. We replace the probabilistic approach of channel avulsion previously used in the model with a module incorporating the steepest-decent methodology used in Jerolmack and Paola (2007), and a floodplain algorithm to deposit sediment on subaerial cells. Model experiments with Sedflux and the new modules address the effects on delta morphodynamics of varying rates of RSLR (affecting base-level), changes in sediment delivery (adjusting the upstream boundary conditions), and restriction of natural fluvial dynamics (inhibiting avulsions). The work presented here is the first step in a more expansive project to develop a new 3D eco-morphodynamic delta model system that will be based on further model couplings, including a vegetation module (that will affect fluvial and floodplain dynamics) and a coastline module (that will re-work the shoreline based on wave-driven alongshore sediment transport). The model system results will be tested and calibrated based on comparisons with observations from both the field and physical experiments.\nHutton, E, and J Syvitski (2008), Sedflux 2.0: An advanced process-response model that generates three-dimensional stratigraphy, Comput.

Here we explain how to use implicit sampling for parameter estimation, i.e. to find independent samples of a posterior probability density. The basic idea is to focus the computational effort on the region of high probability defined by a prior and data. This region is located via numerical optimization, and explored by samples that are generated by solving algebraic equations with a stochastic right hand side. We also present an efficient numerical implementation of implicit sampling for parameter estimation. Specifically, we use BFGS optimization coupled to an adjoint code, and explain how to use multiple grids (coarse to fine) to speed up the computations. The random maps we use to solve the random algebraic equations are pre-conditioned with information from a Hessian. We demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our method in numerical experiments where we estimate a diffusion coefficient in an elliptic equation, as is important in reservoir simulation and pollution modeling. Our numerical tests indicate that our implementation of implicit sampling can be more efficient than standard MC sampling by a large factor, and that it accounts in full for the nonlinearity of the elliptic inverse problem.",

Although transient, eruptions strongly cool the planet through the liberation of sulfur gases that enter the stratosphere (converting to sulfate aerosol) and scatter sunlight. In particular, such events source the largest amplitude radiative forcings that perturb the terrestrial climate during the Last Millennium. Previous studies have highlighted the global climate impact of large volcanic events, including the role of latitude and time-of-year of a given eruption. Here, we focus on the influence of hemispheric asymmetry in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and its projection onto the tropical hydrologic cycle. This is assessed using a suite of simulations from a fully coupled isotope-enabled General Circulation Model (NASA GISS ModelE2-R) run from 850-2005 CE. This study builds upon prior work that demonstrate the role of inter-hemispheric forcing gradients on Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) location. In addition to unveiling the physical mechanisms that alter tropical hydroclimate, we highlight the anticipated tropical oxygen isotope distribution following large eruptions. Thus, through the vehicle of an isotope-enabled model, we formulate a potentially falsifiable prediction for how volcanic forcing may manifest itself in high-resolution proxies across the tropics.",

            "abstract": "Graymer and Simpson (2013, AGU Fall Meeting) showed that in a simple 2D multi-fault system (vertical, parallel, strike-slip faults bounding blocks without strong material property contrasts) slip rate on block-bounding faults can be reasonably estimated by the difference between the mean velocity of adjacent blocks if the ratio of the effective locking depth to the distance between the faults is 1/3 or less (\"effective\" locking depth is a synthetic parameter taking into account actual locking depth, fault creep, and material properties of the fault zone). To check the validity of that observation for a more complex 3D fault system and a realistic distribution of observation stations, we developed a synthetic suite of GPS velocities from a dislocation model, with station location and fault parameters based on the San Francisco Bay region. Initial results show that if the effective locking depth is set at the base of the seismogenic zone (about 12-15 km), about 1/2 the interfault distance, the resulting synthetic velocity observations, when clustered, do a poor job of returning the input fault slip rates. However, if the apparent locking depth is set at 1/2 the distance to the base of the seismogenic zone, or about 1/4 the interfault distance, the synthetic velocity field does a good job of returning the input slip rates except where the fault is in a strong restraining orientation relative to block motion or where block velocity is not well defined (for example west of the northern San Andreas Fault where there are no observations to the west in the ocean). The question remains as to where in the real world a low effective locking depth could usefully model fault behavior. Further tests are planned to define the conditions where average cluster-defined block velocities can be used to reliably estimate slip rates on block-bounding faults. These rates are an important ingredient in earthquake hazard estimation, and another tool to provide them should be useful.",

            "abstract": "The North Anatolian Fault (NAF), a major continental transform boundary, splays westward into three branches in the Sea of Marmara region of NW Turkey. The main northern branch passes only ~20 km from Istanbul and has been the subject of intense investigation, The central branch enters the sea of Marmara in Gemlik Bay and extends westeward along the southern shelf of the Sea of Marmara. However, its detailed offshore geometry as well as its level of seismic activity have remained controversial. Under the SoMAR Project, two geophysical cruises were carried out in 2013 and 2014 to map the major sedimentary basins and shallow fault patterns of the southern shelf of the Marmara Sea. Including our 2008 and 2010 acquisition, we acquired 4,430 km of high-resolution multichannel seismic, sparker, multibeam bathymetric and CHIRP data. We used the new data to correlate our published late Quaternary stratigraphic age model across the outer shelf, and a ~1/4 Ma horizon across the Inner Shelf, thus providing a chronology that can be applied to the tectonic history of the central branch.\nAs it exits Gemlik Bay, the central branch itself diverges westward into strands in a fan pattern. A half dozen southern strands strike WSW and W, with one continuing onland near the Kocasu River delta between Bandırma and Mudanya, and others dying out offshore. The northern strand strikes WNW and splays again into the İmrali Ridge Fault and the Imrali Fault across respectively the mid-shelf and the shelf break. A middle fault, the Kapidag fault, is present between Kapidag Peninsula and Marmara Island.\nMost of the faults increase their vertical component with depth, suggesting activity during Pliocene through Holocene time. The Kapidag fault and Imrali Ridge fault each exhibit between 1 and 2 km of vertical separation of acoustic basement. Late Quaternary rates of vertical separation on these faults can accumulate the total vertical component after Miocene time. Thus, steady-state activity is possible. Alternatively, the late Quaternary activity could represent reactivation. High-resolution CHIRP seismic profiles confirm that tilting is ongoing and that most of the faults offset the Last Glacial Maximum unconformity.\nKeywords: Marmara Sea, North Anatolian Fault; central branch; strike slip fault; erosional unconformity, seismic hazard; transform fault;",

            "abstract": "Most lakes and reservoirs are known to have surface carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations that are supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere, and hence nearly all of them are net emitters of CO2. Global carbon emissions from lakes account for 0.06 to 0.84 Pg C year-1, a substantial amount relative to other fluxes of the continental C balance. Therefore, a proper understanding of the land carbon cycle and its sensitivity to external perturbations requires detailed knowledge of drivers of global CO2 supersaturation in lakes. CO2 supersaturation has generally been attributed to a widespread imbalance of lake net ecosystem production towards net heterotrophy, but recent findings challenge this interpretation. Here we show that an integrated perspective including lake net ecosystem production together with precipitation and dissolution of carbonate minerals and inputs of dissolved inorganic carbon from the watershed, substantially improves our understanding of the processes leading to CO2 supersaturation in lakes with alkalinity above 1 meq L-1. Our results indicate that CO2 supersaturation is independent of net ecosystem production in many lakes, and that a significant amount of the CO2 evaded through their surface is directly related to weathering processes in the watershed that supply alkalinity to surface waters. After evaluation of the worldwide distribution of alkalinity across lakes we show that CO2 emissions related to weathering processes are relevant in tropical and temperate latitudes, but negligible in boreal regions.",

These ridges and fracture zones comprise the divergent plate boundary of the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate and the western edges of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda Plates. Both plates are being subducted beneath the western edge of the North American Plate. CARIS HIPS 8.1 software was used to process the multibeam data and create bathymetric images. The ridge axes, located off the coast of Washington and Oregon (USA) adjacent to the Cascadia Basin, indicate obvious signs of spreading, due to the series of faults and rocky ridges aligned parallel to the plate boundaries. Fault and ridge orientations are used to compare the direction of seafloor spreading, and indicate that both the Juan de Fuca Plate and Gorda Plate are spreading in a southeastern direction. Younger ridges from the Gorda Ridge system mapped in the study run parallel to the boundary, however older ridges do not show the same orientation, indicating a change in spreading direction. The presence of hydrothermal vents along the Juan de Fuca Ridge is also evidence of the active boundary, as the vent chimneys are composed of minerals and metals precipitated from the hot water heated by magma from beneath the spreading seafloor. In this study, the data are used to compare and contrast earthquake seismicity and ridge morphologies at a depth range of approximately 762 to 2134 meters. The diverging Pacific, Juan de Fuca, and Gorda Plates along with the San Andreas Fault have potential to increase seismic and volcanic activity around the diverging plates and North America’s west coast.",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy beneath the eastern Himalayan orogenic belts and the adjacent Lhasa block and the northern extreme of the Indian continent has been investigated by many studies using splitting of P-to-S converted phases from the core-mantle boundary. Significant discrepancies exist in the measurements and in the geodynamic models proposed by previous studies to explain the shear-wave splitting (SWS) results. Here we report results from a comprehensive analysis of XKS (including PKS, SKKS, and SKS) data recorded by 112 stations in the area from 83 to 93 degree East, and 26 to 31 degree North. A total of 236 pairs of resulting splitting parameters show systematic spatial variations. In the western one-third of the study area (approximately west of 86 degree East), the fast orientations are mostly E-W which is parallel to the strike of the orogenic belts, while stations east of this longitude demonstrate mostly NNE-SSW fast orientations which are similar to those observed on the Indian continent. Based on the spatial variations revealed by this and previous studies, we propose that seismic anisotropy beneath the study area is the result of two contrasting mechanisms. The first is the simple shear between the lithosphere of the subducting Indian slab and the asthenosphere, which leads to NNE-SSW oriented anisotropy; and the second is lower crustal flow which induces mostly E-W oriented anisotropy. Because the fast orientations in the two layers are approximately orthogonal to each other, the observed fast orientation at a given area reflects that of the layer with stronger anisotropy, and the observed splitting time is the difference in splitting time between the two layers. Under this model, the western part of the study area is dominated by lower crustal flow, while in the eastern part, simple shear between the slab and the asthenosphere produces stronger anisotropy than crustal flow.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice thickness is a primary indicator of climate change in the polar oceans, as the thickness is a time-integrated result of both thermodynamic and dynamic processes. The large-scale ocean and atmospheric forcing acts on the fine-scale (a few to 10s of meters) opening and closing of the sea ice cover along fractures. The mean thickness and variance of sea thickness at km scales (50 cm uncertainty) are derived from recent spaceborne observations from the ICESat lidar and in the Arctic from sporadic upward looking sonar measurements. However, accurate measurements of sea ice thickness at the fine-scales at which the forcing is occurring are virtually non-existent.\nIn this paper we explore two potential radar interferometric means of obtaining sea ice thickness. One method uses high frequency Ka-band (8.5 mm wavelength) to infer sea ice thickness by measuring elevations to the surface of the ice and to the ocean surface in nearby open leads. Data from the NASA Glistin radar is used to illustrate this methodology. Alternatively, we consider the use of dual frequency X-band and P-band (3 cm and 85 cm wavelengths) to exploit the differential penetration of longer versus shorter wavelength to estimate sea ice thickness. This technique is illustrated with data collected by the Furgo Earthdata GeoSAR system.\nPortions of this research were conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

            "abstract": "Natural gaseous emissions near large crustal faults and their potential relations with deformation and earthquake have always aroused significant interest. Radon-222, a radioactive gas (half-life of 3.8 days) naturally produced in the Earth’s crust, is used as a tracer of fluid migration in fault zones and is sometimes considered as a potential earthquake precursor. However, this matter is still highly debated. In this study, dedicated rock deformation experiments are conducted on various low-porosity granites and high-porosity volcanic tuffs under controlled upper crustal conditions. The sample is placed in the tri-axial cell under given confining and pore pressures. In practice, pore pressure, controlled by a flux of inert argon, expels the poral gas of the sample, whose radon concentration is continuously measured. First, when pore pressure is applied, radon is expelled from the connected pores and cracks of the sample, leading to a transient peak in radon concentration. This case may correspond to an initially cemented fault conduit which becomes suddenly unsealed. Second, radon concentration increases with confining pressure, but starts to decrease above a given value of confining pressure. This is related to the closing of pores and cracks that may be considered when a fault conduit becomes progressively sealed. Third, when axial stress increases, hence approaching the macroscopic rupture of the sample, initially isolated micro-cracks interconnect. In some cases, this may lead to transient peaks of radon concentration. Finally, after the macroscopic rupture, a significant transient radon peak is systematically detected. The time between the rupture and the transient radon signal mainly depends on the permeability of the sample at the rupture point. This study demonstrates that advective conditions are definitely required to efficiently observe potential transient radon signals, and that, even so, precursory radon signals cannot be systematically observed. Radon appears also as a tracer of what is effectively changing in a rock sample during deformation and in the general context of dynamic permeability changes.",

            "abstract": "Accurate and reliable information on flood frequency and magnitude is vital for the design of hydraulic structures and for floodplain mapping. The time-series data used for flood frequency analysis are obtained from both gauged systematic records and also historical floods. These time-series data sets, however, may include outliers. Outliers are defined as values that are much larger or smaller than most of the values in a given data set. Therefore, by definition, outliers include both very high and very low values. However, the main focus of this study is only on high outliers (hereafter referred to as simply outliers). The availability of a wide-array of tests and techniques makes the outlier detection and modification procedure anything but straightforward. The set of tests and techniques that is selected to detect and modify these outliers can have a direct impact on flood frequency and magnitude estimates.\nMany different approaches, based on the principles of hypothesis testing, are available for the detection of outliers. Several such methods are examined in detail in this study by using data from Southeast Europe. Outliers detected using these approaches can be eliminated, modified or disregarded (i.e., by treating them as non-outliers) prior to being used in flood frequency analyses. Eliminating or disregarding the outliers typically requires additional gauge- or event-specific information in order to be fully implemented. In the absence of such information, the practice of using modified outliers in flood frequency analysis provides the best compromise. Nevertheless, the effects of all three options on flood frequency and magnitude estimates are investigated to provide a more meaningful comparison. Flood magnitude-frequency estimates based on the log Pearson type 3 distribution are used in this study to evaluate the effect of outlier modification. The study findings have important implications for estimation of flood frequency and magnitude with time-series data sets that have one or more outliers.",

            "abstract": "Today’s instruction in Earth’s systems requires thoughtful selection of curricula, and in turn, high quality learning activities that address modern Earth science. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), which are intended to guide K-12 science instruction, further demand a discriminating selection process. The DIG (Diversity & Innovation in Geoscience) Texas Instructional Blueprints attempt to fulfill this practice by compiling vetted educational resources freely available online into units that are the building blocks of the blueprints. Each blueprint is composed of 9 three-week teaching units and serves as a scope and sequence for teaching a one-year Earth science course.\nIn the earliest stages of the project, teams explored the Internet for classroom-worthy resources, including laboratory investigations, videos, visualizations, and readings, and submitted the educational resources deemed suitable for the project into the project’s online review tool. Each team member evaluated the educational resources chosen by fellow team members according to a set of predetermined criteria that had been incorporated into the review tool. Resources rated as very good or excellent by all team members were submitted to the project PIs for approval. At this stage, approved resources became candidates for inclusion in the blueprint units. Team members tagged approved resources with descriptors for the type of resource and instructional strategy, and aligned these to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Earth and Space Science and the Earth Science Literacy Principles. Each team then assembled and sequenced resources according to content strand, balancing the types of learning experiences within each unit. Once units were packaged, teams then considered how they addressed the NGSS and identified the relevant disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices.\nIn addition to providing a brief overview of the project, this presentation will detail the intensive review process educators utilized to determine the viability of the resources included in the blueprints. A short summary of first-year implementation results will be shared, along with the second year now in progress.",

            "abstract": "Mechanism to cause drastic variation of the Earth's outer radiation belt is one of outstanding problems of the magnetospheric researches. While the radial diffusion of the electrons driven by ULF waves in Pc5 frequency range has been considered as one of the candidate mechanisms, it is pointed out that the radial transport of relativistic electrons by ULF waves is not necessarily reach the radial diffusion limit and collective motion of the outer belt electrons can exhibit large deviations from the radial diffusion [Ukhorskiy et al., JATSP, 2008]. Thus it is important to understand the form of radial transport of electrons under realistic ULF distribution in the inner magnetosphere. We have developed a physics-based model for the global dynamics of the ring current (GEMSIS-RC model). The GEMSIS-RC model is a self-consistent numerical simulation code solving the five-dimensional collisionless drift-kinetic equation for the ring-current ions in the inner-magnetosphere coupled with Maxwell equations [Amano et al., JGR, 2011].\nWe applied the GEMSIS-RC model for simulation of global distribution of ULF Pc5 waves. Comparison between runs with/without ring current ions show that the existence of hot ring current ions can deform the original sinusoidal waveforms. The deformation causes the energy cascade to higher frequency range (Pc4 and Pc3 ranges). The cascade is more pronounced in the high beta case. It is also shown that the existence of plasmapause strengthens ULFs outside the plasmapause and widens the MLT region where the E_r (toroidal) component is excited from initially-given E_phi (poloidal) component. In order to investigate the characteristics of radial transport of relativistic electrons, we then use the global magnetic and electric fields variation obtained by the GEMNIS-RC model as input field models for the test particle simulations of radiation belt electrons (GEMSIS-RB) [Saito et al., JGR, 2010]. The combination of GEMSIS-RC and RB models reproduced rapid radial transport by the drift resonance for simple monochromatic wave inputs as theoretically expected. On one hand, collective motion of the relativistic electrons shows deviations from the radial diffusion limit for large amplitude case due to finite system size. We will discuss a possible threshold of the Pc5 amplitude to cause the deviations.",

            "abstract": "Recent MHD simulations indicate that the magnetic reconnection processes in the near-Earth magnetotail can be highly 3-dimensional in geometry and dynamics, even though the magnetotail configuration itself is nearly two dimensional due to the symmetry in the dusk-dawn direction. These reconnection processes are in fact induced by the intrinsically 3D process of nonlinear ballooning instability [1,2]. Where and how 3D reconnection occurs is crucial for determining its consequences in both the magnetotail and the auroral regions. In this work, we focus on examining the geometric aspects of the 3D reconnection process induced by ballooning instability in the near-Earth magnetotail by computing the bald patches and squashing degrees of the magnetic field lines associated with the 3D plasmoid formation. The periodic distributions of both bald patches and quasi-separatrix layers (QSL) correlate closely with the ballooning finger pattern, revealing the intrinsically 3D nature of the coupling between the reconnection process and the ballooning instability. Despite the 3D geometry involved, the QSL pattern in the equatorial plane as well as its mapping in the auroral region is 2-dimensional. This may provide an alternative means for identifying the magnetotail origins of the auroral structures during substorm process.\n*Research supported by U.S. NSF grant AGS-0902360 and USTC 100-Talent program.\n[1] P.

            "abstract": "An unusual sequence of earthquakes in NW Brooks Range region of Alaska began with two magnitude 5.7 earthquakes within minutes of each other on April 18, 2014. These events were followed by a vigorous aftershock sequence with many aftershocks reaching magnitude 4 and higher. Later, three more magnitude 5.7 earthquakes occurred in the same source region on May 3, June 7 and June 16. Earthquake source mechanisms indicate normal faulting on SE-NW striking fault planes. The source region is located ~20 km NE of the Noatak village and ~40 km S of the Red Dog Mine. A magnitude 5.5 occurred in this area in 1981. The 1981 sequence also exhibited a swarm-like behavior over the course of 6 months.\nDetection and reporting of these earthquakes is complicated by sparseness of seismic network in NW Alaska. At the time of April 18 earthquake the nearest seismic site was located at the Red Dog Mine, with the next nearest station 350 km away. Following the May 3 event, the Alaska Earthquake Center installed two additional temporary stations, one in Noatak and another in Kotzebue, 85 km S of the source area. Overall, 450 events were reported in this sequence through end of July. The catalog magnitude of completeness with the additional stations was about ~2.2.\nWe applied waveform template matching algorithm to detect additional events in this sequence that could not be detected with the standard network processing. The template matching resulted in ~600 additional event detections. The waveform cross-correlation indicates that most of the events are not repeating sources. From the catalogued events, only 6% of event pairs have correlation coefficients of 0.75 or higher. We were able to identify only a few families of repeating events. Only one family seemed to be present throughout the entire sequence, while other event families were mostly short-lived. We find preliminary evidence that the earthquakes migrated to shallower depths throughout the sequence, consistent with the observation that most event families are short-lived.\nWe speculate that these earthquakes are concentrated in a zone of weak crust that allows intrusion of upper mantle materials, such as fluid and volatiles. Western Alaska is characterized by extensional tectonics and accommodates a distributed plate boundary between Bering micrpolate and North American plate.",

However, the Berkeley Atmospheric CO2 Observation Network (BeACON) project aims to provide a better understanding of the emissions and physical processes governing CO2 by deploying a high density of moderate-precision instruments. Here we present the first estimate of hourly urban carbon dioxide fluxes at 1 km spatial resolution in California's Bay Area using the BeACON network. The CO2 fluxes are estimated in a mesoscale inverse modeling framework using WRF-STILT and a custom state-of-the-science prior inventory. We also present a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) with synthetic observations derived from our custom 1 km inventory that resolves fine-scale CO2 fluxes such as individual highways and attempt to retrieve them using the EDGARv4.2 and VULCAN inventories, which are too coarse to resolve individual highways. These OSSEs allow us to determine the extent to which a dense network can quantify fine-scale CO2 fluxes from sources such as traffic and provide an estimate of the information content of a dense network. This will allow us to place rigorous error bounds on the CO2 fluxes from California's Bay Area and inform future greenhouse gas measurement strategies.",

Since several years of data are now available, we show CO distributions over polluted and clean regions for the period 2008-2013, and we discuss their evolution with time.\nA detailed analysis was performed to compare both datasets and we show the influence of the a priori assumptions in the retrieval process. We did a retrieval experience where the MOPITT retrieval code was run on the MOPITT dataset using the IASI a priori profile and covariance matrix. The agreement for total columns and profiles distributions is discussed, and the retrieved profiles are validated with aircraft IAGOS data.\nFinally, we will also describe how MOPITT and IASI data are routinely assimilated in the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) system (the pre-operational Copernicus Atmosphere Service of the European Union), which provides analyses and forecasts of global CO distributions.",

The topographic and subsurface properties of these features control the lateral and vertical drainage pathways of snow melt and precipitation as well as the spatial and temporal dynamics of standing water in the landscape. The Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment, NGEE-Arctic, project combines multi-scale in-situ and remote surface and subsurface observations that quantify the interactions between landscape structure, hydrology, the carbon cycle and energy balance of Arctic permafrost environments, with the aim of improving representation of Arctic ecosystem processes in global climate models. Data and models from the project show distinct relationships exist between the hydro-geomorphic features mapped on the ground and observed in remote sensing imagery, and the measured in-situ thermal, biogeochemical and ecosystem responses coincident with those features. The relationships between micro-topographic setting, snow distribution, inundation, subsurface temperature and thaw depth observed at the NGEE Barrow field sites are now well reproduced in process resolving models such as Pflotran and the Arctic Terrestrial Simulator. Current modeling efforts are investigating how topographically controlled thermal-hydrologic dynamics impact the carbon cycle. The next challenge is to scale these relationships for application in a global climate model grid cell to enable pan-Arctic predictions of future change, including the change in topography and inundation resulting from thawing permafrost and melting ground ice.

            "abstract": "We present new interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results for the Khumbu region, Nepal, using PALSAR data from the ALOS1 satellite. Glaciers and ice-debris landforms represent a critical water resource to communities in the Himalayas and other relatively arid alpine environments. Changes in climate have impacted this resource as the volume of ice decreases. The monitoring of rock glaciers and debris covered glaciers is critical to the assessment of these natural resources and associated hazards (e.g. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods--GLOFs). Satellite data provide one means to monitor ice-containing landforms over broad regions. InSAR measures the subtle deformation of the surface, with mm precision, that is related to deformation or changes in ice volume within rock glaciers and debris-covered glaciers. While previous work in the region had used C-band (6 cm wavelength) SAR data from the ERS satellite, we utilize L-band data (24 cm) from the ALOS satellite, which provides better coherence, especially where the phase gradient is large. After processing 20 differential interferograms that span from 2008 to 2011, we focus on the 5 interferograms with the best overall coherence. Based on three 45-day interferograms and two 3-year interferograms, all of which have relatively small perpendicular baselines (<260 m), we report line-of-sight surface displacement rates within the Khumbu region and calculate the down-slope surface speed of the active glaciers. From the 3-year interferograms, we map the boundary of active movement along the perimeter of the debris-covered toe of Khumbu Glacier. Movement over this longer time period leads to a loss of coherence, clearly delimiting actively moving areas. Of particular note, active movement is detected in the glacier-moraine dam of Imja Lake, which has implications for GLOF hazard. The significant vertical relief in the Himalaya region poses a challenge for doing differential radar interferometry, as artifacts in the digital elevation model (DEM) can propagate into the differential interferograms. Additionally, large changes in topography or glacier surfaces between the acquisition time of the DEM and SAR scenes can appear as artifacts. We carefully evaluate the differential phase for potential DEM artifacts and attempt to isolate these signals.",

Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the catalytic efficiency between ferrous ion (Fe2+) and base (NaOH), oxidant decomposition rates, and contaminant degradation efficiency. For the base-catalyzed H2O2-S2O82- system, oxidant release was moderate and sustained over the entire test period of 96 hours. Conversely, the oxidants were depleted within 24 hours for the Fe2+-catalyzed system. Solution pH decreased slightly for the Fe2+-catalyzed system, whereas the pH increased for the base-catalyzed system. The rates of degradation for TCE and 1,4-dioxane are compared as a function of system conditions.

            "abstract": "The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is an area characterized by limited fresh water resources, an often inefficient use of these, and relatively poor in-situ monitoring as a result of sparse meteorological observations. Enhanced satellite-based monitoring systems are needed for aiding local water resource and agricultural management activities in these data poor arid environments. A multi-sensor and multi-scale land-surface flux monitoring capacity is being implemented over parts of MENA in order to provide meaningful decision support at relevant spatiotemporal scales. The integrated modeling system uses the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model and associated flux disaggregation scheme (DisALEXI), and the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) in conjunction with model reanalysis data and remotely sensed data from polar orbiting (Landsat and MODIS; MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and geostationary (MSG; Meteosat Second Generation) satellite platforms to facilitate daily estimates of land surface fluxes down to sub-field scale (i.e. 30 m). Within this modeling system, thermal infrared satellite data provide information about the sub-surface moisture status and plant stress, obviating the need for precipitation input and error-prone soil surface characterizations.\nIn this study, the integrated ALEXI-DisALEXI-STARFM framework is applied over an irrigated agricultural region in Saudi Arabia, and the daily estimates of Landsat scale water, energy and carbon fluxes are evaluated against available flux tower observations and other independent in-situ and satellite-based records. The study addresses the challenges associated with time-continuous sub-field scale mapping of land-surface fluxes in a harsh desert environment, and looks into the optimization of model descriptions and parameterizations and meteorological forcing and vegetation inputs for application over these regions.",

            "abstract": "The continental crust and upper mantle velocity structure beneath Madagascar remained poorly constrained until recent deployments of broadband seismic instrumentation across the island. The MACOMO (MAdagascar, COmoros and MOzambique), RHUM-RUM (Réunion Hotspot and Upper Mantle - Réunions Unterer Mantel) and the Madagascar Seismic Profile experiments have opened up this region to be studied in detail for the first time. The island is an amalgamation of an Archean craton, associated with the Western Dhawar craton of southern India, and a series of Proterozoic terranes that comprise the backbone of the island (Tucker et al., 2010). A receiver-function analysis has provided both the first Moho depth measurements and spatially discrete 1-D shear velocity results that matched well with known tectonic regions. To provide a more continuous 2-D and 3-D velocity structure map, teleseismic surface wave analysis is employed. Using Helmholtz tomography as implemented by the ASWMS package (Ge, Gaherty and Hutko; 2014), we are able to map phase velocities from the cross-correlation of station pairs at periods 20–100 s. At periods 20–40 s our results compare well with ambient noise analysis results (see poster by Wysession et al. (this meeting)). The prominent features of these results are a distinct low phase-velocity sector beneath the central Itasy region, with a secondary low phase-velocity region to the north of the island. Both the central part of the island and the northern region have experienced geothermal activity in recent times as well as volcanic activity within the last 10,000 years. This may suggest that the crust and underlying mantle in these regions remains at relatively higher temperatures than the surrounding rock. Combining this information with receiver-function analysis, we jointly invert our data for the shear velocity structure. These analyses will constrain the upper mantle seismic velocities in the region, allowing further analysis from body waves to probe the transition zone and determine whether or not these low-velocity zones extend into the deep mantle.",

            "abstract": "Pore-scale imaging and modeling are becoming routine geoscience techniques of reservoir analysis and simulation in oil and gas industry. Three-dimensional printing may facilitate the transformation of pore-space imagery into rock models, which can be compared to traditional laboratory methods and literature data. Although current methodologies for rapid rock modeling and printing obscure many details of grain geometry, computed tomography data is one route to refine pore networks and experimentally test hypotheses related to rock properties, such as porosity and permeability. This study uses three-dimensional printing as a novel way of interacting with x-ray computed tomography data from reservoir core plugs based on digital modeling of pore systems in coarse-grained sandstones and limestones.\nThe advantages of using artificial rocks as a proxy are to better understand the contributions of pore system characteristics at various scales to petrophysical properties in oil and gas reservoirs. Pore radii of reservoir sandstones used in this study range from 1 to 100s of microns, whereas the pore radii for limestones vary from 0.01 to 10s of microns. The resolution of computed tomography imaging is ~10 microns; the resolution of 3D digital printing used in the study varies from 2.5 to 300 microns. For this technology to be useful, loss of pore network information must be minimized in the course of data acquisition, modeling, and production as well as verified against core-scale measurements. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a reservoir rock “photocopier” that couples 3D scanning and modeling with 3D printing to reproduce a) petrophyscially accurate copies of reservoir pore systems and b) digitally modified pore systems for testing hypotheses about reservoir flow. By allowing us to build porous media with known properties (porosity, permeability, surface area), technology will also advance our understanding of the tools used to measure these quantities (e.g. Mercury Injection or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Porosimetry). Three-dimensional printing can offer a great potential of not only improving our approach to reservoir analysis and fluid flow simulation, but also facilitating more efficient oil and gas recovery.",

            "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REE) have been identified as strategic natural resources and their demand in the United States is increasing rapidly. REE are relatively abundant in the Earth’s crust, but REE deposits with minable concentrations are uncommon. One recent study has pointed to the deep-sea REE-rich muds in the Pacific Ocean as a new potential resource, related to adsorption and concentration of REE from seawater by hydrothermal iron-oxyhydroxides and phillipsite (Kato et al., 2010). Finding new REE deposits will be facilitated by understanding global REE cycles: during the transformation of bedrock into soils, REEs are leached into natural waters and transported to oceans. At present, the mechanisms and factors controlling release, transport, and deposition of REE - the sources and sinks - at Earth’s surface remain unclear.\nHere, we systematically studied soil profiles and bedrock in seven watersheds developed on shale bedrock along a climate transect in the eastern USA, Puerto Rico and Wales to constrain the mobility and fractionation of REE during chemical weathering processes. In addition, one site on black shale (Marcellus) bedrock was included to compare behaviors of REEs in organic-rich vs. organic-poor shale end members under the same environmental conditions. Our investigation focused on: 1) the concentration of REEs in gray and black shales and the release rates of REE during shale weathering, 2) the biogeochemical and hydrological conditions (such as redox, dissolved organic carbon, and pH) that dictate the mobility and fractionation of REEs in surface and subsurface environments, and 3) the retention of dissolved REEs on soils, especially onto secondary Fe/Al oxyhydroxides and phosphate mineral phases. This systematic study sheds light on the geochemical behaviors and environmental pathways of REEs during shale weathering along a climosequence.",

            "abstract": "Unlike other natural hazards, earthquakes strike suddenly and without warning. Consequently, prevention is the best we can do to ensure safety.\nIn spite of the large and medium earthquakes, some of them tsunamigenic, that affected Portugal in the past, the Portuguese society is little aware of the seismic risk and has not developed an adequate culture of prevention. This is most probably due to the long time interval between destructive earthquakes.\nEarthquakes can be a real danger to societies, damaging human-made structures and endangering human lives. Earthquakes can trigger additional emergencies, and individuals should also be prepared to contend with it. By planning and practicing what to do if an earthquake strikes, children and their family can learn to react correctly and automatically when the shaking begins. Risks can then be dramatically lessened if the population is educated on how to react before, during and after an earthquake.\nChildren’s knowledge is ever growing. They have a fundamental role in changing societies. By educating the children of today we are forming better adults of tomorrow. We are simultaneously passing this knowledge to their caregivers and families. Through demonstrating how fundamental it is to be conscious of those issues, not only will the children will be informed, but also their relatives will be aware of such risks.\nWe use this approach to explain children how to assess risk in a broader sense. We teach them other preventive measures, namely those related with electricity, gas and the danger on non-potable water, essential topics on “what to do before an earthquake” but also on the daily routines.\nThis presentation will highlight the importance of encouraging a culture of prevention.

            "abstract": "Landsat data records of surface reflectance provide a three-decade history of land surface processes. Due to the vast number of these archived records, development of innovative approaches for automated data mining and information retrieval were necessary. Recently, we created a prototype utilizing open source software libraries for automatically generating annual Anderson Level 1 land cover maps and information products from data acquired by the Landsat Mission for the years 1984 to 2013. The automated prototype was applied to two target areas in northwestern and east-central North Dakota, USA. The approach required the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and two user-input target acquisition year-days. The Landsat archive was mined for scenes acquired within a 100-day window surrounding these target dates, and then cloud-free pixels where chosen closest to the specified target acquisition dates. The selected pixels were then composited before completing an unsupervised classification using the NLCD. Pixels unchanged in pairs of the NLCD were used for training decision tree models in an iterative process refined with model confidence measures. The decision tree models were applied to the Landsat composites to generate a yearly land cover map and related information products. Results for the target areas captured changes associated with the recent expansion of oil shale production and agriculture driven by economics and policy, such as the increase in biofuel production and reduction in Conservation Reserve Program. Changes in agriculture, grasslands, and surface water reflect the local hydrological conditions that occurred during the 29-year span. Future enhancements considered for this prototype include a web-based client, ancillary spatial datasets, trends and clustering algorithms, and the forecasting of future land cover.",

The sea anemone Bunodosoma caissarum is an endemic species in Brazil capable of bioaccumulating Hg from the ambient seawater. The radiotracer 203Hg was used in order to investigate mechanisms of Hg uptake and depuration of B. caissarum and the distribution of Hg in laboratory model systems, with and without B. caissarum. A single initial spike of 203Hg was added to each microcosm. Microcosms had continuous air renovation and trapping of Hg volatile forms. Total Hg in different compartments was measured by gamma spectrometry. In the uptake experiment 203Hg activity was determined periodically in seawater and specimens for 6 days. At the end, specimens had an average bioconcentration factor of 70. After the uptake experiment, methylmercury (MeHg) in seawater was extracted and measured by liquid scintillation. In microcosms with and without B. caissarum, respectively 0.05% and 0.32% of the initial spike was found as MeHg. Hg was probably less available for methylation in the first because of bioaccumulation and higher concentrations of suspended particulate matter that could form complexes with Hg. After that, specimens were transferred to unspiked microcosms. After a 48 day depuration specimens still retained 35 - 70% of the previously bioaccumulated Hg and 0.2 - 2.4% of the total Hg was MeHg. The presence of B. caissarum resulted in an unexpected higher volatilization of Hg (58%) compared to controls (17%). This increased volatilization is possibly a result of Hg2+ reduction mediated by microorganisms associated with its tissues and mucus secretions and/or an unknown defense mechanism of this species.",

            "abstract": "For monitoring and for improved understanding of the seismic cycle we have collected continuous deformation data close to the two most active faults in Southern California over the past few decades. Pinyon Flat Observatory (PFO) is 14 km from the Anza section of the San Jacinto fault (slip rate 10-15 mm/yr), which has not produced a large earthquake in the past 200 years; Salton City (SCS) is within 15 km of the blind section of the fault further SE. Two locations (Cholame, or CHL, and Durmid Hill, or DHL) are within three km of the San Andreas fault (SAF): CHL, at the N end of the segment that ruptured in 1857, and DHL at the S end of the segment that ruptured about 1700. All these observatories use laser strainmeters (LSM's), 400 to 700 m long, and located on the surface with endpoints anchored 25 m deep. These instruments provide unique long-term high-quality measurements of strain; in geological settings from slightly weathered granite to lake-bed clay sediments, the LSM data record secular strain accumulation consistent with continuous GPS, while covering the temporal range from seismic waves to secular changes. At periods less than a few months, the LSM noise level is far below that from fault-scale GPS networks.\nThe LSM sites near the SAF show strain-rate fluctuations over periods of months and longer of up to 20 percent of the long-term rate, and have also observed aseismic strain events lasting hours to days. At CHL these short-term signals have been observed on borehole strainmeters nearby, and there and at DHL they appear to be a few km deep. Aseismic signals observed at PFO seem to be nearer to the seismogenic zone. In most cases further interpretation has been hampered by not having similar measurements at other locations, but the existing LSM data have been used to rule out possible aseismic strains from nearby earthquake swarms (DHL) and deep tremor (CHL).\nThe LSM data and other measurements at the observatories, confirm how important patience and persistence are for learning about the Earth: only an ongoing multiyear program can capture interesting signals and properly characterize the Earth's behavior. But it is not easy to maintain such data collection over geophysically useful timescales.",

            "abstract": "Multi-anvil deformation apparatus in the synchrotron have been used conventionally by mineral physicists to understand the rheology of deep earth materials. Instead of simulating such high pressure (in the order of tens of GPa) and temperature (up to thousands of degrees) conditions, this study pioneered to investigate systematically rock deformation at low pressure (in the order of hundreds of MPa) and room temperature (~25oC) in this setting. We present new mechanical data on quartzite, as well as siltstone, under compaction. Stress and strain on individual quartz grains were resolved by analyzing the in-situ collection of X-ray beam diffracted by the rock matrix. With increasing pressures, the diffraction peaks were observed to be broadened, which has been widely observed in other compaction studies. More interestingly, peak shapes were evolved asymmetrically as pressure increased. Based on this evolution, stress distribution of quartz grain in these samples were evaluated quantitatively. Our study yielded comprehensive knowledge on mechanical behavior of quartzite and siltstone.",

            "abstract": "It is now admitted that high rate GPS observations can provide reliable surface displacement waveforms. For long-period (T > 5s) transients, it was shown that GPS and seismometer (STS-1) displacements are in agreement at least for vertical component [Houlié et al., 2011]. We propose here to supplement existing long-period seismic networks with high rate (>= 1Hz) GPS data in order to improve the resolution of global seismic velocity models. We aim at extending the use of GPS measurements beyond the range of STS-1 in the low frequency end (T>1000s). We present the results of the processing of 1Hz GPS records of the Hokkaido, Sumatra and Tohoku earthquakes (25th of September, 2003, Mw = 8.3; 26th of December, 2004, Mw = 8.9; 11th of March, 2011, Mw = 9.1, respectively). 3D waveforms phase time-series have been used to recover the ground motion histories at the GPS sites. Through the better resolution of inversion of the GPS phase observations, we determine displacement waveforms of periods ranging from 30 seconds to 1300 seconds for a selection of sites. We compare inverted GPS waveforms with STS-1 waveforms, superconducting gravity waveforms and synthetic waveforms computed using 3D global wave propagation with SPECFEM. We find that the GPS waveforms are in agreement with the SPECFEM synthetic data and are able to fill the period-gap between the broadband seismometer STS-1 data and the normal mode period range detected by the superconducting gravimeters.\n",

            "abstract": "A number of geodynamical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of the observed structure of the inner core, using either solidification texturing or deformation texturing to produce anisotropy. Our goal here is to compare quantitatively mechanisms involving deformation of the inner core and build a regime diagram giving the dominant mechanism as a function of the values of key control parameters.\nWe focus on deformation mechanisms, which can be further subdivided between natural convection (arising from unstable thermal or compositional gradients, the relevant mode being here Rayleigh-Benard type convection) and externally forced convection, with possible forcing including the effect of the core magnetic field, which can force a flow either through the direct effect of the Lorentz force (Karato, 1999; Buffett and Bloxham, 2000; Buffett and Wenk, 2001) or through heterogeneous Joule heating of the inner core (Takehiro, 2010), and viscous relaxation of a topography at the inner core boundary (ICB) associated with spatially heterogeneous inner core growth (Yoshida et al., 1996).\nTwo key parameters emerge for the inner core dynamics. The first one is the sign and strength of the density stratification, separating convective and non-convective inner core, either from a thermal or compositional point of view. The second one is the viscosity of the inner core, with published estimates ranging from $10^{11}$ to $10^{22}$ Pa.s. A meaningful comparison between the different mechanisms requires the definition of a measure of the strength of the flow, and we choose here to compare this mechanisms in terms of the instantaneous strain rate, and consider that the dominant mechanism is the one which induces the highest strain rates at a given time. Using scaling laws for all proposed mechanisms, we build regime diagrams giving the dominant mechanism as a function of control parameters and compute the predicted geometry of the flows in the different domains. Whereas the computed strain is of the order of one over the life of the inner core, most of the predicted dynamics do not induce the expected geometry.",

            "abstract": "After decades of relative stability, Jakobshavn Isbræ, a tidewater glacier in West Greenland, started to destabilize at the turn of the century. The glacier thinned, the perennial tongue disintegrated, velocities doubled, and the terminus retreated. The glacier evolved over the next several years as it showed large seasonal variations in speed and a progressive kilometer-scale retreat of its calving front. Then, during the 2012 summer, Jakobshavn set a new record when its speed increased to rates more than four times the 1990s values, and consequently became the fastest glacier recorded by satellite yet. A 2-week field study was conducted along the terminus at that time; ground portable radar interferometers (GPRI), time-lapse cameras, GPS, and a tide gauge were deployed to characterize glacier dynamics along the ice-ocean boundary. We use >10,000 interferograms recorded with the terrestrial interferometers to probe the cause of this acceleration. We observe a 33% increase in glacier speed and a 250% increase in the amplitude of response to tidal forcing during our study period. We explore how the location of the terminus along the reverse bed slope contributed to the observed speedup, and we compare our findings with the long-term record of satellite observations. Our data show that understanding tidewater glacier dynamics requires knowledge of short-term variations along glacier termini that is currently not available from satellites. This study provides insight into such short-term dynamics on spatial scales comparable to satellite InSAR but with temporal resolution similar to GPS.",

            "abstract": "Imaging and monitoring efforts along mid-ocean ridges, transform faults, and forebulges of subduction zones raise some apparently contradictory points about faulting in the oceanic lithosphere. Faults are conduits to fluid flow, but also reside within broader flow fields that extend beyond the fault planes themselves. Fault-zone properties appear to govern slip dynamics, yet seismicity and deformation also occur far off the map-trace of faults. Geologic observations of fast-spread oceanic crust exposed in seafloor escarpments and analogs in ophiolites offer some insight. (i) The upper crust — the sheeted dikes and deepest lavas — is highly altered, both within fault zones through which hydrothermal fluids flowed, but also in surrounding, low-permeability basaltic rock. (ii) The upper crust is highly fractured over areas tens-of-meters wide, despite relatively low (meters-to-tens of meters) fault displacements. (iii) Detailed structural mapping of such sections finds that fractures become more densely spaced toward fault zones, achieving a critical spacing of ~1 cm, below which the basaltic material is comminuted to breccia and gouge. (iv) Breccia and gouge also have characteristic grain sizes of ~1 cm, below which grain-size distributions steepen. (v) In experiments conducted in the Penn State Rock Mechanics Lab, altered basaltic fault rocks tended to be moderately weak and velocity strengthening. Putting i-v together paints a picture wherein gouge-filled faults indeed localize both fluid flow and stable sliding, but also reside within damage zones which host most of the active seismicity and within which penetrative fluid flow also occurs. Though these observations predominantly come from windows into subaxial processes, this damaged and altered crust is spread off axis where it is deformed and reactivated by transform and bend faults. Moreover, new faults and fractures formed off axis may well follow the same patterns of localization as subaxial faults, minus the flow of very high temperature fluids. An outstanding question, though, is how the lower gabbroic crust and upper mantle behave with respect to the upper crust, the former thought to control a great deal of transform seismicity, and the latter to be hydrated during bend faulting.",

            "abstract": "A kyanite eclogite from the ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) terrane in the North-East Greenland Caledonides was studied in order to establish a detailed metamorphic pressure–temperature (P–T) path. The peak mineral assemblage is garnet + omphacite + kyanite + phengite + rutile ± coesite. Garnets are large, up to 6 mm, and contain inclusions of phengite, quartz, clinopyroxene and rutile. A few quartz inclusions in garnet are surrounded by clinopyroxene. Rutile is common both as inclusions in garnet and a matrix mineral. Coesite has been identified in 5 samples from the UHP terrane; although no coesite has been found in the studied sample, radial fractures around quartz inclusions in garnet point to former coesite. The garnets are pyrope-rich (>38 mol %) with homogeneous cores and slightly zoned rims. Electron microprobe analysis indicates that clinopyroxene and phengite are also compositionally zoned. Symplectites composed of diopsidic clinopyroxene, plagioclase, amphibole and quartz replace omphacite. Isochemical phase equilibrium diagrams (i.e. pseudosections) have been modeled for the bulk composition of the sample and a symplectite within the system MnO-TiO2-Na2O-CaO-K2O-FeO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O-O2 using PERPLE_X. A P-X(O2) pseudosection at 800 °C indicates that the maximum pressure of the peak mineral assemblage strongly depends on the O2 content. An optimized O2 content related to 5% of the total Fe being trivalent, was thus utilized for modeling a P–T pseudosection. Intersections of garnet isopleths for core, inner rim and outer rim compositions on the P-T pseudosection show a P–T path from UHP conditions at 3.5 GPa and 740 °C to decompression at 1.9 GPa and 840 °C to 1.8 GPa, 750 °C. Pseudosections for the symplectite give conditions of 1.3 GPa and 775 °C. The equilibrium temperature for clinopyroxene inclusions in garnet is about 800 °C estimated with the garnet–clinopyroxene Fe2+–Mg exchange thermometry (Ravna 2000). Zr-in-rutile thermometer (Tomkins et al. 2007) yielded rutile crystallization temperatures around 790 °C at 3.5 GPa, with rutile inclusion temperatures slightly higher. The clockwise metamorphic P–T path is consistent with UHP metamorphism in an intracontinental subduction zone within the overriding plate of the Greenland Caledonides.",

            "abstract": "This August 2014, a 14-day expedition of the E/V NAUTILUS of the OCEAN EXPLORATION TRUST will explore the region delimited by two deep straits of the northern Caribbean, the Windward passage and the Jamaica Channel. The morphology of these straits is controlled by two transform faults: The Septentrional fault, which stretches between Cuba and Haiti (slip rate: ~13 mm/yr), and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden Fault (EPGF), which stretches between Jamaica and Haiti (slip rate: ~9 mm/yr). Together, these faults bound the Gonave microplate, an elongated platelet caught between the North America plate and Caribbean plates. The Septentrional fault ruptured in 1842, devastating the town of Cap Haitien. The EPGF ruptured catastrophically in 2010 near Port-au-Prince (death toll > 100,000). Tsunamis were associated with both earthquakes. Oblique slip on these two faults is presumably controlling the history of uplift and subsidence of the seafloor, and has therefore also been regulating the water exchanges between the north central Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea. New multibeam bathymetric and CHIRP sub-bottom profiling data will be acquired with the E/V NAUTILUS, while the ROV HERCULES will be used to collect video, water and rock samples, as well as water column physical properties.\nWe anticipate that this survey will document the following: (1) The nature of drowned carbonate platforms, which in turn may provide useful markers to assess rates of vertical deformation along the two faults. (2) The extent of major landslides detected on the steep fore reefs from existing multibeam bathymetric data. (3) Whether fluids are actively seeping along the fault traces or in association with the landslides, as has been reported elsewhere around the World. (4) If cold seeps are indeed present, to what extent their associated ecosystems are affected by the bottom currents that flow through these gateways. Altogether, the new findings should contribute to a better understanding of the natural hazards associated with two major transform faults.",

            "abstract": "An extensive investigation on tsunami generation and the resulting coastal inundation due to coseismic seabed displacements has been performed for the Cascadia Subduction Zone. We have adopted a new approach to represent coseismic seabed deformation in giant earthquakes, which avoids artefacts generated at the edges of block deformations. We represent the deformation with arbitrary shaped 4-sided polygons in which subsidences and uplifts are represented as quadratic curves. The arbitrary shapes of these polygons allow the realistic representation of the deformed seabed as a continuous surface except at the trench, where the fault breaks the surface. Experimental Design is used to select combinations of three source characteristics generating different event scenarios amongst Cascadia whole-margin ruptures; further work on other event types is in progress. Following that, the numerical model VOLNA has been run for the different scenarios, obtaining the induced tsunami waves propagation and coastal inundation. Statistical emulation has been applied to the wave elevation time series evaluations for many locations. Statistical emulators approximate expensive computer models: they are powerful tools for analyses that require many model evaluations since they can give accurate and fast probabilistic predictions. Registration and Functional Principal Components techniques are applied to the emulation process leading to further improvement in predictions. Leave-one-out diagnostics are used to validate the emulator, showing excellent agreement in predictions and model evaluations. The statistical emulation is also used for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. These two analyses require a large number of evaluations and hence cannot be carried out with the expensive computer model. Our approach can be applied to provide uncertainty estimates both in operational tsunami warnings and in tsunami risk modeling, and can be used with many different numerical models.",

The thermal noise from various microwave devices in the radar receiver tends to lower the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby masking the weaker signals.\nRecently, the compressed sensing (CS) technique has emerged as a novel signal sampling paradigm that allows perfect reconstruction of signals sampled at frequencies lower than the Nyquist rate. Many radar and remote sensing applications require efficient and rapid data acquisition. The application of CS to weather radars may allow for faster target update rates without compromising the accuracy of target information. In our previous work, we demonstrated recovery of an entire precipitation scene from its compressed-sensed version by using the matrix completion approach.\nIn this study, we characterize the performance of such a CS-based weather radar in the presence of additive noise. We use a signal model where the precipitation signals form a low-rank matrix that is corrupted with (bounded) noise. Using recent advances in algorithms for matrix completion from few noisy observations, we reconstruct the precipitation scene with reasonable accuracy. We test and demonstrate our approach using the data collected by Iowa X-band Polarimetric (XPOL) weather radars.",

Self-similarity conditions imposed due to initial and boundary conditions are also examined. Furthermore, one-parameter Lie group point scaling transformations required to physically scale the transport process without scaling the sediment material properties are identified and investigated. Preserving sediment density and diameter is believed to eliminate some of the scale errors encountered in traditional scaling methods. Under these conditions, not only are sediment diameter and density unscaled, but so too are the critical and total shear, kinematic viscosity and particle Reynolds number. The similarity of suspended sediment transport is increased through more accurate representation of suspended sediment concentration and carrying capacity of flow. The proposed method meets the needs of modelers by; maintaining the benefits found from distortion such as reduced cost, space, and model run-time; removing the need to apply scaled sediment or surrogate sediment; avoiding some of the scale effects and resulting errors of traditional flow and sediment transport scaling.",

            "abstract": "The northern Altiplano plateau of southern Peru and northern Bolivia is one of the highest topographic features on the Earth, flanked by Western and Eastern Cordillera along its margin. It has strongly influenced the local and far field lithospheric deformation since the early Miocene (Masek et al., 1994). Previous studies have emphasized the importance of both the crust and upper mantle in the evolution of Altiplano plateau (McQuarrie et al., 2005). Early tomographic and receiver function studies, south of 16° S, show significant variations in the crust and upper mantle properties in both perpendicular and along strike direction of the Altiplano plateau (Dorbath et. al., 1993; Myers et al., 1998; Beck and Zandt, 2002). In order to investigate the nature of subsurface lithospheric structure below the northern Altiplano, between 15-18° S, we have determined three-dimensional seismic tomography models for Vp and Vs using P and S-wave travel time data from two recently deployed local seismic networks of CAUGHT and PULSE. We also used data from 8 stations from the PERUSE network (PERU Subduction Experiment). Our preliminary tomographic models show a complex variation in the upper mantle velocity structure with depth, northwest and southeast of lake Titicaca. We see the following trend, at ~85 km depth, northwest of lake Titicaca: low Vp and Vs beneath the Western Cordillera, high Vs beneath the Altiplano and low Vp and Vs beneath the Eastern Cordillera. This low velocity anomaly, beneath Eastern Cordillera, seems to coincide with Kimsachata, a Holocene volcano in southern Peru. At depth greater than ~85 km: we find high velocity anomaly beneath the Western Cordillera and low Vs beneath the Altiplano. This high velocity anomaly, beneath Western Cordillera, coincides with the well-located Wadati-Benioff zone seismicity and perhaps represents the subducting Nazca slab. On the southeast of lake Titicaca, in northern Bolivia, we see a consistently high velocity anomaly that continues deeper as a westward dipping high velocity structure in the upper mantle. Our further in depth modelling and tomographic constraints on Vp/Vs would allow us to better resolve the lithospheric features that we see in our preliminary tomographic models and their possible correlations with the evolution of northern Altiplano plateau.",

            "abstract": "For the past few decades, the Long Valley caldera in California has experienced several inflation and deflation episodes leading to uplift and subsidence, respectively, of the resurgent dome. The abundance of geodetic measurements from leveling, microgravity, GPS, two-color electronic distance meter (EDM), and interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series has allowed the geodetic community to closely monitor surface deformation of the caldera. However, estimation of the source properties of the underlying magma chamber has led to a number of different models that often disagree over important features, such as chamber depth, chamber shape, influence of the south moat fault on the southern edge of the caldera, etc. These discrepancies can often be attributed to strong non-linearities of the different source models and trade-offs between various parameters. Furthermore, underestimation of the observation errors and uncertainties regarding the elastic structure can lead to biases and overconfidence of the inversion results. We address these issues by studying the 2002-2003 inflation episode due to the availability of GPS, EDM, and InSAR time series for that time period. We first use a transient detection approach that incorporates compressed sensing principles to compactly reconstruct temporally and spatially coherent transient signals for the GPS and EDM data. A similar approach is used to construct a continuous InSAR time series formed from over 200 ERS and Envisat interferograms over a 20-year time period. We compute static offsets for the 2002-2003 inflation event and perform a fully Bayesian analysis to estimate parameter values and uncertainties for various non-linear source models. Additionally, we also test a linear source model consisting of a grid of point volume-sources. By again using compressed sensing principles, we show that the linear model is largely consistent with the more compact non-linear analytical models. We use the linear model in a time-dependent fashion to characterize subtle magma migration for the 2002-2003 inflation episode using the reconstructed continuous time series for all data sets. We also extend the inversion to simultaneously estimate time-dependent aseismic slip on the south moat fault.",

            "abstract": "Although most cratons maintain stable, some exceptions are present, such as the North China craton, North Atlantic craton, and Wyoming craton, which have experienced dramatic lithospheric deformation/thinning. Mechanisms triggering cratonic thinning remains enigmatic [Lee et al., 2011]. Using a 2D thermo-mechanical coupled numerical model [Gerya and Yuen, 2007], we investigate two possible mechanisms: (1) stratification of cratonic lithospheric mantle, and (2) rheological weakening due to hydration.\nLithospheric mantle stratification is a common feature in cratonic areas which has been demonstrated by geophysical and geochemical studies [Thybo and Perchuc, 1997; Griffin et al., 2004; Romanowicz, 2009; Rychert and Shearer, 2009; Yuan and Romanowicz, 2010]. The influence of lithospheric mantle stratification during craton evolution remains poorly understood. A rheologically weak layer representing hydrated and/or metasomatized composition is implemented in the lithospheric mantle. Our results show that the weak mantle layer changes the dynamics of lithospheric extension by enhancing the deformation of the overlying mantle and crust and inhibiting deformation of the underlying mantle [Liao et al., 2013; Liao and Gerya, 2014]. Modeling results are compared with North China and North Atlantic cratons. Our work indicates that although the presence of a weak layer may not be sufficient to initiate craton deformation, it enhances deformation by lowering the required extensional plate boundary force.\nRheological weakening due to hydration is a possible mechanism triggering/enhancing craton deformation, especially for cratons jaxtaposing with a subduction, since water can release from a subducting slab. We investigate the influence of wet mantle flow laws [Hirth and Kohlstedt, 2003], in which a water parameter (i.e. constant water content) is involved. Our results show that wet dislocation alone does not accelerate cratonic deformation significantly. However, if wet diffusion creep is incorporated, combined effect of wet dislocation and wet diffusion creeps enhance lithosphere deformation dramatically. Lithospheric material drips off rapidly from the lithosphere base to asthenosphere, and thins lithosphere by ~ 40 km.",

            "abstract": "Among the most significant phenomenological theories of turbulence, two are commonly singled out: the von Karman-Prandtl logarithmic law for the mean velocity profile and the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the local structure of the turbulent velocity. These two developments have often been regarded as separate given that the log-law is an outcome of restrictive boundary effects on eddy sizes responsible for mixing, while the local structure of turbulence is associated with locally homogeneous and isotropic turbulence far from any boundary. Furthermore, these two theories have stirred significant debate with some stating that the von Karman-Prandtl law should be abandoned and replaced by a power-law when viscosity is small but finite. Here, connections are explored between spectral descriptions of turbulence and the mean velocity profile in the equilibrium layer of wall-bounded flows using a modeled budget for the co-spectral density. Employing a standard model for the wall normal velocity variance and a Rotta-like return-to-isotropy closure for the pressure-strain effects, the co-spectrum describing the momentum flux is derived. The approach establishes a relation between the von Karman, the one-dimensional Kolmogorov and the Rotta constants. Depending on the choices made about small-scale intermittency corrections and how it is introduced into the energy cascade, the logarithmic mean velocity profile or a power-law profile with an exponent that depends on the intermittency correction are derived thereby offering a new perspective on this long standing debate.",

The analysis reveals the dynamical processes that lead to the buildup of moisture to the east of the region of maximum ascent and drying to the west of it. To the east, a deep plume of ascent confined to the equatorial belt advects moisture upward from the surface toward the middle and upper troposphere while diffluence above the boundary layer acts to widen the anomalously moist region in the lower troposphere. To the west of the region of strongest ascent, equatorially-symmetric, shallow meridional circulations induce drying through anomalous descent beneath the 600 hPa layer while confluence above the boundary layer advects drier air from higher latitudes. The resulting drying is co-located with anomalous westerlies associated with forced equatorial Rossby waves. The major features that give rise to this systematic moistening and drying during the MJO cycle support the “bottom-up” evolution in vertical velocity and the characteristic “swallowtail” shape in vertical motion and precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Intentional modification of Earth’s climate by geoengineering can restore global mean temperature in climate model simulations but is expected to cause regional inequalities in temperature change and shifts in precipitation which may depend on the geoengineering method employed. In simulations of twenty-first century climate using the UKMO HadGEM2 climate model, we have assessed the effectiveness of two regional scale geoengineering methods (crop and desert albedo modification) and four large scale geoengineering methods (ocean albedo modification, marine cloud brightening by sea salt, cirrus cloud thinning and stratospheric sulphur). We projected anthropogenic emissions based on RCP4.5, applied geoengineering from 2020 to 2069 and quantified the impact on temperature and precipitation for 2040-2059 compared to a no-geoengineering control simulation. We found forcing for crop albedo modification was largely insignificant (-0.3 ± 0.3 Wm-2). Desert albedo modification had a catastrophic impact on tropical precipitation drying the Amazon, the Sahel, India and China. Of the large scale geoengineering simulations, only stratospheric sulphur and ocean albedo modification were potentially scalable to temporarily return global mean temperature to the late twentieth century climate. Cirrus cloud thinning was the only method that increased global mean precipitation (+0.7%) while in other respects the four methods were remarkable in the consistency of their precipitation response to geoengineering compared to the control simulation (Figure 1). Over land, precipitation reduced less (between -0.5% and +1.8%) than global precipitation (between -3.8% and +0.7%). A northward shift in tropical precipitation over the Atlantic and eastern Pacific was found for all four methods, likely driven by cloud rapid adjustments and changes in atmospheric circulation. After geoengineering, during 2080-2099, significant differences in maritime tropical precipitation persisted despite regional precipitation elsewhere being generally within a 95% confidence interval of the control. We conclude that delivering equitable and predictable changes in tropical precipitation is currently the greatest climate related challenge for geoengineering.",

            "abstract": "Reconstructions of the flow in Earth's outer core, based on surface magnetic data, suggest\nthe existence of decadal accelerations in its mean zonal component. The presence of these zonal\naccelerations is confirmed by oscillations observed in the length-of-day, reflecting the\naccelerations' role in core-mantle angular momentum exchange. While they were once believed to\nrepresent the free modes of torsional oscillations, recent investigations show that zonal\naccelerations should have periods shorter than 10 years. Our understanding of which mechanisms are\nresponsible for creating and controlling decadal zonal accelerations is, therefore, incomplete.\nTo address this problem we construct a two-dimensional model of the dynamics in the fluid\ncore, with flows driven by thermal convection and coupled to a background magnetic field. Our\nquasi-geostrophic approach is justified by the Taylor-Proudman theorem, which states that a rapidly\nrotating fluid shows little variation parallel to its rotation axis. Using two spatial dimensions,\nas opposed to three, allows us to reach higher resolutions and more realistic parameters with\ncomparable computational power.\nWe find that the convective dynamics in our model are capable of producing mean zonal\nflows with characteristics similar to those inferred from geomagnetic reconstructions. We quantify\nthe contribution of each term in the force balance to address how zonal accelerations are driven in\nour model and, from this, extrapolate our results to conditions in Earth's core.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the application, as well as limitations, of interferometric redatuming to low frequency earthquake templates (LFEs) in northern Cascadia. This approach has the potential of effectively removing the distorting effects of shallow structure and providing more detailed images of the subduction zone structure. We first develop an alternate formulation for redatuming in elastic media where the interferometric integral is decomposed into compressional and shear components. We next test the redatuming approach with synthetic LFE P-waveforms to obtain virtual zero-offset and common offset seismic sections along the plate boundary. We then apply redatuming to observed P-wavetrains from reprocessed and relocated LFE templates that occur beneath a linear subset of stations in northern Cascadia. The effect of the reprocessing is to slightly increase the frequency content and provide better temporal resolution of the extracted LFE waveforms. Although the stations have an average spacing of 7.5 km, the spacing is irregular and multi-step auto-regressive reconstruction is applied to regularize and stabilize the redatuming by interpolating the data onto a denser grid. There are also complications due to the radiation patterns of the direct and scattered waveforms. Since scattered S-to-P wave amplitudes are significant over a restricted range of azimuth and distance, windowing is applied to enhance these arrivals when applying the redatuming. Although the redatuming results are generally consistent with the previous waveform modeling that placed the templates near the top of the Juan de Fuca plate, the increased frequency content and interpolation of the data allows for the identification of upward scattered S-to-P arrivals in several templates indicating that at least a subset of LFEs are occurring within a low velocity zone inferred to be upper oceanic crust of the subducting plate.",

The model is explicitly spatial, with a covariance structure that incorporates the effects of coastline geometry, and is resolved at impacts-relevant, 50-mile coastal increments. The model is based on a negative binomial regression on the phase of the Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, and also accounts explicitly for the time-dependent uncertainty in the historical data used to fit it. The statistically-inferred climatology is interpreted in terms of current scientific understanding of the mechanisms through which related large-scale climatic variability affects the development and motion of Atlantic tropical cyclones. We also probe the spatial posterior probability distribution to quantify and rank the uncertainty in the climatology of TC landfalls that can be attributed to climatic variability, model parameter uncertainty, uncertainty in the historical landfall positions, a possible undercount bias early in the historical record, and sampling variability from the finite length of the observations. Given more detailed, expert information about uncertainty for each specific storm in the historical dataset, the model could be used to develop a definitive TC landfall climatology. It could also be used in conjunction with spatial information about exposures for risk management applications.",

WISPR, with a 95° radial by 58° transverse field of view, will image the fine-scale structure with arcminute-scale resolution. The dependency of the Thomson scattering on the imaging geometry (distance and angle from the Sun) dictates that WISPR will be very sensitive to the emission from plasma close to the spacecraft, in contrast to the situation for imaging from Earth orbit. Thus WISPR will be the first ‘local’ imager providing a crucial link between the large-scale corona and SPP’s in-situ measurements. The high speed at perihelion will provide tomographic-like views of coronal structures. To prepare for this unprecedented viewing of the structure of the inner corona, we are creating synthetic white light images and animations from the WISPR viewpoint using the white-light ray-tracing package developed at NRL (available through SolarSoft). We will present results from multi-strand models of coronal streamers and currents sheets as well as images of coronal mass ejections as seen simultaneously from Earth, Solar Orbiter and SPP.",

            "abstract": "Observations and regional climate modeling (RCM) studies demonstrate that global climate models (GCMs) are unreliable for predicting changes in extreme precipitation. Yet RCM climate change simulations are subject to boundary conditions provided by GCMs and do not interact with large-scale dynamical feedbacks that may be critical to the overall regional response. Limitations of both global and regional modeling approaches contribute significant uncertainty to future rainfall projections. Progress requires a modeling framework capable of capturing the observed regional-scale variability of rainfall intensity without sacrificing planetary scales. Here the US summer rainfall response to quadrupled CO2 climate change is investigated using conventional (CAM) and superparameterized (SPCAM) versions of the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model. The superparameterization approach, in which cloud-resolving model arrays are embedded in GCM grid columns, improves rainfall statistics and convective variability in global simulations. A set of 5 year time-slice simulations, with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice boundary conditions harvested from preindustrial and abrupt four times CO2 coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM/CAM) simulations, are compared for CAM and SPCAM. The two models produce very different changes in mean precipitation patterns, which develop from differences in large-scale circulation anomalies associated with the planetary-scale response to warming. CAM shows a small decrease in overall rainfall intensity, with an increased contribution from the weaker parameterized convection and a decrease from large-scale precipitation. SPCAM has the opposite response, a significant shift in rainfall occurrence toward higher precipitation rates including more intense propagating Central US mesoscale convective systems in a four times CO2 climate.",

Remote sensing and in situ observations have revealed that much of Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss has been synchronous with a temperature increase of the relatively warm subsurface waters of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean that circulate around the island’s continental shelf. At key locations, these warm waters cross the continental shelf and are able to reach fjords with outlet tidewater glaciers terminating in direct contact with the ocean. The existence of these warm waters in fjords with shrinking outlet glaciers has been previously documented at several locations around Greenland. Here we use oceanographic data collected in August 2012 and 2013 to show for the first time the existence and distribution of these warm waters throughout Uummannaq Fjord, a major fjord complex in West Greenland. The distribution of these warm waters in conjunction with estimates of ocean circulation and new ocean seafloor measurements reveals the set of glaciers that are likely venerable to enhanced submarine melting in a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "We present results of recent fieldwork related to the Húsavík-Flatey Fault (HFF), a ~100 km dextral fault on the southern boundary of the Tjörnes Fracture Zone in North Iceland through which the Kolbinskey spreading ridge is connected with Iceland's Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ). High-angle rift-transform junctions are rarely exposed on land, and tectonic studies of them are relatively rare (e.g. Mouslopoulou, et. al., 2007) – accordingly, the HFF provides an excellent field laboratory for the study of strike-slip terminations and oblique tectonics in general. The 20 km long onshore section of the fault is deflected by ~15° driving transtensional deformation and these segments display complex kinematics as the ~6.8 mm/yr of dextral motion, estimated from GPS measurements (Metzger, et al., 2012) interacts with the ~20 mm/yr extension of the Northern Rift Zone. Structural mapping of the on land section suggests a pattern of oblique deformation which gradually transforms a significant portion of the strike-slip into dip-slip motion as the fault moves closer to the NVZ. Although bedrock exposures are rare, due to glacial and tectonic erosion, the “Arctic desert” environment preserves Holocene-age deformation signals in geomorphology and soil profiles. Deflected drainages and soft-sediment deformations provide insight on kinematics and offset tephras and lavas provide Quaternary to mid-Holocene vertical slip-rate estimates on some structures in the fault zone. Preliminary results of paleoseismic trenching in a small basin on the western on land segment show evidence of multiple earthquakes, in a sequence that extends at least to the earliest Holocene. The established tephrachronology in the region is primarily used for chronology and we will perform Geotek MSCL on the trench walls. These records will also be correlated with sediment cores taken from Botsvatn (Lake), located only 1.5 km from the trench site.",

Thanks to its high spatiotemporal coverage along with its radiometric stability, IASI provides a unique dataset of vertically-resolved profiles for investigating global distributions, time series and climatology.\nWe analyze the time development of O3 by fitting constant, annual and semi-annual terms, solar flux and quasi biennial oscillation proxies to the IASI time series on a large spatial scale (20-degree latitudinal bands), separately in different layers over the stratosphere and the troposphere which help to distinguish the chemical and dynamical contributions to the O3 total columns variations. Based on the fitting procedure, the ozone time development estimation (“trends”) is also derived. Despite the short time period of available IASI dataset, statistically significant trends are measured in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. Significant positive trends are obtained in the upper stratosphere, in particular over the highest latitudes, which potentially point out a turnaround for stratospheric O3 recovery, and significant negative trends are observed over the mid-and high northern latitudes during summer which is possibly linked to the decreasing ozone precursor emissions. More specifically, ozone trends are also estimated in the troposphere on a regional scale over and downwind anthropogenic polluted areas. Finally, the influence of the stratosphere on the tropospheric variability as seen from IASI is also evaluated using simulations from global 3-D chemical transport models.",

Wetlands often link ground and surface-waters, making them strategic systems for potentially limiting migration of uranium contamination. Little is known about how drought periods that result in the drying of wetland soils, and consequent redox changes, affect uranium fate and transport in wetlands. In order to better understand the fate and stability of immobilized uranium in wetland soils, and how dry periods affect the uranium stability, we dosed saturated wetland mesocosms planted with Scirpus acutus with low levels of uranyl-acetate for 5 months before imposing a 9-day drying period followed by a 13-day rewetting period. Concentrations of uranium in mesocosm effluent increased after rewetting, but the cumulative amount of uranium released in the 13 days following the drying constituted less than 1% of the uranium immobilized in the soil during the 5 months prior to the drought. This low level of remobilization suggests that the uranium immobilized in these soils was not primarily bioreduced U(IV), which could have been oxidized to soluble U(VI) during the drought and released in the effluent during the subsequent flood. XANES analyses confirm that most of the uranium immobilized in the mesocosms was U(VI) sorbed to iron oxides. Compared to mesocosms that did not experience drying or rewetting, mesocosms that were sacrificed immediately after drying and after 13 days of rewetting had less uranium in soil near roots and more uranium on root surfaces. Metal-reducing bacteria only dominated the bacterial community after 13 days of rewetting and not immediately after drying, indicating that these bacteria are not responsible for this redistribution of uranium after the drying and rewetting. Results show that short periods of drought conditions in a wetland may impact uranium distribution, but these conditions may not cause large losses of immobilized uranium from the wetland.",

Here we infer the existence of a plastically deforming bed beneath Hofsjökull, a temperate ice cap in central Iceland, using numerical ice flow models constrained by surface velocity observations. Basal plasticity is evident by the independence of basal shear stress and basal slip rate, both of which we inferred using higher-order flow models in the Ice Sheet Systems Model (ISSM). We derived seasonal surface velocity fields from airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data collected with NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) in winter and during the early melt season. Using velocity fields from different seasons and applying a simple plastic model for basal stress, we present estimates of surface-melt-driven changes in basal water pressure that correspond to observed variations in surface velocity. Our data and an idealized basal slip model show that the sensitivity of basal slip to basal water pressure variability scales as the inverse of the ice surface slope, making glaciers with shallow surface slopes more sensitive to basal water pressure fluctuations than steep-sloped glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Pandora spectrometer measurements are compared to other remotely sensed and in-situ NO2 measurements in the Houston, TX region during the third deployment of the DISCOVER-AQ campaign in September 2013. The network of freeways, petrochemical facilities, and related industries contribute to an ongoing pollution problem in the Houston region with the direct emissions of NOx and VOCs producing secondary pollutants such as ozone and PM2.5. The goal of this work is to determine how the Pandora spectrometer column measurements of NO2 compare to in-situ derived and other remotely sensed columns, as well as with ground measurements during this deployment of DISCOVER-AQ. UC Berkeley’s LIF measurements of NO2 aboard the NASA P-3B at each spiral site are used to create the aircraft derived profiles of NO2. The aircraft measured profiles include upwind, source, and receptor sites in the region, three times a day, at eight different locations. In addition, we investigate how the NO2 profile shape changes both spatially and temporally, with a focus on the difference between the boundary layer and free troposphere distributions. Pandora measurements are also compared to column measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and ACAM aboard the B200 aircraft. Where available, surface measurements are included to supplement aircraft profiles and are correlated to the Pandora column measurements to determine the relationship between the total NO2 column and ground concentrations. Understanding of how these measurements compare spatially and temporally will aid both future Pandora deployments and satellite retrievals.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate and quantify the effects of desorption kinetics and colloid transport on radionuclides with different sorption affinities. We focused on quantifying transport mechanisms important for upscaling in time and distance. This will help determine the long-term fate and transport of radionuclides to aid in risk assessments. We selected a fractured/weathered granodiorite at the Grimsel Test Site (GTS) in Switzerland as a model crystalline rock repository system because the system has been thoroughly studied and field experiments involving radionuclides have already been conducted. Working on this system provides a unique opportunity to compare lab experiments with field-scale observations.\nWeathered fracture fill material (FFM) and bentonite used as backfill at the GTS were characterized (e.g., BET, SEM/EDS, QXRD), and batch and breakthrough column experiments were conducted. Solutions were prepared in synthetic groundwaters that matched the natural water chemistry. FFM samples were crushed, rinsed, sieved (150-355 µm), and equilibrated with synthetic groundwater. Bentonite was crushed, sodium-saturated, equilibrated with synthetic groundwater, and settled to yield a stable suspension. Suspensions were equilibrated with Am, Cs, or Pu. All experiments were conducted with Teflon®materials to limit sorption to system components. After radionuclide/colloid injections reached stability, radionuclide-free solutions were injected to observe the desorption and release behavior.\nAliquots of effluent were measured for pH, colloid concentration, and total and dissolved radionuclides. Unanalyzed effluent from the first column was then injected through a second column of fresh material. The process was repeated for a third column and the results of all three breakthrough curves were modeled with a multi-site/multi-rate MATLAB code to elucidate the sorption rate coefficients and binding site densities of the bentonite colloids and fracture fill material. Nearly 50% of the sorbed Am was exchanged from the colloids to the fracture filling material in each of the three columns; whereas, less Cs and Pu was desorbed with each pass through a new column. Using a two-site kinetic model allowed for interrogation of desorption rates and dominant transport parameters.",

The temporal variability of inputs (e.g. precipitation) and internal redistribution (e.g. groundwater flow) and dynamics (e.g. microbial communities) make predicating these fluxes challenging. Complex terrain can provide a laboratory for improving understanding of the spatial patterns, temporal dynamics, and drivers of trace gas flux rates, requisite to constraining current GHG budgets and future scenarios. Our research builds on previous carbon cycle research at the USFS Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, Little Belt Mountains, Montana that highlighted the relationships between landscape position and seasonal CO2 efflux, induced by the topographic redistribution of water. Spatial patterns and landscape scale mediation of CH4 fluxes in seasonally aerobic soils have not yet been elucidated. We measured soil methane concentrations and fluxes across a full range of landscape positions, leveraging topographic and seasonal gradients, to examine the relationships between environmental variables, hydrologic dynamics, and CH4 production and consumption. We determined that a threshold of ~30% VWC distinguished the direction of flux at individual time points, with the riparian area and uplands having distinct source/sink characteristics respectively. Riparian locations were either strong sources or fluctuated between sink and source behavior, resulting in near neutral seasonal flux. Upland sites however, exhibited significant relationships between sink strength and topographic/energy balance indices. Our results highlight spatial and temporal coherence to landscape scale heterogeneity of CH4 dynamics that can improve estimates of landscape scale CH4 balances and sensitivity to change.",

This study proposes an appropriate treatment for inland glaciers as systems in dynamic equilibrium that stay constant under a static climate condition. It is supposed that the snow/ice vertical movement from high elevation areas to valleys (lower elevation areas) by means of wind re-distribution, avalanches, and glaciation, may be considered as an equilibrator of the glacier system because it stimulates snow/ice ablation. The implicit physically-based modeling of such a dynamic equilibrium snow system is introduced and discussed for the long-term snow simulation at a regional scale. The developed model has been coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to compute the snow surface energy balance.",

            "abstract": "As high-resolution topographic data become increasingly available, comparison of multitemporal and disparate datasets (e.g. airborne and terrestrial lidar) enable high-accuracy quantification of landscape change and detailed mapping of surface processes. However, if these data are not properly managed and aligned with maximum precision, results may be spurious. Often this is due to slight differences in coordinate systems that require complex geographic transformations and systematic error that is difficult to diagnose and correct. Here we present an analysis of four airborne and three terrestrial lidar datasets collected between 2003 and 2014 that we use to quantify change at an active earthflow in Mill Gulch, Sonoma County, California. We first identify and address systematic error internal to each dataset, such as registration offset between flight lines or scan positions. We then use a variant of an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to align point cloud data by maximizing use of stable portions of the landscape with minimal internal error. Using products derived from the aligned point clouds, we make our geomorphic analyses. These methods may be especially useful for change detection analyses in which accurate georeferencing is unavailable, as is often the case with some terrestrial lidar or “structure from motion” data. Our results show that the Mill Gulch earthflow has been active throughout the study period. We see continuous downslope flow, ongoing incorporation of new hillslope material into the flow, sediment loss from hillslopes, episodic fluvial erosion of the earthflow toe, and an indication of increased activity during periods of high precipitation.",

ComMIT is a desktop application providing a powerful and fully functional, yet easy-to use graphical user interface to the NCTR-developed MOST tsunami forecasting model. ComMIT is a self-contained downloadable application available from NCTR for use by qualified and novice modelers alike. We have recently added functionality that allows ComMIT to retrieve the prefered model solution for tsunami events from the Tweb Web Service. A ComMIT user with access to high resolution coastal bathymetry can generate detailed inundation models for real or synthetic events for their areas of interest. Then with the push of a button, the ComMIT user can upload their model results to Tweb where a community of tsunami modelers and forecasters can see these model results displayed in Tweb, along with other operational and contributed inundation forecast models. Besides the crowdsourcing aspect of tsunami modeling that will allow tsunami forecasters to get inundation model inputs from areas they normally would not consider, these contributed flooding models could provide forecasters with an early model solution verification capability by allowing model result comparisons with local tide gauge data in areas where operational models have not been developed. In addition, with the proper training this tool is very useful for education and as a vehicle for community tsunami hazard assessment. We will illustrate the model solution and results interchange capabilities now possible with these two applications.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter(DOM) fluxes from terrestrial to marine environments have increased as a result of anthropogenic activities and climate change, and DOM is known to facilitate the transport of both metals and trace organics. The nature and composition of DOM may influence its binding properties to metals and thus affect their mobility and fate in aquatic environments. Humic substances make up the majority of DOM in many aquatic ecosystems. Metals such as Fe and Cu are not only important as nutrients in aquatic systems, but also in controlling biogeochemical and ecotoxicological processes respectively. Thus, gaining a better understanding on the interaction of humic substances with Fe or Cu is important in the assessment of the bioavailability of such metals in aquatic systems.\nIn this study, the binding processes of two different DOM samples (Suwanee River humic acid, SRHA and Nordic Lake fulvic acid, NLFA)with Fe(III) and Cu(II) were examined. With the assistance of excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEM) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), three humic-like components (C1, C2 and C4), and one microbial humic-like component (C3), were identified in the characterization of the samples. The quenching rates of C2 and C4 fluorescence in the presence of Cu were similar, which were slightly faster than that forC1. In contrast, the C3 fluorescence was significantly less affected by the addition of metals. In the presence of Fe, the most significant quenching was also observed for C2, and the behavior of C4 fluorescence was dependent on the pH value. Some differences in the fluorescence quenching were also observed between the two humic acid standards (one more higher-plant/terrestrially derived vs. the other more microbial/aquatic derived). In addition, pH had a significant effect on the metal binding with significantly lower quenching at lower pH values. Some variations where observed for the higher pH conditions particularly for Cu(II). A modified version of the Ryan-Weber model was used to calculate conditional stability constants (KM) and the complex capacity (CL). Effects of metal type, DOM type and pH on the fluorescence quenching are discussed.",

Amongst the most noticeable fractures are tensile fractures occurring in the outer hinges of the fold crest and shear fractures in the bottom of fold hinge zones. These fractures are well explained and understood by the extensional and compressional strain/stress pattern in the fold hinge. However, tensile fractures parallel to the fold axis, tensile fractures cutting through the limb, normal faults on the fold hinge, and shear fractures of different orientations in the fold limb cannot intuitively be linked to the stress regime occurring during the buckling process.\nThis study utilizes a 2D and 3D finite element modeling approach using Maxwell visco-elastic rheology to study the stress conditions during single and multilayer buckling for each fracture set to occur. The numerical simulations include sensitivity analyses on material parameters such as permeability, viscosity and overburden thickness. For fracture sets not likely to occur during the buckling process pre- and post folding processes such as initial overpressure, extensional unfolding, and erosional unloading are studied.",

We used a dual-etalon Fabry-Perot spectrometer with a resolving power of 200,000 to measure the line widths and radial velocity Doppler shifts of the sodium D2 (5889.951 Å) and potassium D1 (7698.965 Å) emission lines. Data were taken during the full moon periods from November 2013 through May 2014 with the exception of March 2014. The instrument’s Field of View (FOV) of 3 arcmin (~360 km) was positioned at several locations, centered at 1.5 arcmin, off the East and West limbs. The deconvolved line widths indicate sodium temperatures pre- and post- magnetotail passage are on the order of 1600 K while temperatures during passage through the magnetotail are on the order of a several thousand Kelvin. Unlike sodium, the potassium deconvolved line widths indicate pre-magnetotail passage several hundred degrees hotter than the post-magnetotail passage temperatures. Additionally, both sodium and potassium intensities were brighter after magnetotail passage than before.

However, direct evidence of the existence of the giant Recovery lakes has until recently been limited to ground-based radar measurements during IPY, showing that the lakes A and B were not distinct lakes at the time of the measurement (January, 2009) and may have drained recently. In order to fill the significant data gap over the Recovery catchment identified by the BEDMAP2 project, over 29,000 line km of new radio-echo sounding, laser altimetry, gravity and magnetic data were acquired using a British Antarctic Survey Twin Otter during the IceGRAV 2012-13 field season. Here, we present a subset of this Recovery Frontier dataset in the vicinity of the giant Recovery lakes A and B to assess their current conditions. Bed reflectivity derived for a range of englacial attenuation rates indicates that the lake surface has larger reflectivity than the adjacent grounded areas, by more than 10 dB. Bed reflectivity varies little over short distances (< 1 km), both around the lakes and adjacent areas. Hydraulic potential varies little over the lakes as well as their downstream sides but increases in the upstream directions. These recent characteristics are clearly distinct from the previous ground-based measurements taken in 2009. We hypothesize that these differences indicate that lakes A and B may be filling. The existence of a major active hydrological system in the interior of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet could influence ice streaming also further downstream, where smaller-scale active lake systems have been inferred.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) play an important role in atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemical cycles. It is known that tropical forests are the biggest source of the dominant BVOCs (i.e. isoprene and monoterpenes) emitted to the atmosphere. Nevertheless, Amazonian rainforest, the world’s largest tropical rainforest, has been poorly explored for isoprene and monoterpene emissions. Recently (June and July 2014), we deployed a PTR-TOF-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction – Time of Flight – Mass Spectrometer) to quantify isoprene and monoterpene emissions using the eddy covariance flux method at the FLONA Tapajos (Floresta Nacional do Tapajos; Tapajos National Forest) in the eastern central Amazon rainforest, Santarem-PA, Brazil. The sample inlet and a 3D-sonic anemometer were located above the forest canopy (~65m), and the air was sampled through a long Teflon tube (100m) with high flow rate (40L/min) to the PTR-TOF-MS. From preliminary results for the first 3 days, concentrations and fluxes of m/z 69 (isoprene; C5H8-H+) and m/z 137 (total monoterpenes; C10H16-H+) showed a clear circadian cycle (high during daytime and low at nighttime), suggesting the emissions of these compounds are light and temperature dependent. Our study provides the first PTR-TOF-MS flux observations of isoprene and total monoterpenes at the Flona Tapajos. Moreover, since there are variations on the emissions, when comparing different environments of the huge Amazon basin, these results from eastern central Amazonia will contribute to improving regional and global BVOC emission model estimates.",

            "abstract": "Due to the non-linear nature of ozone production in the troposphere, ozone (O3) production as a function of aviation NOx emissions varies based on the background NOx and VOCs levels. Of the several sources of NOx in the atmosphere, NOx from lightning contributes a substantial amount of NOx to the upper troposphere and has an effect on the ozone production efficiency. In this study, CAM5, the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) was used to study the effect of lightning NOx (LNOx) on the production of O3 in the background atmosphere and on the production of aviation NOx-induced O3 for the year 2006. Currently, there is wide range of uncertainty in aviation NOx-induced effects on O3 among the models. This study shows that one major contributor to this uncertainty is the amount of NOx emissions from lightning. Three simulations were run with varying LNOx values of 3.7, 5.0, and 7.4 TgN/yr. Results show that due to the different background concentrations of NOx and VOCs near the surface nd at cruise altitudes where majority of aircraft fly, varying LNOx impacts the production of the global mean O3 in the background atmosphere and the aviation NOx-induced O3 differently. Increasing LNOx results in an increase in the global mean background O3 production and a stronger decrease in the aviation NOx-induced O3 production due to the low NOx and high VOCs conditions at most attitudes and high NOx and low VOCs conditions at cruise altitudes. By increasing LNOx emissions from 3.7 to 7.4 TgN/yr the global mean O3 production increases from 0.33 to 0.36 Pg (~10% increase) whereas the aviation-induced ozone production decreases from 8.8 to 7.2 Tg (~20% decrease). Similarly, the aviation-induced O3 RF decreases from 43.9 mW/m2 for the 3.7 TgN/yr case to 34.3 mW/m2 for 7.4 TgN/yr case. These results should aid the intercomparions of aviation NOx-induced effects between different models in light of differences in their amounts of NOx emissions from lightning.",

            "abstract": "Aside from nutrients and water, the main factor determining whether a given microbial population increases, decreases or stays the same size is the amount of energy that is available to the community and the rate at which it is delivered, the power supply. The power supply characterizing an environment - the Gibbs energy of catabolic reactions multiplied by the rate of reactants supply - is relatively straightforward to determine. However, the power required to synthesize biomolecules needed for growth is not only a function of the temperature, pressure and composition of the environment where it is happening, but also the actual amount of biomass needed to make a new cell. The purpose of this presentation is to quantify the cost of synthesizing biomass under different environmental conditions for differently sized microbial cells.\nIn particular, we will show that the amount of energy required for anabolism is strongly dependent on the average nominal oxidation state of carbon, NOSC, in the compounds that are used for anabolism and the oxidation state of the environment where growth is occurring. For instance, the energy required to synthesize glycine (NOSC = +1) from CO2 (NOSC = +4 under relatively oxic conditions, log aH2 = -9, is +87 kJ (mol glycine)-1, whereas under more reducing conditions, log aH2 = -4, it’s only + 1.8 kJ (mol glycine)-1. If instead acetate (NOSC = 0) is used as the carbon source for glycine anabolism, it’s exergonic to synthesize glycine throughout a very broad range of redox states (from O2 saturated water to log aO2 = -45).\nFurthermore, and unlike earlier efforts, the amount of energy required to make microbial cells is corrected for their variable sizes. Based on a literature survey, the mass of carbon in Archaeal and Bacterial cells ranges by at least a factor of 17. Similarly, of the ~3100 complete Bacterial genomes that have been sequenced and reported on the Nation Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI, website, the number of base pairs per genome varies by a factor of 138.\nTaken together, the number of cells that can be synthesized by a joule of energy can vary by several orders of magnitude depending on the environmental conditions and the size of the cells being made.",

            "abstract": "The movement of contaminant plumes in underground aquifers is highly dependent on many hydrogeological parameters. We model the transport with an advection, diffusion, reaction system requiring the specification of porosity, flow direction, flow speed, dispersivities, and effects of geochemical reactions. It is often prohibitively expensive or impossible to make accurate and reliable measurements of these parameters in the field. It is also difficult to know the position and shape of a contaminant plume at a given time or the exact details of the source of the contamination, e.g. size, location, origin time, and magnitude. If decisions are to be made regarding contaminant remediation strategies or predictions of future contaminant concentrations in and near water-supply wells, then these uncertain hydrogeological and source parameters need to be analyzed and estimated. We utilize a measure-theoretic framework to formulate and solve the physics-based stochastic inverse problem to quantify the uncertainty for these parameters.\nWe solve the model using both analytical and finite element solutions. We define quantities of interest (QoI) for the groundwater contaminant problem in terms of observable field measurements. We develop adjoint problems to compute accurate and reliable a posteriori error estimates of the QoIs. The adjoint solutions are also useful in the solution of the inverse problem. The measure-theoretic formulation and solution of the inverse problem and modeling framework define a solution as a probability measure on the parameter domain. In the typical case where the number of output quantities is less than the number of parameters, the inverse of the map from parameters to data defines a type of generalized contour map where the geometry plays a pivotal role in determining an optimal set of QoI. We determine and analyze solutions for geometrically distinct QoI defining reduced-dimension set-valued inverses for this measure-theoretic inverse framework.",

            "abstract": "The Mendocino triple junction contains a diversity of fault types including plate boundary strike-slip and thrust faults as well as intraplate faults within the subducting oceanic mantle that are expected to operate under significantly different rheological conditions. We analyze the data from the Cascadia Initiative’s Year-2 focused OBS array deployed at the triple junction region. We detect over 1000 earthquakes with magnitude ranging from 1 to 4.5 from Sep 2012 to Feb 2013. Locations refined with waveform cross-correlation arrival time measurements delineate two sub-parallel faults trending NW-SE revealing the complex geometry of the triple junction, as well as a intraplate fault possibly related to the 2010 M6.5 earthquake in the subducted Gorda plate. We are performing a joint inversion for 3D structure and hypocenter locations to further refine the image of the triple junction fault systems.\nOur primary focus is on examining earthquake rupture mechanics in this complex fault network. Strength envelope calculations predict that the faults within the subducting Gorda plate support differential stress levels that are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than what is typically assumed for the thrust interface. To determine if this contrast is reflected in the data, we estimate apparent stress for the M>2 earthquakes on the three types of faults. We compute displacement spectra using 2.56s time window from the picked arrival. Spectra with signal-to-noise ratio > 3 between 4 to 10 Hz are saved for further analysis. For the saved spectra, we apply two approaches using EGF method: (1) single event-pair deconvolution, where we select best-similar event pairs using relative locations derived from waveform cross-correlation, (2) iterative stacking deconvolution, where we solve for a event term, a station term and a path term using all the event-station pairs. Once the target event source spectrum is obtained, we compute the stress drop and apparent stress using the generalized “Boatwright” source model. The event durations will be independently measured from time-domain deconvolution using best-similar event pairs. We observe generally lower stress drops for earthquakes near the plate boundary and higher stress drops inside the Gorda plate, which is consistent with the expectation from fault strength profiles.",

            "abstract": "The interplay between aerosol particles and water droplets in the atmosphere, especially in clouds, influences both aerosol and cloud properties. The major uncertainty in our understanding of climate arises in the indirect effect of aerosol and their ability to impact cloud formation and consequently alter the global radiative balance. The collision between a water droplet and aerosol particles that results in coalescence is termed “collection” or “coagulation”. Coagulation can lead to aerosol removal from the atmosphere or induce ice nucleation via contact freezing. There is a theoretical collection efficiency minimum of particles with diameter between 0.1-2 µm, called the “Greenfield Gap”. Experimental effort, however, was limited to drizzle and rain drops until recently, and has not constrained parameters that describe particle collection efficiency by cloud droplets. Collection efficiency is also an important parameter for assessing contact freezing, the least known ice nucleation mechanism today. Experimentally assessing collection efficiency can prove the existence of the “Greenfield Gap” and lay the foundation for studying contact freezing.\nWe recently constructed the MIT-Contact Freezing Chamber (MIT-CFC) to study coagulation experimentally. A stream of 40 µm cloud droplets fall freely into the chamber and collide with aerosol particles with known size and concentration. The outflow goes through a series of dryers before entering the Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry (PALMS) instrument for chemical composition analysis. PALMS is a true single-particle instrument and gives information on the size and the chemical composition of each particle. Coagulated particles from the MIT-CFC have mass spectral signatures of both the aerosol particles and the droplet residuals, while the droplet residual contains no signature of the aerosol particles. To our knowledge, this is the first time coagulation has been seen on a single-particle basis. We will present the collection efficiency data by the 40 µm droplets of polystyrene latex spheres (PSLs) with well-defined sizes (50-950 nm) and concentrations (10-100 #/cc) under atmospherically relevant temperatures and relative humidity conditions.

            "abstract": "Increases in greenhouse gas concentrations through the 21st century are projected to increase global temperatures and change circulation and precipitation patterns globally. However, there remain many uncertainties in how the general circulation of the atmosphere will change and how it will impact regional hydroclimates. In the low and middle latitudes the isotopic composition (δ) of atmospheric moisture could potentially be useful at tracing these changes in precipitation and wind patterns. In this study sea surface temperatures and sea ice conditions from 21st century climate projections (RCP8.5 scenario) were used to force the isotope-enabled Global Spectral Model (IsoGSM). This ensemble of IsoGSM simulations provides insight as to how and where water isotopologues will change globally as a result of 21st century climate change. In general, δ values increase in the subtropics and middle latitudes and decrease in the southern tropics. Changes to horizontal winds suggest that the isotopic changes are likely due to changes in the strength of the Hadley Cell, rather than the poleward expansion of the descending branch of the cells. Regionally, the simulations project consistent increases in δ values through the 21st century over central and southern Africa, the Tibetan Plateau, and the eastern Australia. Decreasing δ values were found over the eastern tropical Pacific and the western margins of South America. A comparison with a present-day IsoGSM simulation reveals similar regional changes in δ values over the last 60 years. The similarities between recent changes and 21st century projections of δ values suggest that certain hydrological aspects of 21st century climate change are already taking place in some regions. Central Africa stands out as a region where IsoGSM simulates robust rises in precipitation and vapor δ values for both the 21st century and the late 20th century. The recent rise in δ values over central Africa is validated against δ variations from a Lake Bosumtwi sediment archive. The present-day increase in regional δ values could be a precursor of worsening drought conditions as the Earth warms through the 21st century.",

In addition, repeated multibeam surveys are used to monitor and compare the temporal evolution of such morphologies providing important insights into the sedimentary processes on the continental shelf.\nIn the Murcia continental shelf, Western Mediterranean Sea, a large filed of subaqueous dunes has been observed in the middle and outer shelf. Here, we present a detailed morphologic and sedimentological analysis of these features with the aim to discuss their possible mechanism of formation and assess their potential mobility. The findings are based on swath-bathymetry collected using a SIMRAD EM 710 and EM3000D multibeam echosounders, high-resolution seismic profiles acquired with a TOPAS 018 system and sediment samples.\nDunes are widely distributed between 60 and 110 m depth, from the Cope Cape, to the north, to the Águilas submarine canyon head rim, to the south. Dunes range from 18 to 140 m in wavelength and from 0.29 to 1.28 m in height. Dunes have asymmetrical profiles (average asymmetry of 0.065) with the lee slope facing towards the southwest that indicate a net south-westward sediment transport. Seabed samples collected in the crests and troughs of individual dunes show a similar grain-size distribution curve, but differ in the content of fines, which is higher in the trough, whereas the crests are dominated by coarse particles. High resolution seismic profiles reveal the presence of a continuous strong reflector that constitutes the base of the subaqueous dunes and could likely correspond to the Holocene transgressive ravinement surface.\nDune migration rates were determined from the net displacement of the crests and troughs positions deduced from repeated multibeam surveys (2003 and 2013). Results indicate that the subaqueous dunes remain stationary or migrate at low rates towards the southwest (migration rates < 1 m yr-1). Bedform asymmetry and migration are consistent with the general circulation of the margin, characterized by a predominant geostrophic current flowing south-westward along the shelf break.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater is a major source of water in the western U.S. Aquifer systems in this region depend on variable recharge rates influenced by local climatology, vegetation, soils, and geology. There are limited recharge estimates in this region due to the complexity of recharge processes and limited observations. Reliable recharge estimates are important for management of these aquifer systems in response to projected increases in population, land use and climate changes. Several Land Surface Models (LSMs) have been developed over the last few decades to better represent the land surface and atmospheric processes aimed at improving the estimates of various water, energy and carbon fluxes. The complexity of these LSMs varies in simulating exchanges of energy, mass, and momentum between the land surface and overlying atmosphere. In this study, simulations of three LSMs (Noah, Mosaic and VIC) obtained from North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) are used for assessing recharge estimates across the western U.S. Modeled recharge was then compared with published recharge estimates for several aquifers in the region. Mosaic consistently generated higher evapotranspiration compared to Noah and VIC, thereby generating lower recharge. Estimates of recharge from Noah and VIC were similar to each other. While the average annual recharge values varied between the models, the models were consistent in identifying high and low recharge areas in the region. For an average annual precipitation ranging between 58-5051 mm across the western U.S., the estimated average annual recharge ranged between 0-3479 mm based on Mosaic, 0-4128 mm based on Noah and, 0-2209 mm based on VIC simulations. Annual recharge to precipitation ratios across the study basins, varied from 0.04-3.3% based on Mosaic; 4.3-35.5% based on Noah; and 3.9-24.3 % based on VIC simulations. Models tend to agree in seasonality of recharge occurring dominantly during the spring across the region. Our results highlight that LSMs have the potential to capture the spatial and temporal patterns of recharge at large scales; however more observational studies are required for improved parameterization.",

However, emissions originating on the regional scale are poorly constrained. Here we present a study focused on assessing the complementarity of the constraints on estimates of North American CH4 emissions provided space-based and ground-based observations of atmospheric CH4. We use data from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) together with discrete air sample measurements from tall towers and ground-based Fourier-Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometers over North America to constrain surface fluxes of CH4. FTIR measurements are made by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and by the Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), which includes an instrument installed at the University of Toronto Atmospheric Observatory in downtown Toronto. We also employ two inverse modeling approaches. One of them exploits the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model to link CH4 fluxes with measurements. Updates on emissions are obtained based on simple Bayesian inversion. In the second approach, CH4 emissions are constrained by means of a four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation method implemented with the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. Comparing the two approaches, we investigate the effect of transport errors and the inversion framework on the inferred CH4 fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The second rise of atmospheric oxygen (~600 Ma) marked an increase of atmospheric pO2 from a poorly constrained value of 0.1% < pO2 < 10% of present atmospheric level (PAL) in the early and mid Proterozoic to >10%PAL1. The event is important because it ushered in the modern era of animal life. To understand the evolution of Earth’s habitability, it is therefore key to understand the cause of this 2nd rise.\nHere, we quantitatively examine possible causes for the 2nd rise of oxygen. We use a biogeochemical box model2 originally developed to calculate the oxygen evolution before and after the 1st rise of oxygen (~2.4 Ga). The Claire et al. (2006) model calculates the evolution of atmospheric oxygen and methane given production and loss fluxes associated with the oxygen, carbon, and iron cycles. Because the model was unable to drive pO2 to end-Proterozoic levels, the authors suggested that another buffer, such as sulfur, is needed to explain the 2nd rise of oxygen. The sulfur and oxygen cycles are tied through various biogeochemical interactions; therefore, once sulfur (as sulfate) began to accumulate in Proterozoic oceans, it likely began to heavily influence the oxygen cycle. We have added a sulfur biogeochemical cycle to this model, enabling exploration of mechanisms that buffer pO2 at intermediate levels in the Proterozoic and fail to do so in the Phanerozoic.\nPreliminary results show evolution of oxygen and methane that are consistent with geologic proxies. However, the model-generated 2nd rise of oxygen is dependent upon sulfur fluxes that have uncertain magnitudes, so we will present the sensitivity of our results to model assumptions while constraining scenarios for the 2nd rise of atmospheric O2. In the future, we will also integrate isotopic fractionation effects, which will allow comparison with isotopic data from sedimentary sulfides, carbonates, and organic carbon.\n1Canfield, C., 2014, Treatise on Geochemistry, 197 2Claire, M.W., et al., 2006, Geobiology, 4, 239",

            "abstract": "Relatively thick soils mantle limestone bedrock throughout much of middle TN. Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology was used to test two hypotheses: 1) That soil formed by accumulation of insoluble residue during chemical weathering of \"dirty\" limestone bedrock. 2) That an exotic component, perhaps wind-blown loess, was deposited and weathered to form soil. Samples of soil and underlying bedrock were collected from flat surfaces at the tops of cliffs. At Site 1 the Mississippian cherty limestone of the Fort Payne Formation was collected along with the B1 and B2 horizons of the overlying ultisol. At Site 2 a composite sample of A and B horizons of an alfisol and a sample of the underlying Ordovician limestone of the Hermitage Formation were collected. Zircon was recovered from soil and limestone samples, imaged using cathodoluminescence, and analyzed for trace elements and U-Pb isotopes using a 193 nm laser and quadrupole ICP-MS. Discordant analyses were discarded and 206Pb/238U ages are reported.\nTrace element concentrations and ratios in zircon seem to not be useful as provenance indicators. However, comparison of U-Pb age spectra showed that soils at both sites predominantly formed by weathering of limestone, with a small exotic component. The Hermitage has significant age peaks at ~1330, 1043, 955 and 439 Ma, and its overlying soil has age peaks at 1410, 1235, 1036 and 442 Ma. The age spectra are significantly different (Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability P = 0.01 < 0.05 significance). The Fort Payne has age peaks at ~1253, 967 and 417 Ma, while the B1 has age peaks at 1440, 1182, 1012 and 450 Ma (K-S P = 0.051) and the B2 at 1240, 941, 362, 81 and 33 Ma (K-S P = 0.073). The young ages in B2 require an exotic component that may account for ~25% of the measured ages. The source of the exotic material has not yet been identified, but its zircon age spectrum does not match previously published age spectra for the regional Pleistocene Peoria loess. Bedrock age peaks overlap with the Grenville, Taconic and Acadian orogenies of eastern North America. This study demonstrates that dating of detrital zircon is a powerful tool for determining the provenance of soil and limestone.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon Basin, during the wet season, has one of the lowest aerosol concentrations worldwide, with air masses covering thousands of kilometers of pristine forest with negligible human impact. The atmosphere in such regions is strongly coupled with the biosphere through primary biological aerosols, biogenic salts and secondary aerosols from oxidation of biogenic VOCs. The natural environment is strongly modified nearby urbanized areas, in particular Manaus, a city of nearly two million people. The urban pollution plume has high concentrations of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, carbon monoxide, particle concentrations, and soot, among other pollutants, strongly contrasting with the clean air masses reaching the city. Such unique location provides the ideal laboratory to study the isolated urban emission, as well the pristine environment by perturbing it in a relatively known fashion. The GoAmazon experiment was designed with these questions in mind, combining remote sensing, in situand airborne measurements. This manuscript describes the measurements currently taking place at the T2 site, near Manaus, frequently impacted by relatively fresh emissions from the city. This presentation focuses on aerosol properties and trace gas composition at the T2 site.\nPM1 mass concentration from March up to July 2014 has been observed to be dominated by organics (1.51 µg m-3), followed by BC (0.83 µg m-3), SO4 (0.17 µg m-3), NO3 (0.08 µg m-3) and NH4 (0.06 µg m-3). Mean aerosol number concentration was 3600 cm-3, with a mean geometric diameter of 70 nm. As for the trace gases, initial estimates of isoprene average ambient concentration is 0.95 ppb, whereas MVK+MACR has been estimated to be 0.76 ppb. Average mixing ratios of toluene, benzene and C8 aromatics were 0.31 ppb, 0.16 ppb and 0.15 ppb, respectively, correlating relatively well with markers of anthropogenic activities, such as BC. Such measurements will carry on throughout GoAmazon 2014/5, providing a unique dataset to understand the aerosol life cycle and the impact of urban emission in the heart of the Amazon Forest.",

            "abstract": "A continuum damage model for differential stress-induced anisotropic crack formation and stiffness degradation is used to study geologic fracturing in rocks. The finite element-based model solves for deformation in the quasi-linear elastic domain and determines the six component damage tensor at each deformation increment. The model permits an isotropic or anisotropic intact or pre-damaged reference state, and the elasticity tensor evolves depending on the stress path. The damage variable, similar to Oda’s fabric tensor, grows when the surface energy dissipated by three-dimensional opened cracks exceeds a threshold defined at the appropriate scale of the representative elementary volume (REV). At the laboratory or wellbore scale (<1m) brittle continuum damage reflects microcracking, grain boundary separation, grain crushing, or fine delamination, such as in shale. At outcrop (1m-100m), seismic (10m-1000m), and tectonic (>1000m) scales the damaged REV reflects early natural fracturing (background or tectonic fracturing) or shear strain localization (fault process zone, fault-tip damage, etc.). The numerical model was recently benchmarked against triaxial stress-strain data from laboratory rock mechanics tests. However, the utility of the model to predict geologic fabric such as natural fracturing in hydrocarbon reservoirs was not fully explored.\nTo test the ability of the model to predict geological fracturing, finite element simulations (Abaqus) of common geologic scenarios with known fracture patterns (borehole pressurization, folding, faulting) are simulated and the modeled damage tensor is compared against physical fracture observations. Simulated damage anisotropy is similar to that derived using fractured rock-mass upscaling techniques for pre-determined fracture patterns. This suggests that if model parameters are constrained with local data (e.g., lab, wellbore, or reservoir domain), forward modeling could be used to predict mechanical fabric at the relevant REV scale. This reference fabric also can be used as the starting material property to pre-condition subsequent deformation or fluid flow. Continuing efforts are to expand the present damage model to couple damage evolution with plasticity and with permeability for more geologically realistic simulation.",

            "abstract": "Mainland Portugal has experienced several past large earthquakes both offshore and onshore. Examples of significant past events include the great Lisbon earthquake in 1755 (M ~8.5-8.7) that generated a devastating tsunami, the 1858 M ~7.1 event in Setúbal, and the Benavente earthquake of M ~6.0 in 1909. To better characterize seismicity that pose a potential risk to this region, accurate models of regional Earth structure are required. The lack of a region-wide high quality broadband (BB) seismic network in the past however, has hindered a quantitative characterization of the region’s Earth structure. Since 2006 the permanent Portuguese seismic network has greatly expanded, which resulted in a continuously accumulating large volume of high quality BB data. Within the scope of the FCT-funded project AQUAREL (Accurate QUAntification of Regional Earthquakes and earth structure: application to western Iberia, PTDC/CTE-GIX/116819/2010) project, we utilize this new dataset to measure Rayleigh wave ellipticity from teleseismic events that will be inverted for the seismic structure beneath Portugal.\nThe horizontal-to-vertical amplitude ratio (H/V ratio) at a given station is defined as the Rayleigh wave ellipticity, which in theory depends only on the structure immediately beneath that particular station. We are measuring H/V ratios from BB seismograms of teleseismic events that occurred between 2009 and 2013 that have hypocentral depths less than 25 km (to reduce the effects of higher modes) and within epicentral distance range 50° – 120° (to minimize interference of other waves). These measurements are made both in time domain at discrete central periods from 25s through 120s and frequency domain using a multitaper method. Theoretical predictions of H/V ratios are calculated using the normal mode summation code MINOES, taking in to account the effects of both fundamental mode and higher mode energy accurate up to 0.1 Hz. With our semi-automated amplitude picking procedure along with standard quality control steps, we are able to measure synthetic H/V ratios with little scatter. Our initial H/V ratios measured from BB data indicate systematic variations with respect to the reference model PREM. We will present initial results from forward and inverse modeling of these measurements.",

In the mid-50’s five watershed centers with intensively instrumented watersheds at the scale of 100 to 700 km2 were established. Primary network research objectives were to quantify the downstream effects of conservation practices and accumulate rainfall-runoff observations for design of water conservation structures. ARS has operated over 600 watersheds in its history and continues operate roughly 100 watersheds, many of which are nested. With passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 research and instrumentation evolved to add a variety of observations relevant to water quality issues that varied regionally. The intensive, long-term measurements and observations have led to an extensive process-based understanding of watershed behavior encompassing a diverse range of hydrologic and ecosystem dynamics. Many of the intensively monitored ARS watersheds have, and continue to serve as validation sites for aircraft and satellite based remotely sensed instruments. Recently, many of the ARS Experimental Watershed have become part of the Long-Term Agro-ecosystem Research Network (LTAR).

General circulation models (GCMs) still have trouble simulating climate variability in the tropics, where deep convection plays an important role in determining the mean climate and its variability. It has been observed that lightning flash rates over land in the tropics are orders of magnitude higher than those over the ocean. Because higher lightning flash rates tend to be associated with higher updraft velocities, deep convective updrafts over land are expected to be stronger than those over the tropical oceans. We hope to elucidate the physical mechanisms that influence updraft intensity using a cloud resolving model (CRM), which, unlike a GCM, is able to explicitly simulate individual convective updrafts.\nThere are numerous hypotheses regarding what causes the discrepancy between land and ocean convection in the tropics. The hypotheses that we explore are variations in the Surface Bowen Ratio (SBR), as well as the existence of horizontal heterogeneities interacting with an ocean. We test these hypotheses in two different contexts: initial condition simulations, and radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) simulations. We modified the SBR of a region in RCE which by extension changes its boundary layer depth. The expectation in this case was that higher SBRs would lead to more enhanced convection. However, we find that higher SBRs have no effect or a slightly negative effect on updraft statistics in RCE simulations.\nWe also looked at how the inclusion of differently sized islands affected convection in initial condition simulations. Previously, there had been discussion of a resonant island size that may produce more intense convection (Robinson, Sherwood, and Li 2008; Robinson et al. 2011,). We were able to reproduce predicted variations in convective intensity using differently sized islands. It remains to be seen whether these variations in convective intensity are due to resonant island size or some other mechanism.",

To examine these air quality issues, CAREBEIJING-NCP2014 (Care Beijing – Northern China Plain 2014) was held in WangDu, Hebei province, China from 6 June to 15 July 2014.\nWe deployed our newly developed instrument, ACES (Airborne Cavity Enhanced Spectrometer), for high time resolution in-situ measurement of glyoxal (CHOCHO), nitrous acid (HONO) and other trace gases (NO2, H2O) to investigate mechanisms of oxidation processes and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation.\nThe in situ measurements of CHOCHO provide observational constraints on secondary organic aerosol formation and oxidation processes, since this molecule has been proposed to play a crucial role in forming aerosol due to its high water solubility, isomerization, and abundant production from the oxidation of many different volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A box model analysis incorporating secondary glyoxal sources from VOC oxidation and sinks to OH reaction, photolysis and heterogeneous uptake will be used to determine a budget and potential for SOA formation.\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21190052), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB05010500) and the U.S. National Science Foundation Atmospheric (AGS-1405805).",

            "abstract": "Two important topics in current climate research are the global warming hiatus and the seesaw pattern of sea level rise (SLR) in the Pacific Ocean. We use ocean temperature and sea-level observations along with CMIP5 climate modelling data to investigate the relationship between the warming hiatus and sea-level variability in the Pacific Ocean. We analyse ocean heat content (OHC) trend by basin and layer for the full record (1945-2012) as well as the hiatus period (1998-2012). The result confirms the importance of the Pacific for heat uptake during the hiatus. Notably, the subsurface layer of the Pacific shows significant increase in OHC during the hiatus and a strong east-west compensation. This is mainly responsible for and reflected by the seesaw pattern of the Pacific sea level through thermosteric effect. The control simulations from 38 CMIP5 models indicate that the seesaw pattern of SLR in the Pacific is mainly a feature of decadal to multidecadal variability. Most CMIP5 models can capture this variability, especially in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation region (poleward of 20°N). The CMIP5 control runs show that during periods of negative trends of global temperatures (analogous to hiatus decades in a warming world), sea level increases in the western Pacific and decreases in the eastern Pacific. The opposite is true during periods of positive temperature trend (accelerated warming). These results suggest that a possible flip of the Pacific SLR seesaw would imply a resumption of surface warming and a SLR acceleration along the U.S. West Coast.",

The majority of the streaming stations are part of the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO). Following community input from a real-time GNSS data products and formats meeting hosted by UNAVCO in Spring of 2011, UNAVCO now provides real-time PPP positions, and network solutions where practical, for all available stations using Trimble’s PIVOT RTX server software and TrackRT.\nThe UNAVCO real-time system has the potential to enhance our understanding of earthquakes, seismic wave propagation, volcanic eruptions, magmatic intrusions, movement of ice, landslides, and the dynamics of the atmosphere. Beyond the ever increasing applications in science and engineering, RT-GNSS has the potential to provide early warning of hazards to emergency managers, utilities, other infrastructure managers, first responders and others. Upgrades to the network include eight Trimble NetR9 GNSS receivers with GLONASS and receiver-based RTX capabilities and sixteen new co-located MEMS based accelerometers. These new capabilities will allow integration of GNSS and strong motion data to produce broad-spectrum waveforms improving Earthquake Early Warning systems.\nControlled outdoor kinematic and static experiments provide a useful method for evaluating and comparing real-time systems. UNAVCO has developed a portable low-cost antenna actuator to characterize the kinematic performance of receiver- and server-based real-time positioning algorithms and identify system limitations. We have performed tests using controlled 1-d antenna motions and will present comparisons between these and other post-processed kinematic algorithms including GIPSY-OASIS and TRACK. In addition to kinematic testing, long-term static testing of Trimble’s RTX service is ongoing at UNAVCO and will be used to characterize the stability of the position time-series produced by RTX.\nIn addition, with the goal of characterizing stability and improving software and higher level products based on real-time and high frequency GNSS time series, we present an overview of the UNAVCO RT-GPS system, a comparison of the UNAVCO generated real-time, static and community data products, and an overview of available common data sets.",

            "abstract": "Mt. Kilauea, located in the Hawaiian Islands, has been actively emitting substantial quantities of SO2 for the past several years. This event provides an excellent experimental case for investigating indirect aerosol effects. This project examines CloudSat reflectivity and MODIS reflectance at the 0.55 and 2.1 micron channels using data from 2006 until 2013. Validation of the volcano’s plume activity and SO2 emissions were conducted using Aura’s OMI retrieval. If the aerosol indirect effects are operable, We expect to find that as SO2 aerosols increase the integrated column radar reflectivity will decrease. It can also be assumed that there will be an increase in 2.1 micron reflectance returns. This signal should be stronger at the plume’s location and is expected to dissipate as the tropical circulation carries the aerosol-loaded clouds westward. While large-scale meteorology events could be a factor in the cloud's aerosol optical depth (AOD), a stronger reflectance would indicate a thicker AOD, which could be attributed to increased SO2 aerosol content. However, this increase in SO2 would limit the liquid water content of these low level clouds thus resulting in reduced precipitation events. However it will be interesting to determine whether as the perturbed air masses reach some sort of equilibrium with the large scale dynamics downstream of the volcanoes if the indirect effects will be distinguishable from the background cloud conditions.",

            "abstract": "Winds over West Africa loft vast plumes of Saharan mineral dust aerosols into the atmosphere. The plumes affect the radiative balance, causing changes to the thermal and dynamical structure of the atmosphere. How these dust-induced changes of the atmosphere affect the growth, propagation and subsequent evolution of African easterly waves (AEWs) remains poorly understood. Because AEWs often serve as seeds for the development of tropical storms, understanding how dust affects their evolution is of both practical and theoretical importance. In this study, a quasigeostrophic model is used to construct a theory that explicitly describes how dust-radiative-dynamical feedbacks affect the linear and weakly nonlinear dynamics of AEWs. The model consists of coupled equations for potential vorticity, temperature and dust concentration. The radiative-dust heating rate accounts for both shortwave and longwave radiative transfer. The source of dust is due to surface emission, which depends on surface wind; the sinks of dust are due to sedimentation and dry deposition. An asymptotic analysis yields analytical expressions for the propagation and growth characteristics of the model’s AEWs, as well as their weakly nonlinear evolution and feedback on the zonal-mean field. The analysis shows the importance of the meridional and vertical gradients of the basic state dust distribution to the linear and weakly nonlinear dynamics of the AEWs. Idealized examples are used to highlight how the dust-radiative feedbacks affect the propagation, group velocity, growth, structure, wave fluxes and weakly nonlinear evolution of AEWs. The clarity of the expressions connecting dust aerosols to the dynamics of AEWs provides an important interpretive tool for analyzing results obtained from comprehensive model simulations of AEWs, such as those produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.",

We call this part of the waveform signal the acoustic coda. We modeled these features as reflected and/or scattered waves by acoustic reflectors/scatters surrounding the explosions. The acoustic coda is sensitive to changes in the atmospheric conditions and location of background scatters, and can be used to extract information of such changes. For example, we have demonstrated a technique to recover differential air temperatures around explosions using small changes in the phase of the acoustic coda. This technique provides an estimate of changes in bulk air temperature that are averaged over the path. Also, as the coda is very sensitive to changes in the location of background scatters, we are exploring the use of relative phase delays and amplitude changes within the coda to study changes in the location and the characteristics of the surroundings of the source.",

            "abstract": "Ozone is a species of major importance in the Martian atmosphere e.g. since it is involved in the stabilization of Mars' major atmospheric constituent carbon dioxide. Below XX km altitude, ozone acts as an atomic oxygen source, which is produced by photolysis and oxidizes carbon monoxide via catalytic cycles involving odd hydrogen (HO$_x$=H+OH+HO$_2$). Originating mainly from H$_2$O photolysis, odd hydrogen destroys ozone resulting in the observed anti-correlation between water vapor and ozone. Compared with species from the HO$_x$-family, ozone is relatively easy to detect by e.g. UV spectroscopy or IR heterodyne spectroscopy. Similar to carbon dioxide, the concentration of ozone can be critically influenced by chemical trace species acting as catalysts in chemical pathways. The identification of such chemical pathways in complex reaction networks and the quantification of their contribution is in general challenging. Therefore, we use an automated computer algorithm (PAP - Pathway Analysis Program), which is specifically designed to address such problems.\nIn this work, we apply the PAP-algorithm to the results of the newly updated JPL/Caltech photochemical column model of the Martian atmosphere in order to investigate the Martian atmospheric ozone photochemistry. The efficiencies of individual ozone formation and destruction pathways are calculated for different atmospheric heights, by applying the algorithm to each vertical layer of the column model in turn.\nThe results of our investigations suggest that ozone is primarily produced by a Chapman-like mechanism, whereby atomic oxygen is produced by carbon dioxide photolysis instead of molecular oxygen photolysis. In the ozone layer at approximately 40 km altitude, ozone formation is chiefly dominated by a chemical pathway where atomic oxygen is supplied by vertical transport. Ozone consumption pathways involving ozone photolysis are most efficient except for a layer around 40 km altitude where the reaction between ozone and atomic hydrogen become more important. These findings are of particular importance to understand the dominating processes in Martian chemistry also in view of more complex modelling approaches.",

            "abstract": "There is a large and increasing number of ground-based and satellite-borne instruments, which reliably reveal ionospheric manifestations of natural hazards such as large earthquakes, strong tsunamis, and powerful tornadoes. As the focus shifts from detecting the ionospheric features associated with the natural hazards to characterizing the hazards for the purposes of improving early warning systems and contributing to disaster recovery, it becomes imperative to relate quantitatively characteristics of the observed ionospheric disturbances and the underlying natural hazard. The relation between perturbations at the ground level and their ionospheric manifestations is strongly affected by parameters of the intervening atmosphere. In this paper, we employ the ray theory to model propagation of acoustic gravity waves in three-dimensionally inhomogeneous atmosphere. Huygens' wavefront-tracing and Hamiltonian ray-tracing algorithms are used to simulate wave propagation from an earthquake hypocenter through the earth’s crust and ocean to the upper atmosphere as well as the generation of atmospheric waves by seismic surface waves and tsunamis. We quantify the influence of temperature stratification and winds, including their seasonal variability, and air viscosity and thermal conductivity on the geometry and amplitude of ionospheric disturbances. Modeling results are verified by comparing observations of the velocity fluctuations at altitudes of 150–160 km by a coastal Dynasonde HF radar system with theoretical predictions of ionospheric manifestations of background infragravity waves in the ocean. Dynasonde radar systems are shown to be a promising means for monitoring acoustic-gravity wave activity and observing ionospheric perturbations due to earthquakes and tsunamis. The effects will be discussed of background ionospheric disturbances and uncertainty in atmospheric parameters on the feasibility and accuracy of retrieval of open-ocean tsunami heights from observations of the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Melt from mountain glaciers is contributing about one third to the sea level rise total, equal to the current contribution from the ice sheets, and this is likely to be the case for the next century. The GLIMS Glacier Database provides detailed and traceable information on glaciers that can be used by the modeling and assessment communities to estimate present and future contributions from glaciers to sea level.\nThere are currently two major collections of glacier outlines: the glacier database of the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) initiative, and the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI). The GLIMS database is rich in source metadata and contains time series for thousands of glaciers, while the RGI is a single snapshot in time and has less of the crucial metadata. However, the RGI has nearly complete global coverage, while the GLIMS database is currently at about 70% coverage.\nWorking with members of both the GLIMS and RGI communities, we have begun to merge the RGI database into an enhanced GLIMS Glacier Database and to provide tools for downloading glacier data in either the GLIMS or RGI data model. The result will be an improved glacier database compared to either of the inputs, which we are calling GLIMS 2. This contribution provides an update of this work, its challenges and estimated time line for completion.",

The latter allows for the displaying of 4D data stored using the NetCDF file format (widely used for storing environmental model datasets). Some of the features available on the sites built with OWGIS are: multiple languages, animations, vertical profiles and vertical transects, color palettes, color ranges, and the ability to download data.

            "abstract": "Lightning, a phenomenon widely known to occur in thunderstorms, is also present in major volcanic eruptions. Although volcanic lightning is not apparently different, its occurrence within ash clouds increase the difficulty to detect and measure it optically with remote instruments. Major volcanic eruptions, those with Volcanic Explosive Index (VEI) > 3 or with ash plume heights greater than 10 km are likely to have lightning. This lightning should be seen from space by LIS and OTD (Lightning Imaging Sensor, Optical Transient Detector). Ash clouds however absorb much more light than regular clouds which results in lower or no radiance measured for lightning in the ash plume. The LIS/OTD satellite data was studied for a small region centered on different volcanoes during reportedly active periods (3 days or more). This volcanic lightning should be distinguished from thunderstorm lightning according to specific criteria. All relevant eruptions that have occurred since LIS was launched in 1997 aboard TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission) Observatory need to be studied. LIS and OTD are in low orbits and do not cover the entire globe. Since any volcano is observed only a few minutes each day the likelihood of observing lightning events during a volcanic eruption is low. Inter comparison of lightning data from several eruptions, at different dates and places all over the world helps set a criteria to distinguish volcanic lightning from thunderstorm related lightning. LIS datasets, typically structured in four different levels – events,groups,flashes, areas – are plotted separately using conventional IDL algorithms to retrieve orbit data from individual HDF files. Events associated to volcanic lightning are distributed in fewer groups, which in turn are structured in less flashes than “regular” lightning.",

            "abstract": "Marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are key regions of nitrogen cycling and nitrogen loss as N2. The potential for methane cycling to influence OMZ nitrogen budgets remains largely unknown. The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to nitrite or nitrate reduction has been shown to be a potential source of methane consumption, N loss, and oxygen production in freshwater sediments, but has not been described for marine pelagic environments. Nitrite-dependent AOM is performed by bacteria of the candidate division NC10 through an intra-aerobic pathway involving the dismutation of nitric oxide to O2 and N2. We explored the potential that NC10-like bacteria are present and active in the anoxic, nitrite-rich OMZ of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Community transcriptome sequencing confirmed the expression of genes with top matches to the NC10 bacterium 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera.' NC10-like transcripts increased in relative abundance with depth into the anoxic OMZ core and included genes of aerobic methanotrophy and denitrification, as well as high numbers of transcripts matching norZ nitric oxide reductase, hypothesized to play a role in the O2-yielding dismutation reaction. Phylogenetic analysis of OMZ particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) and 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered by PCR revealed multiple clades of NC10 phylotypes in the OMZ. Preliminary data from OMZ enrichments revealed methane-dependent nitrite consumption, but further characterization is required to identify the pathways and organisms mediating this process. These findings expand the known environmental range of NC10 and suggest the possibility of previously uncharacterized linkages between OMZ nitrogen and methane cycles.",

We use methods from statistical extreme value theory to characterize the spatial dependence of extremes as a function of spatial distance. Our focus in this work is characterizing uncertainty in our understanding of how the spatial dependence of extremes in climate models\nWe investigate the influence of ARs on the spatial dependence structure of extreme precipitation from CMIP5 simulations under climate change. We fit statistical models that treat initial condition ensemble members as independent data replicates and uses bootstrapping (across yearlong blocks of data) to estimate uncertainty from having only limited model runs. We also focus on multi-model ensembles as random draws of CMIP5 model runs and approximate the uncertainty for simulating the behavior of tail dependence across models.\nPreliminary results from four CMIP5 models show that projected AR events bring more severe rainfall with less dependent pattern between locations under high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) during 2076-2100 than for the historical run during 1981-2005. Within the UQ framework, spatial dependence between nearby locations is estimated more precisely, showing narrower confidence intervals, than the spatial dependence measure for locations further apart.",

            "abstract": "Peridotite xenoliths are recovered in basaltic to andesitic lavas from several localities in the Japan Sea, a Miocene back-arc basin of the Western Pacific region. These peridotites are classified into two groups: two-pyroxene peridotitess and dunite-wehrlite groups. Although slight chemical modifications are observed in these peridotite samples, two-pyroxene peridotite group has retained their original residual mantle geochemical signatures left after partial melting. The dunite-wehrlite group is, on the other hand, probably formed by extensive interaction of the two-pyroxene peridotite group. We examined trace element characteristics of clinopyroxene in these xenoliths. Light REE-depleted clinopyroxenes that are usually interpreted as a simple residual mantle after anhydrous partial melting are similar to those of abyssal peridotite recovered from mid-ocean ridges and back-arc basins. Other samples show LREE-enriched patterns that are residues after influx melting caused by hydrous melt/supercritical fluids released from the subducted slab at high pressure conditions. The geotectonic and geochemical variations of the peridotite xenoliths from the Japan Sea (Shirabeshi Seamount, Seifu Seamount and Oshima-Oshima Island) suggest that the mantle beneath the Japan Sea are suffered from hydrous to anhydrous melting as the Japan Sea forms. This is consistent with the geochemical and isotopic results from Miocene basaltic rocks formed during opening of the Japan Sea (Sato et al., Jour. Petrol., 2013). The Japan Sea peridotite xenoliths also shed lights on the origin of ophiolites.",

            "abstract": "The development of evolutionary models and constraints for the extensional mechanisms which govern continental rifting is of fundamental significance toward understanding the breakup of continents and the role of volcanism in achieving successful rifting. To analyze the transitional nature of the Red Sea rift (RSR) passive margins and to quantify the mechanism through which extension has been accommodated, we examined a total of 3531 high-quality radial receiver functions from multiple temporary deployments in Saudi Arabia and the Levant as well as data recently acquired by the Egyptian National Seismic Network. Egypt is characterized by a relatively constant crustal thickness of approximately 37 km, while the southern Arabian Shield is roughly 35 km on average. The crust beneath the Eastern Desert of Egypt is significantly thinned with an average thickness of about 26 km. Observations of Vp/Vs across the Arabian-Nubian Shield indicate highly similar intermediate to mafic compositions, supporting well-accepted theories for juvenile arc accretion of relatively uniform makeup. Thinned crust as far as 130 km inland on the Egyptian margin indicates a highly asymmetric crustal structure across the Red Sea, supporting a model invoking simple shear extensional mechanisms. Joint modeling using satellite gravity and magnetic data with RF Moho depth constraints reveals the presence of high-density high-magnetic susceptibility mafic complexes which we interpret as volcanic margins in the northern RSR at ~25.5°N and the southern RSR at ~19.5°N. We believe the development of the northern RSR margin is accompanied by isolated volcanism associated with slow spreading rates since the Oligocene.",

Models and data generally place the transition between the two regions near 200 km, but measurements from the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on Mars Express suggest that the transition occurs closer to 275 km. This altitude also marks the transition between the two MARSIS operational modes: the electron density above 275 km is determined from local plasma frequency measurements, while at lower altitudes it is obtained remotely from radio sounding. In this study we compare Mariner 9 radio occultation electron density profiles to the Němec et al. (2011) empirical model based on MARSIS data to evaluate the accuracy and biases of the MARSIS measurements. We investigate whether the Mariner 9 electron density profiles can be well described by the Němec et al. (2011) empirical model. We also identify the typical Mariner 9 transition region altitude, as measured by a change in scale height, to determine whether the transition at 275 km observed by MARSIS is a consequence of differences in the two MARSIS operational modes or is physically meaningful. The Mariner 9 radio occultation measurements of the Martian ionosphere have recently been digitized and reanalyzed and are ideal for our study because they extend as high as 400 km, spanning the transition region between the two MARSIS data types, while similar measurements from Mars Global Surveyor rarely extend beyond 200 km. Our findings will help resolve discrepancies between the two MARSIS data types and validate the MARSIS electron density measurements.",

            "abstract": "Hydrology is one of the most important triggering factors for slope destabilization. When a slope becomes unstable, cracks and fissures develop during slope deformation. These discontinuities affect both geotechnical and hydrological conditions of the slope. The crucial role of water flow, and especially the important role of preferential flow in unstable slopes, is generally recognized. However, in hydrological modelling, the unstable slope is characterized using static subsurface properties. The dynamic feedback between slope deformation and slope hydrology, being positive or negative depending on other geotechnical conditions, is not taken into account although it influences the pore pressure distribution and as such the overall stability.\nThis research aims to highlight and quantify the dynamic nature of the subsurface hydrological conditions in unstable slopes. We focus on the role preferential flow has on slope destabilization and more specifically on the feedbacks between differential displacement and hydrological behaviour of the subsurface in natural slopes.\nWe will present examples of field experimental work where we measured the hydrological influence of fissures, theoretical analysis and case study modelling of combined hydrology and slope stability, including feedbacks. The results show the subtle trade-off of increased infiltration and storage capacity in a slope and the increased drainage capacity of well connected preferential flow paths.\nWe will furthermore highlight the current status of our knowledge as well as identify the knowledge gaps we face and the importance of cross- and multidisciplinary approach to better understand the internal dynamics of slope deformation and hillslope hydrology.",

The spatial distribution, magnitude, as well as timing of precipitation events are being altered globally, resulting in significant biotic implications. Motivated by the pressing need to understand how the different components of natural habitats behave under extreme hydrologic conditions, we quantitatively assessed the response of two major hydrological attributes, namely soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (VWC) to rainfall deficiencies. More specifically, using multi-year microwave remote sensing observations, we quantified the changes of VWC and SM during dry spells, as well as their resilience during those periods. Differences among vegetation types, as well as the effect of the duration of the dry spells were also investigated. Finally, spatial patterns and characteristics of the response of VWC and SM to sustained precipitation deficits were identified across the study area, and within each of the major vegetation regimes of the region. This hydro-ecological study provides critical insight into the behavior of two crucial components of the natural ecosystems during prolonged dry periods, which in turn yields useful information on the role of the hydrologic regimes in determining biotic composition and patterns, as well as the regional micro-climatology. Furthermore, this information can significantly contribute towards the achievement of more efficient and precise farming practices at the local level, resulting in the increase of food security and societal well-being.",

            "abstract": "Topography perturbs the near-surface stress fields caused by gravity and by regional horizontal stresses. Two-dimensional analytical solutions for elastic stresses in uniform, isotropic rock allow the effects of gravity and a uniform regional horizontal stress P to be distinguished beneath isolated bell-shaped ridges and valleys. The topographic stress perturbations vary depending on the shape of the topography. Gravity, by itself, causes surface-perpendicular and surface-parallel compressive stresses beneath the crest of a bell-shaped ridge. Regional compression contributes a surface-parallel compression atop broad gentle bell-shaped ridges with steepest slopes less than 45°, but a surface-parallel tension atop narrower ridges with steeper slopes. If P is an order of magnitude less compressive than rg|b|, where r is rock density, g is gravitational acceleration, and b is the topographic relief, then effects of gravity dominate effects of the regional compression near the topographic surface. Conversely, if P is an order of magnitude more compressive than rg|b|, then effects of regional compression dominate the effects of gravity, and tensile stresses can develop normal to the surface beneath gentle convex bell-shaped ridges and the convex portions of bell-shaped valleys. The latter conditions promote the widespread development of sheeting joints. The locations of topographic inflection points help define where sheeting joints can develop at a particular time. As erosion progresses and the shape of the topographic surface changes, sheeting joints can form in new areas and be left as relict structures in others. The distribution of sheeting joints thus reflects the dynamic response of geologic systems that evolve through time.",

            "abstract": "Stochastic models are often applied to problems where only a small subset of variables are accessible by direct observation. This approach is well suited to paleomagnetism because we usually want to characterize the dipole field without explicitly accounting for all of the details of the internal field. Instead, the evolution of the dipole field is divided into two parts, based on the inherent timescales. One part describes slow adjustments of the dipole field toward a time-averaged state. The second part represents the effect of short-period convective fluctuations, which may be due to turbulent flow at smaller scales. Both parts of the stochastic model can be reconstructed from a time series of paleomagentic estimates. In this study we consider an example from (Buffett et al., 2013), which is based on the virtual axial dipole moment (VADM) from (Ziegler et al., 2011). The resulting stochastic model permits testable predictions, including the mean time between magnetic reversals or excursions. We extend these capabilities by predicting a geomagnetic power spectrum. The spectrum is nearly flat at low frequencies with a shoulder defined by the decay time of dipole fluctuations. At higher frequencies the spectrum decreases with frequency as\nf\n−2\n. Geodynamo models suggest that dipole fluctuations involve the first few decay modes. When these results are applied to geomagnetic spectrum we obtain an average electrical conductivity of\n1.5×\n10\n6\nS/m, which is compatible with recent estimates. The stochastic model also yields predictions for the duration of a magnetic reversal. A key input parameter is the amplitude of convective fluctuations when the dipole is weak. The model inferred from VADM estimates implies a 50\\% increase in convective fluctuations when the field is weak, yielding a mean reversal duration of 15 kyr. Interestingly, the model also predicts multiple flips in the dipole before a new polarity is established. For the predicted duration we expect two changes in polarity before a strong dipole emerges.",

Jet emission affects ~ in 25 mile radii from airports produce fine particles and concomitant pulmonary and cardio-vascular diseases. These unregulated emissions are of particular concerns for the health of local residents and environment in general due to rapid increase in worldwide air travel in 21st century. The accurate measurement of emissions from airports therefore requires development of new tools that quantification of aviation related emissions against other road traffic and hence to assess its local and global impacts and provide deeper understanding of nitrate in the environment in general, including the stratosphere where contrails are inadequately detailed\nTriple oxygen isotopic analysis of particulate nitrate from a DC 8 engine during a controlled experiment in Palmdale, CA documented the emission of nitric acid (~31 ng.m-3) at ~ 1m. The oxygen triple isotopic composition of nitrate emitted directly from the jet had δ18O values (22±1‰) identical to air O2 (δ18O = 23.5‰) with a mass dependent isotopic signature (Δ17O = 0), thus providing a unique isotopic signature of jet nitrate. A year long sampling campaign at one of the world’s busiest airports, the Los Angeles International airport showed the contribution of NO3 varies from 60 to 90% in summer and winter with variations largely attributed to the change in road traffic as air traffic remains fairly constant throughout the year at LAX. The next step in this is to detect these contributions at distal sites and use this as a signal carrier of atmospheric nitrate and its transport in general in the global biogeochemical system. These aspects will be discussed in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Very low permeability is a principal reason salt formations are considered viable hosts for disposal of nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. Granular salt is likely to be used as back-fill material and as a seal system component. Granular salt is expected to reconsolidate to a low permeability condition because of external pressure from the surrounding salt formation. Understanding the consolidation processes--known to depend on the stress state, moisture availability and temperature--is important for predicting achievement of sealing functions and long-term repository performance. As granular salt consolidates, initial void reduction is accomplished by brittle processes of grain rearrangement and cataclastic flow. At porosities of less than 10%, grain boundary processes and crystal-plastic mechanisms govern further porosity reduction. We investigate the micro-mechanisms operative in granular salt that has been consolidated under high temperatures to relatively low porosity. These conditions would occur proximal to heat-generating canisters. Mine-run salt from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant was used to create cylindrical samples which were consolidated at 250°C and stresses to 20 MPa. From samples consolidated to fractional densities of 86% and 97% polished thin sections, etched cleavage chips, and fragments were fabricated. Microstructural techniques included scanning electron and optical microscopy. Microstructure of undeformed mine-run salt was compared to the deformed granular salt. Observed deformation mechanisms include glide, cross slip, climb, fluid-assisted creep, pressure-solution redeposition, and annealing. Documentation of operative deformation mechanisms within the consolidating granular salt, particularly at grain boundaries, is essential to establish effects of moisture, stress, and temperature. Future work will include characterization of pore structures. Information gleaned in these studies supports evaluation of a constitutive model for reconsolidating granular salt, which will be used to predict the thermal-mechanical-hydrologic response of salt repository seal structures and backfilled rooms.",

Comparison between data and model results shows that the recovery of ~1 MeV radiation belt electrons near geosynchronous is mainly due to global convection and dipolarization associated injections from the plasma sheet [Kress et al., GRL, 2014]. Energetic particle measurements made with the Van Allen Probes spacecraft during this geomagnetic storm suggest that transport of electrons with energies up to ~2 MeV is driven by convection well inside of geosynchronous orbit, in a region where radiation belt transport is usually treated as diffusive. The general build up of outer belt electrons during the 17 March 2013 geomagnetic storm is also well modeled with test-particle trajectories in global MHD magnetospheric model fields. Rapid transport of plasma sheet electrons may provide a seed population for local acceleration mechanisms, resulting in the observed enhancements in 2-6 MeV outer radiation belt flux.",

            "abstract": "In situ remote sensing complements data from airborne and space-based sensors, in particular for intensive study sites where optical imagery can be paired with detailed ground and tower measurements. The characteristics of tower-mounted imaging systems are quite different from the nadir viewing geometry of other remote sensing platforms. In particular, tower-mounted systems are quite sensitive to artifacts of seasonal and diurnal sun angle variations. Most systems are oriented in a fixed north or south direction (depending on latitude), placing them in the principal plane at solar noon. The strength of the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) effect is strongest for images acquired at that time. Phenological metrics derived from tower based oblique angle imaging systems are particularly prone to BRDF effects, as shadowing within and between tree crowns varies seasonally. For sites in the northern hemisphere, the fraction of sunlit and shaded vegetation declines following the June solstice to leaf senescence in September.\nCorrecting tower-based remote sensing imagery for artifacts of BRDF is critical to isolate real changes in canopy phenology and reflectance. Here, we used airborne lidar data from NASA Goddard’s Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Airborne Imager (G-LiHT) to develop a 3D forest scene for Harvard Forest in the Discrete Anisotrophic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Our objective was to model the contribution of changes in shadowing and illumination to observations of changes in greenness from the Phenocam image time series at the Harvard Forest site.  Diurnal variability in canopy greenness from the Phenocam time series provides an independent evaluation of BRDF effects from changes in illumination and sun-sensor geometries.\nThe overall goal of this work is to develop a look-up table solution to correct major components of BRDF for tower-mounted imaging systems such as Phenocam, based on characteristics of the forest structure (forest height, canopy rugosity, fractional cover, and composition) and viewing geometry of the sensor. Given the sensitivity of tower-based systems to BRDF effects, efforts to correct artifacts of BRDF in phenology time series is critical to isolate seasonal changes in vegetation reflectance.",

            "abstract": "Most severe weather during the North American monsoon in the Southwest U.S. occurs in association with organized convection, including microbursts, dust storms, flash flooding and lightning. Our objective is to project how monsoon severe weather is changing due to anthropogenic global warming. We first consider a dynamically downscaled reanalysis (35 km grid spacing), generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model during the period 1948-2010. Individual severe weather events, identified by favorable thermodynamic conditions of instability and precipitable water, are then simulated for short-term, numerical weather prediction-type simulations of 24h at a convective-permitting scale (2 km grid spacing). Changes in the character of severe weather events within this period likely reflect long-term climate change driven by anthropogenic forcing. Next, we apply the identical model simulation and analysis procedures to several dynamically downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 models for the period 1950-2100, to assess how monsoon severe weather may change in the future and if these changes correspond with what is already occurring per the downscaled renalaysis and available observational data. The CMIP5 models we are downscaling (HadGEM and MPI-ECHAM6) will be included as part of North American CORDEX. The regional model experimental design for severe weather event projection reasonably accounts for the known operational forecast prerequisites for severe monsoon weather. The convective-permitting simulations show that monsoon convection appears to be reasonably well captured with the use of the dynamically downscaled reanalysis, in comparison to Stage IV precipitation data. The regional model tends to initiate convection too early, though correctly simulates the diurnal maximum in convection in the afternoon and subsequent westward propagation of thunderstorms. Projected changes in extreme event precipitation will be described in relation to the long-term changes in thermodynamic and dynamic forcing mechanisms for severe weather. Results from this project will be used for climate change impacts assessment for U.S. military installations in the region.",

            "abstract": "Policy-making in social-ecological systems increasingly looks to iterative, evolutionary approaches that can address the inherent complexity of interactions between human wellbeing, agricultural and aquacultural production, and ecosystem services. Here we show how an analysis of available time-series in delta regions over past decades can provide important insight into the social-ecological system dynamics that result from the complexity. The presentation summarises the recent changes for major elements of each social-ecological system, for example demography, economy, health, climate, food, and water. Time-series data from official statistics, monitoring programmes and sequential satellite imagery are analysed to define the range of trends, the presence of change points, slow and fast variables, and the significant drivers of change. For example, in the Bangladesh delta zone, increasing gross domestic product and per capita income levels since the 1980s mirror rising levels of food and inland fish production. In contrast, non-food ecosystem services such as water availability, water quality and land stability have deteriorated. As a result, poverty alleviation is associated with environmental degradation. Trends in indicators of human wellbeing and ecosystem services point to widespread non-stationary dynamics governed by slowly changing variables with increased probability of systemic threshold changes/tipping points in the near future. We conclude by examining how the findings could feed into new management tools, such as system dynamic models and assessments of safe operating spaces. Such tools have the potential to help create policies that deliver alternative and sustainable paths for land management while accommodating social and environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Here we present five new ring-width records from Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis) stands in northern California and southwestern Oregon to evaluate growth trends and their relation to climate across the species’ latitudinal range. The chronologies are made up of 173 living trees in total, and earliest adequate replication ranges from AD 1624 to AD 1812. The oldest tree sampled has an inner-ring date of AD 1340. Chronologies display shared variability in ring-width at inter-annual timescales; however, reliable cross-dating across the full study region is not possible. The five chronologies, together with one publicly available record, were compared to local and regional climate data. Significant correlations between red fir tree growth and local climate were found at all six sites but no relationship was consistent throughout the latitudinal gradient. Prior analysis has suggested that the growth of the species is primarily limited by summer minimum temperature, but this relationship was not apparent at most sites within our network. Instead, the associations observed between red fir growth and climate are multivariate, dependent on the temporal resolution of climate data used, and may also be influenced by both latitude and elevation.",

            "abstract": "The increasing frequency, scale, and damages associated with recent catastrophic events has called for a shift in focus from evading losses through risk analysis to improving threat preparation, planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation through resilience. However, neither underlying theory nor analytic tools have kept pace with resilience rhetoric. As a consequence, current approaches to engineering resilience analysis often conflate resilience and robustness or collapse into a deeper commitment to the risk analytic paradigm proven problematic in the first place. This research seeks a generalizable understanding of resilience that is applicable in multiple disciplinary contexts. We adopt a unique investigative perspective by coupling social and technical analysis with human subjects research to discover the adaptive actions, ideas and decisions that contribute to resilience in three socio-technical infrastructure systems: electric power, water, and roadways. Our research integrates physical models representing network objects with examination of the knowledge systems and social interactions revealed by human subjects making decisions in a simulated crisis environment. To ensure a diversity of contexts, we model electric power, water, roadway and knowledge networks for Phoenix AZ and Indianapolis IN. We synthesize this in a new computer-based Resilient Infrastructure Simulation Environment (RISE) to allow individuals, groups (including students) and experts to test different network design configurations and crisis response approaches. By observing simulated failures and best performances, we expect a generalizable understanding of resilience may emerge that yields a measureable understanding of the sensing, anticipating, adapting, and learning processes that are essential to resilient organizations.",

            "abstract": "There are sharp rises in the Sr- and Li-isotopic composition of seawater at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary that are generally thought to be associated with Himalayan uplift and associated climatic changes and continental weathering variability. In modeling such data the norm is to hold the chemical fluxes associated with off-axis hydrothermal circulation through the oceanic crust constant while varying the river fluxes (and/or isotopic ratios). There is, however, no a priori reason to assume the chemical fluxes (or isotopic compositions) associated with off-axis hydrothermal systems should stay constant. Instead, changing environmental conditions (e.g. seawater composition and bottom water temperature) will lead to changes in these fluxes. An alternative model to explain the sharp rise in the Sr- and Li-isotopic composition of seawater at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary is cooling of the deep ocean. Decreased reaction rates in the oceanic crust, due to decreasing temperature, can be shown to lead to a decrease in the flux of unradiogenic Sr into the ocean. The magnitude matches, within uncertainty, that required to explain the increase in seawater Sr-isotopic composition [Coogan and Dosso, in review]. The story for Li is more uncertain. Two factors may lead to smaller effective fractionation factors between seawater and the (large) Li sink in the oceanic crust when bottom water is warmer: (i) higher temperature will decrease the isotopic fractionation factor; (ii) the more extensive fluid-rock reaction in the ocean crust when bottom water is warmer will make Li uptake by the oceanic crust more efficient. All other things being equal this will lead to a lower Li content of seawater. In turn, a lower Li content in seawater will mean that for a given Li-uptake rate by the crust the effective fractionation factor is smaller, due to Rayleigh distillation of Li-isotopes during fluid-rock reaction in the oceanic crust. In combination these factors predict a significant (many per mil), but poorly constrained, increase in the Li-isotopic composition of the ocean due to cooling bottom water. Models of many geochemical species, including carbon [Coogan and Gillis, 2013], should include environmentally dependent fluxes from off-axis hydrothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that the production of fish in the water column is related to the amount of primary production in the surface waters. Most future Earth scenarios suggest that as the climate warms, increased surface ocean stratification will decrease nutrient availability and therefore net primary productivity and fish production. Here we calculate accumulation rates of ichthyoliths (microfossil fish teeth and shark dermal scales) throughout the Paleogene and find that ichthyolith accumulation is inversely related to hypothesized changes in primary productivity, but is positively related to ocean temperature. At DSDP Site 596 in the South Pacific, and ODP Site 1258 from the equatorial Atlantic, accumulation of fish fossils increase 6-10 fold from the relatively cool Paleocene into the warm Early Eocene Climate Optimum. In contrast, cooling and increased biosilica deposition at the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) Boundary suggests that the marine ecosystem switched to a highly productive diatom-dominated ocean, which should favor short, efficient food chains and increased fish production. However, we find that at both Pacific DSDP Site 596 and Atlantic DSDP Site 522, fish accumulation drops by about 50% across the E/O.\nIndeed, this relation between ichthyolith accumulation and δ18O-estimated paleotemperature is also seen in the Oligocene, at North Pacific ODP Site 886, where warming in the middle Oligocene is mirrored by an increase in ichthyolith accumulation. It appears that ichthyolith accumulation rate may not be purely an effect of total primary production in the water column but rather, may reflect a fundamental response in fish physiology or ecosystem efficiency to warmer water. It has been documented that respiration is faster and more efficient in warm waters, and this may help generate more efficient food web links that compensate for any decrease in primary productivity caused by global warming. Indeed, it appears that fish seem to thrive as the temperature goes up.",

This has significantly hindered data-driven scientific discovery and advances in the polar research and Earth sciences community. In an effort to solve this problem we have investigated and developed innovative techniques for the construction of ``condensate database'', which is much smaller than the original data yet still captures the key characteristics (e.g., spatio-temporal norm and changes). In addition we are taking advantage of parallel databases that make use of low cost GPU processors. As a result, efficient anomaly detection and quality assurance can be achieved with in-memory data analysis or limited I/O requests. The challenges lie in the fact that cryospheric data are massive and diverse, with normal/abnomal patterns spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This project consists of investigations in three main areas: (1) adaptive neighborhood-based thresholding in both space and time; (2) compressive-domain pattern detection and change analysis; and (3) hybrid and adaptive condensation of multi-modal, multi-scale cryospheric data.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is contributing to rapid vegetation shifts in the ecologically sensitive arctic tundra. These tussock grass dominated systems are shifting to tussock/woody shrub communities with cascading ecological and climate feedback consequences. This shifting vegetation composition should result in concomitant changes in carbon sequestration (net ecosystem exchange, NEE) and productivity which in turn could be manifested in “Greening” and changes in normalized difference vegetation index values (NDVI). In this study, we address the need to know the relationships between NDVI, leaf area, and shrub biomass, in part so that long-term trends in NDVI can be much more accurately interpreted as true changes in ecosystem C cycling processes. These relationships will enhance our ability to predict shifts in standing carbon mass, carbon cycling, and use historic satellite products to assess change. We sampled NEE, NDVI, leaf area and shrub (Betula spp. and Salix spp.) biomass across a shrub gradient in a dry heath and moist acidic tundra. The positive relationship between NDVI and NEE highlights the potential shifts in tundra carbon sequestration associated with woody vegetation shifts. Furthermore, strong positive linear relationships found among shrub biomass, species, leaf area, and NDVI in different tundra habitats should increase the robustness of spatial scaling. Increased productivity in sites with increased NDVI can provide a mechanism through which tundra ecosystems may respond to climate change. Improvements in our ability to detect relationships between above and belowground biomass for the dominant shrubs can strengthen our ability to predict standing biomass from satellite imagery.",

The aim of the present study is to better understand inter-model differences in projected cloud changes and to constrain the cloud feedback to warming. To do this, we compute independent relationships of cloud properties (cloud fraction, cloud-top height, and cloud radiative effect) to interannual variations in sea surface temperature, estimated inversion strength, horizontal surface temperature advection, free-tropospheric humidity, and subsidence using observations and as simulated by models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5. Each relationship is considered to be independent because it represents the association between some cloud property and a meteorological parameter when the other parameters are held constant. We approximate modelled cloud trends in climate change simulations as the sum of the simulated cloud/meteorology relationships multiplied by the respective meteorological trends. We compare these estimated cloud trends to the sum of the observed cloud/meteorology relationships multiplied by the simulated meteorological trends. This method allows us to better understand the sources of inter-model differences in projected cloud changes, including whether cloud/meteorology relationships or meteorological trends dominate the spread of cloud changes. We approximate the true cloud trend due to climate change as the sum of the observed cloud/meteorology relationships multiplied by the multi-model mean meteorological trends.

            "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed an explosion in atmospheric characterization of spatially unresolved exoplanets using transmission spectra of transiting planets, but understanding has been hampered by degeneracies resolvable through blue optical observations. Here, scattered light is more important than the Wien tail of re-radiated thermal emission. Therefore, the next frontier in exoplanet characterization lies in the direct detection of scattered light. The polarization state of starlight scattered by a planetary atmosphere distinguishes it from the direct light from the host star, and the inherently differential nature of polarimetry reduces systematic effects to the point where ground-based detections are possible. Furthermore, polarimetry is uniquely sensitive to the size distribution, shape, and chemical composition of atmospheric cloud particles as well as to the scattering optical depth. I will review the current state of exoplanet polarimetry, which is dominated not by photon noise but by non-Gaussian systematic effects. Ground-based detection of order ten exoplanet photons relative to the host star’s million requires dense orbital phase coverage and therefore long observing programs. However, variability inherent in the host star, interstellar medium, Earth’s atmosphere, the telescope, and the instrument at all timescales must be measured and subtracted in order to definitively uncover scattered light from the exoplanet. While polarimetry is in principle sensitive to exoplanets regardless of orbital inclination, repeated observations of transiting exoplanet systems during secondary eclipse events are required to measure the polarimetric variability of the system that cannot be due to the planet. The emergence of scattered light polarimetry as a robust tool for the study of exoplanet atmospheres, and eventually surfaces, therefore requires diligent attention to the role of systematic effects.",

The method was benchmarked against an independent Successive Orders of Scattering code and linearized through the use of Jacobians. Incorporated with the multi-patch optimization algorithm and look-up-table method, simultaneous aerosol and ocean color retrievals were performed using imagery acquired by the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) when it was operated in step-and-stare mode with 9 viewing angles ranging between ±67°. Data from channels near 355, 380, 445, 470*, 555, 660*, and 865* nm were used in the retrievals, where the asterisk denotes the polarimetric bands.\nRetrievals were run for AirMSPI overflights over Southern California and Monterey Bay, CA. For the relatively high aerosol optical depth (AOD) case (~0.28 at 550 nm), the retrieved aerosol concentration, size distribution, water-leaving radiance, and chlorophyll concentration were compared to those reported by the USC SeaPRISM AERONET-OC site off the coast of Southern California on 6 February 2013. For the relatively low AOD case (~0.08 at 550 nm), the retrieved aerosol concentration and size distribution were compared to those reported by the Monterey Bay AERONET site on 28 April 2014. Further, we evaluate the benefits of multi-angle and polarimetric observations by performing the retrievals using (a) all view angles and channels; (b) all view angles but radiances only (no polarization); (c) the nadir view angle only with both radiance and polarization; and (d) the nadir view angle without polarization. Optimized retrievals using different initial guesses were performed to provide a measure of retrieval uncertainty. Removal of multi-angular or polarimetric information resulted in increases in both parameter uncertainty and systematic bias. Potential accuracy improvements afforded by applying constraints on the surface and aerosol parametric models will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The release of U and As from abandoned mine wastes obtained from a site in the Navajo Nation in Northeastern Arizona was assessed by integrating spectroscopy, microscopy, and aqueous chemistry techniques. X-ray fluorescence analyses detected concentrations of 0.6% U, 0.4 % V, and 0.3% Fe. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the presence of 73% Fe(II), 27% Fe(III), and the predominance of U(VI), V(V), and As(0). Transmission electron microscopy analyses detected the presence of amorphous carnotite [K2(UO2)2(VO4)2·3H2O]. The proportional release of U and V into solution was measured for chemical extractions using 10 mM ascorbic acid (~pH 3.5) using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy after 96 hours of reaction (sampled periodically). A similar proportional release of As and Fe after 2 hours of reaction was observed for chemical extractions using the same conditions mentioned previously. Lower concentrations of U, V, As, and Fe were released from chemical extractions using 10 mM bicarbonate (~pH 8.3). The integration of spectroscopy, microscopy, and aqueous chemical extractions suggest that carnotite and an As-Fe-bearing mineral phase (likely arsenopyrite) control the dissolution of U and As in these abandoned mine wastes. This has important environmental implications related to contamination of water sources in communities that live in the proximity of abandoned mine wastes.",

            "abstract": "Projected increases in global population will put enormous pressure on fresh water resources in the coming decades. Approximately 70 percent of human water use is allocated to agriculture with 40 percent of global food production originating from irrigated lands. Growing demand for food will only worsen the strain placed on many irrigated agricultural systems resulting in an unsustainable reliance on groundwater. This work represents an effort to improve the operability of the recently developed and promising cosmic-ray neutron method for estimating field-scale soil moisture. The cosmic-ray sensor passively measures above ground low-energy neutrons, which correlate to the amount of water within the measurement area (a circle with radius of ~300 m and a depth of ~30 cm). The sensor sees all forms of water (hydrogen), therefore time-varying water in growing biomass should be accounted for to reduce systematic measurement error and bias. Two vegetation indices were used to estimate fresh biomass within study agricultural fields near York, NE. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GRNDVI) were both calculated from MODIS 500 m resolution satellite reflectance data for the summer of 2014. Additionally, in-situ biomass samples were collected from study fields to compare to biomass estimates obtained from MODIS reflectance data. Preliminary results suggest that remotely sensed fresh biomass estimates collected over the course of a growing season were sufficient and accurate enough (~ within 1 kg/m2) to eliminate the systematic error in the cosmic-ray calibration method for both soybean and maize crops. The incorporation of this novel technique for soil moisture management in producer operations has the potential to increase the efficiency of irrigation water use.",

            "abstract": "Deformation patterns in subducting oceanic lithosphere reflect the state-of-stress in the plate: slab-pull forces and bending stresses overcome compressional forces generated at the plate boundary interface, giving rise to outer-rise normal faulting. Recent studies provide extensive constraints on outer-rise faulting patterns, subducting and overriding plate structure and plate kinematics. Here, we use these new observations from the Tonga subduction zone and high-resolution numerical simulations to systematically test how the thickness and strength of the subduction interface affects outer-rise faulting patterns. In contrast to previous numerical models of outer-rise faulting that examine deformation in highly dynamic, time-dependent systems, we construct a 2D thermo-mechanical, elastic-viscous-plastic model based on the present structure of the Tonga subduction system. Thermal and compositional variations in the upper mantle (down to 700 km depth) define a cross-sectional slice of the present day slab structure and drive deformation through slab-pull (no velocity boundary conditions). Bathymetry and oceanic plate ages define the thickness and shape (i.e. curvature) of the subducting and overriding plate lithosphere. The plate boundary interface, accretionary wedge and overriding plate geometry (near the trench) follow structures outlined by a regional, lithospheric-scale tomography study (Contreras-Reyes et al., 2011). High numerical resolution (100-200 m) in the vicinity of the trench permits resolving the plate-boundary interface down to a thickness of 1 km. Consequently, we can systematically test how the thickness and strength of the plate-boundary interface influences outer-rise deformation over short time scales ($< 5$ Myr) and compare the results directly to observations. Preliminary results show deformation near the plate boundary is highly sensitive to the strength of the plate-boundary interface and accretionary wedge. Presented work will focus on the sensitivity of deformation patterns to both the numerical parameters (resolution, viscosity limits) and structure (thickness, strength) defining the plate boundary interface.",

A year of Landsat 8 data over the Conterminous United States (CONUS), composed of 11,296 acquisitions, was analyzed comparing the spatial and temporal incidence of these cloud and cirrus states. This revealed (i) 36.5% of observations were detected with high confidence cloud with spatio-temporal patterns similar to those observed by previous Landsat 7 cloud analyses, (ii) 29.2% were high confidence cirrus, (iii) 20.9% were both high confidence cloud and high confidence cirrus, (iv) 8.3% were detected as high confidence cirrus but not as high confidence cloud. The results illustrate the value of the cirrus band for improved Landsat 8 terrestrial monitoring but imply that the historical CONUS Landsat archive has a similar 8% of undetected cirrus contaminated pixels.

However, in these landscapes the ground may thaw up to a meter during summer, and microtopography on lake shores and ground ice gradients may promote subsurface flow. Using permeameter and infiltration tests coupled with lake water budgets, we test the hypothesis that subsurface flow may be an important component of arctic lake water budgets after the spring freshet. Water budgets incorporating only evaporation, precipitation, and stream discharge indicated substantial, unmeasured fluxes that varied in direction and magnitude in full and partially-drained lakes. We were able to successfully reproduce the observed fluxes with a model incorporating drainage from thawing soils, storm runoff, and lake edge evapotranspiration. Thaw drainage was the dominant flux in a full lake, and runoff and evapotranspiration became increasingly important in partially drained lake basins. Our results suggest that supra-permafrost flow is an important component of arctic lake water budgets that must be considered to accurately predict water, solute, and heat fluxes in a changing Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The Mars atmosphere is composed of 95% CO2, 25% of which is cycled through the seasonal CO2 ice caps annually. During the polar night, surface temperatures drop to ~145 K and CO2 ice can begin to directly condense. Also, atmospheric temperatures can drop even lower, allowing for the formation of CO2 snow. During the spring, the CO2 ice sublimes thus completing the annual CO2 cycle. While significant study has been conducted to characterize and model the annual CO2 cycle, little has been done to investigate the possibility of a diurnal CO2 cycle.\nThere are two general locations where the diurnal exchange of surface CO2 ice with the atmosphere can occur: (1) the higher elevations of the Tharsis region and (2) the edges of the seasonal polar caps. This presentation will focus on the Tharsis region. The low surface thermal inertia, due to a thick layer of dust, and the low atmospheric pressure of the Tharsis region allow for diurnal temperature ranges from at or near the CO2 frost temperature (~140 K at 2 mbar) during pre-dawn hours to temperatures above the triple point of water during mid-day.\nThe Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer showed evidence of CO2 ice deposition near the summit of Olympus Mons at 2 am local time. Spectra from the coldest data observed are generally flat through the 25 μm region, suggesting slab or coarse grained CO2 ice. The 15 μm region of the spectra shows a warm atmosphere, suggesting that the formation of CO2 snow is unlikely. The Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging System showed consistently that much of the surface is at or near the frost point of CO2, suggesting the possible widespread presence of CO2 ice deposits during the pre-dawn hours.\nSimple energy balance considerations suggest that a nightly CO2 deposit that completely sublimes away shortly after dawn, could be as thick as 1.6 kg/m3 (~1 mm if deposit is slab ice with no porosity). Further constraints on the details of the Tharsis diurnal CO2 cycle will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The SE US and the Amazon have large sources of biogenic VOCs and varying anthropogenic pollution impact, and often poor aerosol model performance. Recent results on the sources, properties, aging, and impact of anthropogenic pollution on OA and secondary OA (SOA) over these regions will be presented. SOA from IEPOX accounts for 14-17% of the OA on average over the SE US and extending up to 6 km. Higher IEPOX-SOA correlates with airmasses of high isoprene, IEPOX, sulfate, acidity, and lower NO. The IEPOX organosulfate accounts for ~10% of IEPOX-SOA over the SE US. The AMS ion C5H6O+ is shown to be a good marker of IEPOX-SOA, while total m/z 82 (as in ACSM) suffers larger interferences. The sinks of IEPOX-SOA via both OH oxidation and evaporation are slow. The low-volatility of IEPOX-SOA contrasts with the small semivolatile molecules that have so far been identified as its components, suggesting the importance of oligomerization. Urban SOA is estimated to account for 25% of the OA in the SE US using either the GEOS-Chem model or the measured 14C (using recent results that urban SOA (POA) is 30% (50%) non-fossil, mainly due to cooking emissions).\nAn oxidation flow reactor (OFR) is used to investigate SOA formation by OH, O3, and NO3 in-situ. Largest SOA formation is always observed at night when monoterpenes (MT) are largest, and is underpredicted by SOA models that use MT as precursors but ignore partially-oxidized products. Closure results from models (VBS and GECKO-A) that account for the whole oxidation chain will be presented.\nThe partitioning of organic acids is found to proceed rapidly in response to temperature changes, in contrast with recent reports of very slow equilibration. The agreement with absorptive partitioning theory is reasonable for most species, except small acids that may be formed by thermal decomposition during analysis. Partitioning data from four instruments is compared, with reasonable agreement in many cases including the rapid response to temperature changes. Partitioning to aerosol water is minor for most of the measured species.\nLow volatility products of isoprene oxidation were measured during FIXCIT, forming via several pathways and depositing quickly to chamber walls and aerosol seeds. Their presence in ambient air during SOAS and the ability of GECKO-A to predict their formation are explored.",

            "abstract": "Shale gas production via hydrofracturing has profoundly changed the energy portfolio in the USA and other parts of the world. Under the shale gas reservior conditions, CO2 and H2O, either in residence or being injected during hydrofracturing or both, co-exist with CH4. One important feature characteristic of shale is the presence of nanometer-scale (1-100 nm) pores in shale or mudstone. The interactions among CH4, CO2 and H2O in those nano-sized pores directly impact shale gas storage and gas release from the shale matrix. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of interactions among CH4, CO2 and H2O in nanopore confinement would provide guidance in addressing a number of problems such as rapid decline in production after a few years and low recovery rates. We are systematically investigating the P-V-T-X properties and adsorption kinetics in the CH4-CO2-H2O system under the reservior conditions.\nWe have designed and constructed a unique high temperature and pressure experimental system that can measure both of the P-V-T-X properties and adsorption kinetics sequentially. We measure the P-V-T-X properties of CH4-CO2 mixtures with CH4 up to 95 vol. %, and adsorption kinetics of various materials, under the conditions relevant to shale gas reservoir. We use three types of materials: (I) model materials, (II) single solid phases separated from shale samples, and (III) crushed shale samples from both the known shale gas producing formations and the shale gas barren formations. The model materials are well characterized in terms of pore sizes. Therefore, the results associated with the model material serve as benchmarks for our model development.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

            "abstract": "Ground ice features such as ice wedges, segregation ice, and thermokarst cave ice are present in the subsurface in a variety of spatial scales and patterns. Accurately identifying the character and extent of these ice features in permafrost terrains allows engineers and planners to cost effectively create innovative infrastructure designs to withstand the changing environment. We are assembling a holistic view of how a variety of surficial and standoff geophysical measurements can be combined with classic ground based measurements to delineate subsurface permafrost features. We are combining horizontal geophysical measurements; borehole mapping; multispectral and radar remote sensing; airborne and ground-based LiDAR; snow, soil, and vegetation mapping; and subsurface thermal measurements and modeling at three field sites in discontinuous permafrost of Interior Alaska. Our sites cross transects representing upland and lowland permafrost and a variety of soil and vegetation compositions. With our measurements we identified and mapped a 300 meter wide swath of ice rich frozen peat at one of our lowland field sites. The high ice content was confirmed with borehole measurements. This ice rich permafrost region yields higher electrical resistivity values than the nearby permafrost and is associated with anomalously low seasonal thaw depths compared to other sites nearby. Surface soils in the ice rich region have high soil moisture contents, low redox potential (30-100 mV), and elevated soil microbial activity. The ice rice region yields low phase changes from paired interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements collected in late spring and late summer. One interpretation of this result is that the ice rich area experiences minimal summer season subsidence. Taken in total, our results suggest the ice rich peat region has distinct surface signatures and subsurface geophysical characteristics that may be extrapolated to other areas to identify ice rich permafrost in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "The study of aerosol pollution transport and optical properties in the western U.S. is a challenge due to the complex terrain, bright surfaces, presence of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, secondary organic aerosol formation, and smoke from wild fires. In addition, the complex terrain influences transport phenomena by recirculating mountain air from California to Nevada, where air pollution from the Sierra Nevada Mountains (SNM) is mixed with urban air from the Central Valley in California. Previous studies in Reno hypothesize that elevated aerosol concentrations aloft, above the convective boundary layer height, make air quality monitoring in Reno challenging with MODIS products. Here, we analyze data from August 2013 as a case study for wildfire smoke plumes in California and Nevada. During this time period, northern California was impacted by large wild fires known as the American and Yosemite Rim fires. Thousands of acres burned, generating large quantities of aerosol pollutants that were transported downwind. The aim of the present work is to investigate the fire plume behavior and transport phenomena using ground level PM2.5 concentrations from routine monitoring networks and aerosol optical properties from AERONET, both at multiple locations in California and Nevada. In addition, the accuracy of MODIS (Collection 6) and VIIRS aerosol satellite products will be evaluated. The multispectral photoacoustic instruments and reciprocal nephelometers located in Reno support the estimation of approximated aerosol height. The objectives are to investigate the impact of the vertical distribution of PM concentrations on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals; assess the ability to estimate ground level PM2.5 mass concentrations for wildfire smoke plumes from satellite remote sensing; and investigate the influence of complex terrain on the transport of pollutants, convective boundary layer depth, and aerosol optical height.",

            "abstract": "To support a climate dynamics multidisciplinary curriculum for graduate and senior university students, I will describe on-line modules on volcanic eruptions and climate, geoengineering, and nuclear winter. Each of these topics involves aerosols in the stratosphere and the response of the climate system, but each is distinct, and each is evolving as more research becomes available. As reported for the first time in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, volcanic eruptions are a natural analog for the climate impacts of potential anthropogenic aerosol injections into the stratosphere, either sulfates from potential attempts to cool the climate to counteract global warming, or smoke that would be produced from fires in cities and industrial targets in a nuclear war. The volcanic eruptions module would stand alone, and would also serve as a prerequisite for each of the other two modules, which could be taught independently of each other. Each module includes consideration of the physical climate system as well as impacts of the resulting climate change. Geoengineering includes both solar radiation management and carbon dioxide reduction. The geoengineering and nuclear winter modules also include consideration of policy and governance issues. Each module includes a slide set for use in lecturing, links to related resources, and student exercises. The modules will be regularly updated.",

            "abstract": "Middle Cenozoic magmatism in the Four Corners region of the United States produced alkalic mantle magmas that were emplaced in diatreme-dike complexes of the 25-24 Ma Navajo volcanic field (NVF) and small-volume 20-5 Ma dike swarms on the northeastern San Juan Basin and western flanks of the San Juan Mountains. Magmatism involved partial melting of Proterozoic lithospheric mantle that underwent regional metasomatism during Laramide subduction. Emplacement of magmas was focused on zones that were broadly aligned with lithospheric-scale anisotropies (e.g., Colorado lineament). The majority of intrusive rocks produced are minette, but included small amounts of katungite formed by melting of carbonate rich mantle.\nA northward decrease in intrusion age is mimicked by subtle variations in major and trace element geochemistry. Compared to the 20-5 Ma dike rocks, NVF intrusions have higher overall Mg# (> 55), K2O (5-6 wt. %), La/Lu (300–1000), and elevated concentrations of incompatible trace elements (e.g. Rb, Ba, Zr). The katungite samples are marked by extreme silica undersaturation (SiO2 ~34 wt. %), and higher MgO (~15 wt. %) and FeO (~13 wt. %) than the minettes. Isotopic signatures of the minettes are relatively homogenous, falling within a lithospheric mantle field spanning 87Sr/86Sr 0.705-0.707 and εNd +2 to -2; except the Dulce dikes which have anomalously lower εNd. Isotopic signatures of the katungites plot between the minettes and average OIB.\nThe spatial variations in geochemical signatures over time are attributed to either compositional variation in mantle sources ± different degrees of melting of lithospheric mantle; crustal contamination was insignificant. The lower concentrations of incompatible elements in the 20-5 Ma minettes might be explained by depletion of the lithospheric mantle caused by earlier voluminous volcanism in the San Juan Mountains. Alternatively, greater lithospheric fertility in Colorado may have promoted higher percentage partial melts in the mantle diluting the trace element concentrations of the 20-5 Ma minettes.",

The permanent GPS network of GPS stations around the Earth recorded more than 15 years of data, which comprise the elastic response of the bed rock movements induced by mass loading. The inversion of the observed displacements, yields mass variations which can be interpreted as CWS under the condition that no other mass loading is interfering. GPS-derived CWS offers complimentary information to the widely used CWS determination by GRACE but is also able to mitigate a possible loss of data in case the GRACE mission ends before the launch of the GRACE Follow-On mission. GPS also allows increasing the temporal resolution (weekly from GPS versus monthly from GRACE) and the spatial resolution (especially in the regions with dense GPS networks). Here, we determine the weekly mass variations from GPS 3-D coordinates by using mass-loading Green’s function in six Danube sub-basins. The results are validated against GRACE and hydro-meteorological models. We also demonstrate the contribution of GPS horizontals for regional water storage and provide insights into the benefits and limitations of 3-D GPS inversions for regional water storage.",

            "abstract": "A significant fraction of the ambient short-period seismic noise at a given site may be attributed to P, S, Rayleigh and Love waves with spectral characteristics strongly dependent on the geological structure underlying the recording station. Unlike an underground nuclear explosion, an earthquake may have intense pre-event activity within the hypocentral region. This pre-earthquake activity may occur at one or more places at various depths mostly within the hypocentral region and over short and/or long periods of time, leading to significant temporal variations in the geological environment. Some of this activity, such as generation of new cracks, may create seismic waves contributing to short-period seismic noise. All these underground phenomena will have significant influence on the spectral characteristics of noise as observed at nearby three-component recording stations.\nKachchh, India Mw 5.1 Earthquake of 19 June 2012 was well recorded at several broadband stations at various epicentral distances. Analysis of limited data from two stations has indicated two distinct premonitory variations in the low-frequency (less than 0.5 Hz) spectral characteristics of noise, initiating several days before the earthquake: (1) systematic shift of peak frequencies to lower values and (2) significant changes among the three components (vertical V, radial, R and transverse, T) of ground motion, evidenced by spectral ratios such as T/R. These results for premonitory variations are similar to those observed for several earthquakes in the United States. Although these preliminary results need to be confirmed by analyzing considerably more data from several additional recording stations, they appear to suggest an entirely new methodology for obtaining advance warning of a few days or more before a large earthquake.",

The model utilizes an improved convection scheme and a correlated-k radiative transfer scheme, capable of accurately modeling both water-rich and CO2-rich atmospheres while maintaining adequate computational efficiency. We explore hot climates caused both by the inevitable increase in the solar constant over time and by the addition of large amounts of CO2 into our present atmosphere. With the current atmospheric CO2 inventory, a runaway greenhouse is not triggered until the Sun becomes greater than 17.5% brighter than today. However, near a 12.5% increase in the solar constant, the climate system experiences an abrupt transition from a warm state (Ts < 305 K) to a moist greenhouse state (Ts > 330 K). Projections for anthropogenic CO2 emissions predict that in an extreme scenario humans could elevate CO2 ~10 times beyond the present atmospheric level. We find that such a case would not trigger a runaway greenhouse. Excessively large CO2 partial pressures (>0.2 bar) may trigger a runaway under the current solar insolation, however, such high levels of CO2 are unlikely to occur.",

            "abstract": "Despite its critical importance to global food security, approximately 60% of water used for agriculture is wasted each year through inadequate water conservation, losses in distribution, and inefficient irrigation. Therefore, in order to coordinate a strategy to accomplish the agricultural demands in the future we must maintain a stable global food and water trade while increasing crop yield and efficiency. This research aims to improve the operability of the novel cosmic-ray neutron method used for estimating field scale soil moisture. The sensor works by passively counting the above ground low-energy neutrons which correlates to the amount of water in the measurement volume (a circle with radius of ~300 m and vertical depth of ~30 cm). Because the sensor responds to different forms of water (sources of hydrogen), estimates of background water in the mineral soil and soil organic matter must be accounted in order to minimize measurement error. Here we compared field-scale estimates of soil mineral water and soil organic matter with readily available global datasets. Using the newly compiled 1 km resolution Global Soil Dataset (GSDE), we investigate the correlation between (1) soil mineral water and clay content and (2) in-situ soil organic material. Preliminary results of in-situ samples from forty study sites around the globe suggest the GSDE dataset has sufficiently low bias and uncertainty (~ within 0.01 g/g of water equivalent) to better isolate the soil moisture signal from the neutron count information. Incorporation of this dataset will allow for real-time soil moisture mapping of hundreds of center-pivots using the mobile cosmic-ray sensor without the need of time-consuming in-situ soil sampling. The incorporation of this novel technique for soil moisture management has the potential to increase the efficiency of irrigation water use.",

            "abstract": "The temporal and spatial variations of the thermosphere mass density during a variety of idealized substorms were investigated using the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) simulation and Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite. From the GITM simulation, the maximum mass density perturbation of an idealized substorm with a peak variation of Hemispheric Power (HP) Index of 50 GW and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bz of -2 nT was ~14% about 50 min after the substorm onset in the nightside sector of the aurora zone. About 110 min after onset, a negative mass density perturbation (~-5%) occurred in the night sector, which was consistent with the mass density measurement of the CHAMP satellite. Further investigation suggests that a large scale in situ gravity wave was generated in the aurora zone and propagated to the mid and low latitudes. Simulations with IMF Bz changes, with HP being constant and HP changing and IMF Bz being constant were run to investigate any nonlinearities in the combined response. The mass density perturbation due the IMF Bz variation peaks in the dusk sector and the density perturbation due to HP input peaks in the nightside sector. The non-linear of the mass density response to different energy input is less than 6%. The thermospheric mass density at higher altitudes is more sensitive to the Joule heating energy input. The change in hemisphere power adds electron density to lower altitudes, so the heating due to the HP change is at lower altitudes than the heating due to the IMF Bz change. This causes the density change due to the HP change to be larger than the density change due to the IMF change.",

            "abstract": "Local meteorology, crop management practices and site characteristics have important impacts on carbon and water cycling in agricultural ecosystems. This study focuses on carbon and water fluxes measured using eddy covariance (EC) methods and crop simulation models in the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW), in association with the Regional Approaches to Climate Change (REACCH) program. The agricultural ecosystem is currently challenged by higher pressure on water resources as a consequence of population growth and increasing exposure to impacts associated with different types of crop managements. In addition, future climate projections for this region show a likely increase in temperature and significant reductions in precipitation that will affect carbon and water dynamics. This new scenario requires an understanding of crop management by assessing efficient ways to face the impacts of climate change at the micrometeorological level, especially in regards to carbon and water flow. We focus on three different crop management sites. One site (LIND) under crop-fallow is situated in a low-rainfall area. The other two sites, one no-till site (CAF-NT) and one conventional tillage site (CAF-CT), are located in an area of high-rainfall with continuous cropping. In this study, we used CropSyst micro-basin model to simulate the responses in carbon and water budgets at each site. Based on the EC processed results for net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2, the CAF-NT site was a carbon sink during 2013 when spring garbanzo was planted; while the paired CAF-CT site, under similar crop rotation and meteorological conditions, was a carbon source during the same period. The LIND site was also a carbon sink where winter wheat was growing during 2013. Model results for CAF-NT showed good agreement with the EC carbon and water flux measurements during 2013. Through comparisons between measurements and modeling results, both short and long term processes that influence carbon and water cycling in the agricultural ecosystems are better understood.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, introductory hydrology courses focus on hydrologic processes as independent or semi-independent concepts that are ultimately integrated into a watershed model near the end of the term. When an “off-the-shelf” watershed model is introduced in the curriculum, this approach can result in a potential disconnect between process-based hydrology and the inherent interconnectivity of processes within the water cycle. In order to curb this and reduce the learning curve associated with applying hydrologic concepts to complex real-world problems, we developed the open-access Modular Distributed Watershed Educational Toolbox (MOD-WET). The user-friendly, MATLAB-based toolbox contains the same physical equations for hydrological processes (i.e. precipitation, snow, radiation, evaporation, unsaturated flow, infiltration, groundwater, and runoff) that are presented in the companion e-textbook (http://aqua.seas.ucla.edu/margulis_intro_to_hydro_textbook.html) and taught in the classroom. The modular toolbox functions can be used by students to study individual hydrologic processes. These functions are integrated together to form a simple spatially-distributed watershed model, which reinforces a holistic understanding of how hydrologic processes are interconnected and modeled. Therefore when watershed modeling is introduced, students are already familiar with the fundamental building blocks that have been unified in the MOD-WET model. Extensive effort has been placed on the development of a highly modular and well-documented code that can be run on a personal computer within the commonly-used MATLAB environment. MOD-WET was designed to: 1) increase the qualitative and quantitative understanding of hydrological processes at the basin-scale and demonstrate how they vary with watershed properties, 2) emphasize applications of hydrologic concepts rather than computer programming, 3) elucidate the underlying physical processes that can often be obscured with a complicated “off-the-shelf” watershed model in an introductory hydrology course, and 4) reduce the learning curve associated with analyzing meaningful real-world problems. The open-access MOD-WET and e-textbook have already been successfully incorporated within our undergraduate curriculum.",

The Eastern Taiwan Earthquake Research Center (E-TEC) is established on 2013/09/24 in National Dong Hwa University and collaborates with Central Weather Bureau (CWB), National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR), Institute of Earth Science of Academia Sinica (IES, AS) and other institutions (NCU, NTU, CCU) and aims to provide an integrated platform for researchers to conduct the new advances on earthquake precursors and early warning for seismic disaster prevention in the eastern Taiwan, as frequent temblors are most common in the East Taiwan rift valley. E-TEC intends to integrate the multi-disciplinary observations and is equipped with stations to monitor a wide array of factors of quake precursors, including seismicity, GPS, strain-meter, ground water, geochemistry, gravity, electromagnetic, ionospheric density, thermal infrared remote sensing, gamma radiation etc, and will maximize the value of the data for researches with the range of monitoring equipment that enable to predict where and when the next devastated earthquake will strike Taiwan and develop reliable earthquake prediction models. A preliminary study on earthquake precursor using monthly Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) data before 2013/03/27 Mw6.2 Nantou earthquake in Taiwan is presented. Using the statistical analysis, the result shows the peak of the anomalous LST that exceeds a standard deviation of LST appeared on 2013/03/09 and became less or none anomalies observed on 2013/03/16 before the main-shock, which is in consist with the phenomenon observed by other researchers. This preliminary experimental result shows that the thermal anomalies reveal the possibility to associate surface thermal phenomena before the strong earthquakes.",

As a result, while scientific results may be highly relevant to society that relevance is operationally far from clear.\nThis paper explores the use of shared learning processes to bridge the gap between the evolving body of scientific information on climate change and its relevance for resilience planning in cities across Asia. Examples related to understanding uncertainty, the evolution of scientific knowledge from different sources, and data extraction and presentation are given using experiences generated over five years of work as part of the Rockefeller Foundation supported Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network and other programs. Results suggest that processes supporting effective translation of knowledge between different sources and different applications are essential for the identification of solutions that respond to the dynamics and uncertainties inherent in global change processes.",

Its closest approach from the centre of the planet will be 135,000 km, and its predicted visual magnitude as low as -5.3 (JPL Horizons web site). The observing conditions will be ideal to attempt spectroscopic measurements of the inner coma from the UV to the IR at an unprecedented spectral resolution from the instruments located on and around Mars.\nChemCam is a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy instrument operating on-board the Mars Science Laboratory rover to analyse the chemical composition of rocks and can be used for passive spectroscopy. ChemCam is equipped with high resolution spectrometers covering the optical range (240–850 nm) with a pixel resolution of 0.05nm up to 470nm and 0.2nm in the near-IR range. The ChemCam passive spectroscopy field of view is 0.65 mrad wide and covers several 100km projected on the coma. Based on predicted magnitude and inner coma intensity variations, we expect to retrieve spectral signatures around the nucleus. Simultaneously the 7 instruments on board Mars Express will take measurements in nadir and limb modes. We will merge the results obtained with ChemCam with those of the 2 imaging spectrometers SPICAM (110-310 nm resolution of 0.6nm and 1-1.7 µm resolution of 1.5 nm) and OMEGA (457-910 nm resolution of 1.5 nm and 2.5-5.1 µm resolution of 15 nm) to obtain the composition and spatial variation of emitting molecules in the different parts of the coma. The instruments will also monitor the atmosphere before and after the encounter to detect any change.\nWe will report on the preparations for the observations and the spectroscopy results, with emphasis on the detection of complex organic molecules and the spatial distribution of H2O and OH in the inner coma. A decision will be made on the adequacy of risk reduction activities for the spacecraft, and planned science operations may need to be cancelled by ESOC.\nThis work is supported by NASA, ESA and CNES.",

            "abstract": "We analyze the ocean’s role in shaping the atmosphere’s fast response to radiative forcings with a 120-member ensemble of the coupled climate model CESM. Recently, it has been argued that the initial tropospheric adjustment to a forcing agent should be treated as part of the forcing and not as a feedback, as long as the surface temperature response is negligible. In most of these studies, the ocean is not considered to play an active role in the adjustment phase.\nWe show that on time scales of months to years after a forcing, the ocean heat uptake (OHU) strongly varies spatially. While the tropical Pacific initially loses heat, locations of high OHU shift poleward during the first three years, before becoming stationary. The ocean is passively and actively linked to the atmospheric fast responses via latent heat exchange, freshwater redistribution, and the rate and efficiency of local heat uptake. Globally integrated, the OHU efficiency is as high as the climate feedback parameter for more than a decade. Since the oceanic adjustment involves surface heat fluxes, differentiating between time scales of adjustment and feedbacks is even more convoluted than in the atmosphere.\nWe conclude that analysing the ocean’s role is necessary to quantify a forcing’s short time scale contribution to transient and equilibrium climate sensitivity because of (1) the oceans’ impact on the magnitude of the atmospheric adjustment and (2) the initially very high OHU efficiency.",

However, little is known about the electrical conductivity of silicate liquids over the relevant pressure-temperature regime. Here, we focus on silica as one of the most abundant components and a model system for understanding transport properties in silicates. We perform first principles molecular dynamics simulations over the pressure-temperature encompassing that of the early Earth, and compute the electrical conductivity via the Green-Kubo formula. The electrical conductivity of the liquid substantially exceeds that of crystalline phases at all conditions. We find that along isotherms the conductivity of silica liquid reaches a maximum near 40 percent compression, remarkably similar to the compression at which 5-fold Si-O coordination is most abundant. The conductivity decreases upon further compression. The conductivity increases rapidly with increasing temperature at all pressures. We explore the underlying physical mechanisms of the computed variations of conductivity with pressure and temperature and discuss the implications of our results for magnetic field generation in basal magma oceans.",

            "abstract": "Plasma sheet particles with sufficiently low mirror points will interact with thermospheric neutrals through charge exchange. The resulting ENAs are no longer magnetically bound and can therefore be detected by remote platforms outside the ionosphere/lower atmosphere. These ENAs closely associated with ion precipitation are termed Low Altitude Emissions (LAEs). They are non-isotropic in velocity space and mimic the corresponding ion pitch angle distribution.\nIn this study we present a statistical correlation between remote observations of the LAE emission characteristics and ion precipitation maps determined in situ over the declining phase of solar cycle 23 (2000-2005). We discuss the strength and derived location (MLT, iMLAT) of LAEs as a function of geomagnetic activity levels in relation to the simultaneously measured strength, location, and spectral characteristics of in situ ion precipitation. These comparisons may allow us to use ENA images to assess where and how much energy is deposited during any type of enhanced geomagnetic activity.\nThe precipitating ion differential directional flux maps are built up from combining NOAA–14/15/16 TED and DMSP–13/14/15 SSJ4 data. Low altitude ENA source locations are identified algorithmically using IMAGE/MENA images. ENA flux maps are derived by computing the LAE source locations assuming an ENA emission altitude (h) of 650 km, then projecting each image pixel onto a sphere with radius Re+h to determine the local time and latitude extent of the ENA source. The IGRF magnetic field model is used in combination with the Solar Magnetic coordinates of LAE pixels to compute the pitch angle of the escaping neutrals (previously ion before charge exchanging). Pitch angles larger than 90° will have a mirror point further into the atmosphere than the assumed emission altitude.",

            "abstract": "This study presents a diagnosis of a multi-resolution approach to the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A) for modeling regional climate in comparison to global high and low resolution simulations. Four experiments are conducted in AMIP-style with prescribed sea surface temperature for 1999 – 2009. In the first two experiments, MPAS-A is configured using quasi-uniform grids at 120 km and 30 km resolution. In the other two experiments, MPAS-A is configured using variable resolution with local refinement at 30 km resolution over North America and South America, respectively, embedded inside a quasi-uniform resolution domain at 120 km. The variable resolution simulations are compared against the quasi-uniform resolution global simulations to determine how well the variable-resolution simulations reproduce the features simulated by the globally high-resolution model in the refined resolution domain, and evaluate the upscale effects from the local grid refinement in the coarse resolution region. In previous analysis of idealized aqua-planet simulations with a refined domain over the tropics, high-resolution features only developed near the outflow boundary of the refined region. In contrast, the AMIP simulations with variable-resolution grids are able to reproduce the features of the quasi-uniform high-resolution simulation within the refined domain, particularly in South America during warm season. This suggests that regional forcings such as topography and land surface heterogeneity have more dominant control over the regional climate in North and South America so simulations that resolve those forcings using global quasi-uniform high resolution or variable resolution with grid refinement produce similar results. Outside of the refined grids, some remote upscaled effects are detected that suggest potentially important linkages of processes over North America with East Asia and the western Pacific. Our results provide support for the multi-resolution approach as a computationally efficient method for modeling regional climate.",

We conduct simulations for each land use/land cover and emission scenario from 2006-2010 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, with online chemistry/aerosol and urban canopy models, at a 3-km grid spacing. Overall the model can reasonably capture the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation as well as the phase of precipitation diurnal cycle in summer. Simulations results show a very clear UHI effect, i.e. expanded urban surface decreases surface latent heat flux, increases sensible heat flux and PBL height, and reduces surface wind over urban areas, with a more significant change in summer. Aerosol has much less obvious impact on local surface heat flux and temperature, but shows more remote impacts downwind due to dispersion and transport of pollutants and aerosol-cloud interaction. Aerosol also has a larger impact on precipitation amount and areal coverage than UHI. While UHI increases precipitation over urban regions during daytime especially when the southeasterly monsoonal flow prevails, aerosol remarkably suppresses precipitation, especially for light to moderate rain events, and increases the frequency of dry days in the entire model region.

            "abstract": "The Elkhorn Slough in central California has gone through periods of erosion and high energy currents in the 1870s and periods of more deposition and lower energy in the 1920s-1940s. Since the construction of jetties at Moss Landing Harbor in the 1940s, the harbor mouth has dramatically increased tidal currents and with them, the patterns of erosion. Current strong tidal incursion (particularly ebb tides) has changed this environment into a very erosive one, transforming the mud banks and channel floor quickly. In order to evaluate the erosion processes in the Slough’s underwater sediments we conducted two seismic surveys in 2012 and 2014. The EdgeTech SB-424 full-spectrum sub-bottom CHIRP profiler, was used with a default pulse which generates a sweep frequency of 4 kHz – 24 kHz for 10 ms, and a vertical resolution of 0.4 m. This system performed ideally in this shallow environment.\nThe chirp lines show channels that abrade layers of older sediment, and areas with a very highly reflective seafloor reflector that we interpret as coarse sediments. This erosive process is extremely pronounced near the ocean (in the western end) and in the middle of the channel. Comparison of the sedimentation at the mouth and farther inland suggests that the velocity of water is significantly greater at the mouth. We discuss the patterns of sedimentation/erosion in the mouth of the slough and away from the ocean. We also discuss the differences in two years’ time and if there is any evidence of changes in the geological processes. If current patterns continue, more and more of the slough will be weathered away, thus affecting the numerous species that currently live in it.\nFunding provided by the Office of Naval Research.",

            "abstract": "Dives with the QUEST 4000 ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) in September 2012 discovered nine hydrothermal sites in the arc and rear-arc region of the NE Lau Basin in 1150 m to 2630 m depth. These sites, originally detected by water column and seafloor surveys conducted in 2008-2011, include: (1) a paired sulfur-rich/black smoker field on the summit of a tectonically deformed magmatic arc volcano (Niua), (2) fracture-controlled black smoker venting on several small en echelon seamounts (north Matas) that lie between the magmatic arc and the backarc spreading center and (3) a magmatic degassing site on the summit of a dacite cone within a large (~12 km diameter) caldera volcano (Niuatahi). Dives at West Mata Seamount, which was undergoing strombolian volcanic activity and effusive rift-zone eruptions from 2008 to 2010, revealed a dormant volcanic phase in September 2012, with continued low-temperature diffuse venting. The high-temperature venting is likely driven by magmatic heat indicative of underlying partial melt zones and/or melt pockets distributed through the region. The occurrence of the youngest known boninite eruptions on the Mata volcanoes is consistent with subduction fluid flux melting extending into the rear-arc zone. Extension related to the transition from subduction to strike-slip motion of the northern Tonga Arc over the active Subduction-Transform Edge Propagator (STEP) fault probably contributes to the enhanced volcanism/hydrothermal activity in the NE Lau Basin. Chemosynthetic ecosystems at these sites range from mostly motile, lower diversity ecosystems at the eruptive/magmatically-degassing sites to higher diversity ecosystems with less mobile faunal components at the black-smoker systems. The wide range of fluid chemistry, water depth and geologic settings of the hydrothermal systems in this area provides an intriguing template to study the interaction of hydrothermal fluid chemistry, chemosynthetic habitats and their geologic underpinning within an arc/backarc setting.",

            "abstract": "Fine particle ammonium nitrate formation results from the atmospheric reaction of gaseous ammonia and nitric acid. This reaction is most important in winter when low temperatures thermodynamically enhance particle formation. Nitrogen oxides emissions from oil and gas operations partially react in the atmosphere to form nitric acid. The availability of atmospheric ammonia plays an important role in determining whether the nitric acid formed results in wintertime ammonium nitrate formation. Here we contrast situations in two important U.S. oil and gas production regions. Measurements of ammonia, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate and other species were made from 2007 to present near Boulder, Wyoming and in winters 2013 and 2014 in western North Dakota. The Boulder, Wyoming site is close to the large Jonah and Pinedale Anticline gas fields. Field sites at the north unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and Fort Union are situated in the large Bakken Formation oil and gas production region. Wintertime formation of nitric acid and ammonium nitrate, together comprising nitrogen in the +5 oxidation state (N(V)), was observed in both locations. Concentrations of N(V), however, are generally much lower at Boulder, WY than in the Bakken. An even bigger difference is seen in fine particle ammonium nitrate concentrations; limited regional ammonia is available in western Wyoming to react with nitric acid, leaving a portion of the nitric acid trapped in the gas phase. Higher concentrations of ammonia are observed in the Bakken where they support formation of much higher concentrations of ammonium nitrate. Comparison of these two regions clearly indicates the importance of understanding both local NOx emissions and regional concentrations of ammonia in predicting source impacts on formation of fine particles and haze.",

            "abstract": "This research seeks to understand how tree wood density and taxonomic diversity relate to topography and three-dimensional vegetation structure in the tropical montane forest of Braulio Carrillo National Park in Costa Rica. The study utilized forest inventory and botanical data from twenty 1-ha plots ranging from 55 m to 2800 m above sea level and remote sensing data from an airborne lidar sensor (NASA’s Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor [LVIS]) to quantify variations in forest structure. There is growing evidence that ecosystem structure plays an important role in defining patterns of species diversity and help to control the phenotypic and functional variations across landscapes. Elevation gradients along mountains provide landscape-size scales through which variations in topography, climate, and edaphic conditions as drivers of biodiversity can be tested. In this study we report on the effectiveness of relating patterns of tree wood density and alpha diversity to three-dimensional structure of a tropical montane forest using remote sensing observations of forest structure. Wood density is an important parameter for aboveground biomass and carbon estimations. Tree cores were analyzed for wood density and compared to existing database values for the same species. In this manner we were able to test the effect of the gradient on wood density and on the subsequent aboveground biomass estimations. Understanding these patterns has implications for conservation of both ecosystem services and biodiversity.\nOur results indicate that there is a strong relationship between LVIS-derived forest 3D-structure and alpha diversity, likely controlled controlled by variations in abiotic factors and topography along the elevation. Using spatial analysis with the aid of remote sensing data, we found distinct patterns along the environmental gradients defining species composition and forest structure. Wood density values were found to vary significantly from database values for the same species. This variation in tree growth has repercussions on overall forest structure, and subsequent carbon estimates extrapolated from field measurements. Because these wood density values are directly tied to biomass estimates, it is possible that carbon storage has been overestimated along this gradient using prior methods.",

Then we isolate BC in sufficient quantities for radiocarbon analysis. We report the radiocarbon age of BC, concentrations and its relative structure, from coastal and open ocean surface samples. We will discuss our progress towards measuring these quantities in dissolved organic carbon collected from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans to understand the fate, transformation and cycling of BC in the world ocean.

WEBMOD includes hydrologic modules derived from the USGS Precipitation Runoff Modeling System, the National Weather Service Hydro-17 snow model, and TOPMODEL. PHREEQC, a geochemical reaction model, is coupled with the hydrologic model to simulate the geochemical evolution of waters as they evaporate, mix, and react within the landscape.\nMajor solute concentrations and δ18O were modeled over the period 1992-2012. Variations of chloride and inorganic nitrogen respond almost entirely to variations in atmospheric deposition and preferential elution of snowpack. Both evaporation and melting result in isotopic enrichment of heavy isotopes in the residual snowpack throughout the summer. Magnesium and potassium, derived mostly from weathering with some atmospheric inputs, vary seasonally with uptake during the growing season and release during the fall and winter. The weathering of granitic minerals—oligoclase, biotite, chlorite, pyrite, calcite, and formation of secondary minerals—kaolinite, goethite, gibbsite, and smectite-illite—were selected as primary reactions based on mole-balance modeling of basin outflows. The rates of these reactions were quantified by calibrating WEBMOD to match observed concentrations and loads. Exported annual loads of most weathering products are highly correlated with discharge, whereas silica loads are less correlated with discharge, suggesting a source that is more active during dry years and less active during wet years. Potential sources include net dissolution of kaolinite and smectite-illite or mineralization of colloids with high silica content.\nWEBMOD is a valuable tool for simulating water quality variations in response to climate change, acid mine drainage, acid rain, biological transformations, and other chemical reactions. It is a robust and relatively parsimonious numerical model that can test conceptual models developed for watersheds with diverse geology, climate, and ecology.",

            "abstract": "In compressional and extensional settings, high-enthalpy geothermal systems and epithermal vein deposits are genetically linked to shallow magmatic reservoirs, overlying hydrothermal circulation cells, and structural meshes that permit vertical migration of fluids. In the Andean Cordillera of Central-Southern Chile, the nature of the relationship between tectonics and volcanism is the result of interaction between the crustal structures and the regional stress field. Between 37° and 46°S, the volcanic and geothermal activity is controlled by the NNE-trending, 1,200 km long LOFS, an intra-arc dextral strike-slip fault system, associated with second-order intra-arc anisotropies of overall NE-SW and NW-SE orientation. Although there is consensus that volcanism in this segment are controlled by the regional scale tectonic stress field, the structural controls on magma degassing and metal fluxing remains poorly constrained.\nThe goal of the study is to constrain the first-order controls on fluxes of noble metals (Au, Ag, PGEs), base metals (Cu, Zn, Pb) and metalloids (As, Sb, Se) along this segment. For this purpose we collected fumarole and thermal water samples from five selected volcanic-geothermal systems along the northern termination of the LOFS. The selected areas are characterized by the occurrence of surface manifestations and are located along NNE-oriented or NWN-oriented fault systems. In each location, the trace metal budget and isotopic composition of fumaroles and springs were constrained along with cations, anions and dissolved gaseous species.\nThe helium isotopic ratios of fumaroles, defined as R/Ra, range between 3.5 and 7.5 in the studied segment. High R/Ra, mantle-like signatures are associated with geothermal manifestations occurring along NNE-trending faults, whereas lower R/Ra values in NWN-oriented systems most likely represent mixing between mantle and crustal sources. Concentrations of Au, Cu and As are significant in selected geothermal wells along NWN-faults (1.5 ppb, 8 ppb and 25 ppm, respectively), while measured concentrations of PGEs in fumaroles are detectable (between 0.6 and 14 ppt of Pt, Pd, Rh and Ir) along both NWE and NNE-trending structures.\nThis study point out towards provide new insights about large-scale metal fluxing along an active intra-arc fault system.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms behind the carbon cycle response to extreme events is essential for predicting future behaviour of tropical forests. In this study, we focus on the modelled response during the 2010 drought in the Amazon forest using a suite of dynamic global vegetation models. The potential impacts of drought on the carbon cycle include increased mortality, reduced productivity, and changes to heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration rates. In addition, the 2010 drought was accompanied by substantial biomass burning which also emitted CO2 to the atmosphere. Many of these fires were from human ignitions related to deforestation, which can be particularly difficult for models to represent.\nDuring the 2000’s, the models all showed that the forests of the Amazon basin were a net sink of CO2, with an average net biome productivity, or NBP, of 0.20±0.19 PgC/yr. This is within the range of bottom-up and top-down estimates of NBP in undisturbed forests (0.39+/-0.26 PgC/yr and 0.25+/-0.14 PgC, respectively) [Phillips et al. 2009, Gloor et al. 2012, Gatti et al. 2014]. This sink was reduced during the 2010 drought but the models tend to underestimate the severity of the reduction. The model average NBP during 2010 was -0.12 PgC, compared to -0.48±0.18 PgC from an observational study [Gatti et al. 2014]. In particular, the models simulated positive NBP during the dry season of 2010, indicating a carbon sink even during the peak drought months. This result is in direct contrast to recent estimates of seasonal terrestrial fluxes during 2010 based on atmospheric measurements [Gatti et al. 2014]. We investigate the roles of fire CO2 emissions, GPP sensitivity to drought, and uncertainty in driving data in the modelled responses, utilizing the GOSAT retrievals of chlorophyll fluorescence and the Global Fire Emissions Dataset. Based on this analysis we will identify priorities for continued model development of DGVMs in tropical forests.",

This interaction is important in auroral physics because the power generated by Io can be predicted and compared to the power output of the Io-induced aurora. Since the power output of the aurora is significantly less than the input power, it is important to understand the transport of energy from Io to Jupiter. We utilize a hybrid plasma simulation to explore the propagation of plasma waves in the Io plasma torus generated by mass loading the flow. Mass loading creates MHD waves (e.g. Alfven and fast mode waves) through the pickup of new ions as well as electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves driven by unstable ring beam distributions. We analyze the propagation of this composite wave field through the Io plasma torus with a density gradient along the magnetic field. We also investigate the propagation of small-scale kinetic Alfven waves by including the electron pressure term.",

            "abstract": "As global warming proceeds, evapotranspiration demand will increase, the precipitation regime may change, and water cycling in many ecosystems may be affected. Streamflow in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region of the USA decreased in the last ~60 year possibly due to decreasing precipitation at high elevations and/or increasing evapotranspiration. However, an increasing trend of streamflow was observed at a 4km2 watershed in the Priest River Experimental Forest (PREF) in northern Idaho. We used the process-based soil-vegetation-atmosphere Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model, to simulate the changes in the water cycle at PREF. Independent measurements were used to parameterize the model, including forest transpiration, stomatal responses to vapor pressure, forest properties (height, leaf area index, and biomass), soil properties, soil moisture, snow depth, and snow water equivalent. The model reasonably simulated the streamflow dynamics during the evaluation period from 2003 to 2010, which verified the ability of SHAW to simulate the water cycle at PREF. We then ran the model using historical vegetation cover and climate data to reveal the drivers of the changes in water budget of PREF over the past 60 years. Historical vegetation cover was obtained from a 1939 digitized historical vegetation map. The biggest change was the decline of western white pine (Pinus monticola Dougl. ex D. Don), a fast growing and deep rooted species with high transpiration rates, which was once a predominant species in PREF in the early 20th century. This was followed by a subsequent increase and decrease in fir species, followed by the emergence of western red cedar (Thuja plicata) as the current dominant tree species. The tree species shifts under this successional trajectory would have produced continually decreasing transpiration rates, which may explain the steady increase in observed runoff over the last ~60 years, which was likewise simulated with the SHAW model.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural production is heavily dependent not only on climate but also on markets as well as on the social and community systems managing the agroecosystem. In addition, the ultimate goal of agricultural production, human food security, is also affected not only by net agricultural production but also by similar economic and social factors. These complex feedbacks assume a particular importance in the case of smallholder farms in the tropics, where alternative rural development policies have led to different and contrasting agricultural management systems. Current approaches at comparing such systems generally study their environmental, economic or social components in isolation, potentially missing important interconnections.\nThis research uses a participatory systems dynamics modelling (SDM) framework to compare two small-scale agricultural approaches in rural Guatemala which differ in their social, economic and ecosystem management decisions. The first case study community, in Quiché, has adopted a subsistence-based system that aims to use low levels of outside inputs to produce food for their own consumption, while the second, in Sololá, has opted for market-based agriculture that uses high input levels to obtain marketable crops in order to assure income for the purchase of food and other necessities. Each of these systems has its respective vulnerabilities; while the Sololá community suffers from more environmental degradation issues (soils and pests), the Quiché community, given lower monetary incomes, is more vulnerable to events whose responses require a significant monetary expenditure.\nThrough the SDM approach, we incorporate local stakeholder knowledge of the respective systems, including biophysical and socioeconomic variables, into a joint biophysical and socioeconomic model for each community. These models then allow for the comparison of the resilience of both types of socio-agroecosystems in the face of climatic, economic and biological shocks, as well as for the participatory use of the models as decision support tools for the participatory design of sustainable solutions to the identified vulnerabilities in each system.",

            "abstract": "A large fraction of soil organic matter (SOM) is composed of small molecules of microbial origin resulting from lysed cells and released metabolites. However, the cycling of these nutrients by microorganisms, a critical component of the global carbon cycle, remains poorly understood. Although there are many biotic and abiotic factors affecting the accessibility of SOM to microbes, adsorption to mineral surfaces is among the most important. Here, we are developing exometabolomics methods to further understand the types of microbial metabolites remaining in the water extractable fraction of SOM (WEOM). To estimate which compounds adsorb to a sandy loam soil (obtained from the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in Mendocino, CA), an extract was prepared from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas stutzerii RCH2 grown on 13C acetate. This approach produced highly labeled metabolites that were easily discriminated from the endogenous soil metabolites by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Comparison of the composition of the fresh bacteria extract with what was recovered following a 15 min incubation with soil revealed that only 26% of the metabolites showed >50% recovery in the WEOM. Most cations (polyamines) and anions showed <10% recovery. These represent metabolites that may be inaccessible to microbes in this environment and would be most likely to accumulate as SOM presumably due to binding with minerals and negatively-charged clay particles. Ongoing studies are focused on comparing the adsorption capacity of bacteria extract with several minerals (ferrihydrite, goethite, meghemite, lepidocrocite). Varying conditions such as metabolite-mineral contact time (ranging from hours to days) and temperature (4-37°C) will provide insight into how microbial metabolites behave in a given mineral-rich environment under certain climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Stable global temperatures of the last 10–15 years have been a topic of considerable discussion. A new proxy extension of the global temperature record enables better placement of this feature in a longer historical perspective. The fixed-grid composite covers the interval 1801–1984, with an extension to 1782, and anchors the global temperature record in the last major cold interval of the Little Ice Age, when carbon dioxide concentration was at preanthropogenic levels. Except for greater and longer cooling (approximately twice the length of Pinatubo) associated with the Tambora eruption, the proxy agrees with the most widely cited previous assessment of global temperature over this interval, lending more confidence to a centennial extension of the global temperature record. The proxy correlation is as high as 0.83 for the interval 1907–1984 (df = 8, p = 0.001), with the 21st century 1.0°C ± 0.2°C warmer than the nonvolcanic base state. This remarkable linearity requires a clear theoretical understanding as to how an exceedingly complex system can, on the global average, behave in such a simple way. Removal of the linear radiatively forced component from the global temperature record yields an estimate of natural variability for the last 230 years and indicates no unusual natural variability during the recent 10–15 years. Based on the estimate of unforced variability over the last 170 years, there is about a 40% chance of continued “natural cooling” over the next few years, with about a 10% chance of cooling persisting into the next decade.",

            "abstract": "The formation of the most recent flood basalt province on Earth, the Columbia River Flood Basalts (CRBs) of the northwestern USA, was accompanied by eruptions of several thousand km3 of rhyolite in a short time window from 16.7 to 15 Ma. These rhyolites span from low (+1‰) to high (+11‰) in δ18O values as recorded by major phenocrysts, and alteration-resistant zircons within each rhyolite commonly display diversity of up to 6‰ δ18O, indicative of batch assembly prior to eruption. Significant variation in εHf also exists in zircons, ranging from -39 to 0 in rhyolites erupted through the North American cratonic crust, and from -1 to +9 in rhyolites erupted through accreted oceanic terranes to the east of the Sr87/86Sr = 0.706 line. This isotopic diversity cannot be accounted for by fractionation of a CRB-like parent magma, demonstrating that the syn-CRB rhyolites must have been derived from melting of the crust. Abundant low-δ18Omelt values among syn-CRB rhyolites further constrains this crustal melting to shallow depths of 5-10 km, due to the shallow depths of the necessary hydrothermal alteration of the protolith. By contrast, high-δ18O rhyolites must have been formed by remelting of sedimentary or metasedimentary rocks. Low-δ18O rhyolites are also most common in the vicinity of the crustal suture between the thick lithosphere of the Archean craton and the thin lithosphere of the accreted terranes. Thermomechanical modeling suggests that this contrast concentrates crustal heating and deformation, creating pathways for meteoric water to penetrate the crust and cause extensive hydrothermal alteration less than 1 Ma before those same rocks remelt to form low-δ18O rhyolites. Finally, we suggest that this extensive crustal hydrothermal alteration and melting may be typical of continental flood basalt provinces world wide, and particularly when there is syn-volcanic extension.",

            "abstract": "The logic tree scheme is the probabilistic framework that has been widely used in the last decades to take into account epistemic uncertainties in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). Notwithstanding the vital importance for PSHA to incorporate properly the epistemic uncertainties, we argue that the use of the logic tree in a PSHA context has conceptual and practical drawbacks. Despite some of these drawbacks have been reported in the past, a careful evaluation of their impact on PSHA is still lacking. This is the goal of the present work. In brief, we show that i) PSHA practice does not meet the assumptions that stand behind the logic tree scheme; ii) the output of a logic tree is often misinterpreted and/or misleading, e.g., the use of percentiles (median included) in a logic tree scheme raises theoretical difficulties from a probabilistic point of view; iii) in case the assumptions that stand behind a logic tree are actually met, this leads to several problems in testing any PSHA model. We suggest a different strategy – based on ensemble modeling – to account for epistemic uncertainties in a more proper probabilistic framework. Finally, we show that in many PSHA practical applications, the logic tree is de facto loosely applied to build sound ensemble models.",

            "abstract": "Our research group has been retrieving aerosol/PM characteristics based on photometry (NASA/AERONET), NIES/LIDAR, PM-sampling and satellite data. It is well known that concentration of anthropogenic aerosols in Asia is increasing with economic growth. In recent year, high concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter) have been recorded in western part of Japan due to trans-boundary pollutants. The DRAGON Japan field campaign was carried out in spring of 2012 in order to investigate both in-bound and local pollutants. At first, this work intends to estimate the concentration of PM2.5 from DRAGON-Japan's AERONET dataset, which provide us with useful information for the modeling of PM particles. Fine mode AOT (Aerosol optical Thickness) is highly correlated with PM2.5 concentration than total AOT. Furthermore, vertical profile of aerosols is necessary for PM modeling because PM concentration seems to be strongly correlated with the low level aerosols. To clarify this problem, 2ch LIDAR measurements are available. The NIES/LIDAR network data present the vertical profile of aerosol extinction which is available to obtain AOT profile from the columnar AOT given by AERONET. This fact suggests that combination use of vertical extinction profile by NIES-LIDAR and AOT by NASA/AERONET provides the efficient model of PM2.5. Thus our PM2.5 model includes the aerosol vertical information. That is why our retrieved PM2.5 gets to precise and practical.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) aerosols play a substantial role in the rapid warming of the Arctic. We systematically evaluate the simulation of BC vertical profile (ARCTAS and ARCPAC flights), surface concentrations and concentrations in snow (Doherty et al., 2010) in the Arctic in spring using a global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. We also provide highly spatially (2° lat ×2.5° lon) and temporally resolved source estimates of surface BC concentrations using GEOS-Chem adjoint. Results showed that the vertical profiles of BC agree with the aircraft observations from surface to 10 km within 50%. The monthly mean regional averaged BC concentrations in snow in Alaska, Arctic Ocean, Canada, Greenland and Russia agree with the observations within 40%, while the mean BC concentrations in snow in Svalbard and Norway agree with the observations within a factor of 3 because of inaccurate simulation of snow precipitation in GEOS5.\nWe found Asian anthropogenic sources contributed 20-50% of BC concentrations through troposphere and in snow in the Arctic and are the major contributors in most regions. Adjoint analysis showed that BC concentrations of about 10 ng/m3 (30-100% of the total Asian contribution) observed at the surface stations are attributed to emissions emitted by Asian anthropogenic sources 30 days before the observation, and these background BC aerosols were transported to the station by circum-polar-vortex. Previous source estimates that repeated identified Europe as the major contributor of BC in the Arctic only trace back for 5 to 10 days and do not capture the background contribution from Asia. Russian biomass burning is important in mid-troposphere and accounts for 60% of total BC at 4-5 km. The relative contribution from different sources estimated by the adjoint of GEOS-Chem agrees with the forward estimate within 10%. Moreover, the adjoint analysis enables us to pinpoint the major sources to grid box level. Results showed that for surface observations, contribution from the top-ten gird box accounts for more than 70% of the total global contribution.",

            "abstract": "The source of S-waves from explosions is debated within the nuclear explosion monitoring community. The HUMBLE REDWOOD III (HRIII) experiment series in 2012 located in New Mexico provides a unique dataset to further our understanding of the generation of S-waves in alluvium by comparing and contrasting co-located aboveground and underground explosions. Two 91 kg explosions were detonated in alluvium at the same location, but HRIII-1 was detonated at 2 m aboveground and HRIII-2 was detonated at 7 m belowground and was fully coupled. A semicircular seismic network of 21 stations was deployed at 1 km to record the explosions. We determined that the belowground HRIII-2 explosion generated P-waves that were 2.4x larger than the aboveground HRIII-1 shot, thus we scaled the aboveground signals by this factor. Visual inspection of the waveforms after scaling showed similar P-wave, higher mode (HM) Rayleigh-wave, and fundamental mode Rayleigh-wave amplitudes for both shots on the vertical and radial components; however the largest differences were observed on the transverse components. Additional Love wave (or SH) energy is generated by the underground explosion that is not accounted for in the P-wave scaling factor. Spectral ratios confirm that the increased SH generation occurs at frequencies between 10-100 Hz. Future work includes modeling of these waveforms to explain the larger SH waves as well as analysis of S-wave generation from a similar set of above- and below-ground explosions in limestone.",

            "abstract": "Recent upgrades to the Deep Space Network’s Goldstone Solar System Radar allow the transmitted waveform to be modulated at up to 40 MHz, providing resolution as fine as 3.75 m in line-of-sight distance for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and the Moon. Bistatic observations, transmitting with an antenna at Goldstone and receiving with either another Goldstone antenna or a larger antenna such as the Arecibo Observatory or the Green Bank Telescope, give the highest possible sensitivity combined with high resolution. High-resolution bistatic radar projects have revealed spin state changes and the presence of boulders on many NEAs. Examples include radar imaging campaigns on the NEAs 2005 YU55, Toutatis, 2012 DA14, and 2014 HQ124.\nIn the near future, a new high-resolution transmitter on Goldstone’s DSS-13 antenna will be able to transmit a signal modulated at 80 MHz, improving line-of-sight resolution by a factor of two to 1.875 m. This will allow many new projects: seeing previously-invisible surface details; measuring the size distributions of boulders and possibly craters on small NEAs; obtaining better estimates of the masses and densities of asteroids from radiation pressure perturbations to their trajectories; improved trajectory predictions for small spacecraft targets and potential Earth impactors; and possibly imaging the reconfiguration of asteroids’ surfaces due to tides during extremely close Earth flybys.\nSomewhat further into the future, a 1.875-m-resolution transmitter may be installed on a 34-m antenna at the DSN’s Canberra complex. This would allow radar imaging of objects in the far southern sky, which current radars cannot see. It would also facilitate rapid follow-up of newly discovered radar targets and before-and-after observations of NEAs making flybys close enough to cause tidal reconfiguration, which move very quickly across the sky at closest approach.\nAs with the current 3.75-m-resolution system, these future high-resolution transmitters will provide the best scientific results when operated in bistatic mode with a large antenna as the receive station. Equipment to be installed at Arecibo and at Green Bank is able to record 80-MHz-coded radar echoes.",

Discovered radical product channels in addition to radical termination channels have resulted in increased study of these important reactions. In our continued study of HO2 reactions with acetonylperoxy and acetylperoxy radicals, we report here our first results on the kinetics of the acetonylperoxy system. Previous studies have resulted in conflicting results and no temperature dependence of the rate constants. Using the Infrared Kinetic Spectroscopy (IRKS) method in which a temperature-controlled slow-flow tube apparatus and laser flash photolysis of Cl2 are used to produce HO2 and CH3C(O)CH2O2 from methanol and acetone, respectively, we studied the chemical kinetics involved over the temperature range of 295 to 240 K. Rates of chemical reaction were determined by monitoring the HO2 concentration as a function of time by sensitive near-IR diode laser wavelength modulation spectroscopy while simultaneously measuring the disappearance of [CH3C(O)CH2O2] in the ultraviolet at 300 nm. The simultaneous fits resulted in the determination of the temperature dependence of the rate constants for the HO2/acetonylperoxy reaction and the acetonylperoxy self-reaction. At the lower temperatures, the reactions of HO2 and CH3C(O)CH2O2 with the adducts HO2•CH3OH and HO2•CH3C(O)CH3 formed in significant concentrations needed to be included in the fitting models.",

            "abstract": "Systematic observations of the global thermal state of the Moon and its diurnal variability provide the ability to characterize the surface energy balance of the lunar regolith and how it exchanges and stores heat. The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (Paige et al., 2010a) on NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has been systematically mapping the global thermal state of the Moon since July of 2009. Early observations have been used to infer the radiative and bulk thermophysical properties of the near-surface regolith at the equator in an average sense (Vasavada et al. 2011). With over five years of data, the density of observations both spatially and in local time is high enough that global diurnal temperatures can be adequately resolved to create global maps of surface temperatures which will provide insight into the radiative and thermophysical properties of the lunar regolith globally.\nWe have compiled all nadir observations of radiance from the seven Diviner infrared spectral channels to derive global bolometric brightness temperatures, a measure of the spectrally integrated flux of infrared radiation emerging from the surface (Paige et al., 2010b), as a function of local time. With this data set, we generate instantaneous global maps of surface temperatures for any arbitrary subsolar longitude and can now provide “snap-shots” of the lunar surface temperatures through an entire lunation at 0.5 degree map resolution. We also generate global temperature maps for any given hour of local time. Hourly nighttime maps reveal global cooling of the lunar surface providing information about the vertical profile of the lunar regolith as sensible heat absorbed during the lunar day is radiated to space during the long lunar night from greater depths.\n",

            "abstract": "The geomorphic and hydraulic characteristics of gravel bars control the direction, magnitude and spatial patterns of infiltration and exfiltration between rivers and their immediate subsurface environments. Bed undulation, water-surface gradient, alluvial depth, and the spatial variation of hydraulic conductivity (both deterministic trends and stochastic variability) affect the hydrologically-driven groundwater-surface water exchange. In this paper, we use a set of field measurements of morphological and hydrological characteristics along two reaches of the San Joaquin River, California to motivate a systematic analysis of the factors that affect paths and residence times of flow through gravel bars under an observed range of streamflow values. In the field investigation, it is shown that asymmetry of bar morphology is a first-order control on the extent and magnitude of infiltration, which is often represented to produce approximately equal areas of infiltration and seepage under the assumption of sinusoidal bedforms. Infiltration over the length of a bar is shown to be greater at low flow than at high flow because of the effect of water-surface gradient. Hydraulic conductivity (ksat) varies by orders of magnitude and systematic downstream coarsening arises related to the process of bar evolution. The lowest values of ksat were observed where the difference between the topographic gradient and the water-surface gradient is at a maximum and thus where the infiltration would be greatest into a uniform bar of homogeneous gravel. Morphology and fine sediment accumulation in recharge zones exert an important control over the mechanisms driving subsurface fluid exchange. Simulations from a numerical groundwater flow model that isolate the signatures of morphology and streambed sediment patterns on subsurface flow corroborate our interpretation that the infiltration patterns and rates are primarily controlled by bed morphology, with ksat playing a secondary role.",

Well-defined and well-documented features such as the Bonneville, Provo, and Stansbury shorelines of Late Pleistocene Lake Bonneville are recognizable to the untrained eye and easily mappable on aerial photos. The continuity and correlation of lesser shorelines must rely quantitative algorithms for processing high-resolution data in order to gain widespread scientific acceptance. Using Savitsky-Golay filters and the geomorphic methods and criteria described by Hare et al. [2001], minor, transgressive, erosional shorelines of Lake Bonneville have been identified and correlated across the basin with varying degrees of statistical confidence. Results solve one of the key paradoxes of Lake Bonneville first described by G. K. Gilbert in the late 19th century and point the way for understanding climatically driven oscillations of the Last Glacial Maximum in the Great Basin of the United States. Similar techniques have been applied to the Eberswalde Crater area of Mars using HRiSE DEMs (1 m horizontal resolution) where a paleolake is hypothesized to have existed. Results illustrate the challenges of identifying shorelines where long term aeolian processes have degraded the shorelines and field validation is not possible.

            "abstract": "The complex nature of dust aerosol emission makes it difficult to accurately represent the dust cycle in global circulation models (GCMs). Indeed, both measurements and the new physically-based dust emission parameterization of Kok et al. (2014) indicate that many GCMs underestimate the dust flux’s sensitivity to soil erodibility. This finding can explain why dust cycle simulations in many GCMs are improved by using an empirical preferential sources function that shifts emissions towards the most erodible regions. To both test this hypothesis and evaluate the performance of the new Kok et al. (2014) dust emission scheme, we implemented this scheme in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and compared its results against measurements. We find that the physically-based scheme produces even better agreement against measurements most representative of dust emission, specifically aerosol optical depth measurements near dust source regions, than simulations that use a source function. This apparent improvement in the representation of dust emission in CESM propagates into a modest improvement against measurements of surface concentration and dust deposition, which tend to be further from source regions and depend on a range of other uncertain model processes besides dust emission. These results indicate that the need to use a source function is at least partially eliminated by the additional physics accounted for by the Kok et al. (2014) parameterization, and the increased sensitivity to soil erodibility that it produces. Since soil erodibility is affected by climate changes, our results further suggest that many models might underestimate the climate sensitivity of the global dust cycle.",

            "abstract": "GRASS GIS, a free and open source GIS, is used by many scientists directly or through other projects such as R or QGIS to perform geoprocessing tasks. Thus, a large number of scientific geospatial computations depend on quality and correct functionality of GRASS GIS. Automatic functionality testing is therefore necessary to ensure software reliability. Here we present a testing framework for GRASS GIS which addresses different needs of GRASS GIS and geospatial software in general. It allows to test GRASS tools (referred to as GRASS modules) and examine outputs including large raster and vector maps as well as temporal datasets. Furthermore, it enables to test all levels of GRASS GIS architecture including C and Python application programming interface and GRASS modules invoked as subprocesses. Since GRASS GIS is used as a platform for development of geospatial algorithms and models, the testing framework allows not only to test GRASS GIS core functionality but also tools developed by scientists as a part of their research. Using testing framework we can test GRASS GIS and related tools automatically and repetitively and thus detect errors caused by code changes and new developments. Tools and code are then easier to maintain which results in preserving reproducibility of scientific results over time. Similarly to open source code, the test results are publicly accessible, so that all current and potential users can see them. The usage of testing framework will be presented on an example of a test suite for r.slope.aspect module, a tool for computation of terrain slope, aspect, curvatures and other terrain characteristics.",

This study examines how the sequence of radar-indicated convective and stratiform precipitation elements, including their wind stress, gustiness, and rain, affect the erosion or buildup of upper ocean stability.

            "abstract": "The ARTEMIS mission has made extensive measurements on the density and magnetic field structure of the lunar wake under different solar wind and magnetosphere conditions. Hybrid-kinetic simulations of the lunar wake have been found to be generally in good agreement with observations [Wiehle, S., et al., Planet. Space Sci., 2011], but are not readily available as they require access to large computers and human resources with expertise using this technology. It would be very useful to have an analytic model of the lunar wake, and one such model will be presented. It is based on an approach outlined by Hutchinson [Hutchinson, I., Physics Of Plasmas, 2008], and makes assumptions of cylindrical geometry, a strong and constant magnetic field, and fixed transverse velocity and temperature. Under these approximations the ion fluid equations (with massless electrons assumed) can be solved analytically by the method of characteristics. This paper demonstrates that the analytic model under these assumptions provides excellent agreement with observations and hybrid-kinetic simulations of the lunar wake. The approach outlined by Hutchinson is generalized to include an arbitrary angle between the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind flow. This results in two angle-dependent characteristics for the fluid flow that can be solved for the density inside the wake region. The Density profiles for different orientations of magnetic field with respect to solar wind flow are in a good qualitative agreement with 2D Hybrid simulation results of the model developed by [Paral and Rankin, Nature Comms, 2012], and with ARTEMIS observations.\nRefrences,\n-Wiehle, S., et al.

            "abstract": "Dust is one of the most important aerosol sources, which cover the sky over Africa, the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, Middle East, and many other areas over the world. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of dust aerosols on regional climate, with a focus on the Sahel region where dust events frequently occur, by examining responses of the regional climate system to direct, semi-direct, and indirect aerosol radiative forcings in the UCLA AGCM in terms of the cloud, radiation, temperature, precipitation, and general circulation patterns. The 3D monthly GOCART dust data have been employed in two scenarios, representing more severe dust loadings during 1980s and less dust during 2000s, respectively. Offline simulations reveal that 1) dust direct effect could overshadow cloud forcing under heavily polluted case; 2) semi-direct effect may change the sign of dust radiative forcing, indicating that cloud forcing associated with aerosol semi-direct effect can exceed direct aerosol forcing; and 3) changes in radiative forcing associated with indirect effect are not very significant with increasing AOD. AGCM simulations show that aerosol indirect effect tends to act oppositely to the aerosol direct and semi-direct effects with a much smaller magnitude, and hence the direct and semi-direct effects play a dominant role in the overall climatic effect of dust aerosols over the Sahel region. Increased dust aerosols in the AGCM simulations in 1980s tend to draw the precipitation further in land, which reduces the precipitation in the south part of the rainfall band over Sahel Savanna area centered at 10 N, where precipitation is shifted to the north over Sahel and produced a dipole anomaly. Dust AOD seems to play an important role in the distribution of the precipitation over North Africa since aerosol is the only forcing in these two experiments. To examine the uncertainty regarding the role of dust in Sahel climate variability, the 3D monthly climatology of the GOCART and MATCH dust data has been employed, respectively, in another two experiments. Differences in the simulated precipitation due to the use of different aerosol data reveal that the responses of the regional climate to the aerosol forcing are sensitive to the aerosol optical depth and properties.",

            "abstract": "The Hawaiian Islands extend NW for 625 km from Lō‘ihi to Ka‘ula island. One anomalous feature cross-cutting the Hawaiian Islands is the Kaua‘i Ridge, a 165 km-long bathymetric high with three well-defined gravity highs. These gravity highs are centered under or near the islands of Ka‘ula, Ni‘ihau and Kaua‘i, and represent the cores of three shield volcanoes whose volumes decrease dramatically with distance from the axis of the Hawaiian Chain (Kaua‘i, 58 x 103 km3, Ni‘ihau x 103 km, Ka‘ula 10 x 103 km; Robinson and Eakins 2006). Ka‘ula Volcano, on the SW end of the Kaua‘i Ridge, is centered 100 km off the axis of the Hawaiian mantle plume. The volcano is capped by a small island, which is a remnant of a nephelinitic tuff cone. The cone contains abundant accidental bombs of lava (tholeiite, phonolite and basanite), peridotite and pyroxenite, and unexploded ordnance from US military bombing. Two JASON dives on the flanks of Ka‘ula recovered only alkalic lavas. Three stage of Ka‘ula volcanism have been identified from sampling the volcanic bombs and flanks of the volcano. These rocks were dated using 40Ar/39Ar methods for the basalts and K-Ar for the phonolites. A tholeiitic shield basalt yielded an age of 6.2 Ma, the oldest reliable age for any Hawaiian Island tholeiite. Post-shield phonolites gave ages of 4.0 to 4.2 Ma (Garcia et al., 1986) and rejuvenation stage alkalic basalts yielded ages of 1.9 to 0.5 Ma. These ages are nearly identical to those for the same stages for adjacent Ni‘ihau volcano but slightly older than on Kauai, 100 km to the NE (Sherrod et al. 2007). Thus, volcanism was nearly simultaneous along Kaua‘i Ridge. The new age results extend to 420 km the distance within the Hawaiian Islands that experienced coeval rejuvenated volcanism. Geochemically, the rejuvenated and tholeiitic lavas from the Kaua‘i Ridge are very similar with mixed source signatures of Loa and Kea trend compositions. Mixed Loa-Kea sources have been found for many other Hawaiian volcanoes. These results indicate that the Hawaiian mantle plume was broadly homogeneous over 100 km distance but also heterogeneous on a fine scale.\nGarcia et al., 1986. Contr. Mineral.

            "abstract": "Phobos’ low density of 1.876 ± 0.02 g/cm3 (Andert et al., 2010, Witasse et al., 2013, Paetzold et al., 2013) supports its formation from a disk of debris (Peale 2007). The disk would either be a remnant of the formation of Mars (Safronov et al., 1986) or the result of a collision between Mars and a large body (Craddock 1994, 2011; Singer 2007). Within this scenario a large interior porosity would be responsible for the low density of the re-accreted material forming Phobos. Thermal emission spectra of Phobos suggest an ultramafic composition with the presence of phyllosilicates and feldspathoids in some regions (Giuranna et al., 2011), consistent with Phobos’ in situ formation (Giuranna et al., 2011).\nHowever, the 0.3-4.0 μm surface spectra taken from multiple areas of the body in more than 43 years of observations (Duxbury et al., 2013), show physical characteristics similar to low-albedo asteroids such as C-type (Masursky et al., 1972, Pang et al., 1980) or D-type (Murchie 1999, Rivkin et al., 2002, Lynch et al., 2007, Pajola et al., 2012). They argue in favor of an asteroidal capture scenario that could be explained by binary asteroid dissociation (Landis 2009) or by collisional capture in the Martian orbital region (Pajola et al., 2012).\nFinally recent work by Schmedemann et al., (2014) indicates Phobos’ surface to be ~ 4.3 – 3.7 Ga, dating back to a period where there was an intensification in the number of impactors in the inner Solar System (Gomes et al., 2005), and supporting both the in-situ and the capture scenario.\nPajola et al. (2013) match the surface reflectance of Phobos from 0.4 to 4.0 μm with a mineralogical model composed of a mixture of Tagish Lake meteorite (TL) and Pyroxene Glass (PM80). Based on the published model, we adopted the weighted TL and PM80 densities to investigate if the low bulk density of Phobos could conform with these components reconciling both inner properties and surface spectra. While the TL density is available from measurements by Hildebrand et al. (2006), that of PM80 (Jager et al., 1994) has not been measured. In its stead, we have adopted density values of different pyroxene glasses from the literature (Karamanov and Pelino, 1999, and Smithsonian Physical Tables 1921) along with the density of mafic-rich glasses with VNIR spectra similar to PM80. We present our results.",

            "abstract": "Increasing integration of satellite and ground-based geophysical observations in volcanic areas has dramatically enhanced our ability to detect and track complex processes that can be difficult to reconcile with models of elastic mechanical behavior of upper crust. This study uses a thermo-poroelastic model to evaluate ground deformation, magnetic and gravity changes caused by hydrothermal fluid circulation and pressurization of magma chambers, in which surface topography, crustal heterogeneities and the presence of faults are taken into account. We develop a numerical framework for more realistic assessment of geophysical observations associated with volcanic processes, with particular focus on calderas. The numerical model is fully coupled with TOUGH2, a commercial software simulating multi-phase and multi-component fluid flow and heat transfer. The two-way coupling is performed through: (i) the concept of effective stress, which is controlled by pore pressure and thermal expansion, and (ii) empirical expressions for porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure, which are dependent on the effective stress. The model is applied to Campi Flegrei to simulate a generic unrest period caused by a deep injection of hot water and CO2. Vertical uplift reaches 12 cm in 3 years, with associated thermomagnetic variations of c. 14 nT and gravity changes of c. 210 μGal, comparable to those observed during the 1982-84 bradyseism. Gravity and magnetic signals continuously increase for 2 years and approach steady state after 2.5 years. The contribution of thermal effects to total ground deformation is almost negligible in the first 3 years, but reaches half of the total after 15 years, and is dominant after 35 years. We also simulated the presence of faults and the contribution of a deeper magma chamber pressurization, which affect considerably the sub-surface circulation, and consequently the geophysical changes at the surface.",

Little is known about the instantaneous occurrence of this feature. Here we use a new method for automated daily identification of convection associated with the east Pacific ITCZ in visible and infrared geostationary satellite images from 1980-2012. The method uses the satellite images to extract information about the spatial features of the clouds comprising the convergence zones. Features are then used as input to a temporal classification algorithm that is based on a combination of hidden semi-Markov model and support vector machine methods. Five ‘states’ are used to describe the location of the ITCZ: northern hemisphere only (nITCZ), southern hemisphere only (sITCZ), double ITCZ (dITCZ), ITCZ located directly on the equator (eITCZ), and no ITCZ present (aITCZ). Most of the year, particularly from May-Dec, is dominated by the nITCZ state. The boreal springtime is characterized by a high number of days classified as dITCZ, but the state of the ITCZ is quite variable during this time and can frequently transition between dITCZ, nITCZ, sITCZ, and aITCZ states. Our results will show ITCZ variability in terms of the different states on daily to interannual time scales. We will show how the large scale environment, including SST and atmospheric moisture availability, influences the occurrence of each ITCZ state, focusing on the dITCZ in the boreal springtime.",

On determining these accuracies, various measurements have been performed in the range of 1m – 50 m. For performing an accuracy analysis, a calibration plate has been used. Four different geometric shapes, equilateral triangle, square, circle and a plus sign have been placed on the plate. The measurement basis or line is 300 m long. The calibration plate ranging between 0 - 100 m is linearly placed at 10 m intervals, whereas the range of 100 - 300 m is linearly placed at 50 m intervals. Without moving the plate from the testing point, the scanning distance has been kept equal and has been scanned at three different angles. This process was repeated for every designated point. This study has been extrapolated to analyze the effect of different scanning distance, angle and resolution and the change in the structure of the object.",

            "abstract": "The catastrophes induced by earthquakes are among the most devastating ones, causing an elevated number of human losses and economic damages. But, we have to keep in mind that earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do. Earthquakes can’t be predicted and the only way of dealing with their effects is to teach the society how to be prepared for them, and how to deal with their consequences. In spite of being exposed to moderate and large earthquakes, most of the Portuguese are little aware of seismic risk, mainly due to the long recurrence intervals between strong events.\nThe acquisition of safe and correct attitudes before, during and after an earthquake is relevant for human security. Children play a determinant role in the establishment of a real and long-lasting “culture of prevention”, both through action and new attitudes. On the other hand, when children assume correct behaviors, their relatives often change their incorrect behaviors to mimic the correct behaviors of their kids.\nIn the framework of a Parents-in-Science initiative, we started with bi-monthly sessions for children aged 5 – 6 years old and 9 – 10 years old. These sessions, in which parents, teachers and high-school students participate, became part of the school’s permanent activities.\nWe start by a short introduction to the Earth and to earthquakes by story telling and by using simple science activities to trigger children curiosity. With safety purposes, we focus on how crucial it is to know basic information about themselves and to define, with their families, an emergency communications plan, in case family members are separated.\nUsing a shaking table we teach them how to protect themselves during an earthquake. We then finish with the preparation on an individual emergency kit.\nThis presentation will highlight the importance of encouraging preventive actions in order to reduce the impact of earthquakes on society. This project is developed by science high-school students and teachers, in strait collaboration with the Parents Association. It was partially funded by the Portuguese “Ciência Viva” program. The seismology research group at Instituto Dom Luíz provides the necessary scientific advice.",

Since feedbacks represent the energetics of a dynamic climate system, local imbalances will affect meridional heat fluxes, which in the tropics are modulated by the structure and intensity of the Hadley circulation. A goal of this study is to understand the relationship between the spatial pattern of feedbacks and the large-scale circulations that both cause and respond to them. In a subset of CMIP5 models and for particular seasons, the tropical circulation increases in intensity in a warmer world, in contrast to the anticipated weakening. The feedback pattern shows striking differences depending on whether the circulation strengthens or weakens. By analyzing the coupled feedback-circulation system, the results offer insights into understanding both climate sensitivity and the response of the hydrological cycle under global warming.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have seen the emergence of a new framework for describing plant water use, whereby species-specific water use strategies during periods of hydrologic stress are classified as falling on a spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior. Trees that regulate water potential to within a relatively narrow range, and thereby reduce the risk of damaging xylem cavitation, are categorized as isohydric. In contrast, anisohydric trees allow their leaf water potential to decrease during drought, which may improve gas exchange rates, but at the cost of a greater risk of cavitation in the xylem. To date, most of the approaches to diagnose and characterize isohydric as compared to anisohydric behavior rely on observations of stem or leaf water potential measurements, which are difficult to collect at a high temporal and spatial frequency and rely on destructive techniques. Here, we use cohesion-tension theory to develop a novel approach for diagnosing isohydric/anisohydric behavior in observations of leaf- or canopy-scale stomatal conductance, which are data that may be collected in situ and with relative ease. The approach is particularly focused on exploring how the relationship between stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit changes during dry-down periods. The theoretical predictions suggest that the sensitivity of stomatal conductance to vapor pressure deficit may decrease over the course of the drought event for more anisohydric trees, and increase in the case of more isohydric trees. Species-specific, leaf-level observations of the relevant variables collected during the course of a severe drought event affecting the Morgan-Monroe State Forest in 2012 are shown to confirm the theoretical predictions. Finally, the diagnostic approach is evaluated in the context of other emerging approaches for describing stomatal behavior, including the growing recognition of the role of hydraulic capacitance during drought, and recent advances in stomatal optimization theory. Ultimately, placing species along the isohydric-anisohydric contiuum may advance our understanding of the magnitude of drought-related declines in productivity and other physiological processes in forest ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Inter-calibration of passive microwave sensors has been the subject of on-going activity at Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) since 1974. RSS has produced a brightness temperature TB data record that spans the last 28 years (1987-2014) from inter-calibrated passive microwave sensors on 14 satellites: AMSR-E, AMSR2, GMI, SSMI F08-F15, SSMIS F16-F18, TMI, WindSat. Accompanying the TB record are a suite of ocean products derived from the TBs that provide a 28-year record of wind speed, water vapor, cloud liquid, and rain rate; and 18 years (1997-2014) of sea surface temperatures, corresponding to the period for which 6 and/or 10 GHz measurements are available. Crucial to the inter-calibration and ocean product retrieval are a highly accurate radiative transfer model RTM. The RSS RTM has been continually refined for over 30 years and is arguably the most accurate model in the 1-100 GHz spectrum. The current generation of TB and ocean products, produced using the latest version of the RTM, is called Version-7. The accuracy of the Version-7 inter-calibration is estimated to be 0.1 K, based on inter-satellite comparisons and validation of the ocean products against in situ measurements.\nThe data record produced by RSS has had a significant scientific impact. Over just the last 14 years (2000-2013) RSS data have been used in 743 peer-reviewed journal articles. This is an average of 4.5 peer-reviewed papers published every month made possible with RSS data. Some of the most important scientific contributions made by RSS data have been to the study of the climate. The AR5 Report “Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis” by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the internationally accepted authority on climate change, references 20 peer-reviewed journal papers from RSS scientists. The report makes direct use of RSS water vapor data, RSS atmospheric temperatures from MSU/AMSU, and 9 other datasets that are derived from RSS data. The RSS TB data record is used to produce the NSIDC Sea Ice, NASA Sea Ice, and NASA GPCP Rain Rate datasets. The RSS ocean products are used to produce the NCDC ERSST, CCMP Winds, NOAA Sea Winds, WHOI OA Flux, OSU Wind Stress, and UWISC Cloud Water datasets. The large number of scientific articles and significant impact on the IPCC report demonstrate the success of RSS inter-calibration methodology.",

Scientific goals of the experiment include precise analysis of chemical and isotopic composition, thermal and dynamical structure of the ambient atmosphere, as well as volatiles in soil samples retrieved in the vicinity of the platform, and their diurnal and seasonal variation during at least one Martian year. The instrument consists of three optical paths and two spectral channels. Optical paths corresponding to a classical laser spectroscopy are organized in high-temperature cell for soil volatiles analysis, and multipass integrated cavity-output spectroscopy (ICOS) cell with an efficient pathlength reaching several km. The third optical path is organized in the free atmosphere by direct Sun observations with heterodyne technique. The latter method allows to retrieve vertical profiles of the observed species and to estimate wind speed profile by Doppler shift of absorption line.\nThe instrument covers two major spectral ranges; near infrared (1.39-1.65 micron) and mid-infrared (2.67-3.27 micron). In the near-infrared range main CO2 and H2O isotopes are analyzed, including vertical profiling of H2O and winds. In the mid-infrared, the instrument will detect HDO and methane. An unprecedented accuracy corresponding to upper limit of 70 ppt is expected on CH4 in both ICOS and heterodyne channels.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we will describe the results obtained through integration of a further refined version of the truly global barotropic tidal model of Salehipour et al. (Ocean Modell., 69, 2013) using the most recent reconstruction of ice-age bathymetric conditions as embodied in the recently constructed ICE-6G_C (VM5a) model of Peltier et al. (JGR-Solid Earth, in press, 2014). Our interest is in the spatial and temporal evolution of tidal amplitude, phase and dissipation from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 26,000 years ago until the present. The state-of-the-art higher order nonlinear tidal model of Salehipour et al. (2013) includes a highly parallelized multi-scale framework in which an unstructured tessellation of the global ocean enables extensive local refinement around regions of interest such as the Hawaiian Ridge, the Brazil Basin and the Southern Ocean. At LGM, features such as the Patagonian Shelf were fully exposed land which during the deglaciation process would have been flooded leading to significant changes of tidal range along the evolving coastline. In the further development of this model we have included the fully iterated treatment of the influence of gravitational self-attraction and loading as in, e.g. Egbert et al. (JGR-Oceans, 109, 2004). The treatment of the dissipation of the barotropic tide through dissipation of the internal tide has also been significantly improved. Our paleobathymetry and coastline data sets extend from LGM to present at 500 year intervals and constitute a significant refinement of the widely employed ICE-5G (VM2) model of Peltier (Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci., 32, 2004). Our results will be compared with those recently published by Green & Nycander (JPO, 43, 2013) and Wilmes & Green (JGR-Oceans, 119, 2014) as well as with the earlier results of Griffiths & Peltier (GRL, 35, 2008; J.

            "abstract": "Current efforts to forecast the future of forested systems often oversimplify or overlook the role of plant migration in carbon balance. Research on plant migrations influence on the carbon balance from climate change has been limited from challenges that arise when the ecosystem characteristics of this fine scale process are modeled over large domains. The computational time required to simulate migration lends itself to studies with representative forests while still limiting domain size. For higher resolution runs without limiting domain size migration was introduced to the Ecosystem Demography (ED) model. ED is an individual tree based model that uses a size and age-structured approximation for the first moment of the stochastic ecosystem model. Hence it can simulate large domains at high spatial resolution with reduced computational intensity. As it is an approximation, the specific location of an individual tree within a site is unknown so binomial probability of dispersal distance with respect to patch size was added to the model to determine when migration to a new site should occur. Migration probability also depends on the number of months reproduction occurs at a given site for deciduous and evergreen plant functional types. The maximum paleoecological data migration rate of 100 km per century was used for both functional types and calibrated in ED in a test domain of the eastern United States. After validation, meteorological data from NARCCAP for current and future climate were used to simulate migration at three rates (none, instantaneous and 100 km per century) with a North America domain at quarter degree resolution. Comparison of scenarios highlights plant migrations role on the terrestrial carbon balance under climate change simulations, particularly with regard to transition zones where biomes are expected to expand and contract.",

            "abstract": "The hydrologic community has made significant advancements in our predictive understanding of the hydrologic cycle at continental to global scales. Still, there is need for improving model realism at the local scale (i.e., individual river reaches) to evaluate potential impacts of climate variability or landscape disturbances on water availability, ecosystem services and flood/drought risk. It is also well known that scaling issues has large effects on different hydrological processes. The assessment of local water resources and related systems (e.g., ecological and biogeochemical cycles) requires predictive capabilities for flood events not achievable in many current Earth System models. Here, we use an event-focused hydrologic modeling approach applicable at continental to global scales to study hydrologic scaling effects by systematically varying model scales. A case study in the Mississippi River Basin (3.0 M sqkm) is presented. Driven by TRMM precipitation (3B42v7), MODIS evapotranspiration (MOD16A2), MODIS land cover (MCD12C1), AMSR-E snow water equivalent (SWE), LandSat based river widths, and SRTM digital elevation data (v4.1), the Hillslope River Routing (HRR) hydrologic model is used to estimate daily streamflow throughout the Mississippi River Basin for the period 2004-2012. To generate runoff, a coefficient (α) based is used approach, where runoff is α times precipitation and α varies with soil moisture. The generated runoff is routed with HRR to simulate event hydrographs. In our approach, the runoff coefficient varies in space and time with the maximum value based on land cover, soil type and slope, and the time varying values are based on a relationship with relative soil moisture. Results are presented to illustrate how initial soil moisture conditions impact runoff generation and event hydrograph behavior. Simulated hydrographs are analyzed over a range of model resolutions (i.e., sub-catchment areas ranging from about 10 to 10,000 sqkm) to investigate hydrologic scaling behavior. We also explore model behavior related to individual hydrologic characteristics by systematically averaging over different spatial scales individual model parameters and forcings (rainfall, soil depth, and slope, etc).",

            "abstract": "Improved image-to-image cross correlation software is applied to pairs of sequential Landsat 8 satellite imagery to accurately measure ice surface velocity over ice sheets and glaciers (±0.1 pixel displacement, 15 meter pixels). The high radiometric fidelity of Landsat 8’s panchromatic band (12-bit), and exceptional geolocation accuracy (typically ±5 m) supports the generation of ice velocity fields over very short time intervals (e.g., 16-, 32-, or 48-day repeat images of the same scene location). The high radiometry supports velocity mapping in areas with very subtle topographic detail, including un-crevassed sastrugi regions on ice dome flanks or the ice sheet interior. New Python-based software presently under development (named PyCorr), takes two sequential Landsat 8 OLI scenes (or suitably processed ETM+ or TM scenes) and matches small sub-scenes ('chips') between the images based on similarity in their gray-scale value patterns, using an image correlation algorithm. Peak fitting in the region of maximum correlation for a chip pair yields sub-pixel fits to the feature offset vector. Vector editing after the image correlation runs seeks to eliminate spurious and cloud-impacted vectors, and correct residual geo-location error. This processing is based on plausible values of ice strain rates and known areas of near-zero ice flow (rock outcrops, ice dome areas, etc.). In preliminary processing, we have examined ~800 Landsat 8 image pairs having <20% cloud cover spanning the near-coastal Antarctic ice sheet during the 2013-14 summer season.",

            "abstract": "In this study, five data-driven models were evaluated for groundwater level short-term forecasting under tailings recharge from an abandoned mine in Quebec, Canada. Multiple linear regression (MLR) models were used as a linear model, while artificial neural network (ANN) models were used as a non-linear model. In addition, two hybrid models that utilize wavelet transforms for data preprocessing with MLR or ANN models (W-MLR, W-ANN) were considered for the evaluation of the usefulness of wavelet analysis with linear and nonlinear models. The fifth model was a wavelet bootstrap ANN (W-B-ANN) model. Three predictors were considered as inputs: the tailing recharge, total precipitation, and mean air temperature. Results showed that models using wavelets for data preprocessing (W-MLR and W-ANN) performed better than their corresponding basic models (MLR and ANN), which highlights the ability of wavelet transforms to decompose non-stationary data into discrete wavelet components, highlighting cyclic patterns and trends in the time series at varying temporal scales, rendering the data usable in forecasting. In general, with or without wavelets, ANN models performed better than MLR models; this indicates the nonlinear relationship between the three predictors and the groundwater level. Overall, the W-B-ANN model outperformed all models for each of the three lead-times, which highlights the usefulness of bootstrap modeling, and ensuring model robustness along with improved reliability by reducing variance.",

            "abstract": "The conductivity of aquifers is usually hard to represent in a precise manner due to having a high degree of spatial variability combined with a scarcity of information. As a result, such conductivity fields are commonly modeled as a random field, defined by its expectation value and the variogram function. This variogram is usually parametrized by fitting a model functions to an experimental variogram derived from point measurements of said conductivity. In this study, we investigate properties of such conductivity fields, that are hard to detect using such classic characterization schemes. The first property is roughness, which can be modeled by the flexible Matern function. The second property is connectivity, which has a strong impact on flow and transport behavior. These two properties are hard to characterize from point measurements alone. As a result, it is necessary to use additional data. Therefore, we use the Method of Anchored Distributions (MAD), which is a novel Bayesian tool for the inverse characterization of random fields. MAD is versatile with respect to the used data and does not assume any formal relationship between the target variable, i.e. the log hydraulic conductivity, and the data used for the inversion process, e.g. head measurements, drawdown from pumping tests or break-through curves of a tracer. With respect to the characterization of the aforementioned properties, we investigate the impact of several factors on their identifiability, including alternative and complementary data types, the necessary amount of data, where to collect this data or how to assimilate it.",

            "abstract": "The formation of strath surfaces (fluvially created, sub-horizontal erosion surfaces) requires that the rate of lateral erosion outpaces the rate of incision of a river. The change from incision to strath cutting has commonly been linked to a decrease of incision rates due to shielding of the river bed by a thick sediment cover\n1\n. Straths are abandoned when the bed cover is reduced and incision resumes. A more recent study suggests that strath terrace formation might be linked to a change between a braided and a single-thread river\n2\n. Finally, several models have explored strath formation due to inherent dynamics of meandering systems\n3\n,\n4\n. In the foreland of the Tian Shan in northwest China, weakly consolidated Pliocene sand and siltstones are being actively uplifted at rates of 1 – 3 mm/y by a series of detachment anticlines. A number of elevated, several-kilometer-wide planation surfaces bear witness to a history of multiple strath cutting events by braided streams. In contrast, modern rivers incise into the uplifting folds creating 10 – 200 m deep canyons while the up- and downstream alluvial fans remain unincised.\nWe use GIS analysis, field mapping, and OSL dating to describe incision and beveling of the folds. Our chronologic data reveal at least 2 - 3 beveling events over the last 40 ky on the Mutule fold. We find that lateral erosion of the bedrock during beveling events occurs at rates that are more than an order of magnitude higher than average incision rates. During times of incision (which can be tens of thousands of years long), lateral erosion rates need to be considerably lower in order to explain the formation of narrow canyons. Thus, our observations of scale, rate, and intermittency of strath cutting, seem difficult to reconcile with models that explain strath formation by variations of the incision rate1 or intrinsic meandering dynamics under steady forcing3,4. The critical requirement to explain our observations appears to be repeated changes in the rate of lateral erosion, for example, by climatically modulated changes in river lateral mobility.\n1 Hancock, G.

            "abstract": "Theory and observations have linked equatorial VLF waves with pulsating aurora for decades, invoking the process of pitch-angle scattering of 10's keV electrons in the equatorial magnetosphere. Recent satellite studies have strengthened this argument, by showing strong correlation between pulsating auroral patches and (1) lower-band chorus observed by THEMIS and (2) 30-100 keV electron modulation in the vicinity of geosynchronous orbit observed by GOES. Additionally, a link has been made between Pc4-5 compressional pulsations and modulation of whistler-mode chorus using THEMIS. Here we present simultaneous in-situ observations of structured chorus waves and an apparent poloidal field line resonance as a result of a substorm injection, observed by Van Allen Probes, along with ground-based observations of pulsating aurora. We demonstrate the possible scenario being one of substorm-driven ULF pulsations modulating chorus waves, and thus providing the driver for pulsating particle precipitation into the Earth's atmosphere. We also show, for the first time, a particular 3-Hz modulation of individual chorus elements concurrent with pulsating aurora. Such modulation has been noticed in camera data of pulsating aurora for decades.",

Simulations of CAM-chem for summers 2012 and 2013 are evaluated with the aircraft and ground-based observations from DC3, NOMADSS and SEAC4RS. Comparison of directly emitted biogenic species, such as isoprene, terpenes, methanol and acetone, are used to evaluate the MEGAN emissions. Evaluation of oxidation products, including methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), methacrolein, formaldehyde, and other oxygenated VOCs are used to test the model chemistry mechanism.

            "abstract": "We present results of two techniques to estimate the degree of coupling along the two major subduction zone boundaries that bound the Philippine Mobile Belt, the Philippine Trench and the Manila Trench. Convergence along these plate margins accommodates about 100 mm/yr of oblique plate motion between the Philippine Sea and Sundaland plates. The coupling estimates are based on a recently acquired set of geodetic data from a dense nationwide network of continuous and campaign GPS sites in the Philippines. First, we use a kinematic, elastic block model (tdefnode; McCaffrey, 2009) that combines existing fault geometries, GPS velocities and focal mechanism solutions to solve for block rotations, fault coupling, and intra-block deformation. Secondly, we use a plate-block kinematic model described in Johnson (2013) to simultaneously estimate long-term fault slip rates, block motions and interseismic coupling on block-bounding faults. The best-fit model represents the Philippine Mobile Belt by 14 independently moving rigid tectonic blocks, separated by active faults and subduction zones. The model predicts rapid convergence along the Manila Trench, decreasing progressively southwards, from > 100 mm/yr in the north to less than 20 mm/yr in the south at the Mindoro Island collision zone. Persistent areas of high coupling, interpreted to be asperities, are observed along the Manila Trench slab interface, in central Luzon (16-18°N) and near its southern and northern terminations. Along the Philippine Trench, we observe ~50 mm/yr of oblique convergence, with high coupling observed at its central and southern segments. We identify the range of allowable coupling distributions and corresponding moment accumulation rates on the two subduction zones by conducting a suite of inversions in which the total moment accumulation rate on a selected fault is fixed. In these constrained moment inversions we test the range of possible solutions that meet criteria for minimum, best-fit, and maximum coupling that still fit the data, based on reduced chi-squared calculations. In spite of the variable coupling, the total potential moment accumulation rate along each of the two subduction zones is estimated to range from 3.98 x 1019 to 2.24 x 1020 N-m yr-1, equivalent to a magnitude Mw 8.4 to 8.9 earthquake per 100 years.",

            "abstract": "We examine the resolution-dependence of subgrid-scale vertical transport of moist static energy as parameterized by the Zhang-McFarlane convection parameterization (ZM) under a diagnostic framework. Grid-scale input to ZM is supplied by coarsening output from cloud resolving model (CRM) simulations onto sub-domains ranging in size from 8x8 to 256x256 km^2. Then the ZM based parameterization of vertical transport of moist static energy for scales smaller than the sub-domain size (w'h'ZM) are compared to those directly calculated from the CRM simulations (w'h'CRM) for different sub-domain sizes. We find that the overall strength of w'h'CRM decreases by more than half as the sub-domain size decreases from 128 to 8 km across while w'h'ZM decreases with sub-domain size only for strong convection cases and increases for weaker cases. The resolution dependence of w'h'ZM is determined by the positive-definite change rate of grid-scale convective available potential energy (CAPE) used in the convective quasi-equilibrium (QE) closure. Further analysis shows the change rate of actual grid-scale CAPE itself (before taking the positive definite value) and w'h'CRM behave very similarly as the sub-domain size changes because they are both tied to grid-scale advective tendencies. We suggest a simple algorithm to improve the resolution awareness of ZM based on our analysis. The overall strength of w'h'CRM decreases with increasing resolution while its variability increases dramatically. We find that ZM can capture neither the magnitude nor the pattern of this variability at relatively high resolutions (8 or 16 km grid spacing), suggesting the urgent need for stochastic treatment of convection at high resolutions.",

A 21-year (1991-2011) simulation of maize yield using Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) with observed meteorological forcing, shows that earlier sowing dates are favorable for higher yields primarily by increasing the length of growing season in cold mountaineous regions. In these regions, warmer conditions in the sowing period tend to advance the sowing date and then enhance yield. Over low-elevation warm regions, yields are less correlated with sowing dates and the length of growing season, perhaps because growing season temperatures are high enough for fast growth. Instead, in the warm regions, maize yields are sensitive to temperature variations during the late growing season due to adverse effects of extreme high temperature events on maize development.",

            "abstract": "A new Web site, Satellite Observations of Arctic Change (SOAC, http://nsidc.org/soac), was developed to open up NASA Earth science data that show changes taking place in the Arctic over time to a broader range of users. The site was designed to be used by decision makers, teachers, non-specialist scientists, and the motivated public without the need for technical tools or expertise in manipulating data. The data are displayed on interactive maps, allowing users to explore how and where conditions in the Arctic have changed from the 1970s to the present. Users may animate a time series, zoom in or out, and view a bar graph of anomalies over time. Supporting pages provide brief scientific discussion and background to help users understand the data and the significance of the changes. Links to the source data and documentation are also included. Initial data products for SOAC include anomalies associated with near-surface air temperature; water vapor; sea ice concentration; snow cover; and several others. The potential for use and for inclusion of more data will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake simulations are nowadays producing realistic ground motion time-series in the range of engineering design applications. Of particular significance to engineers are simulations of near-field motions and large magnitude events, for which observations are scarce. With the engineering community slowly adopting the use of simulated ground motions, site response models need to be re-evaluated in terms of their capabilities and limitations to 'translate' the simulated time-series from rock surface output to structural analyses input. In this talk, we evaluate three one-dimensional site response models: linear viscoelastic, equivalent linear and nonlinear. We evaluate the performance of the models by comparing predictions to observations at 30 downhole stations of the Japanese network KIK-Net that have recorded several strong events, including the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Velocity profiles are used as the only input to all models, while additional parameters such as quality factor, density and nonlinear dynamic soil properties are estimated from empirical correlations. We quantify the differences of ground surface predictions and observations in terms of both seismological and engineering intensity measures, including bias ratios of peak ground response and visual comparisons of elastic spectra, and inelastic to elastic deformation ratio for multiple ductility ratios. We observe that PGV/Vs,30 — as measure of strain— is a better predictor of site nonlinearity than PGA, and that incremental nonlinear analyses are necessary to produce reliable estimates of high-frequency ground motion components at soft sites. We finally discuss the implications of our findings on the parameterization of nonlinear amplification factors in GMPEs, and on the extensive use of equivalent linear analyses in probabilistic seismic hazard procedures.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock fractures in the deep critical zone influence the hydraulic characteristics of rocks, the distribution of slope failures, and the rates of weathering and erosion processes that drive landscape evolution. Topography may in turn influence bedrock fractures. Previous studies found that topographic perturbations of ambient tectonic stress fields could be large enough to create different distributions of fractures beneath ridges and valleys. However, these studies considered only two-dimensional topographic profiles in plane strain. We use a boundary element model to calculate three-dimensional elastic stress fields beneath topographic surfaces, accounting for the effects of gravity and ambient tectonic stress. From the modeled stress fields, we calculate failure potential, a normalized measure of differential stress, as a scalar proxy for rock damage. The effects of three-dimensional topography on the stress field are most evident at channel junctions and ridge crests and depend sensitively on the ambient tectonic stress. We apply our stress modeling procedure to Critical Zone Observatory sites, using nearby hydraulic fracturing and overcoring measurements to constrain the ambient stress fields. We then compare the spatial distributions of failure potential with seismic velocity profiles and fractures observed in borehole image logs. Interestingly, the spatial distributions of failure potential and seismic velocity are similar, suggesting that topographic stresses may influence near-surface bedrock fractures, and thus affect weathering, erodibility, and groundwater flow, in predictable ways.",

            "abstract": "The Solar Aspect System (SAS) of the RHESSI satellite measures the optical solar limb in the red continuum with a cadence typically set at 16 samples/s in each of three linear CCD sensors. RHESSI has observed the Sun continuously since its launch in early 2002, and we have acquired a unique data set ranging over a full 11-year solar cycle and consisting of about 3x10^10 single data points. Analyzing data for an initial period in 2004, these measurements have led to the most accurate oblateness measurement to date, 8.01+-0.14 milli arcsec (Fivian et al., 2008), a value consistent with models predicting an oblateness from surface rotation. An excess oblateness term can be attributed to magnetic elements possibly located in the enhanced network. We have started to also study photometric properties of our data. Previous observations of latitude-dependent brightness variations at the limb had suggested the presence of a polar temperature excess as large as 1.5 K. The RHESSI observations, made with a rotating telescope in space, have great advantages in the rejection of systematic errors in the very precise photometry required for such an observation. Our new measurements of latitude-dependent brightness variations at the limb lead to a quadrupolar term (a pole-to-equator temperature variation) of the order of 0.1 K, an order of magnitude smaller than previously reported. We present the analysis of these unique data, an overview of some results and we report on our progress as we apply our developed analysis method to the whole 12 years of data.",

CEDAR Workshops are on the order of a week long and at various locations with the goal of being close to university campuses where CEDAR type scientific research is done. Although there is no formal student group within the CEDAR community, the workshops are very student-focused. Roughly half the Workshop participants are students. There are two Student Representatives on the CEDAR Science Steering Committee (CSSC), the group of scientists who organize the CEDAR Workshops. Each Student Representative is nominated by his or her peers, chosen by the CSSC and then serves a two year term. Each year, one of the Student Representatives is responsible for organizing and moderating a day-long session targeted for students, made up of tutorial talks, which aim to prepare both undergraduate and graduate students for the topics that will be discussed in the main CEDAR Workshop. The theme of this session changes every year. Past themes have included: upper atmospheric instrumentation, numerical modeling, atmospheric waves and tides, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, equatorial aeronomy and many others. Frequently, the Student Workshop has ended with a panel of post-docs, researchers and professors who discuss pressing questions from the students about the next steps they will take in their careers. As the present and past CSSC Student Representatives, we will recount a brief history of the CEDAR Workshops, our experiences serving on the CSSC and organizing the Student Workshop, a summary of the feedback we collected about the Student Workshops and what it’s like to be student in the CEDAR community.",

            "abstract": "Marine seismic reflection data collected over the past 30+ years in the Ross Sea region of southwest Antarctica has been tied to the ANDRILL and CIROS boreholes to develop a seismic stratigraphic model that constrains the spatial and temporal evolution of the flexural basin surrounding Ross Island. Ross Island was formed from 4.6 Ma to present by extrusive volcanism in the Ross Sea at the southern end of the Terror Rift. Preliminary mapping has identified a hinge zone trending northeastward from Mt. Bird, separating the well-developed flexural moat on the west side of the island from sub-horizontal strata on the northeast and east sides. The flexural moat on the west and north-northwest sides of the island is approximately 40-45 km wide with sediment fill thickness of roughly 1100 m. Seismic lines to the east and northeast of the island do not indicate the presence of a flexural moat. Instead, the thickness of strata on the east side of the island that are time-equivalent to the infill of the flexural moat on the west side remains constant from the Coulman High westward to within ~28 km of Ross Island (the landward extent of the seismic data coverage). The concordant post-Miocene strata on the east and northeast sides of Ross Island imply either that the flexural basin does not extend more than ~28 km eastward from the Ross Island shoreline, or that the flexural basin is not present on that side of the island. The first scenario requires that the elastic strength of the lithosphere differ on either side of the hinge. The second scenario can be explained by a mechanical rupture in the lithosphere beneath Ross Island, with Ross Island acting as an end-load on a mechanical half-plate that forms the lithosphere beneath Ross Island and westward. In this model, the lithosphere east of Ross Island and the hinge forms a second half-plate, bearing little or none of the Ross Island volcanic load.",

            "abstract": "Observational data is always associated to specific time and space scales. When the observed area of study is homogeneous, the same dynamics can be expected at different observed scales. It is generally not the case. This is a common obstacle when comparing data or products of different resolution. This question is investigated here considering the cycles of rainfed crops observed from space in semi-arid regions. In such context, the rainfed crops are coupled to the climatic dynamics in a synchronized way, the observational signal can thus be seen as an aggregation of phase synchronized dynamics.\nIn the first part of this work, a case study is implemented. Rössler chaotic systems are used for this purpose as elementary oscillators relating to homogeneous behavior. The ‘observational’ signal is obtained by aggregating additively the signals of several elementary chaotic systems. Analytically, it is found that the aggregated signal can be approximated by the Rössler system itself but with some parameterization changes. This result can be generalized to any system for which a canonical approximation is possible. Using the global modeling technique [1], this theoretical result is then illustrated practically, by showing that an approximation of the Rössler dynamics can be retrieved, without any a priori knowledge, from the aggregated signal.\nIn the second part, the cycle of cereal crops observed from space in semi-arid conditions is investigated from real observational data (the GIMMS product of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [2] is used for this purpose). A low-dimensional chaotic model could recently be obtained from a spatially aggregated signal which presents properties never observed from real data before: a toroidal and weakly dissipative dynamics [3]. These unusual properties are then retrieved at various places and scales.\n[1] Mangiarotti S., Coudret R., Drapeau L. & Jarlan L., 2012.

Various pedagogical techniques that have shown efficacy at 4-year colleges have been implemented and adopted to improve student learning and course retention as well as to stimulate their interest in science and in STEM careers. The course covered broad range of STEM topics central to the gemology curriculum, including concepts from geology, mineralogy, physics and chemistry. Lectures and labs were linked. Students’ misconceptions were addressed via guided laboratory activities in a studio-learning environment. The course used peer-based learning and problem solving by creating student groups that discussed observations and measurements. Discussion groups were required to observe, synthesize, and evaluate data for presentations. The goal was to empower student learning and peer-based teaching and to recruit early career, often non-STEM students, to earth science. Students were often prompted to engage in self-reflections on their learning. In this presentation we will present the analysis of the evaluation of the course and its impact on community college students. Some of the evaluation tools we have used are pre- and post- knowledge surveys, science attitude and belief surveys as well as a Geological Interest instrument. Parallel sections of traditionally taught lecture-only courses (taught by the same instructor) were utilized as a control group in the analysis. The pedagogical implications of the analysis on instruction and course design will be discussed as well.",

The MTM is regarded to be the result of the blending of the upward propagating diurnal, semi-diurnal, and other higher order tidal modes and presents itself in intensities and temperatures as a poleward traveling feature with a slight eastward motion. The MSIS-00 model is used as a reference to determine the MTM amplitude for these nights. The statistical analysis of these results shows the detection of the MTM structure with an amplitude greater than or equal to 50 K to occur for ~25% of the nights, with a greater probability for summer periods. The observed MTM amplitude varies from a few tens of degrees to 250 K, maximum. Not only is variability in the local time of the MTM peak seen from one site to another, but a spatial variation of the MTM amplitude is also observed within the NATION latitude coverage. We suggest that this variability is a result of the tidal wave forcing mechanism changing from site to site due to the spatial variation of tidal wave dissipation caused by the latitudinal variation in the E- and F-region plasma densities. The additional measurements of intensities provide further insight into the MTM phenomenology with corresponding enhancements seen where there are temperature maxima. These results illustrate the advantages provided by a network of FPI observatories to help understand large-scale neutral atmosphere dynamical behavior.",

            "abstract": "The nature of the magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind between the ion and electron scales is still under debate. Using the Cluster/STAFF instrument, we make a survey of the power spectral density and of the polarization of these fluctuations at frequencies 1-400 Hz, during five years (2001-2005) when Cluster was in the free solar wind, i.e. not magnetically connected to the Earth's bow-shock.\nIn most of the analyzed time intervals, the fluctuations are non-polarized and they have a general spectral shape between the ion scales and a fraction of electron scales. The intensity of these spectra is well correlated to the ion thermal pressure. These non-polarized fluctuations seem to have a negligible frequency in the solar wind frame, and a wavevector anisotropy kperp>>k||. In the rest ~10% of the selected data, we observe narrow-band, right-handed, circularly polarized fluctuations, with wave vectors quasi-parallel to the mean magnetic field, superimposed on the spectrum of the permanent background turbulence. We interpret these coherent fluctuations as whistler mode waves. The life time of such waves varies between a few seconds and several hours. We analyze in details the long-lived whistler waves, i.e. with a life time longer than five minutes. We find several conditions for the appearance of such waves: (1) a low level of the background turbulence; (2) a low ion thermal pressure; (3) a slow solar wind speed; (4) an electron heat flux Qe>4μW/m2; (5) an electron mean free path larger than 0.5 AU, i.e., a low collisional frequency; (6) a change in the magnetic field direction. When the level of the background turbulence is high, we cannot affirm that whistler waves do not exist: they can be just masked by the turbulence. The six above conditions for the presence of parallel whistlers in the free solar wind are necessary but are not sufficient. When the electron parallel beta factor βe is larger than 3, the whistler waves are seen along the heat flux threshold of the whistler heat flux instability.",

            "abstract": "The California Water Conservation Act of 2009 includes a call for improved quantification of agricultural water use efficiency. Metrics for quantifying irrigated agricultural water use can help evaluate irrigation system performance and assess strategies for improved water management. In support of this legislation, the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) recommends various metrics to help identify opportunities for improving agricultural water use efficiency. Included among these are the Crop Consumptive Use Fraction (CCUF), which evaluates crop consumptive use relative to total applied water, and the Agronomic Water Use Fraction (AWUF), which considers additional beneficial uses of water including soil salinity management, land preparation, and frost protection. A prototype calculator has been built to provide users with a consistent and practical means to derive these metrics over seasonal to annual timeframes. The tool combines Landsat optical data from NASA's Satellite Irrigation Management Support System with reference evapotranspiration from CDWR's California Irrigation Management Information System to estimate crop consumptive water use and evaluate CCUF for non-stressed crops on drip or micro-sprinkler delivery systems. A soil water balance model can then be applied to refine the estimate for crops under deficit irrigation or serviced by sprinkler, flood or furrow water delivery systems during all or part of the season. For AWUF derivation, the user specifies additional values related to agronomic water use, if known, or may use available on-board tools to estimate these values under best professional practices. The calculator operates on several major annual/perennial crop types. Additional input parameters include growing region, season, soil texture, precipitation, and irrigation amount/method.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific walrus (O. r. divergens) uses winter sea ice in the Bering Sea for numerous parts of its natural history including courtship, foraging, and migration. Recent and predicted loss of sea ice has caused the Pacific walrus to be considered for an elevated status under the Endangered Species Act. Study of the ice conditions during this period is required to investigate changes in the Bering Sea ice pack and its effects on walrus sustainability. Using Radarsat-1 data and second-order texture statistics, a classification system was devised to separate sea ice into three distinguishable classes based on walrus needs of open water availability in the pack ice: discontinuous pack ice, continuous pack ice, and open water. Classifications are performed on sub-regional image areas to facilitate classification of heterogeneous seascapes which are thought to be distinguishable by walrus. Spatial, as well as temporal, changes in the seascape cover, based on the classification, are achieved. These results are then combined with ship-based observations of walrus to quantify walrus habitat preference. The three-class algorithm has a success rate of 94% for the discontinuous ice and continuous pack ice. Radarsat-1 images from 2004 – 2008 were analyzed for changes in seasonal and annual discontinuous ice extent. After classification, the spatial extent of discontinuous ice was found to vary throughout 2004 – 2008 in the Bering Sea shelf. Walrus are also shown to prefer discontinuous pack far from the southernmost ice edge. Maps of walrus habitat preference and persistent areas of sea ice seascapes are created and then can be used for the walrus’ status consideration under the Endangered Species Act in addition to general species management issues.",

            "abstract": "A major weakness of forest ecosystem models applied to Amazonia is their inability to capture the diversity of responses to changes in water availability commonly observed within and across forest communities, severely hampering efforts to predict the fate of Amazon forests under climate change. Such models often prescribe moisture sensitivity using heuristic response functions which are uniform across all individuals and lack important knowledge about trade-offs in hydraulic traits. We address this weakness by implementing a process representation of plant hydraulics into an individual- and trait-based model (Trait Forest Simulator; TFS) intended for application at discrete sites across Amazonia. The model represents a trade-off in the safety and efficiency of water conduction in xylem tissue through hydraulic traits, which then lead to variation in plant water use and growth dynamics. The model accounts for the buffering effects of leaf and stem capacitance on leaf water potential at short time scales, and cavitation-induced reductions in whole-plant conductance over longer periods of water stress. We explore multiple possible links between this hydraulic trait spectrum and other whole-plant traits, such as maximum photosynthetic capacity and wood density. The model is shown to greatly improve the diversity of tree response to seasonal changes in water availability as well as response to drought, as determined by comparison with sap flux and stem dendrometry measurements. Importantly, this individual- and trait-based framework provides a testbed for identifying both critical processes and functional traits needed for inclusion in coarse-scale Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, which will lead to reduced uncertainty in the future state of Amazon tropical forests.",

Several authors have highlighted how the subsurface heat buildup in the western tropical Pacific and the recharged phase in zonally-averaged heat content are intrinsic elements of ENSO variability, leading to those changes in zonal wind stress, sea surface temperature and thermocline tilt that characterize the growing and mature phases of EN.\nHere we use an ensemble of ocean and atmosphere reanalyses to expose the dynamical mechanisms that contribute to the heat buildup and the recharged phase. The relative roles of (i) horizontal upper-ocean convergence and downwelling motion in the western equatorial Pacific, (ii) zonal heat advection by the Equatorial Undercurrent along the thermocline and (iii) subsurface meridional Sverdrup convergence in the central tropical Pacific are described and discussed. Our analyses suggest that the interannual eastward propagation of subsurface warm anomalies along the thermocline results from a combination of all these mechanisms, but their relative contribution varies with space and time. Our results highlight the importance of the three dimensional dynamic and thermodynamic structure of the tropical Pacific on the mechanisms explaining the subsurface heat buildup and subsequent development of EN events.",

            "abstract": "Wildfire can have complex effects on physical and chemical properties of soil and post-fire runoff. Water quality issues in the post-fire runoff may have caused catastrophic events in aquatic ecosystem in the Virgin River in Southwestern U.S. To examined the mechanisms of the impact of wildfire on post-fire runoff water quality, field sampling and experiments were conducted on surfaces of various fuel types at a burned site in the Virgin River Watershed. Rainfall simulation tests were performed to generate runoff for water quality test including in-situ DO and pH measurement and laboratory tests on a number of water quality constituents. Soil/ash samples collected from burned surfaces were applied in a laboratory test to produce solutions of different concentrations and DO changes over a 24-hour period were measured. Results confirmed that, for runoff carrying large amounts of sediment or debris, DO values can be substantially reduced to a level close to or lower than 5 mg/L. Fire effects may enhance this trend, but is not necessarily a critical reason for the reduction of DO levels.\nLaboratory runoff and soil sample analysis show that the post-fire runoff in this watershed may contain a large amount of ammonia (NH3 and NH4+). The concentration of ammonia can be higher than the lethal level to many (if not all) fish species. Fire effects appear to have a significant impact on the ammonia level, which lead to an increase of several times to one order of magnitude in the ammonia concentration in the runoff or soil solution under burned conditions. These results provide information to better understand post-fire water quality in this and similar watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Bed forms affect both bed load transport and flow resistance strongly and change their shapes and sizes depending on underlying grain size distribution and shear stress. A series of flume experiments were conducted at the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory to study the effect of bed form dynamics on flow turbulence and sediment transport with both gravel and sand as bed material and different flow conditions. From the experimental data, the spectrum of bed elevation time series, the PDFs of bed elevation increments and the flow resistance characteristics are all analyzed. The wavelet-based spectral analysis shows that the slopes of the elevation spectrums are -2 and -3 for gravel and sand bed surfaces, respectively. The slope -3 indicates that the surface is self-similar, in another words, the ratios of bed form heights and lengths for different bed forms are the same; however, the slope of -2 indicates that the surface is self-affine, and in such case (-2) the ratios of bed form heights and lengths for different bed forms are not correlated at all. We interpret that the relative size of grain and boundary layer affects the bed form characteristics significantly, e.g., grain size of sand is of the same scale as the thickness of boundary layer, but both are much smaller than the grain size of gravel. Our results suggest that the PDFs of bed elevation increments for both gravel and sand beds can be fitted well with two-sided asymmetric exponential function. Furthermore, we show that the flow resistance (Darcy-Weisbach coefficients f) are much higher for sand bed than gravel bed, and the former is contributed by form drags, which is much larger than grain drags. For gravel bed, f and the skewness of bed elevation increments increases with flow discharge whereas for the sand bed, both f and the skewness of bed elevation increments decreases which corresponds to the transition in hydraulic conditions for dune to dynamic flat surface in our experiments. The analysis highlights the need to incorporate several different topics such as boundary layer, bed form development, flow resistance and bed load transport together.",

            "abstract": "Stormwater runoff is a conduit for several pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in to surface and ground water bodies. The control of runoff and pollutants is typically addressed by best management practices (BMPs), such as retention/detention ponds or catchment basins in general. The effectiveness of catchment basins in reducing the volume of runoff and removal of some contaminants has been established. However, very little is known about the fate of the contaminants settled within these structures. In coastal regions and places with shallow groundwater tables accumulation of high concentrations of PAHs in the bottom sediments poses a potential threat for groundwater contamination. The concentrations of PAHs accumulated in the sediments of these catchment basins will primarily depend on the sources of runoff origin and the surrounding land use. Due to the physico-chemical characteristics of PAHs, their transport not only can occur in the liquid and solid phase, but it is also possible that gaseous emissions can be produced from BMP systems.\nFor the purpose of this study, five stormwater catchment basins along the I-95 corridor in Rhode Island were selected based on the stormwater runoff origin and covering (industrial, urban, highway, and commercial) land uses. To study the stratification of PAHs sediment cores one foot were collected and analyzed for 31PAHs (16 EPA parent PAH and 15 methylated PAHs). In order to determine whether the catchment basins are a source of atmospheric pollution polyethylene passive samplers were deployed to determine the freely dissolved PAHs in the water column and gas phase PAHs at the air-water interface. This presentation will describe how PAH fluxes move between three environmental compartments (sediments, water column, atmosphere) within the five stormwater catchment basins. Further, it will be investigated whether these BMP structures can act as contaminant sources rather than sinks and whether BMP maintenance has to be targeted towards pollutant removal to maintain an effective stormwater treatment system.",

            "abstract": "Accounting for an estimated 23 percent of the world’s population, coastal communities face many types of natural hazards. In particular, they may be vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones, flooding due to tsunamis or storm surges, erosion, saltwater intrusion, and subsidence. These coastal hazards are further exacerbated by population growth and climate change. There is a lack of consensus in the literature about what constitutes vulnerability (negative impacts) and resilience (recovery from negative impacts) and how to measure these phenomena. While some important work has focused on the long-term effects of coastal hazards on economic growth, little has been done to understand, in quantitative terms, the extent to which coastal communities may be vulnerable to such hazards and, if so, whether they can be resilient. We surveyed nine indicators of human well-being in order to determine their potential suitability as measures of coastal vulnerability or resilience. Some measures, such as the Gross Domestic Product, the Human Development Index, and the Gini coefficient, comprise economic or distributional indicators of human welfare; others, such as the Social Vulnerability Index, are more complex and difficult to interpret. We selected per capita personal income as the most viable indicator, due largely to its simplicity and its availability over several decades. We used it to examine human community vulnerability and resilience to a specific coastal hazard—significant storm surges from major coastal hurricanes—in several US coastal metropolitan areas. We compiled data on per capita personal income from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis for 15 to 20 years prior and subsequent to four major hurricanes: Hugo, which hit the Charleston, South Carolina, metropolitan area in 1989; Bob, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, in 1991; Andrew, Miami, Florida, in 1992; and Opal, Pensacola, Florida, in 1995. Intervention analysis using linear regression suggests that these coastal areas exhibited the full range of possible combinations of vulnerability and resilience.",

Here, we present a new numerical code developed to retrieve gas profiles of NO2 and HCHO using radiative transfer simulations. We present first results of such profiles from the MAX-DOAS station located at UNAM campus.\nThe code works in two steps: First, the O4 slant column density information is used to retrieve an aerosol profile. As an a-priori aerosol profile, we use averaged ceilometer data measured at UNAM and scaled to the total optical depth provided by the Aeronet data base. In the second step, the retrieved aerosol profile information is used together with the trace gas (HCHO or NO2) SCDs to retrieve the trace gas profiles.\nThe inversion is based on a gauss-newton iteration scheme and uses constrained least square fitting with either optimal estimation or Tihkonov regularization. For the latter, the regulation matrix is currently constructed from the discrete first derivative operator.\nThe forward model uses the radiative transfer code VLIDORT. The inputs to VLIDORT are calculated using temperature and pressure information from daily radiosounde measurements and aerosol single scattering optical depths and asymmetry factors from the Aeronet data base for Mexico City. For the gas absorption cross sections we use the same values as were used for the SCD calculation from the recorded spectra using QDOAS. Besides demonstrating the functionality of the algorithm showing profile retrievals of simulated SCDs with added random noise, we present HCHO and NO2 profiles retrieved from SCDs calculated from the MAX-DOAS measurements at UNAM campus at selected days.",

            "abstract": "Annual mean surface heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere in midlatitudes are maximum in the Gulf Stream and that surface flux is driven by geostrophic heat transport convergence. Evidence is mounting that on interannual times scales, the surface flux of heat in the Gulf Stream region is controlled by the amount of heat that is stored in the region and that the heat storage rate is in turn controlled by geostrophic heat transport convergence. In addition, variations in meridional heat transport have been linked to the meridional overturning circulation just to the south of the Gulf Stream at the RAPID/MOCHA array at 26.5N, suggesting that changes in the meridional overturning circulation might be linked to surface heat exchange in the Gulf Stream.\nThe twenty-year record of satellite sea level (SSH) along with high quality surface heat fluxes allow a detailed evaluation of the interaction between stored oceanic heat in this region and surface heat fluxes on interannual times scales. Using gridded sea level from AVISO as a proxy for upper ocean heat content along with surface turbulent heat flux from OAFlux, we evaluate the lagged correlations between interannual surface turbulent heat fluxes and SSH variability. Previous work has shown that where advection is small lagged correlations between SST (sea surface temperature) and surface turbulent heat flux are generally antisymmetric about zero lag with negative correlations when SST leads and positive correlations when SST lags. This indicates that surface heat fluxes force SST anomalies that at later times are damped by surface fluxes. In contrast, the lagged correlation between SSH anomalies and the turbulent flux of heat in the Gulf Stream region show a distinctly asymmetric relationship about zero-lag. The correlations are negative when SSH leads but are not significant when SSH lags indicating the dominant role in heat transport convergence in driving heat content changes, and that the heat content anomalies generated control the exchange of heat between the ocean and the atmosphere. Seasonal analysis shows that the Gulf Stream region’s heat content primarily is primarily released in winter and that in winter, SSH also gives significant predictive skill for mid-level cloud fraction.",

            "abstract": "Global sea level rise is one of the most direct and potentially costly impacts of human caused global warming. It is driven by both melting glaciers and ice sheets (which react to the warming atmosphere and ocean), and direct absorption of heat by the oceans. In fact, over 90 percent of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases warms the oceans, causing thermal expansion and sea level rise. For this reason the recent warming “hiatus”, or slowdown in the rate of global surface temperature increase, may play an important role in ongoing and future sea level rise. Recent studies based on ocean reanalyses have suggested that the low rate of warming at the ocean surface (which is nearly identical to the rate of global surface temperature increase) is compensated by more rapid warming at depth. We analyzed ocean in situ observations and satellite measurements of sea level independently of these reanalyses, and compared the most recent decade with prior decades to determine whether warming at depth was faster in the past. We find little to no evidence for an increase of the rate of ocean warming at depth in the most recent decade. Our analysis suggests that a weaker external forcing trend might be a stronger key component than the interior exchange in the coupled feedback.",

            "abstract": "Southern Alaska is a complex amalgam of tectonic environments, centered on the subduction/collision of the Yakutat Block with North America. Along the Aleutians in the west, the Pacific Plate subducts normally beneath North America, with a gradually shallowing subduction angle towards the Yakutat Terrane to the east. The western region of the Yakutat Block undergoes nearly flat-slab subduction beneath North America, whereas it transitions to collision in the northeast, which is the primary driver for the growth of the Chugach-St. Elias orogen. Farther to the east, the collisional system transitions to a transform boundary with the Fairweather-Queen Charlotte fault system.\nThe collisional system contributes to farfield tectonic effects in many regions, including northern Alaska and the Pacific Plate, but also combines with glaciation to drive sedimentation in the Gulf of Alaska. Glaciation has periodically increased in the St. Elias Range since the Miocene, but began dominating erosion and spurred enhanced exhumation since the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, at ~2.5 Ma. Results from IODP Expedition 341 show the first appearance of ice-rafted debris and a doubling of Gulf sedimentation at site U1417 at this age, and a major increase in sedimentation at ~1 Ma at sites U1417 and U1418. Glacigenic sediment flux into the Gulf of Alaska represents the majority of accumulation in the deepwater Surveyor Fan, and was the impetus for formation of the Surveyor Channel system.\nClimate events correlate to three major differentiable sequences across the Surveyor Fan that have been previously mapped using seismic reflection profiles. The change in morphology observed throughout the sequences allows us to characterize the influence that a glaciated orogen can have in shaping margin processes and the sediment pathways from source to sink. IODP Expedition 341 results allow us to now apply this method at higher resolution time scales (i.e., 100 kyr). We will explore changes in fan geomorphology observed in seismic reflection data to decipher changes in southern Alaska tectonics and climate, and to show the effect of those changes on deepwater sedimentary systems.",

The vertical distribution of subsurface moisture and its accessibility for evapotranspiration is a key determinant of the fate of ecosystems and their feedback on the climate system.\nA time series of five years of high frequency (every 30 min) observations of water table at a research site in Northern California shows that the water tables, 18 meters below the surface, can respond in less than 8 hours to the first winter rains, suggesting very fast flow through micro-pores and fractured bedrock. Not quite as quickly as the water table rises after a heavy rain, the elevated water level recedes, contributing to down-slope flow and stream flow.\nThe governing equation of our model uses the well-known Richards' equation, which is a non-linear PDE, derived by applying the continuity requirement to Darcy’s law. The most crucial parameter of this PDE is the hydraulic conductivity K(θ), which describes the speed at which water can move in the underground. We specify a saturation profile as a function of depth (i.e. Ksat(z)) and allow K(θ) to vary not only with the soil moisture saturation but also include a stochastic component which mimics the effects of fracture flow and other naturally occurring heterogeneity, that is evident in the subsurface.\nA large number of Monte Carlo simulation are performed in order to identify optimal settings for the new model, as well as analyze the results of this new approach on the available data.\nInitial findings from this exploratory work are encouraging and the next steps include testing this new stochastic approach on data from other sites and also apply ensemble based data assimilation algorithms in order to estimate model parameters with the available measurements.",

Sediment from these rivers has formed one of the largest and most densely populated deltas in the world. The combined rivers discharge through the Meghna estuary into the Bay of Bengal. The study area, Mehendiganj Island, is located in the morphologically dynamic Meghna estuary region of the delta and is characterized by rapid accretion and erosion. The net effect of erosion-accretion processes between the years 1987-2012 was analyzed using Landsat satellite imagery. Time-lapse series were generated over consecutive monsoon periods to estimate net erosion, and reveal that morphological changes are influenced by hydrological conditions (e.g. areal extent of flooding surface, hydrometeorology) driven by high river and sediment discharge, mainly during the seasonal monsoon (wet) period. The hydrological conditions and, consequently, the morphological changes exhibit a skewed pattern in annual distribution on account of high-energy condition prevailing during the monsoon. Total erosion and accretion within the study area was estimated to be about 5997 hectares and 2922 hectares, respectively. The measured annual erosion rates were as high as 1493 hectares, which were about 15% of the existing land surface within the study area. Discharge rates and sediment loads over the course of the study period were calculated using a numerical model (WBMsed) and was validated by comparisons with field-measured values. Moreover, hydrological parameters were analyzed in the context of statistical hydrology in order to obtain trends and were correlated with annual accretion and erosion rates attained from the satellite image analysis. Anomalies in the patterns of annual accretion and erosion rates were detected during extreme hydrometeorological events such as high floodwater years and cyclones. The morphological changes are associated with changes in different hydrological parameters. These massive changes caused social hazards with loss of life and property within the densely populated locality.",

These accuracy and resolution of these snow depth measurements are desirable in mountain environments in which ground measurements are dangerous and difficult to perform, and other remote sensing techniques are often characterized by large errors and uncertainties due variable topography, vegetation, and snow properties.\nBE ground filtering algorithms make different assumptions about ground characteristics to differentiate between ground and non-ground features. Because of this, ground surfaces may have unique characteristics that confound ground filters depending on the location and terrain conditions. These include low-lying shrubs (<1 m), areas with high topographic relief, and areas with high surface roughness. We evaluate several different algorithms, including lowest point, kriging, and more sophisticated splining techniques such as the Multiscale Curvature Classification (MCC) to resolve snow depths. Understanding how these factors affect BE surface models and thus snow depth measurements is a valuable contribution towards improving the processing protocols associated with these relatively new snow observation techniques.\nWe test the different BE filtering algorithms using LiDAR and photogrammetric measurements taken from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in Southwest Tasmania, Australia during the winter and spring of 2013. The study area is characterized by sloping, uneven terrain, and different types of vegetation including eucalyptus and conifer trees, as well as dense shrubs varying in heights from 0.3-1.5 meters. Initial snow depth measurements using the unfiltered point cloud measurements are characterized by large errors (~20-90 cm) due to the dense vegetation. Using filtering techniques instead of raw differencing improves the estimation of snow depth in our study area, and reduces the RMSE to 10 cm, depending on the technique used.",

To forecast and “nowcast” the radiation environment requires the fusing of three components: 1) the ability to provide probabilities for incipient solar activity; 2) the use of these probabilities and daily coronal and solar wind observations to model the 3D spatial and temporal heliosphere, including magnetic field structure and transients, within 10 AU; and 3) the ability to model the acceleration and transport of energetic particles based on current and anticipated coronal and heliospheric conditions. We describe how to address 1) – 3) based on our existing, well developed, and validated codes and models. The goal of RISCS toolset is to provide an operational forecast and “nowcast” capability that will a) predict solar energetic particle (SEP) intensities; b) spectra for protons and heavy ions; c) predict maximum energies and their duration; d) SEP composition; e) cosmic ray intensities, and f) plasma parameters, including shock arrival times, strength and obliquity at any given heliospheric location and time. The toolset would have a 72 hour predicative capability, with associated probabilistic bounds, that would be updated hourly thereafter to improve the predicted event(s) and reduce the associated probability bounds. The RISCS toolset would be highly adaptable and portable, capable of running on a variety of platforms to accommodate various operational needs and requirements. The described transition plan is based on a well-established approach developed in the Earth Science discipline that ensures that the customer has a tool that meets their needs.",

            "abstract": "Current models still have large uncertainties in estimating the impacts of light absorbing aerosols on climate. Light absorbing aerosols can affect climate through radiative effects in both atmosphere and snowpack (hereafter atmospheric-effect and snow-effect, respectively). Both effects, to some extent, have been investigated in previous studies, but few have compared the two effects and their interaction with climate. In addition, most previous studies used models with relatively coarse spatial resolutions (1~2 degrees) that may not be able to resolve climate extremes and mountain snowpack. In this study, a state-of-the-art regional model, WRF-Chem, is coupled with the SNICAR model that includes a sophisticated representation of snow metamorphism processes for climate study. The coupled model is configured at a relatively high spatial resolution (0.25 degree) to simulate black carbon (BC) and dust concentrations in snow and their climatic impact over Eurasia for 2006-2010. The simulations are evaluated with various observations including some extensive field measurements over North China. In general, the model simulated spatial variability of BC and dust mass concentrations in the top snow layer (hereafter BCS and DSTS, respectively) are consistent with observations to within the uncertainty ranges of observations. BCS and DSTS introduce similar radiative warming in the snowpack, which is comparable to the magnitude of surface radiative cooling due to BC and dust in the atmosphere. The impact of BC and dust in the snowpack and in the atmosphere on the variability of regional hydrological cycle and temperature is characterized separately by sequentially “disconnecting” specific BC and dust forcing in the atmosphere and in the snowpack. This study represents an effort in using a regional modeling framework with a relatively high resolution to simulate BC and dust in snowpack and their climatic impact.",

            "abstract": "We present the results of a tidal deformation model for Europa in which the tidal potential and associated stresses evolve with time as the orbit changes. With this model we predict the times and locations at which the tidal stress in the ice shell is maximum, due to the evolution of Europa’s orbital configuration. The orbital elements of Europa change with time due to perturbations from the oblate mass distribution of Jupiter, and from gravitational interactions with neighboring satellites. This is particularly relevant in the Galilean satellite system, in which Io, Europa, and Ganymede participate in the Laplace resonance.\nUsing a secular variation orbital model for Jupiter and the Galilean satellites, we have determined the time variations of eccentricity, longitude of periapse, inclination, and longitude of the ascending node for Europa. This allows us to predict the orbital state for millions of years into the past and future. We then input the orbital element variations into an axi-symmetric tidal deformation model. The variation in stress with radius, within the ice shell, is small and all lateral variation patterns are preserved. As a result, we restrict our analysis to the free surface where only two components of the axisymmetric stress tensor remain non-zero, and are the principal stresses.\nStress magnitudes are maximized at the “tidal equator” at all times, with additional extrema at the sub- and anti-Jovian locations. On the 3.55-day orbital time scale, stress maximizes when the distance to Jupiter is farthest from its mean value (periapse and apoapse). On longer time scales, the stress extrema are maximized at times of local eccentricity peaks.\nAlthough appropriate failure conditions for an ice shell on Europa are not fully known, we use Anderson theory to divide the surface into expected faulting style provinces. Using a Coulomb stress function, as an indicator of fracture propensity, we compute the fault plane orientations, at various locations on Europa’s surface, which maximize the Coulomb stress. We repeat this analysis at epochs of increased eccentricity to compare today’s stress field to that of past and future. We then predict the most probable locations, times, and occurrence frequency for tidal fracturing of Europa’s surface.",

            "abstract": "Rapid changes in slab geometry are typically associated with fragmentation of the subducted plate; however, continuous curvature of the slab is also possible. The transition from flat to normal subduction in southern Peru is one such geometrical change, where previous studies have suggested both tearing and continuity of the slab. The morphology of the subducted Nazca plate along this transition is further explored here using intraslab earthquakes recorded by temporary regional seismic arrays. Observations of a gradual increase in slab dip coupled with a lack of any gaps or vertical offsets in the intraslab seismicity suggest a smooth contortion of the slab. Concentrations of focal mechanisms at orientations which are indicative of slab bending are also observed along the change in slab geometry. The presence of a thin ultra-slow velocity layer (USL) atop the horizontal Nazca slab is identified and located. The lateral extent of this USL is coincident with the margin of the projected linear continuation of the subducting Nazca Ridge, implying a causal relationship. Waveform modeling of the 2D structure in southern Peru using a finite-difference algorithm provides constraints on the velocity and geometry of the slab’s seismic structure and confirms the absence of any tears in the slab. The seismic and structural evidence suggests smooth contortion of the Nazca plate along the transition from flat to normal subduction. The slab is estimated to have experienced 10% strain in the along-strike direction across this transition, compared to 15% strain across flat-to-normal transitions in central Mexico where the Cocos slab is likely torn.",

A Rockland Scientific Microrider with 2 FP07 fast response thermistors and 2 SBE-7 micro-conductivity probes was attached to a Seabird 911+ Conductivity-Temperature-Depth unit to allow for calibration of the microstructure probes against the highly accurate Seabird temperature and conductivity sensors. From a heated hut, the instrument package was lowered through a 0.75-m hole in the sea ice down to 350 m depth using a lightweight winch powered with a 3-phase, frequency-controlled motor that produced a smooth, controlled lowering speed of 25 cm s-1. Focusing on temperature and conductivity microstructure and using the special winch removed many of the complications involved with the use of free-fall microstructure profilers under the ice. The slow profiling speed permits calculation of Χ, the dissipation of thermal variance, without relying on fits to theoretical spectra to account for the unresolved variance. The dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, ε, can then be estimated using the temperature gradient spectrum and the Ruddick et al. [2001] maximum likelihood method. Outside of a few turbulent patches, thermal diffusivity ranged between O(10-7) and O(10-6) m2s-1, resulting in negligible turbulent heat fluxes. Estimated ε was often at or below the noise level of most shear-based microstructure profilers. The noise level of Χ is estimated at O(10-11) °C2s-1, revealing the utility and applicability of this technique in future Arctic field work.",

            "abstract": "Increases in hydraulic fracturing practices for shale gas and tight oil reservoirs have dramatically increased petroleum production in the USA, but have also made the issue of water management from these operations a high priority. Hydraulic fracturing requires ~ 10,000 to 50,000 m3 of water per well for injection in addition to water used to drill the well. Initially much of the water used for hydraulic fracturing was fresh water, but attitudes and operations are changing in response to costs and concerns. Concerns about groundwater depletion and contamination have prompted operators to increase the amount of produced water that can be recycled for hydraulic fracturing and to find suitable locations for salt-water injection. Knowledge of the geochemistry of produced waters is valuable in determining the feasibility of produced water recycling. Water with low salinity can be reclaimed for use outside of the petroleum industry (e.g. irrigation, municipal uses, and industrial operations).\nThe updated and expanded USGS Produced Waters Database available at http://eerscmap.usgs.gov/pwapp/ will facilitate and enhance studies on management of water, including produced water, for unconventional oil and gas drilling and production. The USGS database contains > 160,000 samples. Expanding on the 2002 database, we have filled in state and regional gaps with information from conventional and unconventional wells and have increased the number of constituents to include minor and trace chemicals, isotopes, and time series data. We currently have produced water data from 5,200 tight gas wells, 4,500 coal-bed methane (CBM) wells, 3,500 shale gas wells, and 700 tight oil wells. These numbers will increase as we continue to receive positive responses from oil companies, state oil and gas commissions, and scientists wanting to contribute their data.\nThis database is an important resource for a wide range of interested parties. Scientists from universities, government agencies, public municipalities and citizens can determine the geochemical nature of deep groundwater supplies, contamination sources, and impacts of hydraulic fracturing. Energy companies can utilize the database for determining the suitability of water reuse and for identifying regions where non-potable hydraulic fracturing water may be obtainable.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution, non-hydrostatic atmospheric models are extremely computationally expensive, and, for a certain class of problems, their complexity hinders our ability to ask key scientific questions, particularly those related to hydrology and climate change. For changes in precipitation in particular, an atmospheric model grid spacing capable of resolving the structure of mountain ranges is of critical importance, yet such simulations can not currently be performed with an advanced regional climate model for long time periods, large areas, and many climate models. Here we present a newly developed Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research model (ICAR) capable of simulating critical atmospheric processes two to three orders of magnitude faster than a state of the art regional climate model. ICAR uses a simplified dynamical formulation based off of linear theory, combined with the circulation field from a low-resolution climate model. The resulting three-dimensional wind field is used to advect heat and moisture across the domain, while sub-grid physics are processed by standard and simplified physics schemes (e.g. microphysics) from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. ICAR is tested in comparison to WRF by downscaling a climate change scenario over the Colorado Rockies. Both atmospheric models predict increases in precipitation across the domain with a greater increase on the western half. In contrast, statistically downscaled precipitation using multiple common statistical methods predict decreases in precipitation over the western half of the domain. ICAR is a useful tool for climate change and weather forecast downscaling, particularly for orographic precipitation or model uncertainty tests in which large ensembles are required. In addition, ICAR may be useful to fields that have not traditionally been able to use an atmospheric model, but require transient simulations of precipitation with respect to, e.g., glacial or landscape evolution.",

            "abstract": "The ecohydrological functioning of cloud forests is intricately linked to unique plant ecophysiological traits and processes that influence water fluxes at the plot to ecosystem scales. However, despite substantial gains in our understanding of cloud forest plant ecophysiology over the past decade, integration of water flux information from the leaf to the watershed scale is still lacking. We present a synthesis of research aimed at revealing the linkages between plant ecophysiology and forest ecohydrological functioning, conducted in a seasonal cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico. A variety of species-specific leaf-level water flux behaviors were found to influence various aspects of plant water relations, which in turn, scaled up to impact stand water balance. For example, foliar fog absorption compensated for approximately 9.3 ± 1.2% of transpiration, and nocturnal transpiration for dominant tree species during the dry-season accounted for 22% to 30% of daytime transpiration. Further, the presence of dense fog, light fog, and cloud cover was shown to reduce transpiration such that annual transpiration may increase up to 17% in the case that all fog occurrence is replaced by clear sky conditions. We discuss how these processes affect whole-plant and stand water balances, as well as the potential feedbacks of vegetation controls on hydrologic fluxes under future climate change. After placing our findings within a global context we present a conceptual model of the links between plant ecophysiological and ecosystem hydrological functioning in cloud forest settings. Finally, critical areas for future research are highlighted to further improve our understanding of the linkages between leaf- and ecosystem-level processes and fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning emissions are an important source of a wide range of trace gases and particles that can impact local, regional and global air quality, climate forcing, biogeochemical cycles and human health. In the western US, wildfires dominate over prescribed fires, contributing to atmospheric trace gas budgets and regional and local air pollution. Limited sampling of emissions from wildfires means western US emission estimates rely largely on data from prescribed fires, which may not be a suitable proxy for wildfire emissions.\nWe report here in-situ measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone and water vapor from the plumes of a variety of wildfires sampled in California in the fire seasons of 2013 and 2014. Included in the analysis are the Rim Fire (August – October 2013, near Yosemite National Park), the Morgan Fire (September 2013, near Clayton, CA), and the El Portal Fire (July – August 2014, in Yosemite National Park), among others. When possible, fires were sampled on multiple days.\nEmission ratios and estimated emission factors will be presented and discussed in the context of fuel composition, plume structure, and fire phase. Correlations of plume chemical composition to MODIS/VIIRS Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and other remote sensing information will be explored. Furthermore, the role of plumes in delivery of enhanced ozone concentrations to downwind municipalities will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "How is continental accretion accommodated in the crust and mantle lithosphere? We investigate this question in the southeastern U.S., where Mesozoic rifting left the exotic Suwannee Terrane behind on the Laurentian margin, and the accretionary structures of the Laurentia-Gondwana collision have been at least partially preserved.\nWe analyze Sp phases recorded by SESAME (Southeastern Suture of the Appalachian Margin Experiment), nearby Transportable Array and permanent stations. Sp receiver functions for individual waveforms were obtained by extended time multi-taper deconvolution, and migrated into a 3D volume using common conversion point stacking, a spline function representation of phase Fresnel zones, and 3D crust and mantle velocities.\nWithin the crust, we observe a pair of prominent phases (positive and negative, corresponding to a velocity increase and decrease with depth respectively). The lower, negative phase is continuous over more than 500 km of N-S distance. It is subhorizontal beneath the Blue Ridge and Inner Piedmont terranes, and south-dipping across the suture. The positive phase also dips south at the suture, then flattens in the lower crust. We observe such phases in both eastern and western Georgia, indicating along-strike continuity over at least ~170 km. Beneath SESAME stations in western Georgia, the negative phase is subhorizontal in the midcrust (~17 km depth) from 35.6°N, near the Blue Ridge Thrust, to 32.7°N. From 32.7°N to ~31°N, overlapping the suture zone inferred from COCORP reflection data, it dips south at a minimum angle of 8°. Further south, interference with the Moho may bias apparent phase depth. In the mantle, we observe a N-S transition in discontinuity structure across the suture. Ongoing work with wavefield migration (Bostock et al., 2001) should better resolve discontinuity dips and depths.\nThe crustal phase pair likely represents the top of the Laurentian plate, overthrust by allochthonous Appalachian terranes and the Gondwanan Suwannee fragment. The crustal phase pair is not explained by sedimentary basins in the region, as the depth, topography, and lateral extent of these phases is inconsistent with observations of basin structure. The N-S scale of this crustal discontinuity structure is similar to the decollement imaged beneath the Himalayas and southern Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Exchange of fluid in the near-subsurface of a streambed is influenced by turbulence in the free flow, as well as by bed topography and permeability. Macro-roughness elements such as bedforms are known to produce pressure gradients that drive fluid into the streambed on their stoss sides and out of the bed on their lee sides. To study the modification of the near-bed flow field by self-forming permeable bedforms, laboratory experiments were conducted in a 5 mm wide flume filled with 1.3 mm glass beads. The narrow width of the flume permitted detailed examination of the fluid exiting the bed immediately downstream of a bedform. Dense 2-D velocity field measurements were gathered using particle image velocimetry (PIV).\nIn up to 8% of instantaneous PIV realizations, the flow at the near-bed presented a component perpendicular to the streambed, indicating flow across the interface. At the downstream side of the bedform, such flow disrupted the mean recirculation pattern that is typically observed in finer sediment beds. It is hypothesized that the coarse grain size and the resulting high bed permeability promote such near-surface jet events. A qualitative analysis of raw image frames indicated that an in-place jostling of sediment is associated with these jets thus suggesting that subsurface flow may be characterized by impulsive events. These observations are relevant to hyporheic exchange rates in coarse sediments and can have strong morphodynamic implications as they can explain the lack of ripples and characteristics of dunes in high permeability gravels. Overall, further study of the flow structure over highly permeable streambeds is needed to understand subsurface exchange and bedform initiation.",

The Marginal Ice Zone Ocean and Ice Observations and Processes Experiment (MIZOPEX) was conceived to address directly these information gaps through a targeted, intensive observing campaign that would take advantage of the capabilities of multiple classes of UAS combined with in-situ sensing and satellite observations.\nThe MIZOPEX campaign took place during July-August 2013. A total of 24 UAS flights were performed prior to the last field day on 9 August; 2 NASA SIERRA flights, 16 University of Alaska-Fairbanks ScanEagle flights, and 4 CU-Boulder DataHawk flights, for a total of 54 flight hours. Flight operations for all three UAS were based from the active USAF DEW Line station and runway at Oliktok Point, AK.\nAs the ice cover evolved over the July-August period, two separate regions of focus were identified for the UAS flights - a southern region that was within the flying range of the non-Iridium-equipped ScanEagles, and a more northern area where ice concentration was greater. Mapping-type missions were carried out over these locations on multiple days, along with Air-Deployed Micro-Buoy (ADMB) deployment and data uploading.",

            "abstract": "Temperature variability is small in the tropics, so anomalous moist static energy (MSE) is primarily due to anomalous moisture variability which is tightly connected with precipitation variability. Thus careful analysis of MSE budgets improves our understanding of the dynamics of tropical convection. Previous studies suggested that a recharge-discharge cycle of column-integrated MSE can be observed in the MJO life-cycle and life-cycles of equatorial Kelvin waves. Does this imply that the thermodynamics in the MJO is regulated by a similar process to that of higher frequency variability? To answer this question, we explore the recharge and discharge mechanisms of column-integrated MSE for various time-scales of variability using the TOGA COARE data set. We find that the MSE budgets behave in significantly different ways on the different time-scales. The relative contribution of each MSE budget term to the recharge-discharge mechanism gradually changes as the time-scale gets longer, making the MSE budget behavior on the MJO time-scale distinct from that on the shorter time-scales. For each frequency, we estimate the gross moist stability (GMS), which represents efficiency of MSE export via convection and associated large-scale circulations. The GMS has been used in many MJO studies. One of the popular usages is a linearization of vertical MSE advection in simplified MJO models with an assumption that the GMS is constant. In our analysis, we find that as the time-scale gets longer, the GMS, which is generally a highly variable quantity in a convective life-cycle, becomes a more constant quantity. We show that this more-constant GMS is primarily due to different patterns of the evolution of the vertical velocity profile.",

            "abstract": "In an attempt to better understand the spatial and temporal relationships between lava lake behavior and its surface topography, we conducted repeat, high-speed terrestrial LiDAR surveys of Kīlauea Volcano’s Overlook Crater lava lake surface on January 16, 2013 and December 17, 2013. These scans revealed large- and fine-scale structure not visible in other topographic data sets. For both surveys, the LiDAR sensor was located directly above the Overlook Crater on the edge of the Halema’uma’u Crater, and was tilted 45o towards the lava lake. On January 16, 2013, five-second scans were collected every 2-minutes over 200-minutes, resulting in ~25 points/ m2, and covering the lower walls of the Overlook Crater and the lava lake surface. Similarly, on December 17, 2013, one-second scans were collected every 30-seconds over 240-minutes during a transient deflation-inflation deformation event, resulting in ~6 points/m2. In addition, high-resolution scans of the crater walls and lava lake were captured at the start of both surveys.\nWe derived a number of products and measurements from these 3-dimensional time-lapse data. The slope of the lava lake was measured in each scan, and it fluctuates as lake convection regime, areas of upwelling and downflow, and crustal plate velocities vary. Areas of upwelling were consistently ~0.6m higher than areas of downwelling at any point in time, and the migration of areas of upwelling on the lake surface were coincident with areas of intense outgassing. Velocities of lava lake crustal plates averaged 0.354 m/s near the center of the lake surface on December 17, 2013. From the high-resolution scans collected at the start of both surveys we measured sub-meter lava lake fluctuations over time that may illustrate micro-pistoning in the magma column.\nThese preliminary results raise several questions: 1) do lava lake slopes change spatially and temporally, and what eruption variables are linked to such changes; 2) do lava lake levels change over time periods ranging from seconds to minutes, and are these changes related to outgassing and upwelling variations; 3) are fine-scale structures, such as surface waves that traverse the lake, related to observable processes (such as rockfalls), lake surface slope, and outgassing rates?",

Nearly enveloped by convergent margins, Eurasia is bordered entirely along its eastern and southern boundaries by subduction and, in the only present-day example of its kind, the ongoing Himalayan continental collision. These phenomenal settings have made the region a natural laboratory for studying the deformational mechanics of the Earth’s interior on a near-global scale by utilizing the robust shear-wave splitting (SWS) technique. By acquiring and examining data recorded by 531 broadband stations belonging to numerous networks throughout eastern Eurasia and Indo-Australia, we obtained a data set consisting of over 11,200 high-quality XKS (consisting of PKS, SKKS, and SKS phases) shear-wave splitting measurements composed of fast polarization orientations and splitting delay times. The resulting measurements show relatively high spatial density throughout Central Asia (e.g. Tibet and the Tien Shan), whereas regions in southeastern Asia, India and Australia have relatively sparse coverage. Multiple stations located primarily in the Tien Shan, Tibet, and South China demonstrate a clear azimuthal variation in fast orientations, indicating the presence of strong complex anisotropy beneath these regions. Possible mechanisms generating these occurrences of complex anisotropic layering include the collision and underthrusting of India beneath the Eurasian plate along the Himalayan suture, the westward subduction of the Pacific plate along the Mariana arc, northward subduction of Australia along the Sunda Trench, and slab fragment downwelling beneath the intraplate Tien Shan orogenic belt and Tarim Craton.",

The magnetogram provides a potential field solution, while automated tracing of coronal loops in different EUV wavelengths provide the misalignment angles between potential field lines and non-potential field lines. We present an automated code that uses data from AIA and HMI to calculate the free energy and dissipated energy in solar flares, based on a nonlinear force-free field approximation in terms of vertical currents that produce helical twists of coronal loops. We study the time evolution of free energy and energy dissipation during some 200 solar flares and compare it with the global energetics of flare and CME energies. The occurrence frequency distributions of dissipated magnetic energies follow closely the predicted powerlaw distribution functions of self-organized criticality models. The presented results provide for the first time statistics on magnetic energies dissipated in solar flares.",

            "abstract": "Long practiced in fisheries, visual substrate mapping of coarse-bedded rivers is eschewed by geomorphologists for inaccuracy and limited sizing data. Geomorphologists perform time-consuming measurements of surficial grains, with the few locations precluding spatially explicit mapping and analysis of sediment facies. Remote sensing works for bare land, but not vegetated or subaqueous sediments. As visual systems apply the log2 Wentworth scale made for sieving, they suffer from human inability to readily discern those classes. We hypothesized that size classes centered on the PDF of the anticipated sediment size distribution would enable field crews to accurately (i) identify presence/absence of each class in a facies patch and (ii) estimate the relative amount of each class to within 10%. We first tested 6 people using 14 measured samples with different mixtures. Next, we carried out facies mapping for ~ 37 km of the lower Yuba River in California. Finally, we tested the resulting data to see if it produced statistically significant hydraulic-sedimentary-geomorphic results. Presence/absence performance error was 0-4% for four people, 13% for one person, and 33% for one person. The last person was excluded from further effort. For the abundance estimation performance error was 1% for one person, 7-12% for three people, and 33% for one person. This last person was further trained and re-tested. We found that the samples easiest to visually quantify were unimodal and bimodal, while those most difficult had nearly equal amounts of each size. This confirms psychological studies showing that humans have a more difficult time quantifying abundances of subgroups when confronted with well-mixed groups. In the Yuba, mean grain size decreased downstream, as is typical for an alluvial river. When averaged by reach, mean grain size and bed slope were correlated with an r2 of 0.95. At the morphological unit (MU) scale, eight in-channel bed MU types had an r2 of 0.90 between mean size and MU-average velocity computed using a 2D model. In conclusion, visual mapping of sediment facies is highly feasible over long distances and accurate at MU to segment scales when size classes are distributed about the expected PDF instead of based on the log2 scale. Geomorphologists should reconsider the potential value for spatially explicit mapping.",

            "abstract": "Climate models with variable-resolution grids offer a computationally less expensive way to provide more detailed information at regional scales and increased accuracy for processes that cannot be resolved by a coarser resolution grid. This study uses the recently released version of the Model for Prediction Across Scales–Atmosphere (MPAS-A), consisting of a non-hydrostatic dynamical core and a subset of Advanced Research WRF (ARW) model atmospheric physics and Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) cloud fraction parameterization, to investigate the potential benefits of using increased resolution in an equatorial channel. The simulations are performed with an idealized aquaplanet mode using two quasi-uniform grids, with 30-km and 240-km grid spacing, and two variable-resolution grids spanning the same grid spacing range, one with a narrow (20S–20N) and one with a wide (30S–30N) equatorial channel.\nWe find that for the wider equatorial channel, there is a closer correspondence with the 30-km quasi-uniform simulation. Results show that increasing resolution in the Tropics impacts both the tropical and extratropical circulation. Compared to the quasi-uniform coarse grid, the narrow-channel simulation exhibits a stronger Ferrel cell and stronger updrafts in the middle of the updraft branch of the Hadley cell. However, the total atmospheric poleward energy transports are similar in all simulations. With the CAM5 cloud fraction parameterization, the cloud microphysics shows moderate resolution dependence. The channel simulations have similar peak ITCZ precipitation as the simulation with quasi-uniform 240-km grid spacing and are only about 10% larger than the quasi-uniform 30-km simulation. All simulations have a single ITCZ. The relatively small differences in mean global and tropical precipitation rates among the simulations are a promising result, and the evidence points to the equatorial channel being an effective method for avoiding the extraneous numerical artifacts seen in earlier studies that only refined portion of the Tropics.",

            "abstract": "The April 2014 Mw 8.1 Pisagua earthquake occurred in the Northern Chile seismic gap. This part of the subduction zone was believed to have not experienced a large earthquake since 1877. As part of an international collaboration the \"The Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC)\" network was installed in 2007 to monitor this region. As well as recording the 2014 Pisagua mainshock, the IPOC network was able to record the full foreshock and aftershock sequences, providing a unique opportunity to study the nucleation and rupture process of large megathrust earthquakes.\nAs most seismic activity occurred ~100 km offshore of the coastline, the onshore nature of the network only covers the rupture area to the east resulting in poor azimuthal coverage and hindering accurate depth estimation of seismic events. To improve the location accuracy of the Pisagua seismic sequences, we installed a temporary seismic network that was operative from 1 May 2014. The network comprised 12 short-period stations located in the coastal area between Moquegua and Tacna and three stations at the slopes of Ticsiani volcano to monitor any possible change in volcanic activity following the Pisagua earthquake.\nOur study focuses on the nucleation area, where part of the precursory sequence and a slow slip event occurred (Ruiz et al., 2014). This region became significantly stronger in the two weeks preceding the Pisagua mainshock. On 16 March 2014 the strongest foreshock (Mw 6.7) occurred offshore of Pisagua with a centroid depth of 10 km, shallower than the estimated subduction interface.\nIn this study aftershock locations are further constrained using observations from the new network installed in Peru. We carefully estimate event locations and we compute regional moment tensor solutions by 1-D full waveform inversion of the broadband data. To improve our solutions, we are currently relocating aftershocks, to correct for foreshock mislocations by using the double-difference earthquake location algorithm and including cross-correlation methods.",

            "abstract": "The plate-scale deployment of ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) as part of the Cascadia Initiative (CI) of NSF provides a unique opportunity to study the structure and dynamics of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system beneath an entire oceanic plate, from its birth at a spreading center to its subduction beneath a continent. Here we present tomographic images of the seismic structure of oceanic upper mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca (JdF) and Gorda plates derived from body wave delay times. The results constrain structural anomalies beneath the JdF and Gorda spreading centers, the Blanco and Mendocino transform faults, near ridge hotspots such as Axial Seamount, and the upper mantle structure beneath the subducting oceanic lithosphere. We measured delay times of teleseismic P and S wave phases for the first two years of the CI. Our tomographic analysis assumes both isotropic and anisotropic starting models and accounts for finite-frequency effects and three-dimensional ray bending. Preliminary results indicate that the upper mantle structure beneath the JdF spreading center is asymmetric, with lower shear wave velocities beneath the Pacific plate (also the direction of ridge migration). On a regional scale, regions of lower seismic velocities beneath the JdF and Gorda spreading centers correlate with shallower ridge depths. Beneath the southern Gorda plate a low velocity anomaly is detected, which is absent to the north; this anomaly is bounded to the south by the Mendocino transform. Ongoing work includes analysis of the third year of CI data, which will improve resolution of structure and allow better definition of anomalies in the vicinity of the Blanco transform. In addition, we will combine ocean and continental data to obtain images of the Cascadia subduction zone.",

This study develops and applies a state-of-the-art system that integrates a global climate-chemical transport model with a high-resolution regional climate-hydrology-air quality-water quality model over North America to predict the interactive dynamical, physical and biogeochemical processes that govern the movement of water and pollutants in the air and on land (surface, subsurface, streams, plants, human). It will show that the system well captures the observed geographic distributions and seasonal-interannual variations of streamflow and water quality (nitrogen) over the U.S. Diagnostic analyses indicate that major water quality episodes are associated with large climate anomalies, especially extreme precipitation events. The system also projects the impacts on the U.S. water resources (streamflow and water quality) of climate change to 2050, which will be presented along with changes in extreme events, CO2 fertilization, and atmospheric depositions. The resilience and sustainability of future U.S. water resources will also be discussed.",

Measurement methods despite been improved remarkably in the past few years, especially with the advent of new optical and satellite-derived methods, are limited in their applicability in the Arctic. Modeling methodologies are still under development and cannot help to evolve very coarse global-scale understanding of CH4 sources to resolution of regional-scale emissions. As a result, contribution of the Arctic sources in the global CH4 budget are yet to be quantified adequately. We used a decadal observational data set collected from the water column and from the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), which is the largest continental shelf, to determine the minimum source strength required to explain observed seasonally increased concentration of CH4 in the ABL. The results of top-down modeling performed by implementing a simple box model show a good agreement with results of bottom-up estimates made using interpretation of in-situ calibrated sonar data.",

Such 3D structures and the 2D version of them (plasmoids, secondary islands) could have important dynamical effects on the reconnection physics itself. Small-scale flux ropes have also been observed within the interplanetary space. We have found exact time-steady solutions of kinetic flux ropes by generalizing exact solutions of 2D Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a magnetized plasma with finite magnetic field strength [Ng, Bhattacharjee, and Skiff, Phys. Plasmas 13, 055903 (2006)] to cases with azimuthal magnetic fields so that these structures carry electric current as well as steady electric and magnetic fields. Such fully nonlinear solutions now satisfy exactly the Vlasov-Poisson-Ampere system of equations. Solutions like these could describe small-scale flux ropes observed in reconnection diffusion regions or in the interplanetary space. They are also exact nonlinear solutions that can be used to validate numerical schemes for kinetic simulations.\nThis work is supported by a National Science Foundation grant PHY-1004357.",

            "abstract": "Pseudotachylites are common in brittle deformation zones and represent rapidly crystallized melts produced by friction-induced heating, possibly associated with dynamic rupture and slip during earthquakes. Thus, pseudotachylites may provide insight into how such localized deformation occurs. Here, we investigated the micron to cm scale structure and geochemistry of granitic plutons in the Eastern Peninsular Ranges shear zone (California), which is a large scale thrust rooted in the lower crust. Our U-Pb chronology and Zr thermometry of sphene porphyroblasts in the mylonite indicate that the plutons were deformed at near solidus conditions (780-750 ◦C) between 89 and 78 Ma, which coincides with the last pulse of magmatism. This ductile deformation resulted in a foliated fabric defined by biotite-rich layers. Subsequent brittle deformation is superimposed on this ductile fabric as exemplified by pseudotachylites and ultracataclasites cross-cutting or parallel to the foliation planes. The pseudotachylites are characterized by a glassy matrix with microlites, and the ultracataclasites are characterized by a fine-grained matrix of angular mineral and rock fragments. We measured major and trace compositions of these brittle deformation products using LA-ICPMS. The pseudotachylites are more mafic (lower Si, but higher Fe, Ti and K) than the host granitoid, while the ultracataclasites are intermediate between the pseudotachylites and the host. The mafic compositions of the pseudotachylites indicate that they form almost solely by melting of biotite. The compositions of the ultracastaclasites also suggest preferential involvement of biotite, but with a greater component of feldspar.\nThe compositional discrepancy between the brittle deformation products and the host granitoid begs the question of why brittle deformation appears to preferentially involve biotite. One possibility is that brittle deformation occurred on weak zones inherited from the biotite-rich mylonitic foliation planes. Our observations indicate that such ductile deformation occurred at near-solidus conditions and may have been associated with the assembly of the Cretaceous magmatic arc. We suggest that brittle faulting inherits pre-existing ductile fabrics that, once formed, define long-lived weak shear zones in the crust.",

The use of these data for determining rapid centroid moment tensor solutions (“fastCMT”) has been demonstrated in the post-analysis of the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. This seismogeodetic combination will improve source inversions for future earthquakes, but large-scale accelerometer deployment at the many available permanent GPS stations is limited by the cost of traditional observatory-grade accelerometers. Instead, we improve feasibility by installing SIO Geodetic Modules and low-cost MEMS accelerometers at 17 GPS stations in southern California near the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Elsinore faults, transmitting data in real time for analysis of seismic velocity and displacement waveforms. We examine the performance of our seismogeodetic subnetwork using the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake as our focus. We calculate a kinematic slip inversion, using the small set of seismogeodetic waveforms available at the time of the event, and assess the reliability of the result in comparison to the fastCMT solution. We evaluate reliability by using our model to predict ground motion at independent stations, and using recorded data as verification at a range of frequencies. Next we supplement the dataset by including realistic simulated waveforms for the additional 17 seismogeodetic stations, adding realistic seismogeodetic noise, and demonstrate the improved reliability of our result in terms of reducing the space of possible solutions due to better geometric constraints. The MEMS accelerometer has higher noise than the observatory-grade accelerometer, which we quantify using strong motion recordings from a series of UCSD NEES outdoor shaketable experiments conducted in December 2013 and January 2014. Results will provide confidence in the use of the MEMS accelerometer for large-scale deployment as an alternative to an observatory-grade accelerometer, as well as the prospects for the increased station density to improve the source parameters of future events, in particular a large earthquake forecast for the southern San Andreas fault.",

High-resolution spectra (R ~ 5000) of both the nightglow and the aurorae have been obtained, and the data overlap the time period in which measurements from the PINOT campaign were made. It has been of particular interest to search for regions in which the O2(b-X) Atmospheric band system could be studied with minimal interference from auroral N2/N2+ features. The b-X 2-1 band at 697 nm is such a feature. At longer wavelengths we have ascertained that CESAR is capable of making measurements on the N(2P-2D) lines near 1040 nm, an extremely strong multiplet where the wavelength region has prevented systematic measurements. Controversially, earlier studies had indicated that these lines suffered interference from the N2 First Positive 0-0 band, which we do not find in our limited sample.",

            "abstract": "Proton conduction is directly related to the diffusion of hydrogen (most likely as free protons) through the Nernst-Einstein equation. Prior attempts to use this relationship have always invoked additional terms to try to reconcile proton conduction and hydrogen diffusion data. However experimental data on hydrogen diffusion through the mineral lattice only constrain the rate of proton migration coupled with defects (such as vacancies) and not the diffusion of free protons. New diffusion experiments on olivine demonstrate that lattice diffusion is indeed highly dependent on the defect site where hydrogen is bounded but in any case is not fast enough to explain the observed laboratory proton conduction experiments. Effective diffusion, which combines lattice diffusion with the far faster grain boundary diffusion, explains both the laboratory results and also field observations, and yields an estimate of average grain size of 0.5-2 cm at 100 km below the Jagersfontein kimberlite field, consistent with petrological observations on xenolith material.",

            "abstract": "It is very important and challenging for global climate models to represent a correct diurnal cycle of shallow cumuli over land. In this study, we build a new composite case for fair-weather shallow cumulus over land based on observational statistics. We aim to answer questions: 1) how well the can large-eddy simulation (LES) reproduce the observed cloud metrics? And 2) how well can the composite case represent the shallow cumuli regime compared with one “golden” day case study? These LES results, and the associated forcing and observations, will further serve as a benchmark test bed for the performance of the single column model version of large-scale models on simulating continental shallow cumulus.\nFirst, a case library of continental shallow cumulus clouds was established based on longterm observations at Southern Great Plains ARM site (Zhang and Klein 2010, 2013), which includes days of forced- and active-shallow cumulus clouds, and days of shallow convection that transits to deep convective precipitating events in late afternoon. Observational statistics was developed for each regime on cloud macrophysics, meteorological atmospheric and surface conditions. Particularly for active shallow cumulus clouds, in-cloud vertical velocity retrieval based on long-term radar measurements is used to derive cloud updraft and downdraft mass fluxes. Secondly, LES of the composite case is performed for active shallow cumulus clouds and it shows significantly less cloud fraction than observations. Sensitivity tests are then performed on grid resolution, domain size, microphysics scheme, surface fluxes and so on. LES is also done for each individual shallow cumulus day to investigate the possible non-linear effect due to the composite case. Thirdly, LES is used to study the effect of large-scale environmental controls, such as relative humidity and atmospheric stability, on the vertical extent of clouds, the transition between forced and active shallow cumulus and the transition from shallow to deep convection in the afternoon.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "An investigation of the relation between electrical and seismic parameters is presented for different tectonic contexts. By combining electrical laboratory data and field results (electromagnetic and seismic), constraints on melt storage conditions at depth can be improved. Electrical and elastic rock properties are sensitive to the presence of melt (increasing fluid content increases electrical conductivity EC and seismic wave attenuation, and decreases seismic velocities) but they relate to chemistry, temperature, and connectivity differently, thus complementing each other. In the field, these properties are probed using electromagnetic and seismic methods, offering a unique way to map melt distribution in the upper mantle in real time and understand its dynamics.\nA compilation of geophysical results in 18 locations where melt is expected suggests different relationships between electrical and elastic parameters. In volatile-depleted contexts (mid ocean ridge, hotspot), a correlation between EC and S- and P-waves velocity can be interpreted in terms of melt fraction when combined to the laboratory database of the EC of melts as well as petrology modeling [1]. For example, geophysical results in Hawaii and the Afar Ridge are consistent with the presence of ~ 1vol % and 1-8vol % connected melt phase, respectively. In volatile-rich contexts (subduction), the lack of laboratory studies on relevant volatile-rich compositions makes the elaboration of a petrology-based model difficult to interpret field data. However, a comparison of electromagnetic and seismic data for several back-arc and trench-close fluid reservoirs in the mantle wedge shows a correlation between EC and the inverse quality factor for S and P waves, Qs-1 and Qp-1, respectively\nEC = 1.5e-3×Qp-1 – 0.104 and EC = 1.2e-3×Qs-1 – 0.059\n(Respective correlation coefficient of 0.78 and 0.96). A possible relationship between geophysical properties of reservoirs and slab age is also suggested. These field-based relationships offer promising constraints on melt distribution, but further input from laboratory studies is needed.\n[1] Pommier A. and E. J.

            "abstract": "The separation of radar signatures depicting cloud and drizzle within a pulse radar volume is a fundamental problem whose solution is required to decouple the microphysical and dynamical processes introduced by turbulence. Such a solution would lead to the development of new meteorological products.\nIn this presentation, a method to detect, separate and estimate multiple radar echoes from cloud and drizzle obtained from vertically pointing cloud Doppler spectra is described. In the case when only clouds are present, the Doppler spectrum is symmetrical and is well approximated by a Gaussian. To extract cloud echoes, a parametric maximum likelihood estimator in the time domain is employed using the recorded radar Doppler spectra data. To detect skewness in the radar spectrum, goodness of fit parameters are defined. It is shown that these new detection parameters exhibit a low level sensitivity to poor signal-to-noise ratios and large signal spectrum widths. The proposed method can consequently be applied to signals with shorter integration time; this significantly reduces the impact of small-scale dynamics present in the Doppler spectrum. Additionally, signals near the cloud top and cloud base are used as constraints to optimize the detection and estimation algorithm’s performance.\nThe applications of the technique include inference of the vertical air motion and the particle size distribution of the drizzle. The method will be tested on datasets that have been collected by the ARM cloud radars.",

            "abstract": "Automated baseline correction of strong motion data is of broad interest for regional earthquake source modeling and for rapid earthquake response. Strong motion data are typically high pass filtered before inverting for source properties, thereby eliminating any information on static deformation. High-rate (1 Hz) GPS data preserve the long period information, particularly the static offset, but the data are much noisier at higher frequencies. Through a Kalman filter algorithm we demonstrate that, when available, collocated GPS sensors provide sufficient information for suitable baseline corrections to the strong motion data; we call this the seismogeodetic solution. We discuss in detail the superior recovery of low frequency information using the seismogeodetic approach when compared to baseline corrected accelerometer waveforms. The GPS/accelerometer combination provides broadband motions from the Nyquist frequency of the accelerometer down to the static offset. Because Kalman filtering is a real time operation that does not require operator interaction, we conclude that this approach could provide input for broadband source modeling that could potentially be calculated shortly after large events. To illustrate the performance and usefulness of this algorithm, we conduct a kinematic slip inversion of the seismogeodetic data from collocated GPS/strong motion pairs in Japan for the 2011 Mw9 Tohoku-oki earthquake using three-component Kalman filtered displacements and velocities for a total of 288 waveforms. Such source models are key to understanding the earthquake rupture process and for guiding rapid response, especially for large events such as this one. We quantify the differences between the inversion results using seismogeodetic data compared to those using conventional approaches by assessing the fit to ground motions at independent stations in Japan. In addition, we compare tsunami inundation levels predicted by the different models with actual field surveys that were conducted after the event. We will summarize the benefits of GPS instruments that are collocated with strong motion accelerometers in regional monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "Civilian low-level radioactive waste containing organic compounds was disposed in 2- to 15-m deep unlined trenches in a 110-m deep unsaturated zone at the present-day USGS Amargosa Desert Research Site. Tritium represents the plurality of disposed activity. A plume of gas-phase contaminants surrounds the disposal area, with 60 distinct volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified to date. The distribution of tritiated water in the unsaturated zone surrounding the disposal area is highly enigmatic, with orders of magnitude separating observed levels from those predicted by multiphase models of mass and energy transport. Peaks of tritium and VOCs are coincidently located in sediments tens of meters below the root zone, suggesting abiotic stratigraphic control on lateral transport at depth. Surprisingly, the highest observed levels of tritium occur at a depth of about 1.5 m, the base of the creosote-bush plant-community root zone, where levels of waste-derived VOCs are low (approaching atmospheric levels). Bulk water-vapor samples from shallow and deep unsaturated-zone profile hot spots were trapped as water ice in cold fingers immersed in dry ice-isopropyl alcohol filled Dewar flasks, then melted and sequentially extracted by purge-and-trap VOC degassing followed by elution through activated carbon solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Analysis of tritium activities and mass spectrometer results indicate that over 98% of tritium activity at depth is present as water, whereas about 15% of basal root zone tritium activity is present as organic compounds trapped with the water. Of these, the less-volatile compound group removed by SPE accounted for about 85% of the organic tritium activity, with mass spectrometry identifying 2-ethyl-1-hexanol as the principal compound removed. This plant-produced fatty alcohol is ubiquitous in the root zone of creosote-bush communities and represents a family of hydroxyl-containing plant produced compounds that give the plants their pungency. These findings suggest that tritiated hydroxyl groups on plant-produced organic compounds provide an important reservoir and pathway for tritium transport.",

Small-scale aeolian processes predictably generate local seasonal storms. However, factors that enhance local storm strength and grow local phenomenon to global scales are poorly understood. Research with Martian general circulation models (GCM) has recently demonstrated a strong correlation between dust storm generation, strength and long-term stability and the global distribution of dust reservoirs and their temporal permanence. Here we present results from the NCAR Mars Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) coupled with a fully interactive dust microphysics scheme. Dust devil lifting and saltation wind driven lifting are parameterized in the emission scheme. Mass is distributed into 20 size bins with a radius range of 0.1 to 8 microns. The initial radial size distribution is log-normal with a sigma value of 1.5. Dust is allowed to advect horizontally and is removed from the atmosphere by dry deposition. Dust also impacts the radiative heating rate, as do water clouds.The large number of dust bins allows for the opportunity to track the size distribution of dust deposits and investigate the long term stability of dust source regions as a function of particle size.",

            "abstract": "Induced seismicity plays a crucial role for the success of geological storage of carbon dioxide. No felt seismicity has been reported in current CO2 projects, but the overpressure due to the injection may increase the risk of fault reactivation. Although a site can be designated to stay away from major and regional faults, undetected faults may still be a great concern. Previous 2D numerical results showed that such undetected faults could produce felt seismic events, whose magnitude is only limited by the size of the fault itself. However, 2D models overestimate overpressure acting on the fault. Thus, 3D models are necessary to reproduce the actual overpressure evolution.\nIn this work we analyze the reactivation of a minor, undetected fault, simulating two different cases of injection through a vertical and a horizontal well, respectively. Results show that for a vertical well the fault pressurizes faster and more locally, resulting in a smaller seismic event. For a horizontal well the pressure is more distributed along the fault and requires longer time to reach the critical value for reactivation, thus resulting in a larger event.\nThe fault reactivation also produces changes in damage zone and fault core permeability, allowing the CO2 to leak from the injection zone thereby to escape upward towards shallower depths. Although the calculated fault permeability enhancement is similar for the two cases, results show a slightly higher leakage rate for the case of the vertical well in a region close to the well, while the leakage resulting from injection through a horizontal well is smaller but more distributed in space.",

Preliminary results on one dike show that clasts fail a conglomerate test, indicating that they were completely remagnetized after the breccia dike was emplaced. We interpret this result to indicate that lithic breccia dikes can experience levels of frictional heating capable of fully thermally remagnetizing clasts. Furthermore, breccia bodies from different locales yield similar overprint directions minimally affected by tilting or rotation. This implies that these breccia dikes cooled to blocking temperatures at a rate slower than that of crater modification and obtained their magnetic remanence subsequent to the crater’s final structural state. The magnetic directions of samples yield a virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) that can serve as a reference direction for constraining the structural dynamics of crater formation/modification and evaluating the mechanism whereby impact-related overprints were imparted into the host rock. Breccia dikes have been interpreted to be present within impact craters on Mars (Head, 2006) and should be expected in other extraterrestrial impact structures where erosion levels have allowed exposure of the crater substructure. While breccia dike material would either be remagnetized or demagnetized by the impact (depending on the presence or absence of an ambient field), the surrounding host rock may retain the bulk of its primary remanence. If this magnetic juxtaposition could be measured on a planetary surface, it has the potential to further constrain the life and death of planetary dynamos.",

Despite its importance to the population of these countries, major hydrological parameters such as modern recharge and extraction rates remain poorly investigated given: (1) the large extent of the NSAS, (2) the absence of comprehensive monitoring networks, (3) the general inaccessibility of many of the NSAS regions, (4) difficulties in collecting background information, largely included in unpublished governmental reports, and (5) limited local funding to support the construction of monitoring networks and/or collection of field and background datasets. Data from monthly Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity solutions were processed (Gaussian smoothed: 100 km; rescaled) and used to quantify the modern recharge to the NSAS during the period from January 2003 to December 2012. To isolate the groundwater component in GRACE data, the soil moisture and river channel storages were removed using the outputs from the most recent Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5). GRACE-derived recharge calculations were performed over the southern NSAS outcrops (area: 835 × 103 km2) in Sudan and Chad that receive average annual precipitation of 65 km3 (77.5 mm). GRACE-derived recharge rates were estimated at 2.79 ± 0.98 km3/yr (3.34 ± 1.17 mm/yr). If we take into account the total annual extraction rates (~ 0.4 km3; CEDARE, 2002) from Chad and Sudan the average annual recharge rate for the NSAS could reach up to ~ 3.20 ± 1.18 km3/yr (3.84 ± 1.42 mm/yr). Our recharge rates estimates are similar to those calculated using (1) groundwater flow modelling in the Central Sudan Rift Basins (4-8 mm/yr; Abdalla, 2008), (2) WaterGAP global scale groundwater recharge model (< 5 mm/yr, Döll and Fiedler, 2008), and (3) chloride tracer in Sudan (3.05 mm/yr; Edmunds et al. 1988). Given the available global coverage of the temporal GRACE solutions for the past twelve years and plans are underway for the deployment of a GRACE follow-On and GRACE-II missions, we suggest that within the next few years, GRACE will probably become the most practical, informative, and cost-effective tool for monitoring the recharge of large aquifers across the globe.",

            "abstract": "The fate of methane ebullition from lake sediments is dependent on initial bubble size. Rising bubbles are subject to dissolution, reducing the fraction of methane that ultimately enters the atmosphere while increasing concentrations of aqueous methane. Smaller bubbles not only rise more slowly, but dissolve more rapidly larger bubbles. Thus, understanding methane bubble size distributions in the water column is critical to predicting atmospheric methane emissions from ebullition. However, current methods of measuring methane bubble sizes in-situ are resource-intensive, typically requiring divers, video equipment, sonar, or hydroacoustic instruments. The complexity and cost of these techniques points to the strong need for a simple, autonomous device that can measure bubble size distributions and be deployed unattended over long periods of time.\nWe describe a bubble sizing device that can be moored in the subsurface and can intercept and measure the size of bubbles as they rise. The instrument uses a novel optical measurement technique with infrared LEDs and IR-sensitive photodetectors combined with a custom-designed printed circuit board. An on-board microcomputer handles raw optical signals and stores the relevant information needed to calculate bubble volume. The electronics are housed within a pressure case fabricated from standard PVC fittings and are powered by size C alkaline batteries. The bill of materials cost is less than $200, allowing us to deploy multiple sensors at various locations within Upper Mystic Lake, MA. This novel device will provide information on how methane bubble sizes may vary both spatially and temporally. We present data from tests under controlled laboratory conditions and from deployments in Upper Mystic Lake.",

Recently, important progress has been made in meeting the need for improved precipitation data sets in East Africa. This has been done through capacity building activities with national meteorological and hydrological services (NMHS) in the region, carried out in partnership with the IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC), and with support from the WMO Office for Eastern and Southern Africa. Through a series of regional gatherings and individual country workshops, scientists from the NMHS have been introduced to the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall data set and the GeoCLIM software tool. The CHIRPS data set was developed by USGS and the University of California, Santa Barbara, by blending NOAA geostationary thermal infrared imagery with station observations, using robust geostatistical methods. The core data set consists of pentadal (5-daily) accumulations from 1981-2014 at 0.05 degree spatial resolution, between +/- 50 degrees latitude. The GeoCLIM software can operate on the CHIRPS to map the Standardized Precipitation Index, trends, anomalies, isohyets, and other types of spatio-temporal features. It can also produce new gridded rainfall data sets by geostatistical blending of station observations with existing rainfall grids. NMHS scientists have applied this latter capability to produce best-available national and regional gridded rainfall time-series for 1981-2014 for the East Africa Community (EAC). These data are a fundamental resource for the USAID-EAC climate change adaptation project known by the acronym PREPARED. They incorporate a larger and more complete collection of station observations than ever before. Further work is ongoing at the NMHS to take advantage of the data management capabilities of GeoCLIM, and incorporate its use into ongoing monitoring operations.",

            "abstract": "We give an update on efforts to model the rotation of Titan, subject to constraints from Cassini radar observations. The data we are currently using includes 670 tie-points, each of which is a pair of inertial positions of a single surface point, relative to the center of mass of Titan, and the corresponding pair of observation times. The positional accuracy is of order 1 km, in each Cartesian component.\nA reasonably good fit to the observations is obtained with a simple model which has a fixed spin pole and a rotation rate which is a sum of a constant value and a single sinusoidal oscillation.\nA better fit is obtained if we insist that Titan should behave as a synchronous rotator, in the dynamical sense of keeping its axis of least inertia oriented toward Saturn. At the level of accuracy required to fit the Cassini radar data, synchronous rotation is notably different than having a uniform rate of rotation. In this case, we need to model time variations in the orbital mean longitude, which is the longitude of periapse, plus the mean anomaly. That angle varies on a wide range of times scales, including Titan’s periapse precession period (703 years), Saturn’s heliocentric orbital period (29.47 years), perturbations from relatively large satellites Iapetus (79.3 days), and a 4:3 mean motion resonant interaction with Hyperion (640 and 6850 days), and a linear increase at Titan’s mean orbital period (15.9455 day). Our rotation model for Titan has 4 free parameters. Two of them specify the orientation of the fixed spin pole, and the other two are the effective free libration period and viscous damping time.\nOur dynamical model includes a damped forced longitudinal libration, in which gravitational torques attempt to align the axis of least inertia with the instantaneous direction to Saturn. For a rigid tri-axial body, with Titan’s moments of inertia, the free oscillation period for longitudinal librations would be 850 days. For a decoupled elastic shell, the effective period is likely somewhat less. Variations in angular position of Saturn, as seen from Titan, with periods shorter than the free libration period, will not be accurately tracked. Thus the short period (one and two cycles per orbit) forced librations will be very small (~50 m), and are, in any event, not well sampled in the data.",

            "abstract": "The rapid retreat of glaciers and ice caps throughout the Canadian Arctic is exposing pristine vegetation preserved beneath cold-based ice. For the past half century this vegetation has been consistently reported as dead. This interpretation has been overturned by the successful re-growth of Little Ice Age (1550-1850 AD) bryophytes emerging from the Teardrop Glacier, Sverdrup Pass, Ellesmere Island (79° N) collected in 2009. Some populations showed regeneration in the field and lab experiments confirmed their capacity to regrow. The species richness of these subglacial populations is exceptional, comprising >62 species that represent 44% of the extant bryophyte flora of Sverdrup Pass. Cold-based glaciers are known to provide critical habitats for a variety of microbiota (i.e., fungi, algae, cyanobacteria, bacteria and viruses) in high latitude ecosystems. The regeneration of Little Ice Age bryophytes fundamentally expands the concept of biological refugia to land plants that was previously restricted to survival above and beyond glacial margins. Given this novel understanding of subglacial ecosystems, fieldwork is now being extended southward to plateau ice caps on Baffin Island, Nunavut, where ice retreat is exposing subglacial populations of greater antiquity (thousands to tens of thousands of radiocarbon years before present). Bryophytes by nature are totipotent (stem cell equivalency) and poikilohydric (desiccation tolerance), which facilitate their unique adaptation to extreme environments. Continuity of the Arctic bryophyte flora extends back through the Holocene to the late Tertiary [Beaufort Fm, 2-5 Ma], when the majority of taxa were the same, based on records spanning the archipelago from Ellesmere to Banks Island. This record contrasts with that of vascular plants, which have had a number of extinctions, necessitating recolonization of arctic populations from outside the region. The biological significance of a stable bryophyte element highlights their capacity, resilience and persistence throughout arctic climate fluctuations, suggesting they - like those entombed during the Little Ice Age - have survived glaciation in situ, frozen in time.",

This can be explained by omnipresent aerosol processes. Condensation, coagulation and cloud processing, for example, generally make particles scatter more light while hardly increasing their number. This paper reports on the relationship in local air masses between CCN concentration, aerosol size distribution and light extinction observed from aircraft and the ground at diverse locations. The CCN-to-local-extinction relationship, when averaged over ~1 km distance and sorted by the wavelength dependence of extinction, varies approximately by a factor of 2, reflecting the variability in aerosol intensive properties. This, together with retrieval uncertainties and the variability in aerosol spatio-temporal distribution and hygroscopic growth, challenges satellite-based CCN estimates. However, the large differences in estimated CCN may correspond to a considerably lower uncertainty in cloud drop number concentration (CDNC), given the sublinear response of CDNC to CCN. Overall, our findings from airborne and ground-based observations call for model-based reexamination of aerosol-cloud interactions and underlying aerosol processes.",

Ice core records reveal that each Northern Hemisphere stadial is associated with a warming over Antarctica, so-called Antarctic Isotope Maximum (AIM), and that atmospheric CO2 varies in phase with Antarctic temperature.\nHere we perform transient simulations spanning the period 50-34 ka B.P. with two Earth System Models (LOVECLIM and the UVic ESCM) to understand the link between changes in the AMOC, changes in high latitude Southern Hemispheric climate and evolution of atmospheric CO2. Given the latest Antarctic ice core chronology, we find that part of the atmospheric CO2 increase occurring during AIM12 (DO12, ~48 ka B.P.) and at the end of AIM8 (DO8, 38 ka B.P.) can be attributed to the AMOC resumption. In contrast, the atmospheric CO2 increase observed at the beginning of AIM8 (~39.6 ka B.P.) occurs during a period of weak AMOC and can instead be explained by enhanced Antarctic Bottom Water production. Enhanced Antarctic Bottom Water formation is shown to effectively ventilate the deep Pacific carbon and thus lead to CO2 outgassing into the atmosphere.\nIn addition, changes in the AMOC alone are not sufficient to explain the largest Antarctic Isotope Maxima (namely AIM12 and AIM8). Stronger formation of Antarctic Bottom Water during AIM12 and AIM8 enhances the southern high latitude warming and leads to a better agreement with high southern latitude paleoproxy records. The robustness of this southern warming response is tested using an eddy-permitting coupled ocean sea-ice model. We show that stronger Antarctic Bottom Water formation contributes to Southern Ocean surface warming by increasing the Southern Ocean meridional heat transport. Finally, our simulations also suggest that the Antarctic cooling should be in phase, or lag by a maximum of ~200 years, the North Atlantic warming.",

To help minimize these large discontinuities and to specify the global state of the photospheric magnetic flux distribution as accurately as possible, we have developed the ADAPT (Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric flux Transport) model, which is comprised of a photospheric magnetic flux transport model that makes use of data assimilation methods. The ADAPT transport model evolves the solar magnetic flux for an ensemble of realizations using different model parameter values, e.g., for rotational, meridional, and super-granular diffusive transport processes. In this presentation, the ADAPT model and the data assimilative methods used within it will be reviewed. Coronal, solar wind, F10.7, and EUV model predictions based on ADAPT global photospheric magnetic field maps as input will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "To constrain models of the rheology and dynamic behavior of subducting oceanic lithosphere within the mantle transition zone, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which the major mineralogical components of the slab transform to their high-pressure polymorphs. Despite being the second most abundant component of the upper mantle, the mechanisms of polymorphic phase transformations in enstatite remain poorly understood. To represent mineral compositions found within subducting lithosphere, we used natural enstatite from San Carlos peridotite xenoliths to perform a series of multi-anvil experiments with conditions ranging from 18-20 GPa and 1200-1400°C. This natural enstatite reacts at lower pressure and temperature conditions than synthetic, annealed end-member MgSiO3 used previously [Hogrefe et al, 1994]. In addition to the growth of polycrystalline majorite and akimotoite at the rim of each sample, natural enstatite host grains transform through intracrystalline nucleation and growth. In some samples, coherent, topotaxial akimotoite lamellae nucleate and grow along twin boundaries parallel to (100)En. This mechanism provides a means for akimotoite within the mantle transition zone to inherit a lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) from previously deformed enstatite in subducting slabs. Secondly, polycrystalline akimotoite rods occurring along [001]En may be related to rod-shaped inclusions along [001]En in our starting material. This mechanism does not preserve a LPO, but it would enhance transformation rates by increasing the density of nuclei. These results suggest that transformation mechanisms and kinetic data derived from defect-free end-member minerals may not be applicable to modeling transformation in subducting lithosphere, where defects and inclusions could play an important role in transformation mechanisms, rates, and slab rheology.",

            "abstract": "Planktonic organisms have been extensively used in paleoceanographic studies as proxies for most marine environmental variables (temperature, salinity, currents, frontal zones, upwelling, etc.), both directly by species occurrences and indirectly through particular chemical components produced (e.g. Mg/Ca, stable isotopes, alkanones).\nIn 1965 Stehli pioneered by suggesting the use of planktonic organisms diversity to decipher ancient oceanic circulation, instead of the traditional approaches based on particular indicator species or assemblages composition (transfer functions). The use of species diversity has two main advantages. First, it is not restricted to a temporal epoch where the species existed and second, it does not assume that the species ecology is the same as in the present.\nIn the current work, we compare planktonic organisms diversity on the Atlantic Ocean, obtained from surface samples, with the main satellite measured oceanographic variables, i.e. SST (Sea Surface Temperature), CHL (as an indicator of primary productivity) and the main currents in the area. Three indices were used to quantify diversity: Shannon-Weaver diversity (H), specific richness (S) and Hulbert’s probability of interspecific encounter index of species evenness (PIE). Diversity was then modelled spatially using geostatistical tools at two scales: Atlantic Ocean oceanographic scale and the Iberian margin regional scale.\nThe main conclusions will then be used to interpret measured down core diversity, on a paleo perspective. This work will understand how did diversity reacted to major climatic events, and how long it took to recover – system resilience.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic SO2 is an important trace gas in the atmosphere that affects air quality and which is also a precursor to the production of sulfate aerosols. The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) was the first NASA UV instrument to measure daily maps of ozone and volcanic sulfur dioxide globally. It has been flown on four different satellites since its first launch aboard Nimbus 7 in 1978. The instrument provides a unique global long-term record of volcanic SO2, which have been invaluable to study the response of earth’s climate system to volcanic eruptions. However, complete TOMS SO2 L2 data has not yet been previously processed and properly archived. As part of the NASA MEaSUREs SO2 Program we updated heritage TOMS SO2 algorithm in preparation to re-processing and archiving TOMS data. We have also applied our TOMS algorithm to the L1B measurements of the hyperspectral UV Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) that has been flown on NASA Aura EOS spacecraft since 2004. Due to its hyperspectral capability and smaller field of view OMI SO2 sensitivity is more than hundred times larger than TOMS. The unique challenge is combining TOMS and OMI SO2 records to create a continuous long-term Climate Data record (CDR) to be released to the research community. This data set will provide researchers with continuous Level 2 estimates of SO2 and will help to validate and expand the current catalog of volcanic activity.",

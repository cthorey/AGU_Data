            "abstract": "On May 17, 2014, the Cassini spacecraft completed its 101 flyby of Saturn’s satellite Titan. Mirror-like (quasi-specular) reflections of radio signals transmitted by Cassini were observed on the Earth (bistatic scattering geometry). Three right circularly polarized (RCP) sinusoidal signals were transmitted (wavelength = 0.94, 3.6, and 13 cm). Both the RCP and LCP surface reflections were observed at the Canberra, Australia, complex of the NASA Deep Space Network. The signals probed the region extending from about (lat, long) = (79°N, 315°W) to about (74°N, 232°W). For the first time, two major Titan northern seas, the Ligeia Mare and the Kraken Mare, were probed.\nClearly detectable RCP and LCP echo components were observed over both seas at all 3 wavelengths. The echoes were intermittent over the region in between the two seas. The echoes from the seas have narrowband spectra well modeled as pure sinusoids, suggesting very smooth surfaces over > ~1 cm scales. Over shorelines and river like channels the measured spectra reveal a second distinct broadband component, likely reflection from a rough bottom solid interface.\nModeling the narrowband echo components as sinusoids, we estimate the RCP and LCP echo power profiles over the observation period. High resolution power profiles (several seconds time average; 0.2 to 2 km along the ground track) reveal remarkable structural detail. The statistical measurement uncertainty improves significantly when the resolution is degraded to about 1 m time average (3 to 30 km). Comparison of the 1 m power profiles with theoretical predictions computed assuming absent surface waves (negligible roughness) reveals excellent agreement with reflections from liquid hydrocarbons. The small statistical uncertainty promises to strongly constrain the liquid composition (ethane vs methane dominance).\nIn principle, the measured RCP/LCP power ratio removes dependence on roughness and enables determination of the dielectric constant regardless if waves are present or not. A known dielectric constant then enables searching for potential presence of capillary and/or gravity waves based on effects on the absolute RCP and LCP echo power and on observed spectral bandwidth.\nA second bistatic observation of the Kraken Mare was completed on 06/18/14. A third is to be completed on 10/24/14.",

            "abstract": "The Global Land-Atmosphere Climate Experiment–Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (GLACE-CMIP5) is a multimodel experiment investigating the impact of soil moisture-climate feedbacks in CMIP5 simulations (Seneviratne et al. 2013). This experiment builds upon previous studies investigating the role of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions for seasonal forecasting (Koster et al. 2004) and for regional climate projections (Seneviratne et al. 2006). A total of 6 modeling groups took part in the experiment (CESM, EC-EARTH, GFDL, IPSL, MPI-ESM, and more recently ACCESS). The results reveal that projected soil moisture changes by the end of the 21st century substantially impact climate in several regions on both hemispheres, both under present and future climate conditions. Strong and consistent effects are found on temperature, especially for extremes (about 1– 1.5K for mean temperature and 2– 2.5K for extreme daytime temperature). In the Northern Hemisphere, effects on mean and heavy precipitation are also found in most models, but the results are less consistent than for temperature. A direct scaling between soil moisture induced changes in evaporative cooling and resulting changes in temperature mean and extremes is found in the simulations. Further results from more recent analyses, especially regarding impacts on extremes will be discussed. The presentation will also address the implications of these results for climate extremes attribution and climate change adaptation, as well as follow-up activities under CMIP6.\n",

            "abstract": "Lake surface water (LST) is a key factor that controls most of the physical and ecological processes occurring in lakes. Reliable estimates are especially important in the light of recent studies, which revealed that inland water bodies are highly sensitive to climate, and are rapidly warming throughout the world. However, an accurate estimation of LST usually requires a significant amount of information that is not always available.\nIn this work, we present an application of air2water, a lumped model that simulates LST as a function of air temperature only. In addition, air2water allows for a qualitative evaluation of the depth of the epilimnion during the annual stratification cycle. The model consists in a simplification of the complete heat budget of the well-mixed surface layer, and has a few parameters (from 4 to 8 depending on the version) that summarize the role of the different heat flux components. Model calibration requires only air and water temperature data, possibly covering sufficiently long historical periods in order to capture inter-annual variability and long-term trends. During the calibration procedure, the information included in input data is retrieved to directly inform model parameters, which can be used to classify the thermal behavior of the lake. In order to investigate how thermal dynamics are related to morphological features, the model has been applied to 14 temperate lakes characterized by different morphological and hydrological conditions, by different sources of temperature data (buoys, satellite), and by variable frequency of acquisition. A good agreement between observed and simulated LST has been achieved, with a RMSE in the order of 1°C, which is fully comparable to the performances of more complex process-based models. This application allowed for a deeper understanding of the thermal response of lakes as a function of their morphology, as well as for specific analyses as for example the investigation of the exceptional warming of Lake Superior in summer 1998.",

This is due to the intrinsic weakness of the field (~4 G at a height of 0.1 Rsun above an active region) and the large thermal broadening of coronal emission lines. Current methods deduce either the direction of the magnetic field or the magnetic flux density. We propose using concurrent linear polarization measurements in the near IR of forbidden and permitted lines to calculate the coronal vector magnetic field. The effect of the magnetic field on the polarization properties of emitted light is encapsulated in the Hanle effect. In the unsaturated Hanle regime both the direction and strength of the magnetic field affect the linear polarization, while for saturated Hanle the polarization is insensitive to the strength of the field. Coronal forbidden lines are always in the saturated Hanle regime so the linear polarization holds no information on the strength of the field. By pairing measurements of both forbidden and permitted lines we would be able to obtain both the direction and strength of the field. The near-IR region of the spectrum offers the opportunity to study this problem from the ground. The FeXIII 1.075 um and SiX 1.431 um forbidden lines are strongly polarizable and are sufficiently bright over a large field of view (out to 1.5 Rsun). Measurements of both these lines can be paired up with the recently observed coronal HeI 1.083 um permitted line. The first data set used to test this technique was taken during the March 29, 2006 total solar eclipse and consisted of near-IR spectra covering the spectral region 0.9-1.8 um, with a field of view of 3 x 3 Rsun. The data revealed unexpectedly strong SiX emission compared to FeXIII. Using the HAO FORWARD suite of codes we produced simulated emission maps from a global HMD model for the day of the eclipse. Comparing the intensity variation of the measurements and the model we predict that SiX emission is more extended for this day that the model would suggest, further supporting the possible usefulness of SiX polarimetry. The development of this method and associated tools will be critical in interpreting the high spectral, spatial and temporal IR measurements that will be possible when the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) is completed in a few years time.",

            "abstract": "In the latter part of the 2012/13 austral summer season (January – March), the North Island of New Zealand endured its most severe drought in 41 years of instrumental records. When the 2013 drought is defined by potential evapotranspiration deficit, 34.2% of the North Island land surface experienced its highest recorded cumulative deficits, significantly greater than the 14.3% recorded for the previously severest drought (1997/98). The New Zealand Treasury estimates reduced agricultural production attributed to the drought cost the national economy at least US$1.3 billion, with continued impacts expected for another two years. To examine the role of anthropogenic climate change, we chose to consider the drought in terms of monthly mean sea level pressure (MSLP) anomalies across the North Island, and the maximum three month accumulation of dry days in each extended austral summer (November – April). Those models in the CMIP5 ensemble for which historical simulations compare well against observations are then quantitatively compared to simulations which excluded the impact of anthropogenic changes, such as greenhouse gases and ozone depletion. Results show the monthly pressure anomalies associated with the 2013 drought were on average 0.4 hPa higher as a result of anthropogenic climate change. However, no model was able to capture the extremity of the 3-month dry day index, likely a combination of bias in the models and the severity of the event relative to the size of the model ensemble. Using the observed 90th percentile of the dry day index as a more general threshold for drought, a 72% increase in the number of events was found, suggesting a change in drought risk. The human-induced shift in monthly dry days and MSLP were found to be very well correlated (R = 0.95), underlining that, in these models, the human-induced contribution to drought over New Zealand occurs through increased high pressure. Since the 2013 drought was not associated with record high pressures, natural internal variability in the climate system must have also played a strong role in the underlying causes of its severity.",

            "abstract": "Abrasion by saltating sediment has been shown to be an important mechanism of incision in bedrock rivers. Because sediment can abrade the bed as well as shield bedrock from erosion, it is necessary to understand how sediment becomes spatially distributed in mixed bedrock-alluvial rivers if we want to be able to predict their morphodynamic evolution. This presentation will discuss two analytical approaches to explore the controls on the spatial patterns of sediment distribution in mixed bedrock-alluvial rivers.\nThe first approach focuses sediment distribution in straight channels. The local sediment transport rate is modeled as proportional to the areal concentration of sediment available on the bed, and the sediment continuity equation is reformulated to account for temporal changes in areal concentration of sediment on nonalluviated surfaces. We perform a linear stability analysis and show that an initially uniform distribution of the areal concentration of sediment on the bed is unstable to small perturbations. Our analysis suggests that the difference in roughness between sediment and bare bedrock forces the system to organize such that the sediment on the bed will tend to become locally concentrated, which is in general agreement with experimental observations.\nThe second approach addresses the importance of channel curvature on the formation of point bars in mixed bedrock-alluvial channels. We present a nonlinear asymptotic theory of fully developed flow and bed topography in a channel of constant curvature to calculate the three-dimensional flow field in a channel bend, the shape of the cross section (including the point bar and exposed bedrock), and the slope and depth in the bend necessary to transport the sediment supply from upstream. Our model results suggest that in mixed bedrock-alluvial bends, there is a characteristic relationship between the degree of curvature, the amount of sediment supplied from upstream, the morphology of the point bar, and the amount of bedrock exposure. This points to a potentially useful model application in which sediment supply might be calculated from local measurements of bar morphology and channel curvature.",

            "abstract": "Turbulent flow and transport processes in riverine environments pose major challenges to computational fluid dynamics models. Such flows are dominated by arbitrary nature and man-made geometric complexity, are bounded by dynamically evolving boundaries whose shape and deformation are not known a priori, and are dominated by slowly evolving, albeit energetic, aperiodic coherent structures that often constitute the primary mechanism of turbulence production. With exponentially growing computing power and the development of powerful computational methodologies for carrying our large-eddy simulation (LES) of flow and transport processes in real-life waterways, it is now possible to simulate such flows with unprecedented realism and spatial and temporal resolution. Such sophisticated numerical simulations, however, require experimental measurements of equal sophistication and resolution that can provide reliable data to enable the validation of the numerical models. In this talk I will present a three-pronged high-fidelity modeling validation approach developed at the St. Anthony Falls laboratory based on the integration of laboratory-scale experiments (Indoor Streamlab), field-scale experiments under controlled laboratory conditions (Outdoor StreamLab), and field measurements. I will demonstrate this validation approach in the context of SAFL’s high-fidelity hydro-morphodynamic code, the SAFL Virtual StreamLab (VSL3D), and emphasize the need for tight integration of experiments and simulations. I will show how such coupling is critical prerequisite not only for validating numerical models but also for uncovering new physical insights that could not have been found by measurements alone. I will also discuss and illustrate the challenges for meaningful validation of RANS turbulence models and present metrics for establishing the grid independence of computed solutions for both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic aspects of the simulations.\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grant IIP-1318201.

            "abstract": "As shown by Démoulin and Berger (2003), the magnetic helicity flux through the solar surface into the solar atmosphere can be exactly calculated if we can trace the motion of footpoints with infinite temporal and spatial resolutions. When there is a magnetic flux transport across the solar surface, the horizontal velocity of footpoints becomes infinite at the polarity inversion line, but the surface integral yielding the helicity flux does not diverge. In practical application, a finite temporal and spatial resolution causes an underestimate of the magnetic helicity flux when a magnetic flux emerges from below the surface. In this paper, we consider emergence of simple two- and half-dimensional magnetic flux ropes and calculate the supremum of the magnitude of the helicity influx that can be estimated from footpoint tracking, per unit length in the invariant direction. The results depend on the ratio of the resolvable length scale and the flux rope diameter. For a Gold-Hoyle flux rope, in which all field lines are uniformly twisted, the observationally estimated helicity influx would be about 90% of the real influx when the ratio is 0.01 and about 45% when the ratio is 0.1. For Lundquist flux ropes, the errors to be incurred by observational estimation would be smaller than the case of the Gold-Hoyle flux rope, but could be as large as 30%. Our calculation suggests that the error in the helicity influx estimate is at least half of the real value or even larger when small scale magnetic structures emerge into the solar atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The dependency of surface- or groundwater flows and aquifer hydraulic properties on dewatering-induced layer deformation is not available in the USGS’s groundwater model MODFLOW. A new integrated hydrologic model, MODFLOW-OWHM, formulates this dependency by coupling mesh deformation with aquifer transmissivity and storage and by linking land subsidence/uplift with deformation-dependent flows that also depend on aquifer head and other flow terms. In a test example, flows most affected were stream seepage and evapotranspiration from groundwater (ETgw). Deformation feedback also had an indirect effect on conjunctive surface- and groundwater use components: Changed stream seepage and streamflows influenced surface-water deliveries and returnflows. Changed ETgw impacted on irrigation demand, which jointly with altered surface-water supplies resulted in changed supplemental groundwater requirements and pumping and changed return runoff. This modeling feature will improve the impact assessment of dewatering-induced land subsidence/uplift (following irrigation pumping or coal-seam gas extraction) on surface receptors, inter-basin transfers, and surface-infrastructure integrity. A hypothetical example and the Central Valley are used to demonstrate the utility and importance of the new subsidence model linkages for conjunctive use.",

The ion reflection and acceleration process, which generates earthward flows ahead of the DF, also imposes a dynamic pressure on the DF to decelerate its earthward motion. It has been shown that the ion reflection process is not symmetric, with stronger ion accelerations at the evening side of the DF than at its morning side, which implies dawn-dusk asymmetric reaction of the ambient plasma and consequently dawnward diversion of DFs. In this paper, we examine this scenario in detail, by carrying out statistical studies based on THEMIS observations from 2008 to 2011. We demonstrate the important role of the ion reflection process in the longstanding problems regarding DF evolution and bursty flow braking in the near-Earth plasma sheet.",

Our goal is to evaluate if the strong ground motions from earthquakes on creeping faults are smaller than the strong ground motions from earthquakes on locked faults. Smaller ground motions might be expected from earthquakes on creeping faults if the fault sections that strongly radiate energy are surrounded by patches of fault that predominantly absorb energy. For our study we used the ground motion data available in the PEER NGA-West2 database, and the ground motion prediction equations that were developed from the PEER NGA-West2 dataset. We analyzed data for the eleven largest well-recorded creeping-fault earthquakes, that ranged in magnitude from M5.0-6.5. Our findings are that these earthquakes produced peak ground motions that are statistically indistinguishable from the peak ground motions produced by similar-magnitude earthquakes on locked faults. These findings may be implemented in earthquake hazard estimates for moderate-size earthquakes in creeping-fault regions. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this result will also apply to larger earthquakes on creeping faults.\nPlease also see: Harris, R.A., and N.A.

Intermediate spatial domains remain challenging. Significant progress has been made in estimating regional sources and sinks of GHG, particularly when high data densities are available to constrain integrative modeling systems. These regional estimates, however, have not yet found much utility outside of the academic community working to develop these methods.\nWe will review the current state of regional inferences of GHG sources and sinks including flux tower upscaling and regional atmospheric inversions, focusing especially on uncertainty assessment. Numerous flux tower upscaling products and a smaller number of regional atmospheric inversions have been produced in recent years. These vary greatly in terms of their data density, uncertainty, and method of uncertainty assessment. Arguably, none to date have reached the level of a data product that can be used to evaluate models or rigorously identify changes in fluxes over time and space. We will assess the prospects for obtaining rigorous uncertainty estimates that can move these products out of the realm of methodological experimentation and towards operational assessment of regional GHG sources and sinks.

            "abstract": "This study reviews Australian experience of natural disasters over the last century and considers how to reduce this nation’s vulnerability to such events in the future. In line with global experience, the cost of Australian weather-related natural disasters has been increasing, while loss of life has decreased, with extreme heat events responsible for more fatalities than all other natural perils combined, baring epidemics. However when disaster costs arising from historical events are normalised to current day exposure, no long-term trend emerges. Moreover the frequency of these losses shows no sign of increasing since 1950. In other words, the rising cost of natural disasters can be firmly sheeted home to the fact that there are now more of us living in vulnerable places with more to lose.\nIn view of the above, emergency management and government risk management and strategic planning should focus on plausible large event scenarios, whatever their cause. If we wish to reduce disaster losses, land-use planning has to become risk-informed and building codes need to consider potential economic impacts, rather than just life safety. Insurers can play a role by pricing risk correctly and sending clear signals to homeowners (and governments) to stimulate risk-reducing behaviours. The tools to achieve fine-grained risk assessments are increasingly available. The success of the regulated use of the building code in tropical cyclone-prone regions in Australia and the performance of modern seismic building codes in New Zealand, shows what can be achieved when there is a demonstrated need and political will.",

The coupling between photosynthesis, stomatal dynamics and leaf energy balance fundamentally links the hydrologic and carbon cycles, and provides a basis for examining the utility of observations of functional plant traits for hydrologic prediction. Here we explore the potential of solar induced fluorescence (SIF) and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing observations to improve the accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in hydrologic prediction. While SIF represents an emission of radiation associated with photosynthesis, TIR provides information on foliage temperature and is related to stomatal function and water stress.\nA set of remote observing system simulation experiments are conducted to quantify the value of remotely sensed observations of SIF and TIR when assimilated into a detailed vegetation biophysical model. The MLCan model discretizes a dense plant canopy to resolve vertical variation in photosynthesis, water vapor and energy exchange. Here we present extensions to MLCan that allow for direct computation of the canopy emission of both SIF and TIR. The detailed representation of the physical environment and biological functioning of structurally complex canopies makes MLCan an ideal simulation tool for exploring the impact of these two unique, and potentially synergistic observables.\nThis work specifically addresses remote sensing capabilities on both recently launched (OCO-2) and near-term (ECOSTRESS) satellite platforms.

Conditions both in the incident solar wind and in the magnetosphere are important in determining the efficiency of this energy transfer. In particular, the cold, dense plasmaspheric plume can substantially limit the coupling in the dayside reconnection region primarily on the dusk side of the magnetopause. Using ground-based Total Electron Content maps and in-situ measurements from the THEMIS spacecraft, we investigate simultaneous ionosphere/magnetosphere observations of the plasmaspheric plume and its involvement in an unsteady magnetic reconnection process.",

Here we focus on desert dust size distributions, how these are characterized, emitted from the surface, evolve in the atmosphere, and impact climate and biogeochemistry. Observations, theory and global model results are synthesized to highlight the evolution and impact of dust sizes. Individual particles sizes are, to a large extent, set by the soil properties and the mobilization process. The lifetime of different particle sizes controls the evolution of the size distribution as the particles move downwind, as larger particles fall out more quickly. The dust size distribution strongly controls the radiative impact of the aerosols, as well as their interactions with clouds. The size of particles controls how far downwind they travel, and thus their ability to impact biogeochemistry downwind of the source region.",

Such abundance of data is a new exciting challenge because now, we can’t hide behind one kind of measurement, and we need to reconcile multiple datasets. Since beauty lies in simplicity, we will show how simple physical models can explain multiple datasets without involving complex non-linear interactions that could, of-course, explain all the data at the same time, but at what price?\nHow can we explain the continuous deformation measured at Piton de la Fournaise volcano, while at the same time the seismicity highlights a complex migration of the magma with phases of arrest and phases of migration? We attempt to explain similar behavior observed at other volcanoes.\nThe apparent discrepancy between geodetic and seismic data will be reconciled using comparison with analogue and numerical models. Those models are performed under constant injection rate of maga. Therefore a real-time joint inversion of different data streams with simple physical models will, in the future, allow us to get quantitative estimation of key physical parameters controlling the magma injection. Knowing the magma injection rate in advance will allow a rapid diagnosis of intrusion versus eruption, and also an estimation of potential explosivity.",

            "abstract": "Well-aquifer systems respond to dynamic strains over a wide frequency band, making them sensitive to atmospheric pressure fluctuations, earth tides, and seismic waves. Dynamic pore pressures in damaged rock around active strike-slip fault systems are expected to have a reduced response to given dynamic strains: the rock will be in a drained state, with enhanced permeability and mechanical compliance, and cannot support elevated pressures over long times. Despite this expectation, spatial patterns of such a reduction in response are poorly understood. Here we use a set of strain and pressure measurements from Plate Boundary Observatory boreholes in southern California around the highly active San Jacinto fault to analyze variations in response to seismic waves. Stations near the major fault strand show a marked decrease in response compared to stations much farther away, and we show this reduction is controlled by secular shear-strain rates in the crust following an inverse power law. We propose that the spatial pattern in near-surface response is directly related to the earthquake cycle: recurring periods of high interseismic strain accumulation punctuated by large moment release reduce structural rigidity of the surrounding rock, and enhance its hydraulic transport characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Effects of aquifer heterogeneity and uncertainties in source/sink, and initial and boundary conditions in a groundwater flow model on the spatiotemporal variations of groundwater level, h(x,t), were investigated. Analytical solutions for the variance and covariance of h(x, t) in an unconfined aquifer described by a linearized Boussinesq equation with a white noise source/sink and a random transmissivity field were derived. It was found that in a typical aquifer the error in h(x,t) in early time is mainly caused by the random initial condition and the error reduces as time goes to reach a constant error in later time. The duration during which the effect of the random initial condition is significant may last a few hundred days in most aquifers. The constant error in groundwater in later time is due to the combined effects of the uncertain source/sink and flux boundary: the closer to the flux boundary, the larger the error. The error caused by the uncertain head boundary is limited in a narrow zone near the boundary but it remains more or less constant over time. The effect of the heterogeneity is to increase the variation of groundwater level and the maximum effect occurs close to the constant head boundary because of the linear mean hydraulic gradient. The correlation of groundwater level decreases with temporal interval and spatial distance. In addition, the heterogeneity enhances the correlation of groundwater level, especially at larger time intervals and small spatial distances. ",

The sediments were recovered by hybrid pressure core system (hybrid PCS) and pressure cores were cut by pressure core analysis tools (PCATs) on board. These pressure cores were transferred to the AIST Hokkaido centre and trimmed by pressure core non-destructive analysis tools (PNATs) for TACTT system which maintained the pressure and temperature conditions within the hydrate stability boundary, through the entire process of core handling from drilling to the end of laboratory testing. An image processing technique was used to capture the motion of sediment in a transparent acrylic cell, and digital photographs were obtained at every 0.1% of vertical strain during the test. Analysis of the optical images showed that sediments with 63% hydrate saturation exhibited brittle failure, although nonhydrate-bearing sediments exhibited ductile failure. In addition, the increase in shear strength with hydrate saturation increase of natural gas hydrate is in agreement with previous data from synthetic gas hydrate.\nThis research was financially supported by the Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan (MH21 Research Consortium) that carries out Japan’s Methane Hydrate R&D Program by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).",

KH instabilities are excited in a velocity shear layer, leading to an undulation of the magnetopause or inner edge of its boundary layer and eventually to the formation of flow vortices, while flux ropes are generated in a current sheet through a time-dependent form of magnetic reconnection, which interconnect the field lines on both sides of the magnetopause. Because of their two- or three-dimensional nature, in-depth observational studies have become possible only with the advent of multi-spacecraft missions such as Cluster and THEMIS. We discuss similarities/differences of these two phenomena and the roles of these processes in the transfer of mass, momentum, and energy across the magnetopause, in particular with regard to the formation of the low-latitude boundary layer. Recent advances in studies of three-dimensional effects on these phenomena, effects of nonlinear evolution of the KH instability on magnetic reconnection and flux rope generation, and dawn-dusk symmetry/asymmetry in and IMF dependence of the occurrence of nonlinear (overturned) KH waves are also presented.",

            "abstract": "Titan is the only body in the solar system, besides Earth, to have stable liquid seas at its surface [1]. The three main seas, known as Kraken Mare, Ligeia Mare, and Punga Mare are located at the North Pole where they cover a surface area of 500,000-, 126,000-, and 50,000-km2, respectively. In addition, several hundreds of small lakes are present, raising the questions of their relationships with the large seas. These hydrocarbon lakes and seas can be better imaged at optical wavelengths as the season moves towards summer solstice. At the same time, the North Pole area is receiving more solar light, which modifies the atmospheric circulation. Global Circulation Models (GCMs) predict stronger winds, more evaporation, and formation of methane clouds [2].\nThe Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) has observed the North Pole area during several high inclined flybys. Mosaics in seven infrared atmospheric windows have been constructed. Several units can be distinguished by their surface albedo. The 5-micron bright unit has been interpreted as evaporitic material based on its location relative to the lakes and seas [3]. The spectral characteristics cannot be matched by a simple mixture of water ice and ‘typical Titan organic material’ known as tholins. The composition of these different units is therefore still enigmatic. In addition, some of the spectral characteristics may be related to the texture of the units.\nThe few passes over the North Pole have allowed the VIMS team to image some places several times looking for changes on the surface or/and in the lower atmosphere. Although GCMs predict evaporation of the seas and lakes and the formation of methane clouds [2], neither changes in the shorelines, nor clouds have been identified. Very recent specular reflection observations suggest the formation of waves on Punga [4], and therefore more active winds. In addition, the VIMS recently observed a brightening of the area between Punga, Kraken and Ligeia. Whether this change is related to surface processes or evaporation of the seas is being investigated.\nThis work has been performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to NASA.\n[1] Stofan E.R. et al., Science, 2007 ; [2] Schneider T. et al., Nature, 2012 ; [3] MacKenzie S.M. et al., Icarus, in press ; [4] Barnes J.W., Ap.J., 2014.",

            "abstract": "The nature of landslides is complex in many respects, with landslide hazard and impact being dependent on a variety of factors. This obviously requires an integrated assessment for fundamental understanding of landslide risk. Integrated risk assessment, according to the approach presented in this contribution, implies combining prediction of future landslide occurrence with analysis of landslide impact in the past. A critical step for assessing landslide risk in integrated perspective is to analyze what types of landslide damage affected people and property in which way and how people contributed and responded to these damage types. In integrated risk assessment, the focus is on systematic identification and monetization of landslide damage, and analytical tools that allow deriving economic costs from physical landslide processes are at the heart of this approach.\nThe broad spectrum of landslide types and process mechanisms as well as nonlinearity between landslide magnitude, damage intensity, and direct costs are some main factors explaining recent challenges in risk assessment. The two prevailing approaches for assessing the impact of landslides in economic terms are cost survey (ex-post) and risk analysis (ex-ante). Both approaches are able to complement each other, but yet a combination of them has not been realized so far. It is common practice today to derive landslide risk without considering landslide process-based cause-effect relationships, since integrated concepts or new modeling tools expanding conventional methods are still widely missing.\nThe approach introduced in this contribution is based on a systematic framework that combines cost survey and GIS-based tools for hazard or cost modeling with methods to assess interactions between land use practices and landslides in historical perspective. Fundamental understanding of landslide risk also requires knowledge about the economic and fiscal relevance of landslide losses, wherefore analysis of their impact on public budgets is a further component of this approach. In integrated risk assessment, combination of methods plays an important role, with the objective of collecting and integrating complex data sets on landslide risk.",

            "abstract": "The compositions of alkaline lavas are mostly similar even though they are observed in various tectonic contexts. This similarity has been used to suggest that these rocks are all produced by deep processes. Nevertheless, the formation of petit-spot seamounts, which are interpreted as low-degree melts extracted from the base of the lithosphere in response to plate flexure, demonstrates that alkaline lavas could also be produced by shallow tectonic processes. In this presentation, petit-spot lavas will be compared to intraplate basalts to reveal the processes that control the petrogenesis of intraplate lavas.\nPetit-spot lavas are characterized by an alkaline basaltic composition rich in potassium (K2O/Na2O>0.7). This distinguishes them from oceanic island basalts, which are characterized by a lower alkali ratio. The K-rich nature of petit-spot melts is explained either by the melting of an asthenospheric mantle domain enriched in K2O, TiO2 and trace elements, or by the interaction of low-degree melts extracted from the low velocity zone (LVZ) with phlogopite-rich metasomatic lithologies present in the lower part of the lithospheric mantle; metasomatic cumulates formed during an early stage of LVZ melt migration. The latter model is supported by the recent discovery of metasomatized peridotite xenoliths in petit-spot lavas which demonstrates that low degree melts, similar in composition to the melts responsible for the formation of phlogopite-rich cumulates in continental lithospheric mantle, percolate through the oceanic lithospheric mantle producing a metasomatic enrichment. The involvement of metasomatic processes in the formation of petit-spot lavas provides a link to the metasomatic lithospheric model for the origin of alkaline magmas, a model that suggests that these rocks are not produced directly from the asthenosphere, but by the melting of hydrous veins produced by the percolation and differentiation of low degree asthonospheric melts across the lithospheric mantle.",

            "abstract": "Mars total magnetic data obtained by Mars Global Surveyor mission from 400 km altitude were processed using a second moving average method (SMAM) to estimate the depth of the buried sources. Five profiles were chosen across major magnetic areas. Each profile was subjected to a separation technique using the SMAM. Second moving average residual anomalies (SMARA) were obtained from magnetic data using filters of successive spacing. The depth estimate is monitored by the standard deviation of the depths determined from all SMARA for various value of the shape factor (SF) that includes dike, cylinder, and sphere. The standard deviation along with depth estimate is considered to be a new criterion for determining the correct depth and shape of the buried structures on Mars.",

            "abstract": "The remote southern ocean regions are often described as being pristine. Here we use global aerosol model simulations to define what we mean by pristine in terms of aerosol concentrations and behaviour. The model results show that the processes and emissions controlling cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) over the southern oceans vary substantially with season and with location. In the true Southern Ocean (south of 60 degrees) much of CCN derives from sulfate aerosol entrained into the boundary layer from the free troposphere, but sea spray emissions dominate further north. The Southern Ocean is the part of the atmosphere where CCN concentrations show the highest sensitivity to variations in DMS emissions, although only part of the seasonal variation can be attributed to changes in biological activity, with the rest coming from variations in atmospheric circulation and particle formation. We define the pristineness of the aerosol system in terms of how closely it resembles conditions in the unperturbed pre-industrial period. By this definition, large parts of the southern oceans are pristine in the southern hemisphere summer, but the aerosol system may be significantly perturbed by anthropogenic emissions in winter. Using a multi-parameter sensitivity analysis we explore to what extent these variations in pristineness affect the aerosol processes, and whether the remote southern ocean is a good analogue for pre-industrial marine aerosols in other parts of the world.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions can inject large volumes of ash into heavily travelled air corridors and thus pose a significant societal and economic hazard. In remote volcanic regions, satellite data are sometimes the only technology available to observe volcanic eruptions and constrain ash-release parameters for aviation safety. Infrasound (acoustic waves ~0.01–20 Hz) data fill this critical observational gap, providing ground-based data for remote volcanic eruptions. Explosive volcanic eruptions are among the most powerful sources of infrasound observed on earth, with recordings routinely made at ranges of hundreds to thousands of kilometers. Advances in infrasound technology and the efficient propagation of infrasound in the atmosphere therefore greatly enhance our ability to monitor volcanoes in remote regions such as the North Pacific Ocean. Infrasound data can be exploited to detect, locate, and provide detailed chronologies of the timing of explosive volcanic eruptions for use in ash transport and dispersal models. We highlight results from case studies of multiple eruptions recorded by the International Monitoring System and dedicated regional infrasound networks (2008 Kasatochi, Alaska, USA; 2008 Okmok, Alaska, USA; 2009 Sarychev Peak, Kuriles, Russian Federation; 2010 Eyjafjallajökull, Icleand) and show how infrasound is currently used in volcano monitoring. We also present progress towards characterizing and modeling the variability in source mechanisms of infrasound from explosive eruptions using dedicated local infrasound field deployments at volcanoes Karymsky, Russian Federation and Sakurajima, Japan.",

            "abstract": "The analysis and interpretation of seismicity from mantle depths to the surface plays a key role in understanding how volcanoes work. We are developing and applying methods for the systematic reanalysis of waveforms from volcano-seismic networks, including high-precision earthquake relocation, spectral event classification, and robust focal mechanism and stress drop estimates. Our primary dataset is the ~50-station permanent network of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), but we are extending our methods for application to other volcanic systems. We have converted the entire HVO digital waveform and phase-pick database from 1986 to 2009 (~260,0000 events) to a uniform custom event format, greatly facilitating systematic analyses. A comprehensive multi-year catalog of high-precision relocated seismicity for all of Hawaii Island exhibits a dramatic sharpening of earthquake clustering along faults, streaks, and magmatic features, permitting a more detailed understanding of fault geometries and volcanic and tectonic processes. Automated spectral identification and relocation of long-period (LP, 0.5-5 Hz) seismicity near the summit region of Kilauea Volcano shows that most intermediate depth (5-15 km) LP events occur within a compact volume that has remained at a fixed location for over 23 years. An unanticipated result from our relocation work is the emergence of sharp ring seismicity features. We have so far identified 2 ring features: a full ring of diameter ~2 km on the northwest flank of Mauna Loa, and a half-ring feature of diameter ~0.5 km near Makaopuhi Crater. We are also performing comprehensive spectral analyses to estimate spatial variations in stress drop of shear-failure earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Patterns of high-latitude ionospheric currents are a manifestation of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Rapid variations of the currents are associated with geomagnetically induced currents (GIC) in technological conductor systems and displays of bright, diverse auroras. One advantage of a ground-based magnetometer network over a low-orbit satellite is the possibility to distinguish between temporal and spatial variations in the data. Although ground magnetic field data can only yield distributions of ionospheric equivalent currents instead of the full horizontal and field-aligned current density, estimates for these can be obtained, under certain assumptions. We use data (1994-2013) from the ground-based IMAGE magnetometer network to derive statistical distributions of the large-scale ionospheric equivalent current density and its time-derivative as well as estimates for the field-aligned current density. These are compared with and validated against horizontal and field-aligned current density distributions obtained from low-orbit CHAMP satellite magnetic field data (2000-2010) and convection maps obtained from SuperDARN radar data (2000-2010). The ground-based distributions reveal a strong dependence of the dayside variations on radial interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) orientation and solar wind speed. The spatial distribution of enhanced nightside activity agrees with that of the average substorm bulge and depends on solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere. The most intense time variation events are related to substorm activity and occur on the nightside.",

It is a basic determinant of the terrestrial thermal behaviour, as it controls the effective radiating temperature of the Earth’s surface. The sensitivity of LST to soil moisture and vegetation cover means it is an important component in numerous applications. With the demand for LST data from Earth Observation currently experiencing considerable growth it is important that the users of this data are appropriately engaged by the LST data providers.\nThe GlobTemperature project under the Data User Element of ESA's 4th Earth Observation Envelope Programme (2013-2017) aims to promote the wider uptake of global-scale satellite LST by the research and operational user communities; the key to success depending on the coherence and openness of the interactions between the LST and user communities. By incorporating detailed user input into the specifications, their subsequent testing of the LST data sets, and sustained access to data in a user-friendly manner through common data formats GlobTemperature is enhancing the portfolio of LST products from Earth Observation, while concurrently breaking down the barriers to successful application of such data through its programme of dialogue between the data providers and data users.\nHere we present the outcomes from the first phase of the project, which is achieving some innovative developments: a globally representative and consistent matchup database enabling validation and intercomparison of multi-sensor LST data sets; a prototype combined geostationary earth orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) global data set for LST to resolve the diurnal cycle which is a key request from users of LST data; the delivery of the first LST data sets via a dedicated Data Portal in harmonised data format; and the establishment, in collaboration with international colleagues of a first working group (ILSTE-WG) dedicated to LST and Emissivity, whereby user evaluation of products by climate services aims to provide a thrust to sustained operational support of this group meeting a critical need amongst users of LST data.",

            "abstract": "We collected thermal video for 31 explosions at Stromboli during 2012 and 2014. We obtain a statistically robust database of size, mass and velocity for 83 000 particles. Statistically, the distribution for all parameters for 2012 is similar to that obtained for 2014. Most particles have sizes of 5 to 15 cm, so that the majority of individual bomb masses are below 0.4 kg. However, 4950 (6 %) of the particles are heavier than 5 kg and represent 59 % of the total mass erupted\nThe particle velocity distribution is Gaussian with a mode of 20 to 30 m/s. Explosive activity at Stromboli has been viewed as involving large particles with low velocities (mean = 25 m/s). Recently, various studies have shown that a few lapilli-sized particles can be ejected as part of an initial high velocity gas-jet, which has average velocities of 80 m/s and a maximum of 405 m/s. Our data support this duality. Our spatial resolution allows us to detect particles down to 5 cm. Thus, we assume that all of the bombs are detected and that the bomb velocity distribution has a mode of 20 to 30 m/s. However, we also show that the smallest particles have the highest velocities with a maximum speed of 240 m/s, and a projected maximum of 456 m/s.\nStromboli’s explosions have been classified by visual clustering; depending on whether they are ballistic dominated (Type 1), ash dominated, with (2a) or without (2b) particles, or gas-dominated (Type 0). We used our parameters to cluster the explosions into 3 classes: Type 2a, 2b and Type 0. Correlation with seismic data now help to understand the source mechanism, and support recent models whereby Type 2a and 2b events are a consequence of the presence of a viscous, degassed cap at the head of the magma column, its fragmentation providing 103 to 104 kg of solid material to the plume in each eruption. However, Type 0 are a consequence of slug bursting in a “cleaner” conduit, the cap having been lost by convective overturn.",

Two main processes have been found and will be presented. The first comes from the occurrence of magnetic reconnection between the magnetic cloud and its sheath ahead, leading to magnetic flux erosion and redistribution, with associated large scale topological changes. The second may occur when dense filament material in the coronal mass ejection pushes its way through the structure and comes in direct contact with the shocked plasma in the sheath ahead. This leads to diverging non-radial flows in front of the CME which transport poloidal flux of the flux rope to the sides of the magnetic cloud.",

We assessed the fast cloud feedback in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble of general circulation models (GCM) to find that in the chosen example region of Central Europe the fast cloud feedback behaves similarly as it does over global land areas in indivual models, yet shows a large inter-model scatter.

            "abstract": "For the evolution of the Cenozoic high northern latitude paleo-climate, the development of the North Atlantic – Arctic Ocean interactions including its southern (Faeroe – Shetland channel) and northern (Fram Strait) gateways were vital. In this paper we review the timing of inflow of paleo-Atlantic water into the Norwegian – Greenland Sea and the Arctic Ocean using the development of ocean current controlled contourite drift deposition as a proxy. In the early Miocene, drift growth accelerated in the Rockall Trough and in the Faroe-Shetland Channel interpreted to be related to the opening of the Faeroe – Shetland channel and establish a deep-water passage across the Greenland – Shetland Ridge. To the north, offshore Norway, growth of the Lofoten Drift has been estimated from mid-Miocene although age control is sparse in this area. No drift development has been reported from the SW Barents Sea continental slope while offshore the NW part of the Barents Sea slope, drift growth seems to have come in later, at ~1.3 Ma. North of the Fram Strait gateway, drift growth has been inferred from at least mid-Miocene (~11 Ma). Studies from the central Arctic Ocean shows ventilated surface water conditions from ~17.5 Ma ascribed to the opening of the Fram Strait which was a narrow oceanic corridor during early Miocene (20 – 15 Ma) and where the onset of sea floor spreading and the establishment of a deep-water corridor has been suggested to start from late Miocene (~10 Ma). Other, more recent studies have, however, reported evidence for the development of an initial deep-water gateway through the Fram Strait from around 17 Ma.\nTo summarize:\n- A circulation system similar to the present was probably established in the southern Norwegian – Greenland Sea before the Fram Strait became a deep-water gateway and before the establishments of the major ice sheets in this area (the first occurred in SE Greenland from ~7 Ma).\n- Uncertainties still relates to the timing of the development of ocean circulation in the northern Norwegian – Greenland Sea including the Fram Strait gateway where drift onset has been estimated to at least 11 Ma.\n- The onset of drift growth at 1.3 Ma slightly south of the Fram Strait occurred after the onset of deep-water circulation through the Fram Strait and it is inferred to be related to the glacial expansion recorded in the area.",

            "abstract": "Frozen-in anisotropic structure in the oceanic lithosphere and faulting/hydration in the upper layer of the slab are expected to play an important role in anisotropic signature of the subducted slab. Over the past several decades, despite the advances in characterizing anisotropy using shear wave splitting method and its developments, the character of slab anisotropy remains poorly understood. In this study we investigate the slab anisotropy using subduction zone guided waves characterized by long path length in the slab. In the southernmost Ryukyu subduction zone, seismic waves from events deeper than 100 km offshore northern Taiwan reveal wave guide behavior: (1) a low-frequency (< 1 Hz) first arrival recognized on vertical and radial components but not transverse component (2) large, sustained high-frequency (3-10 Hz) signal in P and S wave trains. The depth dependent high-frequency content (3-10Hz) confirms the association with a waveguide effect in the subducting slab rather than localized site amplification effects. Using the selected subduction zone guided wave events, we further analyzed the shear wave splitting for intermediate-depth earthquakes in different frequency bands, to provide the statistically meaningful shear wave splitting parameters. We determine shear wave splitting parameters from the 34 PSP guided events that are deeper than 100 km with ray path traveling along the subducted slab. From shear wave splitting analysis, the slab and crust effects reveal consistent polarization pattern of fast directions of EN-WS and delay time of 0.13 - 0.27 sec. This implies that slab anisotropy is stronger than the crust effect (<0.1 s) but weaker than the mantle wedge and sub-slab mantle effect (0.3-1.3 s) in Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "226Ra excesses in mafic arc magmas are generally attributed to recent (< 8 kyr) addition of slab-fluid to the mantle wedge and/or mantle melting. Preservation of 226Ra-230Th disequilibria from such sources requires short crustal residence times (<< 8 kyr) for these magmas. The correlation between 226Ra excesses and 10Be/Be previously observed for magmas from the Chilean Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) contributed to the view that recent slab-fluid additions causes 226Ra excesses in arc magmas1. Our extensive dataset for Llaima and Lonquimay volcanoes (SVZ) shows variations in (226Ra/230Th) for each volcano, and in some cases within single eruptions. These variations span almost the entire SVZ range and question the pertinence of mantle-derived 226Ra-230Th disequilibria models.\nLlaima and Lonquimay volcanoes differ in terms of their petrology and magmatic evolution. Llaima magmas (51 to 55 wt% SiO2) are predominantly crystal-rich and carry conspicuous evidence for magma mixing and AFC processes. 238U and 231Pa excesses and incompatible trace element ratios are correlated and this can be accounted for by up to 20% assimilation of basement plutonic rocks2. Crustal contamination had a secondary influence on 226Ra-230Th disequilibria. Magmas with the highest AFC contribution have 226Ra-230Th close to equilibrium, implying that (226Ra-230Th) are mostly affected by either differentiation on time scales of ~8 kyr, or more likely, mixing with mush bodies several kyr old.\nLonquimay magmas (52 to 64 wt% SiO2) are almost aphyric. Their evolution was controlled by fractional crystallization with limited crustal contamination. (226Ra-230Th) range from moderate 226Ra excesses to small deficits, and are negatively correlated with Ba/Th and MgO. These observations are difficult to reconcile with only slab-fluid addition and mantle melting. We posit that this (226Ra-230Th) range results from diffusive Ra-exchange between young recharge melts and an old crystal mush. A similar process may also explain 226Ra deficits at some other SVZ volcanoes. Thus (226Ra-230Th) in erupted magmas reflect modification of mantle-derived signatures by open-system magmatic processes in the crust.\n1Sigmarsson et al., 2002, Earth and Planet. Sc.

            "abstract": "The management of water is among the most important attributes of urbanization. Provision of sufficient quantities and quality of freshwater, treatment and disposal of wastewater and flood protection are critical for urban sustainability. Over the last century, two major shifts in water management paradigms have occurred, the first to improve public health with the provision of infrastructure for centralized sanitary effluent collection and treatment, and the rapid drainage and routing of stormwater. A current shift in paradigm is now occurring in response to the unintended consequences of sanitary and stormwater management, which have degraded downstream water bodies and shifted flood hazard downstream. Current infrastructure is being designed and implemented to retain, rather than rapidly drain, stormwater, with a focus on infiltration based methods. In urban areas, this amounts to a shift in hydrologic behavior to depression focused recharge.\nWhile stormwater is defined as surface flow resulting from developed areas, an integrated hydrologic systems approach to urban water management requires treatment of the full critical zone. In urban areas this extends from the top of the vegetation and building canopy, to a subsurface depth including natural soils, fill, saprolite and bedrock. In addition to matric and network flow in fracture systems, an urban “karst” includes multiple generations of current and past infrastructure, which has developed extensive subsurface pipe networks for supply and drainage, enhancing surface/groundwater flows and exchange. In this presentation, Band will discuss the need to focus on the urban critical zone, and the development and adaptation of new modeling and analytical approaches to understand and plan green infrastructure based on surface/groundwater/ecosystem interactions, and implications for the restoration and new design of cities.",

            "abstract": "We have studied postseismic deformation of the 23 October 2011, Mw=7.2 Van (E. Turkey) Earthquake associated with reverse faulting on a NE-SW trending and northward dipping fault. Postseismic surface displacements between November 2011 and May 2014 are derived from continuous GPS stations in the far field and survey-type GPS measurements carried out in a geodetic network we established after the earthquake in the near field. Total horizontal displacements 2.5 years after the earthquake reach 30 cm at some sites near the fault. The pattern of GPS displacements suggests that the early postseismic deformation is most probably due to shallow after slip that appears to decrease exponentially with time.\nWe model the GPS measurements using dislocations on triangular planes in a homogenous and elastic half space and Coulomb stress. Elastic dislocation and Coulomb stress modeling indicate that the postseismic deformation can be adequately explained by shallow slip on the coseismic fault and a fault splay on the footwall block, and is likely driven by coseismic stress changes.\nKeywords: 2011 Van earthquake, GPS, postseismic deformation, afterslip, elastic dislocation",

            "abstract": "On young soils developing along the recessional path left by the Skaftafellsjökull glacier, SE-Iceland, we investigated the soil development, vegetation succession and landscape representing an age chronosequence of 120 years. In total, 54 sampling sites were distributed along three moraines representing surfaces exposed for 8, 65 and 120 years. For comparison, soil samples were collected from nearby birch woodlands, representing soils in a mature ecosystem likely to establish on the moraines in the future.\nThe youngest moraines were sparsely vegetated with only 10% cover of mosses and grasses. The plant cover increased to 67% after 120 years, and was characterized by mosses (38%), dwarf shrubs (20%) and low growing birch (3.5%). Consequently, the soil formed over 120 years contained 1.1 kg C m-2 in the surface layer (0-10 cm), or about one third of the 3.2 kg C m-2 in soil under the woodlands. The N stock was estimated at 0.06 kg N m-2after 120 yrs, almost one fourth of that under the woodlands. The data suggest that landscape affects vegetation establishment and in turn, both landscape and vegetation affect soil development. Thus, concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), N and noncrystalline oxalate extractable Al and Fe were higher within depressions than on ridges and slopes.\nThe comparison of SOC stock in the moraine-derived soils with that under the birch woodlands showed that the young proglacial soils still have a large potential to accrete SOC within the developing pedosphere. With the observed accrual rate of 9.1 g C m-2 yr-1in the top 10 cm, it may take the moraine soils an additional 220 yrs to accrue SOC stocks comparable with those under the birch forest. Given the fact that all Icelandic glaciers are receding, assessing SOC sequestration in new soil formation may be important to off-setting some of anthropogenic emissions.\nThe research is funded by the University of Iceland Doctoral Fund, the University of Iceland Trust Fund, the Landsvirkjun‘s Energy Research Fund, the Friends of Vatnajökull Fund, the Icelandic Research Fund (no. 120211021) and Targeted Investment in Excellence, Climate, Water and Carbon Project, C-MASC, OSU, USA.\nKeywords: Soil organic carbon, nitrogen, soil development, chronosequence, plant colonization, vegetation succession, glacier forefield, Skaftafellsjökull, Iceland.",

Here I mention just two initiatives: NARS, which was the first digital, mobile network of broadband stations deployed in western Europe (1983-1987), and USarray (2003- ), which is the biggest program of recent times. Presently, innovative data acquisition systems for the oceans are underway and they will allow future imaging of the \"inaccessible\" parts of the Earth.\n(2) In the 1980s seismological data centers were set up to facilitate data archiving and distribution. Since then, open data exchange (not a matter of course) and easy data retrieval have become standard. The impact of this has been phenomenal: most observational studies efficiently retrieve data from these main seismological data centers and the archived seismograms are used for various types of studies, carried out by different persons and groups.\n(3) Seismic tomography changed the face of seismological research. From travel time to waveform tomography, from ray theory to finite frequency tomography: new and improved tomographic techniques greatly enhanced our images (and understanding) of the Earth's interior.\n(4) Many of these developments would not have been possible without young, motivated, seismologists that were educated and stimulated by insightful supervisors.\nOne person has had a major impact on all these fields.

The study is carried out numerically with LES. The numerics are carefully designed to ensure all global conservation laws, proper boundary conditions and a minimal range of dissipation scales. The turbulence dramatically differs from the classical bi-periodic case. Boundary layer separations lead to creation of many small vortices and act as a continuing energy source exciting the inverse cascade of energy throughout the domain. The detachments are very intermittent in time. In free decay, the final state depends on the effective numerical resolution: laminar with a single dominant vortex for low Re and turbulent with many vortices for large enough Re. After very long time, the turbulent end-state exhibits a striking tendency for the emergence of shielded vortices which then interact almost elastically. In the forced case, the boundary layers allow the turbulence to reach a statistical steady state without any artificial hypo-viscosity or other large-scale dissipation. Implications are discussed for the oceanic mesoscale and submesoscale turbulence.",

Comparison between the Betula pollen percentages and Betula pollen influx in the core show a different trend between the two methods of data presentation, particularly after birch forest has been established.\nBoth methods show expansion of dwarf birch (Betula nana) dominated shrub heath during the early Holocene. The appearance of downy birch (Betula pubescens) woodland and subsequent decline is also represented by both methods and is supported by the macrofossil record.\nThe expansion of birch forest during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) is seen from high influx values of more than 2400 Betula grains cm-2 year-1 and Betula percentages above 80%. The influx decreases significantly at ca. 6600 cal. yr. BP and drops to less than 2000 Betula grains cm-2 year-1, decreasing upwards in the core. Betula percentage values become more variable and drop slightly at the same time, but not as prominently as the influx values.\nThe terrestrial response recorded in the Betula pollen influx corresponds to changes apparent in marine cores from Húnaflói bay, and signifies a sensitivity of the Holocene terrestrial ecosystem to climate fluctuations. Betula pollen influx is potentially a sensitive proxy for temperature changes in Iceland and should be included in future palynological studies in order to improve the interpretation of Holocene vegetation and climate changes.\nThe study is funded by the Eimskip University fund, University of Iceland Research Fund, Landsvirkjun’s Energy Research Fund, and the Icelandic Centre for Research (grant no.141842-051).",

            "abstract": "Few areas in Iceland were as vulnerable to climate changes during the 19th century as the region south of Vatnajökull glacier. The region was repeatedly affected by glacier advance and jökulhlaups (glacier outburst floods) during the Little Ice Age AD 1300-1900 (LIA). The land area between the glacier and the coast was occupied by farming community. The aim of this research is to quantify and map the size of lost vegetated area in the 19th century during the glacial advance in the climax of the LIA and the impact these events had on the community, land-use, ownership, value of estates and livelihood.\nThis research employs historical written sources to investigate changes in the cultural and natural landscape. Historical data and field observations will be collected and stored in a GIS database designed for the research, allowing data to be analyzed and presented on maps.\nThe first recorded impact on the settlement is from 1794 when the Breiðármerkurjökull outlet glacier advanced and devastated pastures and crofts belonging in west of the district. Seventy five years later, in 1868, the largest estate was completely destroyed by a jökulhlaup. In 1829 a farm site in the middle of the district was moved due to repeated jökulhlaup. The outlet glacier Brókarjökull initiated annual jökulhlaups during 1820 -1870, devastating pastures and hayfields and woodlands of a total of 3 prominent estates in the area (by 1200 ha), causing devaluation of 33-66% on these estates. In the eastern part extensive jökulhlaups changed the glacial river channel causing the river to flow over vast area devastating 80 % of the eastern most estate causing its abandonment in 1892. The climate change and accompanied hazards during the 19th century changed the landscape of the Suðursveit district significantly. By the turn of the 20thcentury the vegetated land in the district had been reduced by 35% and areas of sediments increased by 25% and glaciated area increased by 10%. These changes had severe impact on the farming society, people’s livelihood and the value of estates.\nThe project is funded by the Vinir Vatnajökull fund, Rannís fund (no: 120211021), Landsvirkjun Power Energy fund, the Kvískerfund, and the doctoral grants of the University of Iceland Research Fund",

Generally, non availability of field data calls for techniques based on remote observations. Soil Conservation Services Curve Number (SCS CN) method is an important method which utilizes information generated from remote sensing for estimation of runoff. Several attempts have been made to validate the runoff values generated from SCS CN method by comparing the results obtained from other methods. In the present study, runoff estimation through SCS CN method has been performed using IRS LISS IV data for the Venna Basin situated in the Central India. The field data was available for Venna Basin. The Land use/land cover and soil layers have been generated for the entire watershed using the satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS). The Venna basin have been divided into intercepted catchment and free catchment. Run off values have been estimated using field data through regression analysis. The runoff values estimated using SCS CN method have been compared with yield values generated using data collected from the tank gauge stations and data from the discharge stations. The correlation helps in validation of the results obtained from the SCS CN method and its applicability in Indian conditions.\nKey Words: SCS CN Method, Regression Analysis, Land Use / Land cover, Runoff, Remote Sensing, GIS.",

            "abstract": "Ferropericlase (Fp) is believed to be the second most abundant phase in the lower mantle. Since the discovery of the high spin (HS) to low spin (LS) crossover in iron in Fp [1], this phenomenon has been investigated extensively experimentally and theoretically. This is a broad and smooth crossover that takes place throughout most of the lower mantle and does not produce an obvious signature in radial velocity or density profiles [2]. Therefore, the spin transition has been generally considered to be invisible to seismic waves. This study, however, shows that it can produce a peculiar effect on lateral velocity heterogeneities at certain depths[3]. Deciphering the origin of seismic velocity heterogeneities in the mantle is crucial to understanding internal structures and processes at work in the Earth. The spin crossover in iron introduces unfamiliar effects on seismic velocities. First principles calculations indicate that anti-correlation between shear velocity (VS) and bulk sound velocity (Vφ) in the mantle, usually interpreted as compositional heterogeneity, can also be produced in homogeneous aggregates containing Fp. The spin crossover also suppresses thermally induced heterogeneity in VP but not in VS. This effect is observed in tomographic models at conditions where the spin crossover in Fp is expected in the lower mantle. In addition, the one-of-a-kind signature of this spin crossover in the RS/P () heterogeneity ratio might be a useful “fingerprint” to detect the presence of Fp in the lower mantle.\n[1] Badro J, et al.

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the vegetation height for a forested region is often used as a proxy for stem volume, biomass, and for characterizing habitats of a variety of plant and animal species. For this reason, remote sensing measures available from stereography, lidar, and InSAR have been important tools for airborne and spaceborne platforms. Among these and other candidates for measuring vegetation heights, InSAR has the advantage of achieving wide coverage areas (on the order of 100 km in cross-track swath) over short time periods, thus making it practical for large-scale assessments of the global environment.\nThe determination of forest stand height (FSH), which is an assessment made on the order of one to ten hectares of resolution, InSAR can provide measures that are proportional to FSH. These are: 1.) interferometric phase compared to a known DEM, preferably of the bald earth, 2.) interferometric correlation (polarimetric or otherwise), which is related to the volume scattering nature of the target, and 3.) interferometric correlation which is related to the temporal decorrelation of the target. Of these, while the volumetric aspect of interferometric correlation is of keen interest, because of the dominant error source of temporal decorrelation, it comes at the cost of the need to perform single-pass interferometry. While such satellite systems do exist (notably the TanDEM-X mission), for vegetation applications, lower frequency systems such as ALOS-1 and -2, and the future NASA radar mission at L-band, provides better signal returns from throughout the vegetation canopy. Hence, rather than relying on volumetric correlation to provide the desired FSH signature, repeat-pass observations of temporal decorrelation are coupled with a vegetation model for this decorrelation to determine the vegetation height.\nIn order to demonstrate this technique, the University of Massachusetts has used 46-day repeat-pass ALOS data to estimate FSH over the US State of Maine, nearly a 10 million hectare region. The results have been validated using the LVIS lidar system and a map of vegetation height provided by Woods Hole Research Center. This talk will describe the process that was used for creating this map, and how the data processing was automated to account for differences in temporal decorrelation over this large study area.",

Some Shaivite temples perform Sahasra Ghatabhishekam (pouring of thousand pots of water, about 15000 L). However, the pollution caused by Abhishekam is minimal. Hindus cremate their dead and immerse the ashes in the waters of perennial rivers, the most preferred being the sacred waters of the Ganga. It has been estimated that 15,000 tonnes/year of cremation ash is immersed in the Ganga. Apart from these 140 to 250 tonnes of half burned corpses are dumped in the Ganges per year. There are 500 million people living in the catchment area of the Ganga, and that number is increasing. While there may be no objection from the public in regard to the cleansing of about 5.8 ×105 million liters of chemical wastes per year, the control of cremation ashes in the Ganga is for more difficult to achieve because of the sentiment. It is urgently necessary that pollution including cultural pollution of Ganges, is drastically reduced.

            "abstract": "We demonstrate (I,II) an approach to find reconnection sites in 3D where there is no flux function for guidance, and where local observational signatures for the ``violation of frozen flux’’ are under developed, if not non-existent. We use 2D and 3D PIC simulations of asymmetric guide field reconnection to test our observational hierarchy of single spacecraft kinetic diagnostics - all possible with present state of the art instrumentation. The proliferation of turbulent, electron inertial scale layers in the realistic 3D case demonstrates that electron demagnetization, while necessary, is not sufficient to identify reconnection sites. An excellent local, observable, single spacecraft proxy is demonstrated for the size of the theoretical frozen flux violation. Since even frozen flux violations need not imply reconnection is at hand, a new calibrated dimensionless method is used to determine the importance of such violations. This measure is available in 2D and 3D to help differentiate reconnection layers from weaker frozen flux violating layers. We discuss the possibility that this technique can be implemented on MMS. A technique to highlight flow geometries conducive to reconnection in 3D simulations is also suggested, that may also be implementable with the MMS flotilla. We use local analysis with multiple necessary, but theoretically independent electron kinetic conditions to help reduce the probability of misidentification of any given layer as a reconnection site. Since these local conditions are all necessary for the site, but none is known to be sufficient, the multiple tests help to greatly reduce false positive identifications. The selectivity of the results of this approach using PIC simulations of 3D asymmetric guide field reconnection will be shown using varying numbers of simultaneous conditions.\nScudder, J.D., H.

            "abstract": "Ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O is thought to be the second most abundant mineral in Earth’s lower mantle. Due to its potentially weak rheological behavior it may play a key role in controlling rheology of the lower mantle and in generating seismic anisotropy [1]. At pressures between approximately 40 GPa and 70 GPa at 300 K, the ferrous iron in ferropericlase undergoes a spin crossover from high-spin to low-spin state [2]. Our understanding of the deformation behavior of both high- and low-spin ferropericlase is incomplete, particularly at high-temperatures. The only published deformation study on (Mg,Fe)O through the spin transition pressure region has limited pressure resolution and was measured at 300 K [3].\nHere, we present new results from synchrotron radial x-ray diffraction measurements on the deformation behavior of (Mg,Fe)O at high-pressures, covering the spin crossover pressure range, and high-temperatures. One set of experiments was performed on (Mg0.8-0.9Fe0.1-0.2)O at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) up to 96 GPa at 300 K. A second suite of data were collected at the Extreme Conditions Beamline of PETRA III (DESY), where (Mg0.8Fe0.2)O was compressed at constant temperature to 70 GPa (at 850 K) and 40 GPa (at 1150 K). In all experiments, pressure was remotely increased using a gas membrane system, which allows for obtaining a very fine pressure resolution.\nFrom our data, we calculate the yield strength of ferropericlase, which we find to increase by a factor of about three throughout the lower mantle. Furthermore, we infer likely slip system activities of ferropericlase in Earth’s lower mantle based on our experimental data and elastic viscoplastic self-consistent (EVPSC) modelling. We will discuss the effect of the increase of ferropericlase strength on the fate of subducting slabs and we will show potential implications for seismic anisotropy observations in D``, where low-spin ferropericlase is characterized by very large elastic anisotropy [4].\n1.

            "abstract": "The coupling of the land with the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on diurnal timescales is critical to regulating the strength of the connection between soil moisture and precipitation. To improve our understanding of land-atmosphere (L-A) interactions, recent studies have focused on the development of diagnostics to quantify the strength and accuracy of the land-PBL coupling at the process-level. In this paper, we apply a suite of local land-atmosphere coupling (LoCo) metrics to modern reanalysis (RA) products and observations during a 17-year period over the U. S. Southern Great Plains. Specifically, a range of diagnostics exploring the links between soil moisture, evaporation, PBL height, temperature, humidity, and precipitation are applied to the summertime monthly mean diurnal cycles of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). Results show that CFSR is the driest and MERRA the wettest of the three RAs in terms of overall surface-PBL coupling. When compared against observations, CFSR has a significant dry bias that impacts all components of the land-PBL system. CFSR and NARR are more similar in terms of PBL dynamics and response to dry and wet extremes, while MERRA is more constrained in terms of evaporation and PBL variability. The implications for moist processes are also discussed, which warrants further investigation into the potential downstream impacts of land-PBL coupling on the diurnal cycle of clouds, convection, and precipitation. Lastly, the results are put into context of community investigations into drought assessment and predictability over the region and underscore that caution should be used when treating RAs as truth, as the coupled water and energy cycle representation in each can vary considerably.",

We examine September to November 2006 over the tropics. El Nino-induced dry conditions over western Indonesia led to extensive biomass burning and persistent CO greater than 200 ppb in the upper troposphere. This was one of the highest CO episodes over the MLS period since 2004. We show how improvements in the vertical resolution of trace gas retrievals can help to distinguish between errors in parameterized vertical transport and biases in bottom-up emissions estimates.\nWe simulate the episode using the NASA GISS ModelE2 coupled composition-climate model with different subgrid physics for small ensembles of experiments with perturbed initial conditions. The starting point is the CMIP5 version of the model, in which there was a pronounced vertical CO dipole over the Maritime Continent, but with a CO peak 100 ppb higher than Aura CO in the upper troposphere. With modified cumulus and boundary layer parameterizations, but the same prescribed biomass burning emissions estimates, the upper tropospheric CO bias is significantly reduced. Concurrently, precipitation over the emissions source region is reduced relative to observational estimates, leading to better consistency with the dry conditions under which the burning occurred. We discuss the effects of the physics changes on the roles of convective frequency and depth in reducing the bias.",

However, robust assessment of the relative timing of the climate change is often very challenging because correlation of the climatic archives from different regions often has inevitable uncertainties. Greenland and Cariaco basin, for example, provide two of the most frequently sited palaeoclimatic proxy data representative of the high- and low-latitudinal Atlantic regions. However, robust correlation of the records from those regions is difficult because of the uncertainties in layer countings, lack of the radiocarbon age control from ice cores, marine reservoir age of the Cariaco sediments, and the absence of the tephra layers shared by both cites. Similarly, Speleothem and ice core records are not robustly correlated to each other, either for the dead carbon fraction in the speleothems and lack of reliable correlation markers. The generally accepted hypothesis of synchronous climate change between China and the Greenland is, therefore, essentially hypothetical.\nLake Suigetsu provides solution to this problem. The lake Suigetsu chronology is supposed to be coherent to the speleothems' U-Th age scale. Suigetsu's semi-continuous radiocarbon dataset, which constitutes major component of the IntCal13 radiocarbon calibration model, also provides opportunity to correlate lake Suigetsu and the Greenland and Antarctic ice cores using cosmogenic isotopes as the correlation key. Results of the correlation and timing comparison, which cast new lights to the mechanism of the monsoon change, will be presented.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 313 (New Jersey shallow shelf) cored a 3-hole transect across Miocene seismic clinothems (prograding sigmoidal sequences) in topset, foreset, and bottomset locations, providing an opportunity to integrate seismic, log, and core data into a sequence stratigraphic framework. We recognize sequence boundaries (SB), stratal surfaces, and systems tracts on seismic profiles by reflector terminations and independently in the cores by integrating studies of core surfaces, facies successions, facies stacking patterns, benthic foraminiferal water depth changes, downhole and core logs, and chronostratigraphic ages. Sampling of the foresets, where the sequences are thickest, allows us to evaluate sequence stratigraphic models. We link seismic SB to impedance contrasts, as suggested by long-held tenants of sequence stratigraphy. Transgressive surfaces (TS) and SB are merged in the topsets, and are overlain by deepening/fining upward transgressive systems tracts (TST) and coarsening/shallowing upward highstand systems tracts (HST). Drilling through the foresets yields thin lowstand systems tracts (LST), thin TST, and thick HST, contrasting with previously published seismic stratigraphic predictions of thick LST and thin to absent TST. TS are recognized by upsection changes from coarsening to fining upward, and Maximum Flooding Surfaces by changes from fining to coarsening upward successions. Despite challenges posed by shallow-water sediments, we derive a chronology using integrated Sr-isotopic and bio- stratigraphy (calcareous nannoplankton, diatoms, and dinocysts), with typical age resolution of ±0.5 Myr. We find little evidence for correlative conformities on the paleoshelf. We do not resolve the issue of fractal versus hierarchical order, but our data are consistent with arrangement into orders based on Milankovitch forcing on scales driven by eccentricity (400, 100 kyr) and obliquity (1.2 Myr). Sequences are generally 1.2 Myr in duration, but sequence m5.4 (17.7-16.5 Ma) is a composite of three 100-400 kyr-scale sequences. Sequences on the New Jersey shallow shelf were preserved during times when benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotopic variations were dominated by 100 kyr cycles, but tend to be eroded away during 41 kyr-dominated worlds.",

            "abstract": "Coarse particles are transported in a river as bed load, i.e., they move in frequent contact with and are supported by the granular bed. This movement is typically intermittent and may be described by a series of steps are rests, the distributions of which determine particle dispersion. Laboratory and field studies of bed load tracer dispersion have reported sub- and super-diffusive behavior, both of which have been successfully reproduced with stochastic transport models. Although researchers have invoked heavy-tailed step lengths as the cause of anomalous dispersion, most observations report thin-tailed distributions. Little attention has been paid to rest periods, and stochastic transport models have not been connected to the underlying mechanics of particle motion. Based on theoretical and experimental evidence, we argue that step lengths are thin-tailed and do not control the longterm dispersion of bed load tracers; they are determined by momentum balance between the fluid and solid. Using laboratory experiments with both marbles and natural sediments, we demonstrate that the rest time distribution is power law, and argue that this distribution controls asymptotic dispersion. Observed rest times far exceed any hydrodynamic timescale. Experiments reveal that rest times of deposited particles are governed by fluctuations in river bed elevation; in particular, the return time for the bed to scour to the base of a deposited particle. Stochastic fluctuations in bed elevation are describable by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (mean-reverting random walk) model that contains two parameters, which we show are directly related to the granular shear rate and range of bed elevation fluctuations, respectively. Combining these results with the theory of asymmetric random walks (particles only move downstream), we predict superdiffusive behavior that is in quantitative agreement with our observations of tracer dispersion in a natural river.",

            "abstract": "Arsenic is a ubiquitous element in soils worldwide and has the potential to negatively impact human and ecosystem health under certain biogeochemical conditions. While arsenic is relatively immobile in most oxidized soils due to a high affinity for soil solids, arsenic becomes mobilized under reduced soil conditions due to the reductive dissolution of iron(III) oxides thereby releasing soil-bound arsenic. Since arsenic is a well-known carcinogen, this plant-soil process has the potential to negatively impact the lives of billions of rice consumers worldwide upon plant uptake and grain storage of released arsenic. Moreover, arsenic uptake by rice is excacerbated by the use of As-laden groundwater for rice irrigation.\nOne proposed strategy to decrease arsenic uptake by rice plants is via an increase in dissolved silicon in paddy soil solution (pore-water), since silicic acid and arsenous acid share an uptake pathway. However, several soil processes that influence arsenic cycling may be affected by silicon including desorption from bulk soil, formation and mineralogy of iron(III) oxide plaque, and adsorption/desorption onto/from iron plaque; the effect of silicon on these soil processes will ultimately dictate the effectiveness of altered dissolved silicon in decreasing arsenic uptake at the root, which in turn dictates the concentration of arsenic found in grains. Furthermore, the source of silicon may impact carbon cycling and, in particular, methane emissions.\nHere, impacts of altered dissolved silicon on processes that affect rhizospheric biogeochemical cycling of arsenic and subsequent plant-uptake, and how it influences other biogeochemical cycles such as carbon and iron are investigated. We show that silicon can decrease arsenic uptake and grain storage under certain conditions, and that altered silicon affects the type of iron (III) oxide that comprises iron plaque.",

            "abstract": "Reconstruction of the large-scale magnetospheric current systems from data has long been based on ad hoc assumptions regarding their spatial structure. A dramatic increase of amount of data provided by space-borne magnetometers from geosynchronous satellites, IMP 8, Geotail, Polar, Cluster, THEMIS, and Van Allen Probes missions enabled the development of a new approach to empirical geomagnetic field modeling. In this approach the custom-tailored modules prescribing the configuration of magnetospheric current systems were replaced by basis function expansions making the model structure free from previous a priori constraints. The new approach reveals a complex structure of the magnetospheric current systems and, in particular, their substantial dawn-dusk asymmetry during magnetic storms. This includes the formation of the hook-shaped current in the main phase, the double partial ring current near the Sym-H minimum, ring current erosion, and near-magnetopause eastward current in the pre-noon sector. With the help of data from the Van Allen Probes mission, the highest-resolution empirical models have resolved the eastward current in the innermost magnetosphere and its local-time asymmetry, including the so-called banana-current structures. At the same time, the increase of the number of degrees of freedom of the empirical model in the description of field-aligned currents has shown that the hook-shaped equatorial current corresponds to the spiral structure of the large-scale upward Birkeland currents, which can now be resolved in detail by AMPERE.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism of the reconnection onset in planetary magnetotails has been a topic of hot debate for more than three decades. At the kinetic level of description the key problem is a seemingly universal stability of the collisionless tearing mode when electrons are magnetized by the magnetic field normal to the current sheet. This effect can be eliminated in 2D equilibria with magnetic flux accumulated at the anti-sunward end of the tail. However, the resulting instability seen in 2D PIC simulations with open boundaries differs from the classical tearing mode because its main effect is the formation of dipolarization fronts, i. e., regions of an enhanced normal magnetic field rather than the reversal of its sign. Strong tailward gradients of the normal magnetic field characteristic of fronts suggest that they can be destroyed in 3D by buoyancy and flapping instabilities. However, 3D PIC simulations show that buoyancy and flapping motions can neither destroy nor change critically the near-2D picture of the front evolution, although they do significantly disturb it. Modeling and understanding of this kinetic picture of the reconnection onset in MHD terms is critically important for incorporating the explosive reconnection physics into global models of the magnetosphere and solar corona. A key to this has become the recognition that tail current sheets with accumulated flux regions can also be unstable with respect to an ideal analog of the tearing mode, which has a similar structure of the electromagnetic field and plasma perturbations but preserves the original magnetic field topology. MHD simulations with high Lundquist number confirm the existence of such “pseudo-tearing” instability regimes. Non-MHD effects, including different motions of electron and ion species as well as the ion Landau dissipation transform these ideal MHD motions into the tearing/slippage instability obtained in PIC simulations.",

Several recent studies on the accuracy of sonic anemometer measurements indicate that non-orthogonal sonic anemometers used in eddy covariance studies underestimate the vertical wind speed. It has been suggested that this underestimation is caused by flow distortion from the interference of the structure of the anemometer itself on the flow. When oriented ideally with respect to the horizontal wind direction, orthogonal sonic anemometers that measure the vertical wind speed with a single vertically-oriented acoustic path may measure the vertical wind speed more accurately in typical surface-layer conditions. For non-orthogonal sonic anemometers, Horst et al. (2014) proposed that transducer shadowing may be a dominant factor in sonic flow distortion. As the ratio of sonic transducer diameter to path length and the zenith angle of the three transducer paths decrease, the effects of transducer shadowing on measurements of vertical velocity will decrease. An overview of this research and some of the methods available to correct historical data will be presented.",

Impacts are exacerbated by intensified cyclones, sea level rise and storm surges. In this regard, many farmers in the populous Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta of Bangladesh have adopted saline shrimp (Bagda) farming with associated displacement of tenant farmers and potential long term damage to the soil through chemicals used to enhance shrimp production. Despite the impact of salinity intrusion on the environment and the commonly perceived effects of shrimp farming on poverty, there has not been any systematic study that examines the associative relationships between salinisation, shrimp farming and poverty in this delta region. Using the 2011 Bangladesh Population and Housing Census and 2010 LandSat remote sensing data this study examines the spatially explicit impact of salinization as well as saline and freshwater shrimp farming on poverty in the Delta, accounting for important environmental and socio-economic predictors. The findings shows that after accounting for important environmental and socioeconomic predictors, levels and intensities of salinization as well as the extent of saline and freshwater shrimp farming in a union are significantly associated with poverty. The results of the study demonstrate that increases in levels and intensities of salinity increases the probability of a union being in the poorest quintile. As such saline water shrimp farming has the potential to reduce poverty only at high intensities, whilst low levels of freshwater shrimp farming are associated with a reduction in poverty.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial and airborne laser scanning of snow has significantly increased our ability to improve our understanding of the spatial variability of snow depth. However, methods to provide corresponding datasets of snow water equivalent of similar quality are unavailable to date. Similar to laser scan technology, ground penetration radar (GPR) has become more accessible to snow researchers and is currently successfully used in the context of snow hydrological studies.\nGPR systems can be used and set up in different ways to measure snow properties. In this study we elaborate on a mobile GPR system that allows simultaneous estimation of snow depth, density, water equivalent in a snow survey setting. For this purpose we have built a GPR platform around a sledge system with four antenna pairs set up as a common-mid-point array and a separate fifth antenna pair dedicated to analyze the frequency change of the radar signal when propagating through the snowpack. Liquid water content can be accounted for by assessing the frequency dependent attenuation of the radar signal.\nWe will present data from field campaigns that were carried out in 2013 and 2014 to test the ability of our GPR system to estimate snow bulk properties along several test transects. Along with the results, we will discuss system configuration and post-processing issues.",

            "abstract": "Piñon-juniper woodlands constitute a large proportion of land area of the southwestern United States and may be highly susceptible to climate change. These ecosystems have experienced widespread tree mortality during regional drought events over the past 100 years, and piñon pines have been especially affected by these events. Climate change projections for the southwestern US call for greater temperature-driven aridity, but the potential effects of winter climate change are unclear. Based on recent research that suggests winter climate anomalies may influence growing season productivity in many semiarid systems, we explored the potential for winter climate change to influence piñon-juniper woodlands in the coming 50 years. We developed a low-dimensional ecohydrological model of lowland and upland piñon-juniper tree stands in northern New Mexico, USA, and simulated the probabilistic response of ecosystem water availability, surface conditions, and water and carbon flux dynamics to climate change projections of increased temperature (+1.6 °C) and decreased winter precipitation (-0.11 mm month-1). The climate change scenario reduced average winter snowcover, decreased surface albedo, increased net radiation, and altered the timing of spring evaporation (E) towards earlier dates. Lowland piñon and juniper trees experienced small reductions in transpiration (T) and carbon assimilation (A), and upland sites experienced small but relatively larger reductions in T and A, as well as relatively higher daily variance in soil moisture (θ) and E. The peak of spring T occurred on average 6 days earlier in lowland and 10 days earlier in upland simulations. The timing of A shifted towards earlier March dates for both lowland and upland, and A was reduced during April and May. Upland piñon pines experienced greater proportional reductions in T and A than junipers. Our results suggest that winter climate change will promote an earlier growing season in piñon-juniper woodlands, will increase variance in θ and E, and will have greater negative impacts in upland compared to lowland sites, and on piñon compared to juniper trees. Earlier growing season onset lengthened and intensified the late spring dry period in April and May, and we hypothesize that this trend may also amplify the effects of early summer drought events.",

            "abstract": "While the interface between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere is often shown in textbooks as a schematically simple boundary, its existence in reality is considerably more complex, with debate existing over the physical and chemical properties that differentiate the overriding, rigid lithosphere from the convecting mantle below. Despite these uncertainties, receiver function analysis shows us that lateral variations in seismic properties (e.g., depth and velocity gradient) exist. These differences are often well-correlated with the tectonic age of the lithosphere, indicating that the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) evolves with time.\nIn our presentation we will outline our work to image the LAB and other lithospheric structure with Sp receiver functions beneath continental North America. In portions of the tectonically active western U.S., detailed 3D imaging reveals a well-defined negative phase at depths of ~50-100 km, consistent with surface wave estimates of LAB depth. Modeling indicates that LAB velocity gradient in these regions is too large to be a function of temperature change alone and that changing composition, water or melt content is also needed. In contrast, there is a dearth of Sp receiver function phase energy present at depths appropriate to the transition from lithosphere to asthenosphere beneath many regions of stable continental interior. Where present, the LAB phase is considerably weaker than in tectonically active regions. A weak or absent phase can be explained through thermal changes alone, although other mechanisms cannot be ruled out. In the stable continental regions we also commonly detect one or more mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs). The observation of such a phase is relatively new, and may be a globally present feature in older continental lithosphere. The MLD in our work appears as both a single phase as well as multiple discrete phases. At the global and regional scale the depth of the MLD, and the LAB in tectonically active regions, is often similar, leading to speculation about the relationship between the two. We will briefly examine possible causes for the MLD, include thermal, compositional and anisotropic effects. We then place these results in the context of the spatial and temporal evolution of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary system.",

Using a novel diagnostic technique, the phase speed, vertical tilting, and form stress of equatorial waves in the stratosphere are obtained continuously on daily basis. The results indicate that on top of a weak-amplitude annual cycle signal, all of these wave properties have a pronounced QBO signal with a downward propagation that evolves continuously together with the background QBO. Our analysis also highlights the potential role of wave-induced form stress in driving the QBO regime change.\nWe find that the dominant waves in the equatorial stratosphere propagate very slowly relative to the ground at all times, implying that their observed intrinsic phase speed evolution follows the background QBO nearly exactly but with opposite sign, as the established theory predicts. By revealing the continuous evolution of the form stress associated with the vertically tilted waves, the new diagnostic method also demonstrates the dominance of eastward-tilted eastward-propagating waves contributing to a deceleration of easterly flow at high altitudes, which causes a downward propagation of the easterly flow signal. Similarly, the dominance of westward-tilted westward-propagating waves acts to reverse westerly flow to easterly flow and causes a downward propagation of westerly flow signal. Our results suggest that in addition to the wave-breaking processes, such continuously alternating downward transfer of westerly and easterly angular momentum by westward-tilted westward-propagating waves and eastward-tilted eastward-propagating waves contributes to the wave-mean flow interaction mechanism for the QBO.",

            "abstract": "Changing winds over the Southern Ocean have had dramatic impacts on Antarctic sea ice extent, anthropogenic heat and carbon uptake by the ocean, and the contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global sea level rise. An overall intensification of the surface westerly winds has been attributed to several different forcings, including stratospheric ozone depletion, greenhouse gasses, and tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs). However, the relative roles of these drivers have not been well quantified. Reconciling previous explanations, here we show that a combination of tropical SSTs and stratospheric ozone loss largely explains the magnitude, regional patterns, and seasonality of observed lower tropospheric zonal wind trends over the Southern Ocean. We evaluate multiple ensembles of atmospheric model simulations, with each ensemble forced by one or a combination of drivers. Considering all months of the year, tropical SSTs are the largest contributor to observed zonal wind trends over 40°S-80°S. In austral summer, tropical SSTs and stratospheric ozone loss have contributed approximately equally to near-surface wind trends. The tropical contribution in austral summer is associated with tropics-wide warming, which has been moderated in recent decades by a prevalence of La-Niña events. The relative phasing of natural variability with anthropogenic forcing is therefore essential for understanding and predicting Southern Ocean climate change.",

Based on the linearized approximation, the idealized case of constant mean sea depth and Brunt-Vaisala\nfrequency is considered. The depth fluctuation is assumed to be a stationary random function of space characterized by small amplitude and correlation length comparable to the typical wavelength. For both one- and two-dimensional topography the effects of scattering on wave phase over long distances are derived explicitly by the method of multiple scales. For one-dimensional topography, numerical results are compared with Buhler-& Holmes-Cerfon(2011) computed by the method of characteristics. For two-dimensional topography, new results are presented for both statistically isotropic and anisotropic cases.\nIn thi talk we shall apply the perturbation technique of multiple scales to treat analytically the random scattering of internal tides by gently sloped bathymetric irregularities.\nThe basic assumptions are: incompressible fluid, infinitestimal wave amplitudes, constant Brunt-Vaisala frequency, and constant mean depth. In addition, the depth disorder is assumed to be a stationary random function of space with zero mean and small root-mean-square amplitude. The correlation length can be comparable in order of magnitude as the dominant wavelength. Both one- and two-dimensional disorder will be considered. Physical effects of random scattering on the mean wave phase i.e., spatial attenuation and wavenumber shift will be calculated and discussed for one mode of incident wave. For two dimensional topographies, statistically isotropic and anisotropic examples will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Subduction interfaces that produce great earthquakes are often said to be “strongly coupled”, and those that creep are said to be “weakly coupled”. However, the relation between the strength and seismogenic behavior of subduction faults is far from clear. Seismological and geodetic observations of earthquake rupture usually provide information only on stress change, not fault strength. In this study, we infer fault strength by calculating frictional heating along megathrusts and comparing results with heat flow measurements. We find that stick-slip megathrusts that have produced great earthquakes such as at Japan Trench and northern Sumatra have very low apparent friction coefficients (~ 0.02 – 0.03), but megathrusts that creep such as at Northern Hikurangi and Manila Trench have higher values (up to ~0.13). The differnce cannot be explained by coseismic dynamic weakening of the stick-slip megathrusts, because the average stress drop in great earthquakes is usually less than 5 MPa, equivalent to a coseismic reduction of apparent friction coefficient by less than ~0.01. Therefore our results indicate differences in the static strength of different subduction faults. Why are the creeping faults stronger? We think it is related to their creeping mechanism. Very rugged subducting seafloor tends to cause creep and hinder great earthquake rupture (Wang and Bilek, 2014). In contrast, all giant earthquakes have occurred at subduction zones with relatively smooth subducting seafloor. Large geometrical irregularities such as seamounts generate heterogeneous structure and stresses that promote numerous small and medium size earthquakes and aseismic creep. The creeping is a process of breaking and wearing of geometrical irregularities in a deformation zone and is expected to be against relatively large resistance (strong creep). This is different from the creeping of smooth faults due to the presence of weak fault gouge (weak creep) such as along the creeping segment of the San Andreas fault. The general correlation between subducting seafloor ruggedness, creeping, and greater heat dissipation, if further verified, provides a new perspective in assessing earthquake and tsunami hazards for risk mitigation.\nWang, K., and S.

            "abstract": "Weather-based index insurance projects are rapidly expanding across the developing world. Many of these projects use satellite-based observations to detect extreme weather events, which inform and trigger payouts to smallholder farmers. While most index insurance programs use precipitation measurements to determine payouts, the use of remotely sensed observations of vegetation is currently being explored. In order to use vegetation indices as a basis for payouts, it is necessary to establish a consistent relationship between the vegetation index and the health and abundance of agriculture on the ground. The accuracy with which remotely sensed vegetation indices can detect changes in agriculture depends on both the spatial scale of the agriculture and the spatial resolution of the sensor. This study analyzes the relationship between meter and decameter scale vegetation fraction estimates derived from linear spectral mixture models with a more commonly used vegetation index (NDVI, EVI) at hectometer spatial scales. In addition, the analysis incorporates land cover/land use field observations collected in Tigray Ethiopia in July 2013. . It also tests the flexibility and utility of a standardized spectral mixture model in which land cover is represented as continuous fields of rock and soil substrate (S), vegetation (V) and dark surfaces (D; water, shadow). This analysis found strong linear relationships with vegetation metrics at 1.6-meter, 30-meter and 250-meter resolutions across spectrally diverse subsets of Tigray, Ethiopia and significantly correlated relationships using the Spearman’s rho statistic. The observed linear scaling has positive implications for future use of moderate resolution vegetation indices in similar landscapes; especially index insurance projects that are scaling up across the developing world using remotely-sensed environmental information.",

            "abstract": "Recent experimental and theoretical studies on the lower-mantle ferropericlase have demonstrated that its physical and chemical properties can be affected by the spin transition, which in turn can affect our understanding of deep-Earth seismic structures, geochemistry, and geodynamics. The sound velocities of ferropericlase at lower-mantle pressures have been reported using various techniques including Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS), Impulsive Stimulate Light Scattering (ISS), Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS), and Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering [1,2,3]. However, the compressional wave and shear wave velocities have never been measured simultaneously up to lower mantle conditions to solve for full elastic constants of ferropericlase, C11, C12 and C44 via Christoffel’s equations. Thus far, the effects of the spin transition on elasticity of ferropericlase remains highly debated. Using the combinations of experimental results from BLS and ISS measurements in the Mineral Physics Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, we have directly measured Vp and Vs of ferropericlase (Mg0.92Fe0.08)O simultaneously along [100] and [110] crystallographic axes up to megabar pressures. These results permit the derivation of reliable full elastic constants and the modeling of the elastic and seismic properties in the high-spin, low-spin and mixed-spin states. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were also performed to provide the equation of state parameters of ferropericlase for the modelling. The compressional wave velocities from ISS measurements show significant softening, while shear wave velocities from BLS experiments were only slightly affected by the spin transition. Using thermoelastic modelling [4], we will discuss the effects of the spin transition on elastic constants, sound velocities, elastic anisotropies, and seismic parameters of ferropericlase at lower-mantle pressure-temperature conditions. These results are compared with seismic observations of the deep lower mantle in order to better understand seismic signatures and mineralogical models of the lower mantle.\n",

Some of these samples had diameters of up to 40 cm and were up to 250 cm long, and thus are much larger than any living trees near the present treeline. Tree-ring analysis shows that these glaciers advanced into and over mature forests that had grown near present-day glacier margins for at least 135 years (Helm) and 357 years (W Squamish). Evidence for permanent snow and ice patches forming, as well as glaciers advancing beyond present-day extents at this time is found in the central Coast Mountains, Yukon Territory, Arctic Canada, Norway, and the Swiss Alps. Glacier advances of similar age have been reconstructed not only in western Canada, but also in Europe, Asia, South America, New Zealand, and Antarctica indicating the global nature of this event. A peak in ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic about 4200 years ago may have been the result of reduced solar output, and based on Earth’s position in the obliquity cycle glaciers should have started to expand 4000 years ago. These ‘glacier forests’ thus could provide a probable start date for Neoglaciation.",

            "abstract": "In order for the United States to remain competitive in the STEM fields, all available interested citizens must be engaged, prepared, and retained in the geoscience workforce. The misperception that the geosciences do little to support the local community and give back to fellow citizens contributes to the lack of diversity in the field. Another challenge is that the assumptions of career paths for someone trained in geosciences are often limited to field work, perpetuated by visuals found in media, popular culture and recruiting materials and university websites. In order to combat these views it is critical that geoscientists make visible both the diverse career opportunities for those trained in geoscience and the relevance of the field to societal issues.\nIn order to make a substantive change in the number of underrepresented minorities pursuing and working in geosciences we must rethink how we describe our work, its impacts and its relevance to society. At UNAVCO, we have undertaken this charge to change they way the future generation of geoscientists views opportunities in our field. This presentation will include reflections of a trained geoscientist taking a non-field/research career path and the opportunities it has afforded as well as the challenges encountered. The presentation will also highlight how experience managing a STEM program for middle school girls, serving as a Congressional Science Fellow, and managing an undergraduate research internship program is aiding in shaping the Geoscience Workforce Initiative at UNAVCO.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of the abundance of water in mantle sources first requires careful consideration of the shallow-level effects of degassing and contamination by seawater-derived components. Use of submarine glasses erupted at >500m water depth, and critically-evaluated use of melt inclusion volatile contents, can be used to identify and eliminate degassing as an important mitigating factor; widespread evidence for seawater-derived components are evident in halogen contents, but these effects do not typically correlate with water though there may be subtle effects in long-lived magmatic systems at mid-ocean ridges. H2O/Ce ratios show large differences between mid-ocean ridges, hotspots, back-arc basins and arc-front volcanoes that testify to the large input of water at subduction zones; however, at arcs most of the Ce (like most of the water) is derived from the subducting slab, and at hotspots isotopic tracers of recycled components indicate the presence of materials that can, in sufficient quantity, dominate the Ce budget of mantle plumes. Thus H2O/Ce ratios, while useful, are problematic when the goal is to determine the absolute abundances of water in mantle sources because the abundance of Ce cannot normally be assumed with confidence, except perhaps at mid-ocean ridges.\nA more complete understanding of the abundance of water in mantle sources can be obtained when data for radiogenic isotopes are used as tracers of mantle composition, and when major and trace element data illuminate the process of mantle melting. In areas far from hotspots, normal mid-ocean ridges reveal a remarkably narrow range of H2O/Ce ratios yet display large-scale regional differences between ocean basins [1]. Isotopically enriched signatures at hotspots suggest low absolute H2O abundances [2], yet there is so much water delivered to the sources of arc volcanoes that even >95% dehydration of slabs results in delivery of water to the deep mantle in excess of that observed in MORB sources. The modern net flux of water from the Earth’s surface to the interior may thus point toward mantle enrichment, and may have been so throughout Earth’s history.\n[1] Michael, P.

Initial results reveal a good correlation between the absolute value of the observed photospheric magnetic field and the observed F10.7 and selected UV bands. In Henney et al (2012), the observed F10.7 signal is found to correlate well with strong magnetic field regions. In addition, we find that observed integrated full-disk solar UV signals are correlated with weaker fields. By evolving solar magnetic maps forward 1 to 7 days with a flux transport model, this new method provides a realistic estimation of the Earth-side solar magnetic field distribution used to predict the F10.7 flux and UV irradiance. The ADAPT model used in this work was developed with support by a grant from the AFOSR (Air Force Office of Scientific Research).",

            "abstract": "Extreme rain-on-snow floods are known to result from snowmelt coincident with precipitation, but comparatively little is known about the relative timing of these factors within storm events. Cumulative net snowmelt (hourly, from a snowmelt lysimeter) was plotted against precipitation for 26 large storms (> 1-yr return period) over the period 1991-2012 in the transient snow zone of the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascades of Oregon. The relative timing of precipitation and net snowmelt at the hourly time scale was assessed with wavelet coherence.\nFive precipitation-net snowmelt response categories were identified: flat; persistent melt; persistent snow accumulation; late melt; and late snow accumulation. Persistent melt events were characterized by increasing cumulative net snowmelt and precipitation and had the highest mean peak flow and water available for runoff. Both the persistent melt and persistent snow accumulation categories had large, contiguous regions of significant wavelet coherence at multiple temporal scales, but pulses of precipitation preceded pulses of snowmelt in the persistent melt events, whereas precipitation was absorbed by the snowpack in the persistent accumulation category.\nA dewpoint temperature consistently above 0.5°C, elevated wind speeds, and a high fraction of precipitation falling as rain in the persistent melt category facilitated rapid snowmelt rates. During the two extreme rain-on-snow events in the sample, snowmelt was significantly synchronized with precipitation at 1-h to 64-h time scales throughout the 10-day event duration. Event categorization and analysis of wavelet coherence between precipitation and snowmelt can help predict peak discharge magnitude.",

These data along with independent, radiative-transfer modeling-studies suggest that it is possible to estimate the internal, physical temperatures of ice sheets to some, perhaps great, depth. Such a measurement is necessary to improve ice sheet models which rely on temperature-dependent deformation rates within the body of the ice sheet. In this paper we review our most recent modeling which now includes the effect of layering in near surface firn. We go on to compare L-band satellite data with modeled brightness temperatures at several sites in Greenland and Antarctica where physical temperature has been measured. We show the brightness temperature response over the band 0.5 to 2 GHz including the influence of basal-water on the low frequency range of this band. We conclude by summarizing our current design of an ultra-wide-band radiometer intended to make ice sheet thermometry measurements.

            "abstract": "Ice sheets are the largest contributors to sea level rise at present, and responsible for the largest uncertainty in sea level projections. Ice sheets raised sea level 5 m per century 13.5 kyr ago during one period of rapid change. Leading regions for future rapid changes include the marine-based, retrograde bed parts of Greenland (north center and east), West Antarctica (Amundsen Sea), and East Antarctica (Filchner basin and Wilkes Land). Fast changes require an increase in ice melt from a warmer ocean and an increase in iceberg calving. Our understanding of both processes remains limited due to a lack of basic observations. Understanding ocean forcing requires observations on the continental shelf, along bays and glacial fjords and at ice-ocean boundaries, beneath kilometers of ice (Antarctica) or at near-vertical calving cliffs (Greenland), of ocean temperature and sea floor bathymetry. Where such observations exist, the sea floor is much deeper than anticipated because of the carving of deep channels by multiple glacier advances. Warm subsurface waters penetrate throughout the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, the southeast and probably the entire west coasts of Greenland. In Greenland, discharge of subglacial water from surface runoff at the glacier grounding line increases ice melting by the ocean even if the ocean temperature remains the same. Near ice-ocean boundaries, satellite observations are challenged, airborne observations and field surveys are limited, so advanced robotic techniques for cold, deep, remote environments are ultimately required in combination with advanced numerical modeling techniques. Until such technological advances take place and advanced networks are put in place, it is critical to conduct boat surveys, install moorings, and conduct extensive airborne campaigns (for instance, gravity-derived bathymetry and air-dropped CTDs), some of which is already taking place. In the meantime, projections of ice sheet evolution in a warmer climate will remain highly conservative and perhaps misleading. Furthermore, as glaciers destabilize, iceberg calving will take over. Calving depends on the height of the calving cliff, the fracturing of ice near the ice front by strain rates or water; but the jury is also out about defining a universal calving law.",

            "abstract": "The Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) forearc preserves the earliest arc magmatic history from subduction initiation to the establishment of the arc. Recent investigations have established a bottom to top igneous stratigraphy of: 1) mantle peridotite, 2) gabbroic rocks, 3) a sheeted dyke complex, 4) basaltic pillow lavas (forearc basalts: FAB), 5) boninites and magnesian andesites, 6) tholeiites and calcalkaline arc lavas. This stratigraphy has many similarities to supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites.\nOne of the most important common characteristics between the SSZ ophiolites and the forearc crust is the occurrence of MORB-like basaltic lavas underlying or accompanying boninites and early arc volcanic suites. A key observation from the IBM forearc is that FAB differs from nearby back-arc lavas in chemical characteristics, including a depletion in moderately incompatible elements. This indicates that FAB is not a pre-existing oceanic basement of the arc, but the first magmatic product after subduction initiation. Sheeted dikes of FAB composition imply that this magmatism was associated with seafloor spreading, possibly triggered by onset of slab sinking. Recognition of lavas with transitional geochemical characteristics between the FAB and the boninites strongly implies genetic linkage between these two magma types.\nThe close similarity of the igneous stratigraphy of SSZ ophiolites to the IBM forearc section strongly implies a common magmatic evolutionary path, i.e., decompressional melting of a depleted MORB-type mantle is followed by melting of an even more depleted mantle with the addition of slab-derived fluid/melt to produce boninite magma.\nSimilarity of magmatic process between IBM forearc and Tethyan ophiolites appears to be reflected on common characteristics of upper mantle section. Peridotite from both sections show more depleted characteristics compared to upper mantle rocks from mid-ocean ridges.\nAge determinations reveal that first magmatism at the IBM arc occurred at c. 52 Ma, and transition from forearc basalt to normal arc magmatism took 7-8 million years. Combined with the age information from SSZ-ophiolites, significant constraints on time scale of subduction initiation and associated crustal accretion might be obtained.",

Here we describe a series of laboratory experiments aimed at better understanding one class of aging reactions, the heterogeneous oxidation of OA by gas-phase oxidants. Central to these experiments is the availability of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light at the Chemical Dynamics Beamline of the Advanced Light Source at LBNL, which enables the implementation of VUV photoionization aerosol mass spectrometry. This technique allows for the real-time, speciated measurement of OA composition, yielding molecular information that is highly complementary to ensemble data from electron-impact ionization. OA composition is measured with both ionization schemes as a function of oxidant exposure within a flow reactor, providing detailed information on the kinetics and products of heterogeneous oxidation over multiple generations of oxidation. Specific topics investigated include the branching between functionalization and fragmentation of OA components, the formation of secondary organic aerosol from photolytically-generated radical species, and the heterogeneous aging of soot-associated organic species.",

Here, we explore the extent to which modeled biogeochemical responses to changing climate are affected by the selection of the climate downscaling method and training observations used in the complex mountainous terrain of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. We evaluated three different downscaling methods: the monthly delta method (or the “change factor method”); monthly quantile mapping (Bias Correction-Spatial Disaggregation, or BCSD); and daily quantile regression (Asynchronous Regional Regression Model, or ARRM). Additionally, we trained outputs, from four AOGCMs (CCSM3, HadCM3, PCM, and GFDL-CM2) driven by higher (A1fi) and lower (B1) future emission scenarios, on two sets of observations (1/8th degree resolution grid vs. individual weather station) to generate the high-resolution climate input for the hydrochemical model PnET-BGC (ensemble of 48 runs).\nThe choice of downscaling approach and spatial resolution of the observations used to train the downscaling model both had a major impact on modeled soil moisture and streamflow which in turn affected forest growth, net nitrification and stream chemistry. Specifically, the delta method, the simplest downscaling approach evaluated, was highly sensitive to the observations used, resulting in projections that were significantly different than those produced with the BCSD and ARRM methods. Using spatially smoothed gridded observations and/or methods that do not resolve sub-monthly shifts in the distribution of temperature and/or precipitation can produce poor results in model applications run at higher temporal and/or spatial resolutions. These results underscore the importance of carefully considering the observations and downscaling method used to generate climate change projections for smaller scale modeling studies.",

            "abstract": "Since their discovery in 1979, high-temperature hot springs fueled by submarine volcanoes have served as models in the search for life elsewhere in the solar system. The early recognition of hot microbial biospheres associated with active volcanism along global mid-ocean ridges fundamentally shifted concepts of how planets and life co-evolve. These metal-rich, acidic systems were thought to represent the most extreme conditions on Earth, hosting novel life based on chemosynthesis. In 2000, this paradigm was profoundly impacted by the discovery of the Lost City hydrothermal field, characterized by conditions never before seen. Here, 60 m-tall limestone chimneys vent pH 10-11, metal-poor, 90°C fluids rich in hydrogen and abiotically-produced methane and formate. The fluid chemistry is driven, not by volcanic heat, but by fluid-rock reactions in underlying ultramafic basement at up to ~ 200°C. These peridotite-hosted biotopes differ significantly from volcanic-hosted vent systems in which carbon dioxide is a dominant volatile species. Instead, serpentinzation reactions yield high hydrogen and low molecular-weight hydrocarbons that result in energy-rich habitats with cell concentrations that reach 109cells/gram carbonate. The absence of volcanism, and on-going serpentinization reactions result in a remarkably stable system with venting active for >150,000 years.\nWith the discovery of Lost City, it is clear that high temperature volcanic activity is not a prerequisite for life. Exothermic serpentinization reactions occur under a wide-range of temperatures and can result in up to a 40% volume of expansion, which may both close and open fractures. Hence, Lost City may serve as a model in the search for life on other planets and moons with rocky, undifferentiated terranes and overlying oceans. Within such systems, interior cooling, coupled with tidally-induced heating may induce hydrothermal flow, and perhaps life-sustaining environments in the absence of volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Sap flow sensors are routinely used to obtain in situ measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) by individual trees. Flow rates within a single tree of some species, e.g., Quercus englemanii trees, exhibit high spatial variability. The latter impedes one’s ability to extrapolate single-tree ET estimates to their grove- and/or watershed-scale counterparts. A simplistic approach of using the highest observed sap flow rate might introduce a systemic bias into up-scaled estimates. We propose an approach to obtain a representative sap flow rate from all observed data; this rate is then applied to multiple trees in order to extrapolate ET rates from individual trees to the grove-scale. Eight thermal dissipation probe (TDP) pairs were deployed in individual Quercus englemanii trees, which had previously been monitored with only two TDP pairs. Analysis of the variability observed among the probes in the eight-probe arrays yields both a representative composite ET rate for the tree and quantification of the uncertainty associated with that rate. The probability distribution from the eight probe arrays can be applied to trees with one or two probes to estimate the probable range of representative ET rates for those trees and the composite rates for all measured trees is then applied to the grove as a whole.",

            "abstract": "Grazing cattle are a major methane (CH4) source from pasture ecosystems, however the underlying landscape is a potentially significant CH4 source that has received far less attention. Ecosystem surface emissions of CH4 are poorly quantified, vary widely across time and space, and are easily underestimated if emission hotspots or episodic fluxes are overlooked. We used static chambers, eddy covariance, and mobile cavity-ringdown spectrometry surveys to quantify spatially and temporally variable CH4 emissions from subtropical lowland pastures. We conclude emissions from soil and standing water are the dominant CH4 source, and cattle were responsible for only 13% of annual CH4emissions. The ecosystem emit 33.8 ± 2.2 g CH4 m-2 yr-1, however surface CH4 emissions were highly variable in both time and space. Seasonal flooding of pastures and low-lying landforms (canals, ditches, wetlands) drove high magnitude CH4 emissions. We observed large CH4 emissions from wetlands and, to a lesser extent, the entire landscape during the wet season. In contrast, during the dry season there was no appreciable CH4 accumulation in pastures when cattle were not present, and canals, which comprise 1.7% of the total land area, were responsible 97.7 % of dry season emissions. Ecosystem CH4 fluxes, measured by eddy covariance, varied seasonally and positively correlated to soil and air temperature, topsoil water content, and water table depth. Our work is the first to use mobile spectrometers to map biogenic CH4 emissions at the landscape scale, and demonstrates that soils and water are a strong pasture CH4 source that must be considered in addition to cattle emissions.",

            "abstract": "To enact effective policies to address climate change, decision makers need both scientific and political support. One major barrier to U.S. climate policy enactment has been the opposition of private sector actors to proposed policies and to climate science itself. Increasingly, the public and investors are holding companies accountable for their actions around climate change—including political activies, affiliations with trade groups, and involvement with climate science. However, this accountability is inhibited by the prominent role that trade associations have played in climate policy debates in recent years. The opaque nature of such groups is problematic, as it inhibits the public from understanding who is obstructing progress on addressing climate change, and in some cases, impedes the public’s climate literacy. Voluntary climate reporting can yield some information on companies’ climate engagement and demonstrates the need for greater transparency in corporate political activities around climate change. We analyze CDP climate reporting data from 1,824 companies to assess the degree to which corporate actors disclosed their political influence on climate policies through their trade associations. Results demonstrate the limitations of voluntary reporting and the extent to which companies utilize their trade associations to influence climate change policy debates without being held accountable for these positions. Notably, many companies failed to acknowledge their board seat on trade groups with significant climate policy engagement. Of those that did acknowledge their board membership, some claimed not to agree with their trade associations’ positions on climate change. These results raise questions about who trade groups are representing when they challenge the science or obstruct policies to address climate change. Recommendations for overcoming this barrier to informed decision making to address climate change will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "A few ice core records recovered from remote arctic regions suggest a widespread impact of toxic trace elements (Pb, Cu, Sb, As and Bi) to the North Hemisphere atmosphere prior to the onset of the Industrial Revolution (1780s-1830s). In the Southern Hemisphere, evidence for preindustrial trace element emissions are, to date, limited to sediment cores recovered from lakes located within the immediate airshed of major metallurgical centers of South America. Thus it remains unresolved whether they could have had a larger scale impact. Here, we present an annually resolved ice core record of anthropogenic trace element deposition from the remote drilling site of the Quelccaya Ice Cap (Peru) that spans 793–1989 AD. During the pre-Inca period (i.e., prior to ~1450 AD) the deposition of trace elements was dominated by the fallout of aeolian dust from the deglaciated margins of the ice cap and of ash from occasional volcanic eruptions. In contrast, the ice core record indicates a clear anthropogenic signal emerging after the onset of large scale colonial mining and metallurgy (1532–1820 AD), ~300 years prior to the Industrial Revolution during the last part of the Little Ice Age. This shift was coincidental with a major technological transition for silver extraction (1572 AD), from lead-based smelting to mercury amalgamation, that initiated a major increase in ore mining and milling that likely resulted in an increase of metallic dust emissions. While atmospheric trace element deposition resulting from colonial metallurgy was certainly much larger than during the pre-Colonial period, trace element fallout during the Colonial era was still several factors lower than during the 20th century, when the construction of the trans-Andean railway and highways promoted a widespread societal and industrial development of South America.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale permafrost thaw is projected under unmitigated warming scenarios. Since permafrost soils contain enormous amounts of organic carbon, whose stability is contingent on remaining frozen, this permafrost thaw could lead to a significant release of carbon to the atmosphere, acting as a positive feedback to climate change. Significant uncertainty remains on the post-thaw carbon dynamics of permafrost-affected ecosystems. The large stocks of permafrost carbon have built up over time in part due to the saturated (and cold) soil conditions found across much of the permafrost domain. But, these conditions are likely to change as permafrost thaws. Here we focus on the hydrologic response. Prior research suggests that the hydrologic response may contain two phases, an initial wettening associated with ice melt and surface subsidence leading to more wetlands and lakes, followed by drying once the permafrost table has deepened enough to open up new channels to the groundwater system.\nSimulations to year 2300 with the Community Land Model (CLM4.5BGC) suggest that, even though Earth System Models project that Arctic climate will get wetter, soil moisture conditions will become drier both at the surface and at depth in response to projected deepening of the permafrost table. Here, we examine the relative influence of these soil moisture changes (compared to the influence of warming) on soil decomposition rates by conducting an additional model experiment in which we artificially maintain the wet 1850 soil moisture conditions through throughout the simulation. We can then assess (a) how the soil moisture drying trajectory affects the rate of soil warming (answer: not much) and (b) how a different plausible soil moisture trajectory can alter the rates of soil carbon decomposition into CO2 or CH4. We find that he drying at depth leads to faster soil carbon decomposition, while the absence of drying leads to slower decomposition rates, but higher CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that soil moisture and trends of soil moisture are an important part of the permafrost climate-carbon feedback picture and that improved understanding of impact of permafrost thaw on soil moisture dynamics is required to further constrain the amplitude of the permafrost climate-carbon feedback.",

The resulting exposure has been linked to cancers and cardio-vascular disease in adults and inhibited intellectual function in children. In Bangladesh, the most affected country, the impact of early mitigation efforts relying on water treatment has been limited by the cost and logistics of maintenance. A simpler approach based on switching human consumption to low-arsenic wells has proved to be more resilient although it remains far from sufficiently adopted. A decade ago, there was concern that low-arsenic wells might become contaminated upon use. Observations and modeling have since shown that groundwater arsenic concentrations are likely to rise only in certain hydrogeologically vulnerable areas and then only gradually. Our recently completed blanket-testing campaign of 50,000 wells in 300 villages of Bangladesh has shown that, instead, a leading cause of current exposure is that households have continued to install wells and typically have nowhere to turn for a reliable arsenic test. The same campaign has shown that another reason for continued exposure is that deeper wells that are low in arsenic and whose installation has been subsidized by the Bangladesh government are not located to maximize public access. The geographic clustering of these deep wells suggests that, all too often, their location is decided on the basis of political allegiance rather than need. Such obstacles to lowering arsenic exposure might be overcome with more widespread testing and the public posting of maps of test results also showing where deep wells have been installed. We will show that obtaining and sharing such information has been greatly facilitated by a reliable field-kit for arsenic and the increasing use of smartphones in Bangladesh.",

Warming of 1-2ºC is simulated for all expanding urban areas, with local warming exceeding 3ºC for some regions during some seasons. This warming is a significant fraction of 21st century greenhouse gas-induced climate change simulated by global climate models. Widespread adoption of adaptation strategies exhibit regionally and seasonally dependent hydroclimatic impacts, displaying intended effects for some urban areas while exhibiting unintended consequences for others. To assess the multi-scale dependency of simulated results, high-resolution (2km grid spacing) seasonal timescale simulations are conducted for select rapidly urbanizing regions. In addition to emphasizing the need for integrated assessment that also incorporates biophysically induced urban impacts, I argue in favor of examining scale dependency of simulated outcomes to comprehensively address tradeoff assessment of various urban adaptation approaches.",

The present study provides an up-to-date assessment of these excitation effects on the basis of 10-year surface and isobaric level data from three, previously unavailable global atmospheric reanalysis systems. We retrieve numerical values of in- and out-of-phase nutation corrections for seasonally modulated S1 variations and indicate how model improvements, specifically in terms of the representation of tidal oscillations, lead to different estimates with respect to earlier reanalyses. Motion term signals in nutation display a close agreement across all probed datasets, whereas larger disparities remain among mass term excitation estimates due to their dependency on small-scale diurnal surface pressure oscillations. A simple time-stepping model for barotropic ocean dynamics, based on the shallow water equations and driven by air pressure tide climatologies, represents an appropriate means to determine global S1 estimates of sea level heights and currents that are consistent with the respective forcing fields from each reanalysis. We address the intricacies of constructing such a model and compare our preliminary oceanic angular momentum solutions to those from more established hydrodynamic forward integrations. The combined influence of the S1 tide on Earth’s nutation, associated with both atmosphere and ocean dynamics, is found to yield a rough agreement with observations from geodetic VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) measurements.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is projected to increase risks to human health. One pathway that may be particularly difficult to manage is adverse human health impacts (e.g. premature mortality and morbidity) from increases in mean temperatures and changing patterns of temperature extremes. Modeling how these health risks evolve over decadal time-scales is challenging as the severity of the impacts depends on changes in climate as well as socioeconomic conditions. Here, we show estimates of health damages as well as both direct and indirect economic damages that span climate and socioeconomic dimensions for each US state to 2050. We achieve this objective by extending the integrated assessment model (IAM), Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM-USA). First, we quantify the change in premature mortality. We identify a range of exposure-response relationships for temperature related mortality through a critical review of the literature. We then implement these relationships in the GCAM by coupling them with projections of future temperature patterns and population estimates. Second, we monetize the effect of these adverse health effects, including both direct and indirect economic costs through labor force participation and productivity along a range of possible economic pathways. Finally, we evaluate how uncertainty in the parameters and assumptions affects the range of possible estimates. We conclude that the model is sensitive to assumptions regarding exposure-response relationship and population growth. The economic damages, however, are driven by the estimates of income and GDP growth as well as the potential for adaptation measures, namely the use and effectiveness of air conditioning.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) transport is a key biogeochemical link across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in headwater catchments, and therefore is intimately linked with the hydrologic connectivity of the catchment to the stream. This study evaluated the mobility of specific chemical constituents of DOM during snowmelt in a montane, semi-arid catchment in the Boulder Creek CZO. Dissolved organic matter quality was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy on a daily basis from water sampled from the soil (10 – 25 cm depth) via tension lysimeters and from the stream during snowmelt and was compared to approximately bi-monthly groundwater samples (~18 m depth). In the stream, a transition occurred from fluorescent DOM (FDOM) being dominated by protein-like material to FDOM being dominated by more humic-like material. The FDOM in the interstitial water of the soils and the groundwater did not change in character. Thus, the stream transition is indicative of an engagement of DOM originating from hillslope soils during snowmelt. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) normalization of these fluorescent loadings suggest that the peak in DOC concentration seen in the stream is mainly controlled by the non-fluorescent fraction of DOM. These results indicate that shifts in hydrologic connectivity of different watershed units to the stream are a major control on DOM export from the watershed.",

            "abstract": "While the concept of hydrologic connectivity is of significant importance to both researchers and policy makers, there is no consensus on how to express it in quantitative terms. This lack of consensus was further exacerbated by recent rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court that rely on the idea of “significant nexuses”: critical degrees of landscape connectivity now have to be demonstrated to warrant environmental protection under the Clean Water Act. Several indicators of connectivity have been suggested in the literature, but they are often computationally intensive and require soil water content information, a requirement that makes them inapplicable over large, data-poor areas for which management decisions are needed. Here our objective was to assess the extent to which the concept of connectivity could become more operational by: 1) drafting a list of potential, watershed-scale connectivity metrics; 2) establishing a list of criteria for ranking the performance of those metrics; 3) testing them in various landscapes. Our focus was on a dozen agricultural Prairie watersheds where the interaction between near-level topography, perennial and intermittent streams, pothole wetlands and man-made drains renders the estimation of connectivity difficult. A simple procedure was used to convert RADARSAT images, collected between 1997 and 2011, into binary maps of saturated versus non-saturated areas. Several pattern-based and graph-theoretic metrics were then computed for a dynamic assessment of connectivity. The metrics performance was compared with regards to their sensitivity to antecedent precipitation, their correlation with watershed discharge, and their ability to portray aggregation effects. Results show that no single connectivity metric could satisfy all our performance criteria. Graph-theoretic metrics however seemed to perform better in pothole-dominated watersheds, thus highlighting the need for region-specific connectivity assessment frameworks.",

The effort centers around several surface field intensive campaigns that are designed or leveraged for EDR validation. These data include ship-based observations of upper air ozone, pressure, temperature and relative humidity soundings; aerosol and cloud properties; and sea surface temperature. Similar intensive data from two land-based sites are also utilized as well. One site, the Howard University Beltsville site, is at a single point location but has a comprehensive array of observations for an extended period of time. The other land site, presently being deployed by the University at Albany, is under development with limited upper air soundings but will have regionally distributed surface based microwave profiling of temperature and relative humidity on the scale of 10 - 50 km and other standard meteorological observations. Combined these observations provide data that are unique in their wide range including, a variety of meteorological conditions and atmospheric compositions over the ocean and urban-suburban environments. With the distributed surface sites the variability of atmospheric conditions are captured concurrently across a regional spatial scale.\nSome specific examples are given of comparisons of moisture and temperature correlative EDRs from the satellite sensors and surface based observations. An additional example is given of the use of this data to correct sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval biases from the hyperspectral IR satellite observations due to aerosol contamination.",

Recent high cadence and full-disk imaging observations in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) have opened a new chapter in understanding these waves and utilizing them for coronal seismology. We will review such new observations, focusing on two intimately related phenomena - global EUV waves (so-called \"EIT waves\") associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and quasi-periodic, fast-mode magnetosonic wave trains associated with flares: (1) The generation and propagation of global EUV waves and their interaction with coronal structures, e.g., reflection and refraction, can provide diagnostics for the global corona in which they propagate, such as mapping the spatial distribution of the wave phase speed and thus the magnetic field strength. (2) AIA-detected fast-mode wave trains are closely correlated with flare pulsations seen from radio to hard X-rays and propagate at typically 500-2000 km/s along funnel-shaped waveguides often located within CME bubbles. They can provide diagnostics for flare energy release mechanisms and the local corona around the flaring active region. We will discuss the roles of such waves in energy transport within the solar atmosphere and in their associated CME/flare eruptions.",

Satellite-derived LSWT observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) are first evaluated against in-situ measurements for a selection of large to medium-size lakes during the open-water season. Three experiments were then run over northern Europe for two winters (2010-2011 and 2011-2012), which involved the assimilation of remote-sensing LSWT observations into the HIRLAM analysis. In the baseline experiment, the prognostic lake parameterization inside the forecast model provided the background for the LSWT analysis by the lake parameterizations of the Fresh-water Lake model (FLake) integrated in HIRLAM. No satellite observations were used in this experiment. In the second experiment, remote-sensing observations were included along with the FLake model and in-situ observations. In the third experiment, satellite observations were used to correct the background provided by the previous analysis, excluding the FLake parameterization scheme.\nResults encourage work to describe better the initial state of the lake surface in NWP models by combining satellite observations and lake parameterizations via advanced data assimilation methods. It has been learned that space-borne observations are beneficial for the description of lake surface state even without parameterizations when FLake alone would have led to too early break-up in spring. In order to utilize the space-borne and in-situ observations along with lake parameterization for the improvement of the weather forecast, methods to connect the analyzed LSWT and ice cover to the prognostic in-lake variables are needed to fully benefit from the space-borne observations.",

            "abstract": "Although plasma convection in the polar cap is often thought of large-scale two-cell convection, recent radar observations have shown that dynamic meso-scale fast flows of the order of 100 km size are embedded within the large-scale convection. Those flow channels are colocated with polar cap airglow patches in many cases, and thus optical measurements can be used to track the origin of such flows, evolution in the polar cap, and their influence on nightside auroral activity. We present unique coordinated observations of the dayside auroral oval, polar cap, and nightside auroral oval by three All-Sky Imagers (ASIs), two SuperDARN radars, and DMSP. This dataset revealed that a dayside Poleward-Moving Auroral Form (PMAF) evolved into a polar cap airglow patch that propagated across the polar cap, and then nightside poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs). Radar observations detected fast anti-sunward flows associated with the PMAF, and the DMSP satellite, whose conjunction occurred within a few minutes after the PMAF initiation, measured enhanced Low-Latitude Boundary Layer (LLBL) precipitation and enhanced plasma density with a strong anti-sunward flow burst. The polar cap patch was spatially and temporally coincident with a localized anti-sunward flow channel. The propagation across the polar cap and the subsequent PBIs suggest that the flow channel originated from dayside reconnection and then reached the nightside open-closed boundary, triggering localized nightside reconnection and flow bursts within the plasma sheet. In addition, we have also statistically investigated the property of dayside and nightside polar cap flow channels using imagers, radars and low-altitude satellites. The flow channels are typically found to have a ~300 km width, propagate a few hundred km/s faster than background flows, and to occur during a By-dominant IMF with a weak southward component.",

However, resource and logistical constraints limit the frequency and extent of observations, particularly in the harsh environments of the arctic and the tropics, necessitating the development of a systematic sampling strategy to maximize coverage and objectively represent variability at desired scales. These regions host large areas of potentially vulnerable ecosystems that are poorly represented in Earth system models (ESMs), motivating two new field campaigns, called Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) for the Arctic and Tropics, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Clustering (MSTC) provides a quantitative methodology for stratifying sampling domains, informing site selection, and determining the representativeness of measurement sites and networks. We applied MSTC to down-scaled general circulation model results and data for the State of Alaska at a 4 km2 resolution to define maps of ecoregions for the present (2000–2009) and future (2090–2099), showing how combinations of 37 bioclimatic characteristics are distributed and how they may shift in the future. Optimal representative sampling locations were identified on present and future ecoregion maps, and representativeness maps for candidate sampling locations were produced. We also applied MSTC to remotely sensed LiDAR measurements and multi-spectral imagery from the WorldView-2 satellite at a resolution of about 5 m2 within the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) in Alaska. At this resolution, polygonal ground features—such as centers, edges, rims, and troughs—can be distinguished. Using these remote sensing data, we up-scaled vegetation distribution data collected on these polygonal ground features to a large area of the BEO to provide distributions of plant functional types that can be used to parameterize ESMs. In addition, we applied MSTC to 4 km2 global bioclimate data to define global ecoregions and understand the representativeness of CTFS-ForestGEO, Fluxnet, and RAINFOR sampling networks. These maps identify tropical forests underrepresented in existing observations of individual and combined networks.",

Based on their gene sequences, we cloned a subset of these proteins and purified them. Each of the proteins precipitate aragonite in vitro in unamended seawater. Antibodies raised against these proteins react with individual crystals of the native coral, clearly revealing that they are part of a biomineral structure. Based on the primary structure of the proteins we have developed a model of the precipitation reaction that focuses on a Lewis acid displacement of protons from bicarbonate anions by calcium ligated to the carboxyl groups on the CARPs. The reactions are highly acidic and are not manifestly influenced by pH above ca. 6. These results suggest that corals will maintain the ability to calcify in the coming centuries, despite acidification of the oceans.",

            "abstract": "We observe the geodynamic appraisal of Naga-Disang Thrust North East India. The Disang thrust extends NE-SW over a length of 480 km and it defines the eastern margin of Neogene basin. It branches out from Haflong-Naga thrust and in the NE at Bulbulia in the right bank of Noa Dihing River, it is terminated by Mishmi thrust, which extends into Myanmar as ‘Sagaing fault,which dip generally towards SE. It extends between Dauki fault in the SW and Mishmi thrust in the NE. When the SW end of ‘Belt of Schuppen’ moved upwards and towards east along the Dauki fault, the NE end moved downwards and towards west along the Mishmi thrust, causing its ‘S’ shaped bending. The SRTM generated DEM is used to map the topographic expression of the schuppen belt, where these thrusts are significantly marked by topographic break. Satellite imagery map also shows presence lineaments supporting the post tectonic activities along Naga-Disang Thrusts. The southern part of ‘Belt of Schuppen’ extends along the sheared western limb of southerly plunging Kohima synform, a part of Indo Burma Ranges (IBR) and it is seismically active.The crustal velocity at SE of Schuppen is 39.90 mm/yr with a azimuth of 70.780 at Lumami, 38.84 mm/yr (Azimuth 54.09) at Senapati and 36.85 mm/yr (Azimuth 54.09) at Imphal. The crustal velocity at NW of Schuppen belt is 52.67 mm/yr (Azimuth 57.66) near Dhauki Fault in Meghalaya. It becomes 43.60 mm/yr (Azimuth76.50) - 44.25 (Azimuth 73.27) at Tiding and Kamlang Nagar around Mishmi thrust. The presence of Schuppen is marked by a change in high crustal velocity from Indian plate to low crustal velocity in Mishmi Suture as well as Indo Burma Ranges. The difference in crustal velocities results in building up of strain along the Schuppen which may trigger a large earthquake in the NE India in future. The belt of schuppean seems to be seismically active, however, the enough number of large earthquakes are not recorded. These observations are significant on Naga-Disang Thrusts to reveal a possible seismic gap in NE India observed from two great earthquakes in the region viz. 1897 (Shillong 8.7M) and 1950 (Arunachal-China 8.7M), which is required to be investigated.",

            "abstract": "Grassroots research networks, such as AmeriFlux, require data and metadata integration from multiple, independently managed field sites, scales, and science domains. The goal of these networks is production of consistent datasets enabling investigation of broad science questions at regional and global scales. These datasets combine data from a large number of data providers, who often utilize different data collection protocols and data processing approaches. In this scenario, data integration and curation quickly become large-scale efforts. This presentation reports on our experience with integration efforts for the AmeriFlux network. In AmeriFlux we are attempting to integrate flux, meteorological, biological, soil, chemistry, and disturbance data and metadata. Our data management activities range from acquisition/publication mechanisms, quality control, processing and product generation, data and software synchronized versioning and archiving, and interaction mechanisms and tools for data providers and data users. To enable consistent data processing and network-level data quality, combinations of automated and visual data quality assessment procedures were built, extending on checks already done at site levels. The implementation of community developed and trusted algorithms to operate in production mode proved to be a key aspect of data product generation, with extensive testing and validation being one of the main concerns. Clear definitions for data processing levels help with easily tracking different data products and data quality levels. For metadata and ancillary information, formatting standards are even more relevant, since variables collected are considerably more heterogeneous. Documentation and training on the standards were crucial in this case, with instruction sessions having proved to be an effective approach, given that documentation cannot cover all different scenarios at different sites. This work is being developed in close coordination with ICOS in Europe and other regional networks aiming at regular and harmonized releases of data and metadata products for the FLUXNET network of flux monitoring networks.",

            "abstract": "“Rain follows the plow” was a theory that encouraged agricultural settlement in dryland areas in both the United States of America and Australia during the mid-1800s. Supporters of the theory believed that humans could master nature and alter the climate through cultivation of the soil. An opponent of this theory was George W. Goyder, who used vegetation in South Australia as an indicator to mark out the extent of the area’s severe 1865 drought, effectively establishing “nature’s limit” to reliable agriculture in South Australia. This limit became known as Goyder’s Line and demarked the boundary between land suitable for agricultural pursuits (i.e. cropping) to the south and land only suitable for grazing in the State’s arid north. Current cropping areas however extend north beyond this line, suggesting that either a) the line is not well defined, b) cropping is occurring on land considered ‘non-viable’ according to Goyder’s Line or c) the line distinguishing where cropping is and is not viable varies on interannual to multidecadal timescales. In this study, the 220 mm growing season (April to October) rainfall isohyet is used as a proxy for Goyder’s Line in order to assess its temporal and spatial variability. Using indices of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean variability, Southern Annular Mode and the Subtropical Ridge, it is shown that climate state significantly influences the location of the 220 mm growing season rainfall isohyet. This implies that the boundary between viable and non-viable cropping areas (i.e. Goyder’s Line or “nature’s limit”) is non-stationary. These results also indicate the key influences on South Australia’s climate and have important implications globally for agricultural practices operating in or bordering semi-arid environments.",

            "abstract": "In August 2010 a mega-heatwave hit large parts of Eastern Europe and Russia, breaking the historical records from the 2003 event in Western Europe. While such heatwaves are predicted to become common by the end of this century, our understanding of the physics behind these phenomena is still imperfect, and so is their representation in climate models. In this presentation we will provide new evidence of how land-atmosphere feedbacks contribute to the development of the extreme temperatures based on satellite observations, climate model reanalyses data (ERA Interim), balloon sounding measurements, soil moisture-temperature coupling diagnostics and mechanistic modelling of the lower atmosphere. Results of our analyses show that in both European mega-heatwaves, persistent synoptic conditions intensified soil desiccation. As a consequence, a deep residual atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) developed, which allowed the multi-day storage of heat coming from: (a) large-scale horizontal advection, (b) intense warming from the land surface associated to the increasingly dry soils, and (c) enhanced warm air entrainment from the top of the ABL. This progressive storage of heat in the residual ABL played a crucial role in the escalation of temperatures, and therefore in the regulation and intensification of land feedbacks.\nSoil moisture deficits have both direct and indirect effects in all these processes, effects that have not been scrutinized separately in previous model studies. Our findings suggest the need of revisiting the traditional view of the soil moisture-temperature coupling during mega-heatwaves, in which only the direct impact of dry soils on the surface energy balance is explicitly considered. These positive feedbacks provide a plausible answer to why temperatures become increasingly higher as heatwaves evolve, and why they reach values so far outside the expected range of variability. We suggest therefore, that both land-surface memory and multi-day ABL development need to be simultaneously considered for timely prediction of future mega-heatwaves.",

Here we present our analysis of MODIS and SAR imagery, to provide an in detail description of the regional sea ice conditions, which led to beset the RV Xuelong for ~6 days. The remotely sensed imagery clearly revealed the sea-ice characteristics during the four stages of the entrapment: gathering stage, compaction stage, dispersion stage and calving stage. Here we present our evaluation of the four factors characterizing the local sea-ice conditions during the late Dec 2013 and early January 2014: coastal current, wind, tide and temperature. This study demonstrates that high spatio-temporal resolution remote sensing data are required to monitor the local and regional sea-ice changes with view to avoid future entrapping of vessels due to drastic changes and to work towards improved understanding of sea-atmosphere-ice interactions.",

            "abstract": "The 2014 Third National Climate Assessment (NCA3) is scientifically authoritative and features major advances, relative to other assessments produced by several organizations. NCA3 is a valuable resource for communicating climate science to a wide variety of audiences. Other assessments were often overly detailed and laden with scientific jargon that made them appear too complex and technical to many in their intended audiences, especially policymakers, the media, and the broad public. Some other assessments emphasized extensive scientific caveats, quantitative uncertainty estimates and broad consensus support. All these attributes, while valuable in research, carry the risk of impeding science communication to non-specialists. Without compromising scientific accuracy and integrity, NCA3 is written in exceptionally clear and vivid English. It includes outstanding graphics and employs powerful techniques aimed at conveying key results unambiguously to a wide range of audiences.\nI have used NCA3 as a resource in speaking about climate change in three very different settings: classroom teaching for undergraduate university students, presenting in academia to historians and other non-scientists, and briefing corporate executives working on renewable energy. NCA3 proved the value of developing a climate assessment with communication goals and strategies given a high priority throughout the process, not added on as an afterthought. I draw several lessons. First, producing an outstanding scientific assessment is too complex and demanding a task to be carried out by scientists alone. Many types of specialized expertise are also needed. Second, speaking about science to a variety of audiences requires an assortment of communication skills and tools, all tailored to specific groups of listeners. Third, NCA3 is scientifically impeccable and is also an outstanding example of effective communication as well as a valuable resource for communicators.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is commonly seen in various planetary magnetospheres. However, morphologies and roles of reconnection in magnetospheric dynamics are not necessarily the same. In a classical view, the Earth’s magnetosphere is driven by the solar wind through reconnection, whilst the Jovian magnetosphere has been believed to be centrifugally-driven because of the planetary fast rotation and its internal plasma source. Due to the poor data, however, detailed study of Jovian reconnection has been difficult before the first orbiting spacecraft GALILEO. In-situ observations by GALILEO, equipped with particle detectors and electric/magnetic field sensors, indeed enabled us to refine the above classical view. We show that the plasma structure of Jovian reconnection is similar to the Earth’s case despite the existence of heavy ions, whilst the global distribution of transient reconnection events is yet unique to the fast-rotating magnetosphere. Observations also suggest that the solar wind may significantly participate in prominent reconnection events, which was not anticipated in the classical view.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation has different degrees of freedom for adaptation to its environment. Examples include stomatal conductance at short time scale (minutes), leaf area index and fine root distributions at longer time scales (days-months) and species composition and dominant growth forms at very long time scales (years-centuries), subject to constraints imposed by land use practices. As a result, the overall response of evapotranspiration to changes in environmental forcing may also change at different time scales. The effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2) on evapotranspiration is an example for different response patterns at different temporal and spatial scales. At the leaf scale, eCO2 can induce stomatal closure and reduced transpiration. This effect was incorporated in global models and held responsible for an observed increase in river runoff during the past century. However, stomatal closure is not the only means by which vegetation responds to eCO2. If, for example, stomatal closure is offset by an increase in vegetation cover in the long term, the effect of eCO2 on global transpiration could, in fact, be reversed.\nLong-term effects of eCO2 are difficult to capture in experiments or to deduce from past observations, because experiments are relatively short and the CO2levels expected in 20 years time have never been observed in the past. Instead, predictions of such long-term effects can be derived from models that do not simply extrapolate observed responses into the future.\nThe Vegetation Optimality Model (VOM) allows separation of different scales of adaptation, without the need for parameterisation with observed responses. This frees up observational and experimental data for model testing and allows hypothetical predictions about vegetation response at time scales beyond those of free air CO2 enrichment experiments. This paper discusses model predictions of the eCO2 effects on vegetation at different temporal scales and puts them in context with experimental evidence from free air CO2 enrichment experiments.",

            "abstract": "We present an ensemble of global high-resolution energy flux products over land derived from upscaling FLUXNET observations with eleven machine learning methods using an array of remote sensing data. The products cover latent heat, sensible heat, ground heat fluxes, as well as net radiation over the period 2001-2012 at 8 daily temporal and 0.0833 degree spatial resolution. To account for the typical energy balance (EB) under-closure observed at flux sites, five different EB correction techniques were used that correspond to different hypothesis on the causes of the EB closure deficit. Hence, in total six different variants of sensible and latent heat flux products are available that allow quantifying the product uncertainty related to the assumptions on the EB closure. We evaluate our products using cross-validation at site level and against various independent observation-based data streams including latent heat fluxes derived from runoff, various precipitation products, and net radiation derived from Earth observations. The evaluation exercise also allows making inferences on the EB closure problem at FLUXNET sites, which remains a major concern for the community. Our products are a valuable source for a variety of applications including the evaluation or calibration of global land surface models and the assessment of the biophysical properties of terrestrial ecosystems.",

This represents a regime-shift away from the familiar climate modeling techniques of the last 40 years into the nonhydrostatic regime where vertical acceleration, gravitational waves, and steep orography must be carefully modeled. The CAM-SE atmospheric dynamical-core is well positioned to take advantage of exa-flop supercomputers due to it near-optimal parallel scalability. However, scalability is merely a prerequisite and does not guarantee success. In order to perform accurate simulations, CAM-SE will require an array of new technologies including: nonhydrostatic dynamical solvers, greatly increased vertical accuracy, improved variable-resolution grid capabilities, and the integration of scale-aware physical parameterizations. In this talk, we will discuss the need for these new technologies and present our progress to date in their implementation.",

This kind of knowledge is inherently interdisciplinary because it requires understanding of the complex sociotechnical dimensions of water, policy, and user relations. It is axiomatic that good governance of water resources and water infrastructure requires information about water resources themselves and about the institutions that govern water use. This “socio-hydrologic” or “hydrosociological” knowledge is often characterized by complex dynamics between and among human and natural systems. Water Resources Research has provided a forum for presentation of interdisciplinary research in coupled natural-human systems since its inception 50 years ago. The evolution of ideas presented in the journal provides a basis for framing new work, an example of which is water conservation in cities. In particular, we explore the complex interactions of political, sociodemographic, economic, and hydroclimatological factors in affecting decisions that either advance or retard the development of water conservation policies.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing the spatial variability of properties and processes in Arctic and boreal landscapes is critical for gaining an understanding of ecosystem functioning and for parameterizing process-rich models that simulate feedbacks to a changing climate. However, large-scale models are often poorly informed by process studies and new approaches are needed if we are to better link field and laboratory investigations to climate models. A fundamental goal of the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE Arctic) project is to accelerate improvements in climate prediction through close integration of field, laboratory, and modeling activities. Geomorphological units, including thaw lakes, drained thaw lake basins, and ice-rich polygonal ground provide the organizing framework for our integrated framework for the coastal plains of the North Slope of Alaska. Process studies and observations of hydrology, geomorphology, biogeochemistry, vegetation patterns, and energy exchange and their couplings are being conducted across nested scales to populate a modeling framework and to achieve a broader goal of optimally informing process representations in global-scale models. We investigate the soil thermal regimes and their control on local scale hydrology for sites near Barrow, Alaska, through simulations at sub-meter scale resolution for low-centered, high-centered and transition polygons. We use high-resolution LiDAR and high-fidelity simulations using several models to couple surface-subsurface processes. A central focus of this challenge is to advance process understanding and predicting the evolution of permafrost thaw, degradation (i.e., thermokarst), and disturbance, and their impact on topography in a warming world and how these changes control the availability of water for biogeochemical, ecological, and physical feedbacks to the climate system.",

To facilitate clearer assessment of such interactions, a deglacial probabilistic distribution of regionally-disaggregated meltwater and iceberg discharge chronologies has been subject to ongoing development as part of the GLAC series of data-calibrated global ice sheet reconstructions. The North American (NA) and Eurasian (EA) components of GLAC are from full Bayesian calibrations of a 3D glacial systems model, while the Antarctic (ANT) component is from data-scoring of an initial 3344 member exploratory ensemble of model runs. Constraint data sets used for the calibration and data-scoring include: relative sea level (all), present-day vertical velocities (NA and EA), geologically-inferred deglacial ice margin chronologies (NA and EA), marine limits (NA),strandline constraints for pro-glacial lakes (NA), present-day ice thickness (ANT), and terrestrial and marine dates constraining past ice cover (ANT).\nI will present the disaggregated distribution of discharge chronologies for the three ice sheets and critically compare them against past inferences. I will also discuss key uncertainties that have not yet been accounted for as well as ongoing efforts to reduce and/or otherwise account for those uncertainties. A key feature of GLAC that recent studies continue to ignore is that there can be significant simultaneous discharge from multiple drainage sectors of a given ice sheet. For instance, a robust feature of GLAC is a dominant Meltwater Pulse 1a contribution from multiple North American sectors.",

Researchers are developing models that estimate snowmelt to aid in water resource management. One such model is the image snowcover energy and mass balance (iSNOBAL) model. It uses input climate grids to simulate the development and melting of snowpack in mountainous regions. This study looks at applying this model to the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in southwestern Idaho, utilizing novel approaches incorporating geographic information systems (GIS). To improve visualization of the iSNOBAL model, we have adapted it to run in a GIS environment. This type of environment is suited to both the input grid creation and the visualization of results. The data used for input grid creation can be stored locally or on a web-server. Kriging interpolation embedded within Python scripts are used to create air temperature, soil temperature, humidity, and precipitation grids, while built-in GIS and existing tools are used to create solar radiation and wind grids. Additional Python scripting is then used to perform model calculations. The final product is a user-friendly and accessible version of the iSNOBAL model, including the ability to easily visualize and interact with model results, all within a web- or desktop-based GIS environment. This environment allows for interactive manipulation of model parameters and visualization of the resulting input grids for the model calculations. Future work is moving towards adapting the model further for use in a 3D gaming engine for improved visualization and interaction.",

The models participating in this comparison were those that had joined the model integration team of the Vulnerability of Permafrost Carbon Research Coordination Network (see\nhttp://www.biology.ufl.edu/permafrostcarbon/\n). Each of the models in this comparison conducted simulations over the permafrost land region in the Northern Hemisphere driven by CCSM4-simulated climate for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Among the models, the area of permafrost (defined as the area for which active layer thickness was less than 3 m) ranged between 13.2 and 20.0 million km2. Between 1960 and 2300, models indicated the loss of permafrost area between 5.1 to 6.0 million km2 for RCP 4.5 and between 7.1 and 15.2 million km2 for RCP 8.5. Among the models, the density of soil carbon storage in 1960 ranged between 13 and 42 thousand g C m-2; models that explicitly represented carbon with depth had estimates greater than 27 thousand g C m-2. For the RCP 4.5 scenario, changes in soil carbon between 1960 and 2300 ranged between losses of 32 Pg C to gains of 58 Pg C, in which models that explicitly represent soil carbon with depth simulated losses or lower gains of soil carbon in comparison with those that did not. For the RCP 8.5 scenario, changes in soil carbon between 1960 and 2300 ranged between losses of 642 Pg C to gains of 66 Pg C, in which those models that represent soil carbon explicitly with depth all simulated losses, while those that do not all simulated gains. These results indicate that there are substantial differences in responses of carbon dynamics between model that do and do not explicitly represent soil carbon with depth in the permafrost region. We present analyses of the implications of the differences for atmospheric carbon dynamics at multiple temporal scales between 1960 and 2300.",

            "abstract": "Recent continuous observations of this exchange of CO2, H2O and sensible heat within the global observation network FLUXNET have enabled us to quantify ecosystem function in response to large eco-climatological spatial gradients and temporal variability of climate. We see that ecosystem function co-varies strongly with climate, but that climate alone does not suffice to explain the variation in total. Instead vegetation biophysical and structural parameters co-determine the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. By combining ecosystem level observation and information of spatial meteorological and vegetation remote sensing covariates we can infer global patterns of ecosystem atmosphere fluxes and derive key ecosystem functional properties globally. While this approach is powerful and meteorological and vegetation structural predictors explain more than 70% of the spatial variation of monthly fluxes at FLUXNET sites, it ignores the effect of ecophysiological vegetation properties, which is expected from plant physiological leaf or whole-plant studies. Hence, future research has to more strongly link the organismic trait information with ecosystem functional properties. For this we propose a framework that involves 1) the correlation of community aggregated traits with flux-derived ecosystem properties across a range of ecosystems, 2) the up-scaling of vegetation traits using spatially distributed geo-ecological co-variates and the comparison with global ecosystem functional properties and their co-variation with climate, 3) the use of vegetation traits instead of vegetation classes for empirical up-scaling of ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes from ecosystem to globe. We hypothesize that these studies will emphasize the superiority of a trait based approach over classical structural PFT concepts for modeling global ecosystem functioning, but will also highlight the scale-emergent properties at ecosystem level, which cannot be explained by plant traits alone.",

NASA satellite and modeling products provide a huge volume of valuable data extending back over 50 years across a broad range of spatial (local to global) and temporal (hourly to decadal) scales and include many products that are available in near real time (see earthdata.nasa.gov). To further accomplish these objectives NASA works to actively partner with public and private groups (e.g. federal agencies, universities, NGO’s, and industry) in the U.S. and international community to ensure the broadest use of its satellites and related information and products and to collaborate with regional end users who know the regions and their needs best. Key objectives of this talk will highlight NASA's Water Resources and Capacity Building Programs with their objective to discover and demonstrate innovative uses and practical benefits of NASA's advanced system technologies for improved water management in national and international applications. The event will help demonstrate the strong partnering and the use of satellite data to provide synoptic and repetitive spatial coverage helping water managers’ deal with complex issues.

Prior to this instrumental period, archived air, firn air, and air trapped in polar ice are the only direct atmospheric archives to reconstruct past CO2 changes. Only ice from Antarctica allows reliable CO2 measurements, either from classical ice cores or outcropping ice, while Greenland records are subject to in situ production. They provide high-resolution and high-precision CO2 reconstructions up to 800,000 years back in time. Ice core records have revealed an intimate connection between CO2 variations and major changes in Earth’s climate and have fundamentally shaped the community’s view of the global carbon cycle. Knowing the concentration of past atmospheric CO2 and the other greenhouse gases is key to provide the radiative forcing for climate simulations. Ice core reconstructions broadly fulfilled this task. On the contrary, we are far from a coherent understanding of the mechanisms driving these changes. Analyzing phase relations between CO2, other ice-core derived species, and proxies from marine sediment cores allow for the identification of factors likely responsible for the observed CO2 changes. Specifically, the strength of the Atlantic overturning circulation and Southern Ocean upwelling are thought to be key players. However, the observed CO2 changes cannot uniquely be related to a specific process. Here, stable carbon isotope analysis on CO2 extracted from ice provides additional constraints as any process leads to isotope fractionation of the reservoir. Analytical progress during the last decade affords us with a growing data set on this long-awaited parameter. This presentation provides a state-of-the-art overview on ice-based CO2 and its carbon isotopic signature focusing both on the long-term orbital changes as well as rapid changes documented during the last deglaciation.",

The recent discovery of seven fans on the continental shelf of the SBC poses an important question; namely, are the SBC fans deposited by sediment gravity flows capable of damaging shelf infrastructure? The fans lie directly offshore from small mountainous creeks that exceed the suspended sediment threshold of 40 g/L required for plunging at the fluvial-marine interface. Here, we present grain size trends, radiocarbon dates, and overall stratigraphic architecture of two fans in the SBC from eight cores and nine grab samples collected in October, 2013. The snub-nosed geometry of each lobe implies en masse freezing of deposits, but the incorporation of shell material and evidence of erosion in shallow seismic profiles indicate an initially turbulent flow regime. The location and geometry of these features suggests that the fans in the SBC are the result of hybrid hyperpycnal-debris flows, likely during floods associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation. A small shoreface slope break found immediately up-dip from these features suggests that seafloor geometry may play a key role in their deposition. The absence of a similar shoreface slope brake in areas without fans suggests a relationship between fan formation and shelf gradient.",

Recalcitrance can be quantified in laboratory incubations, by measuring the rate of production of CO2 from litter, under optimal environmental conditions. “Recalcitrance” is an inherent relative attribute of litter resulting from the synergistic interactions of several specific physic-chemical properties (e.g., stoichiometry, chemistry, energetic, physical structure) of that litter which in absence of environmental constraints (i.e., microbial limitation, physical aggregation, mineral-bonding) determine its potential rate of CO2 production. Because these environmental constraints often cannot be excluded in studies of soil organic matter (SOM), the term “recalcitrance” is not appropriate for SOM, and “persistence” is preferred. Recalcitrance is, of course, relative and requests a time scale of reference, since any litter eventually decomposes. We will illustrate this rational with examples from our latest laboratory incubations using: 1) a variety of plant litter types, 2) litter with differential isotopic enrichment of the metabolic and structural components, 3) soils containing isotopic enriched litter-derived organic matter.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index (PDO), which has been correlated to weather patterns in North America, was compared to precipitation variations for two stations in Texas - Amarillo (mean annual precipitation= 509 mm) in the Texas Panhandle and San Antonio (mean= 742 mm) in south Texas. Negative values of the PDO have generally been correlated with drought periods in the southern United States, including Texas, and positive values of the PDO correlate with periods of above average precipitation. Using a smoothed time-averaged plot of the PDO index, the PDO record was divided into 7 time periods characterized by either positive or negative, as follows: 1900-1934 - neutral, 1935-1944 - positive, 1945-1977 - negative, 1978-2003 - positive, 2004-2007 - positive, and 2008 - 2013 - negative values. For each of these periods the mean annual precipitation was calculated and compared to the values of the PDO index. A correlation was considered positive if above average precipitation occurred during positive PDO values, or if below average precipitation occurred during a period when the PDO values were generally negative. For Amarillo, a positive correlation was noted for all periods except 1978-1997. For the San Antonio data, a positive correlation was noted for all periods except 1998-2003. Given the prevailing negative values of the PDO, 1998-2003 should have been a time of decreased rainfall, but instead the mean annual rainfall was more than 127 mm above the long-term mean. One possible explanation for the increased rainfall is that 1997-1998 was a time of the strongest recent El Nino and 2002-2003 was a time of moderate El Nino conditions - both of which tend to produce above average precipitation in Texas. Notable rainfall amounts in San Antonio during this period are the 459 mm recorded during the month of Oct. 1998 and 430 mm in July 2002. These results suggest that the PDO cannot be used , by itself, to predict precipitation trends in Texas.",

            "abstract": "Seismic wave radiation from megathrust earthquakes provides an important probe of fault zone properties and rupture attributes. Depth-varying rupture characteristics of short-period seismic radiation for earthquakes along megathrusts have been inferred from several recent giant earthquakes and large tsunami earthquakes. To quantify any depth-dependent variations more extensively, we performed systematic analysis of 112 Mw ≥ 7.0 thrust-faulting earthquakes on circum-Pacific megathrust faults using teleseismic body wave finite-fault inversions and source spectrum determinations. Large tsunami earthquakes and some other shallow events at depths less than about 18 km have unusually long source durations, low static stress drops and strongly depleted short-period radiation. Deeper events have no clear trend with source depth for moment-normalized centroid duration, static stress drop, moment-scaled total radiated energy, apparent stress, or radiation efficiency. Scaling with seismic moment supports self-similarity for several source characteristics for the intermediate-size earthquake population, albeit with substantial scatter. However, the source spectra have high-frequency spectral decay slopes averaging ~-1.5, rather than -2, the expected value for a standard ω-2 model. This may result from compound nature of megathrust ruptures with varying scale lengths of heterogeneity, but is also influenced by attenuation assumptions. There is a systematic increase in short-period spectral levels manifested in reduced high-frequency spectral decay slope with increasing depth. The ratio of high-frequency (0.3-1Hz) radiated energy to total energy increases correspondingly. Correlation of higher estimated average megathrust temperature at 30 km depth with higher spectral decay rate indicates that the depth-varying pattern may result from frictional properties being influenced by temperature variations or from a systematic reduction of average attenuation with increasing depth along the megathrust.",

            "abstract": "Seafloor geodesy has been developed as an application of space geodetic technique for the purpose of investigating geodynamic phenomena having their major information in offshore regions. One of such targets is the occurrence of disastrous earthquakes in plate subduction areas. Japan, among others, has repeatedly experienced offshore megathrust earthquakes because of its tectonic location, where multiple plates interact with each other. Most recently, an earthquake of M9.0 occurred off the Pacific coast of east Japan in 2011 with a subsequent huge tsunami, which totally devastated coastal areas and claimed nearly 20,000 lives including those still missing.\nWe, the group of Japan Coast Guard (JCG), have developed a seafloor geodetic technique combining the GPS positioning and underwater acoustic ranging, which is able to measure the position of the seafloor reference point consisting of multiple acoustic transponders with a precision of a few centimeters. We have deployed our seafloor reference points over two regions on the Pacific side of Japan; one is the region along the Japan trench off the eastern coast where the huge 2011 event occurred and another is the region along the Nankai Trough off the southern coast where earthquakes of around M8 have repeated every 100-150 years.\nWith these measurements, we have so far successfully obtained important results providing exclusive information for elucidating the plate boundary behavior causing huge earthquakes. In particular, in the region off east Japan, we have revealed different phases of seafloor movements during the period between several years before and after the 2011 event. They include linear intraplate movements with several centimeters per year before the event, which were the first significant offshore geodetic signals detected around Japan, as well as the coseismic displacements of unprecedentedly huge amount over 20 m close to the epicenter and subsequent postseismic movements with various characteristics depending on the area. These seafloor data contribute to the understandings of physical processes relevant to the event beneath the seafloor in this region, which are unable to be clarified only by the terrestrial data.\nThe presentation summarizes efforts in the field of seafloor geodesy in Japan with a focus on the results obtained by the JCG group.",

            "abstract": "Due to various commonalities in model design and construction current climate models do not provide independent predictions of climate. Studies indicate that the information contained within the CMIP3 ensemble (25 models) is only equivalent to a set of perhaps five to ten independent models. This suggests that through judicious selection of models one could retain much of the information content of the full ensemble within a smaller sub-ensemble. Given constraints of computational resources we seek to select the most independent Global Climate Models (GCMs) to downscale from, and Regional Climate Models (RCMs) to downscale with, when producing a regional climate projection ensemble. Thus retaining the maximum information content possible.\nWe propose a method to perform this selection that satisfies the following criteria\nThe chosen models perform adequately for the recent past compared to observations.\nThe chosen models do not exhibit the same strengths and weaknesses in their representation of the climate (i.e. they are independent).\nAnd for the GCMs\nThe chosen models span the plausible future change space.\nAn application of this method has been performed for the NARCliM project. NARCliM (NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modelling project) is a regional climate modelling project for the Australian area. It will provide a comprehensive dynamically downscaled climate dataset for the CORDEX-AustralAsia region at 50km, and South-East Australia at a resolution of 10km. NARCliM data will be used by the NSW and ACT governments to design their climate change adaptation plans.Using this process an ensemble of 12 simulations (4 GCMs, 3 RCMs) for each period is obtained (Evans et al. 2014). Additionally to the GCM-driven simulations, 3 control run simulations driven by the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for the entire period of 1950-2009 are also performed in order to validate the RCMs performance in the area. In this talk, we will present the initial evaluation results of the GCM driven simulations and the projected future changes.\nEvans, J.

As part of it, the Multi-Viewing Multi-Channel Multi-Polarization Imaging mission (3MI) will be dedicated to the operational monitoring of aerosols but will also provide unique observations for characterization of cloud properties building on the legacy of POLDER and particularly of its 3rd mission (PARASOL) within the A-Train. Through the synergy of POLDER3/PARASOL and MODIS/AQUA several studies have demonstrated the great interest of combining multispectral, multiangle and polarization measurements in the visible, near and shortwave infrared to better constrain retrieval of clouds microphysical and macrophysical properties. Remote-sensing of cloud thermodynamic phase (Riedi et al, 2010), liquid (Bréon and Doutriaux-Boucher, 2005) or ice clouds microphysics (Zhang et al, 2009; Cole et al, 2012), cloud radiative (Zeng et al, 2012) or macrophysical properties (Ferlay et al, 2010; Desmons et al, 2013) can unarguably benefit from the additional information content brought by polarization and multiangle measurements. At the same time, retrieval algorithms are gaining further complexity and skills. Thanks to availability of computational resources, practical implementation of optimal estimation or related optimization techniques (Delanoe & Hogan, 2008; Dubovik et al, 2013) have appeared that allow simultaneous and consistent retrieval of larger sets of parameters from constantly growing observations vectors. Therefore 3MI observations will not only allow to improve accuracy of future cloud products but also opens perspectives for the development of new retrieval algorithms. A major challenge for cloud remote-sensing from passive measurements is to obtain information on clouds properties vertical distribution and structure. Through results of a comprehensive information content analysis we will illustrate our current efforts to obtain vertically resolved information on cloud properties from 3MI passive measurements only. In particular the synergy of multiangle polarization measurements at 443 and 865 nm with Oxygen A-band differential absorption information to retrieve cloud geometrical thickness will be discussed.",

Satellite dust retrievals with sub-daily resolution such as from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) and METOP A/B Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instruments are used to identify dust source regions. Identified dust source regions are then linked to soil properties and land type classification data sets. Information on the mineralogical composition of transported dust inferred from IASI observation are used (a) to investigate the impact of different source geomorphologies and thus different radiative properties of airborne dust particles, and (b) to estimate the contribution of dust uplift from alluvial sediments compared to dust emission from non-hydrological sources. Ultimately, this study contributes to the understanding of controlling mechanism on the interannual variability of dust source activation and will improve current dust emission modules coupled to atmosphere models.",

The leading cause to explain these events is freshwater forcing from ice-sheets that affected sea ice extent, heat transport, and Atlantic Meridional Overturing Circulation. Several long records now exist that extend the history of millennial climate variability back to ~1.5 Ma. These records document how suborbital variability evolved as boundary conditions changed throughout the Pleistocene, including the Middle Pleistocene Transition (MPT) when the climate system transitioned from smaller ice volume fluctuations dominated by 41-kyr cycles before 1250 ka to larger ice sheets with quasi 100-kyr cycles after 650 ka.\nExamination of these records lead to the following observations:\nMillennial-scale variability was a persistent feature of glacial climates for the past 1.5 Ma.\nSuborbital climate variability was enhanced during glacial periods (“noisy glacials”) and suppressed during full interglacial periods (“quiet intergalcials”)\nThe occurrence of strong millennial variability appears to be related to an ice-sheet size/volume threshold (McManus et al., 1999), presumably triggered when ice sheets grow large enough to reach the coast and interact with the ocean.\nNo two glacial cycles were alike with respect to either the magnitude or pacing of millennial climate variability.\nThe most significant change in ice rafted detritus (IRD) that occurred across the MPT was the appearance of Heinrich events, whose widespread occurrence was limited to the last ~650 ka (since MIS 16)\nThe growth of very large ice sheets in the latest Pleistocene introduced a new type of dynamic behavior of the Laurentide Ice Sheet marked by Heinrich layers.\nIRD and benthic δ13C were tightly coupled during glacials periods for the last 1.5 Ma, supporting a persistent link between fresh-water forcing and deep-water circulation\nSuborbital variability provides an important source of “noise” in the climate system that may play a role in noise-assisted transitions, such as glacial terminations and perhaps even the MPT itself.

Indeed, poor model representation of tropical forest carbon cycling and response to change (due in part to a paucity of data) is the most significant source of terrestrial uncertainty in projections of Earth’s future climate. Here we provide an ecological perspective on aspects of tropical forest structure and function that will present distinctive challenges to the Earth System Modeling community. Specifically, we will discuss: (1) high diversity of species, climate, soil types, and land use history within and among tropical forests and how this diversity influences forest responses to perturbation; (2) nutrient regulation of tropical carbon cycling responses to global change, including limitation by phosphorus; and (3) a lack of physiological data specific for tropical plant and microbial communities (e.g., photosynthetic optima, soil microbial carbon use efficiencies). With the goal of determining which processes and/or measurements should be better constrained in order to improve the capacity to model the tropics, we will examine a set of relevant Earth System Model parameters in the context of data synthesized from the literature and of new tropical forest physiological measurements we have recently made. The objective of this talk is not to discourage modelers from attempting to model the tropics, but rather to support this important work by offering research directions likely to reduce uncertainty in future predictions of Earth System Models.",

            "abstract": "Under classic tectonic theory sedimentary basins and continental margins are expected to experience rapid tectonic subsidence during times of active extension and then slow as subsidence becomes controlled by cooling and thickening of the mantle lithosphere after the end of extension. Subsidence has departed from this simple model in the NE Atlantic because of the temporary buoyant effects of upwelling mantle plumes (e.g., Iceland and that responsible for the emplacement of the Yermak Plateau), with this extra uplift dissipating as the plate move away from the area of upwelling. Permanent uplift has been caused by regional magmatic underplating, again often linked to melting from a plume. Svalbard in particular is anomalous in that it constitutes one of the few subaerial parts of the submarine shelf area of the Barents Sea and had also been affected by transpressional deformation resulting in the formation of the West Spitsbergen Foldbelt (WSFB). One and two-dimensional subsidence analyses were used to quantify and date phases of uplift during the Cenozoic. Svalbard has experienced two phases of uplift, from >36 to ~10 Ma, and since ~10 Ma, which is similar in timing to uplift phases identified in Greenland, Scandinavia and the Barents Shelf. Total uplift across much of the Central Tertiary Basin of Svalbard is >1.5 km and exceeds 2.5 km in parts of the WSFB. Uplift from >36 to ~10 Ma accounts for the greatest part of the vertical motion and like the younger phase reduces in magnitude towards the east. Flexural rigidity of the lithosphere is estimated to be low (Te ≈ 5 km), so that erosion of the WSFB after 36 Ma contributes little to the total amount of uplift. The permanent nature of uplift and the proximity to the Yermak Plateau implies that regional magmatic underplating is the cause of uplift. Plume dynamic support and flexural unloading along the western transform margin of the Eurasian plate can be ruled out as significant influences on vertical motions. The second phase of uplift since ~10 Ma that generated the modern topography may be linked to thermal erosion of the mantle lithosphere under Svalbard. We suggest that a likely cause of much of the surface uplift is the northward propagation of the Knipovich Ridge to establish continuous seafloor spreading through the Fram Strait after ~10 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Iceberg calving is responsible for a significant proportion of annual mass loss from marine-terminating glaciers and is believed to be a major factor in the rapid demise of paleo-ice sheets. Recent forecasts of sea-level contributions from the main outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet find the majority of mass-loss will be dynamic in origin (i.e. driven by glacier flow and calving) over the next two centuries. However, despite the use of increasingly realistic, physically-based approaches, current models remain a coarse approximation of real calving mechanisms due largely to a lack of observations of glacier geometry required for 3D time-evolving models. We applied novel digital photogrammetric methods to stereo time-lapse imagery to generate a high temporal and spatial resolution record of daily digital elevation models of the calving margin of Greenland’s Helheim Glacier during the summers of 2010 and 2011. Our results show that during these summers large (>1 km3) calving events driven by buoyant flexure and basal crevasse propagation dominated dynamic mass loss at Helheim. This calving mechanism, common at Helheim and likely elsewhere in Greenland, is not well understood but is clearly an important first-order control on the ice sheet’s future contribution to sea-level.",

To reveal the characteristics of water uptake patterns by Achnatherum splendens and how it response to changes of water conditions in Lake Qinghai watershed, we analyzed isotopic concentrations (δD and δ18O) of plant stem water and soil water, groundwater and precipitation under the natural and drought treatment habitats. Water uptake by A.splendens was analyzed by direct comparison and multi-source mixing model calculating the plant-use proportions from diverse soil depths. The results showed that large fluctuations were found in the soil moisture and the isotopic contents of soil water in the surface soil layers, directly influenced by precipitation and evaporation. The slope and intercept of evaporative soil water line was evidently smaller than local meteoric water line indicating that the isotopic contents from soil water experienced stronger evaporation fractionation processes; The isotopic concentrations of stem were scattered along the evaporative soil water line exhibiting that the possible water sources extracted from soil water. Water uptake by A.splendens mainly absorbed surface soil water ( 45.1% from 0-10cm in June) at the early growth stage. Large precipitation events significantly impacted the whole soil water content and isotopic contents and resulted in the differences of plant-use proportions by A.splendens were minimal during August and September, which revealed that the roots of A.splendens extracted various depth of soil water when soil availability water was high. Under the drought treatment conditions, A.splendens largely used the surface soil water (0-30cm) in the early July. The absorbed depth transmitted to deep soil layers while the surface soil moisture decreased. However, the acquired depth by A.splendens again shifted from deep to surface soil layers when surface soil moisture sharply increased after the irrigation.",

            "abstract": "It is estimated that almost 400 million people live in watersheds where glaciers provide at least 10% of the runoff, yet many questions remain regarding the impact of climate change and glacier recession on water resources derived from these high mountain watersheds. We present research from the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, an area with the highest density of glaciers in the tropics. While glacier meltwater buffers stream discharge throughout the range, groundwater is a major component of dry season runoff, contributing up to 50-70% of outflow in some tributaries. In order to predict future changes to water resources it is critical to understand how groundwater can offset future hydrologic stress by maintaining stream baseflow, including recharge mechanisms, subsurface pathways, storage, and net fluxes to rivers. We present a synthesis of results based on hydrologic modeling, drilling/piezometers, geophysics, and artificial and natural hydrologic tracers. Our findings show that ‘pampas’, low-relief mountain valleys, are critical for baseflow generation by storing groundwater on interannual timescales. Pampas have a total area of ~65 km2 and are comprised of unconsolidated glacial, talus, lacustrine and wetland (bofedales) deposits. The valleys commonly have buried talus aquifers that are overlain by low permeability, glaciolacustrine deposits. Glaciofluvial outwash deposits and small wetlands also act as unconfined aquifers. These groundwater systems appear to be primarily recharged by wet season precipitation, and at higher elevations also by glacial meltwater. Additionally a ubiquitous feature in the valleys are springs, often located at the base of talus deposits, which generate a large hydrologic flux within the hydrologic systems. While glaciers are the most visible and vulnerable component of the Andean waterscape, we argue that it is crucial to understand the complete mountain hydrologic cycle, including groundwater, in order to understand the ongoing transitions in a post peak-water setting.",

            "abstract": "Depending on factors including temperature, snow duration and soil moisture conditions, emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from permafrost wetlands can vary by factors of 2-4 between years. This variability is clear in atmospheric measurements of the gas, but a lack of ground-based data is making it hard to locate the methane sources responsible. Methane monitoring in the Arctic is expensive, requiring sophisticated analysis equipment such as power requiring laser spectrometer analysis made in remote places. This also puts demands on the logistics where infrastructures and field stations that offer line-power in the field are in high demand but very rarely found. Research projects therefore typically focus on one site, and run for a year or two. Longer term monitoring programs, which document climate, hydrology, phenology and population dynamics of birds and mammals, rarely include carbon fluxes since it is technically challenging to measure. One that does is the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring program that started at the Zackenberg research station, which has recorded substantial methane flux variations for almost a decade in North-east Greenland. Such multi-year studies show that, while there is some connection between the amounts of methane released from one year to the next, accurate forecasting is difficult. They also highlight the importance of extending monitoring beyond the growing period into the frozen season, both in spring and autumn. A spatially distributed network of long-term monitoring stations in the Arctic, with consistency between measurements, is badly needed to improve this situation. Productive methane ‘hot spots’, many sporadic, have also been identified in recent studies. By ventilating surface waters, storms trigger emissions in the East Siberian Sea Shelf. Shallow lakes formed when permafrost thaws can belch methane from decomposing old organic deposits, of which there are huge amounts in the Arctic. All of these potentially important emissions are of a scale that still is in need of being reconciled with the atmospheric record. This presentation will give an overview of novel approaches including robot techniques ground-, boat- and airborne-based to reduce uncertainty in particular in relation to these ‘hot spot’ emissions.",

The bi-modal characteristics has been changed in 1999-2009 with the fall bloom being more significant than the spring bloom. The surface circulation pattern-4 (cyclonic RIM current and Batumi eddy) is associated with the occurrence of the fall bloom.

            "abstract": "Detailed knowledge of long-term spatio-temporal variability of the geomagnetic field is lacking because of insufficient data for times prior to 10 ka. We use numerical simulations to investigate three important questions about stability of the geodynamo process: is the present field representative of the past field; does a time-averaged field actually exist; and, supposing it exists, how long is needed to define such a field. Suitable geodynamo simulations are initially required to pass existing criteria for morphological similarity to the observed magnetic field. A further criterion is introduced to evaluate similarity of long-term temporal variations. Allowing for reasonable uncertainties in the observations, observed and synthetic axial dipole moment frequency spectra for time series of order a million years in length should be fit by the same power law model. In almost all simulations, the number of intervals considered to have poor morphological agreement between synthetic and observed field exceed those with good agreement. The time required to obtain a converged estimate of the time-averaged field was found to be comparable to the length of the simulation, even in non-reversing models, suggesting that periods of stable polarity spanning many magnetic diffusion times are needed to obtain robust estimates of the mean dipole field. Long term field variations are almost entirely attributable to the axial dipole; non-zonal components converge to long-term average values on relatively short timescales (15-20 kyr). In all simulations, the time-averaged spatial power spectrum is characterised by a zigzag pattern as a function of spherical harmonic degree, with relatively higher power in odd degrees than in even degrees. We suggest that long-term spatial characteristics of the observed field may emerge on averaging times that are within reach for the next generation of global time-varying paleomagnetic field models.",

            "abstract": "Often, scientists and small research groups collect data, which target to address issues and have limited geographic or temporal range. A large number of such collections together constitute a large database that is of immense value to Earth Science studies. Complexity of integrating these data include heterogeneity in dimensions, coordinate systems, scales, variables, providers, users and contexts. They have been defined as long-tail data. Similarly, we use “long-tail models” to characterize a heterogeneous collection of models and/or modules developed for targeted problems by individuals and small groups, which together provide a large valuable collection. Complexity of integrating across these models include differing variable names and units for the same concept, model runs at different time steps and spatial resolution, use of differing naming and reference conventions, etc. Ability to “integrate long-tail models and data” will provide an opportunity for the interoperability and reusability of communities’ resources, where not only models can be combined in a workflow, but each model will be able to discover and (re)use data in application specific context of space, time and questions. This capability is essential to represent, understand, predict, and manage heterogeneous and interconnected processes and activities by harnessing the complex, heterogeneous, and extensive set of distributed resources. Because of the staggering production rate of long-tail models and data resulting from the advances in computational, sensing, and information technologies, an important challenge arises: how can geoinformatics bring together these resources seamlessly, given the inherent complexity among model and data resources that span across various domains. We will present a semantic-based framework to support integration of “long-tail” models and data. This builds on existing technologies including: (i) SEAD (Sustainable Environmental Actionable Data) which supports curation and preservation of long-tail data during its life-cycle; (ii) BrownDog, which enhances the machine interpretability of large unstructured and uncurated data; and (iii) CSDMS (Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System), which “componentizes” models by providing plug-and-play environment for models integration.",

            "abstract": "We have produced a dated radiostratigraphy for the whole of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) from two decades of airborne radar-sounding surveys performed by The University of Kansas. This radiostratigraphy reveals a wealth of new information regarding this ice sheet’s three-dimensional structure and history. South of Jakobshavn Isbræ, most of the ice sheet is Holocene-aged. Eemian ice is mostly confined to central northern Greenland. Disrupted radiostratigraphy is often located near the onset of the largest outlet glaciers, suggesting a strong coupling between the initiation of faster ice flow and anomalous basal processes in the ice-sheet interior. Ice-flow modeling constrained by this radiostratigraphy reveals that the Holocene-averaged pattern of surface accumulation is similar to the modern pattern, but that Holocene surface-accumulation rates were substantially higher than present rates in the interior. The pattern of predicted basal melt is strongly modulated by surface accumulation, further suggesting that geothermal flux beneath the GrIS is low except in the vicinity of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream. This observation also raises the possibility that the position of the GrIS’s central ice divide is coupled to local basal conditions, including spatially varying subglacial geology and geothermal flux. The Holocene-averaged flow of the GrIS was significantly faster than at present, implying that the ice-sheet interior is presently dynamically thickening, likely due to the viscosity contrast between Holocene and Last Glacial Period ice. Englacial dielectric attenuation, inferred from the echo intensity of mapped reflections, is related to borehole-measured temperature and constrains depth-averaged englacial temperature across the GrIS. This ice-sheet-wide radiostratigraphy and its related inferences are new and powerful constraints on the dynamics of the GrIS, and they should be used to evaluate and improve the next generation of ice-sheet models.",

To elucidate the complex dynamics of this system, we study a model in which a 3-D sheet of viscous fluid with thickness\nh\nand viscosity\nγ\nη\n1\nsubducts in an ambient fluid with viscosity\nη\n1\nand depth\nD\n. Numerical solutions for the sheet's evolution are obtained using a boundary element method, starting from an initial configuration comprising a short protoslab attached to a longer horizontal plate that is free to move laterally. The dynamics of the sheet are controlled by its dimensionless `stiffness'\nS≡γ(h/\nℓ\nb\n)\n3\n, where the `bending length'\nℓ\nb\nis the sum of the lengths of the slab and of the flexural bulge. The slab's sinking speed is controlled by its own viscosity if\nS≫1\n, and by that of the ambient fluid if\nS≤1\n. Time-dependent solutions with passive tracers demonstrate a partial return flow around the leading edge of a retreating slab and return flow around its sides. A systematic investigation of the slab's interaction with the bottom boundary as a function of\nη\n2\n/\nη\n1\nand\nD/h\ndelineates a rich regime diagram of subduction modes (trench retreating, slab folding, trench advancing, etc.) that agrees well with laboratory observations. The solutions show that mode selection is controlled by the dip of the slab's leading edge at the time when it first encounters the bottom boundary. We will discuss several geophysical applications of the model, including seismic evidence for slab folding, the radius-of-curvature constraint on the slab/mantle viscosity ratio\nη\n2\n/\nη\n1\n, and the distribution of seismic anisotropy around subducting slabs.",

            "abstract": "The Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global magnetohydrodynamic magnetosphere simulation has a robust history of producing bursty bulk flow (BBFs) events in the magnetotail under a variety of solar wind conditions. Many spacecraft missions including Geotail and THEMIS have also observed BBFs. Superposed epoch analysis has been used to develop the general properties and distributions of these events. Using a set of idealized solar wind conditions we compare the results of simulations over an order of magnitude in computational range with the observed properties of BBFs. This comparison includes a detail examination of a typical BBF or flow channel event as it develops in the mid-tail region and eventually breaks in the inner magnetosphere. As these flow channels propagate Earthward they develop vortical flows at the leading edge and have field-aligned currents that couple with the ionosphere. An additional area of investigation will be to determine the factors that the to creation of a BBF in a specific location along the mid-tail reconnection line. We have also developed tools for automatically identifying the BBFs in the simulation results we compare these result via a superposed epoch analysis with similar analysis done with the Geotail and THEMIS datasets.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial lidars are increasingly being deployed in a variety of ecosystems to calibrate and validate large scale airborne and spaceborne estimates of forest structure and biomass. While these lidars provide a wealth of high resolution information on canopy structure and understory vegetation, they tend to be expensive, slow scanning and somewhat ponderous to deploy. Therefore, frequent deployments and characterization of larger areas of a hectare or more can still be challenging. This suggests a role for low cost, ultra-portable, rapid scanning (but lower resolution) instruments -- particularly in scanning extreme environments and as a way to augment and extend strategically placed scans from the more highly capable lidars.\nThe Canopy Biomass Lidar (CBL) is an inexpensive, highly portable, fast-scanning (33 seconds), time-of-flight, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) instrument, built in collaboration with RIT, by U Mass Boston. The instrument uses a 905nm SICK time of flight laser with a 0.25o resolution and 30m range. The higher resolution, full-waveform Dual Wavelength Echidna® Lidar (DWEL), developed by Boston University, U Mass Lowell and U Mass Boston, builds on the Australian CSIRO single wavelength, full-waveform Echidna® Validation Instrument (EVI), but utilizes two simultaneous laser pulses at 1064 and 1548 nm to separate woody returns from those of foliage at a range of up to 100m range.\nThe UMass Boston CBL has been deployed in rangelands (San Joaquin Experimental Range, CA), high altitude conifers (Sierra National Forest, CA), mixed forests (Harvard Forest LTER MA), tropical forests (La Selva and Sirena Biological Stations, Costa Rica), eucalypts (Karawatha, Brisbane TERN, Australia), and woodlands (Alice Holt Forest, UK), frequently along-side the DWEL, as well as in more challenging environments such as mangrove forests (Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica) and Massachusetts salt marshes and eroding bluffs (Plum Island LTER, and UMass Boston Nantucket Field Station). Multiple hemispherical point clouds can be combined to generate detailed reconstructions of ecosystem biomass and structure. By combining these scans and reconstructions, the strengths of the DWEL can be coupled with the speed and portability of the CBL to extrapolate comprehensive structure information to larger areas.",

            "abstract": "For over a century vegetation has been removed from channels and coastal zones to facilitate navigation and development. In recent decades, however, we have recognized the ecologic and economic benefits of aquatic vegetation. It buffers against coastal eutrophication, damps waves and coastal storm surge, provides habitat, inhibits bank erosion, and provides significant carbon storage. The management of watersheds and coastal zones has turned from vegetation removal to restoration. In the past 20 years, the study of vegetation hydrodynamics has accelerated to meet the need to understand feedbacks between vegetation, flow and sediment transport. This presentation will describe key features of vegetation hydrodynamics, first at the meadow scale and then at the scale of individual patches, examining how vegetation density and meadow (or patch) morphology impact flow, with subsequent implications for sediment fate. Finally, the talk highlights differences in turbulence generation between bare and vegetated beds that may limit the transfer of open channel sediment transport models to vegetated channels, creating the future challenge of defining sediment transport models appropriate for vegetated regions.",

In this presentation, recent results on the global characterization of the subtropical cloud transition from satellite data are used to illustrate its essential properties and the key questions remaining for a complete understanding of the transition. Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and observations of the cloud transition are used to develop parameterizations, simple models of the transition and a better understanding of the dynamics that leads to the ultimate demise of stratocumulus and its potential impact on climate change.",

Current climate models are still far from realistically representing clouds. Improving the representation of clouds in climate models is therefore fundamental to improving our confidence in climate projections. In particular boundary layer clouds (often also referred to as low clouds) are central to the entire cloud/climate feedback debate. Remote sensing techniques from space to probe the structure of cloudy boundary layers are discussed in detail. New methodologies to utilize these new measurements from space to improve parameterizations of the cloudy boundary layer in climate models are also presented.",

All traditional theoretical methods produce FCN period near 460 days with PREM, while the precise observations (VLBI + SG tides) say it should be near 430 days. In order to fill this big gap, astronomers and geophysicists give various assumptions, e.g., increasing core-mantle-boundary (CMB) flattening by about 5%, a strong coupling between nutation and geomagnetic field near CMB, viscous coupling, or topographical coupling etc. Do we really need these unproved assumptions? or is it only the problem of these traditional theoretical methods themselves? Earth models (e.g. PREM) provide accurate and robust profiles of physical parameters, like density and Lame parameters, but their radial derivatives, which are also used in all traditional methods to calculate normal modes (e.g.. FCN), nutation and tides of non-rigid earth theoretically, are not so trustable as the parameters themselves. A new multiple layer spectral method is proposed and applied to the computation of normal modes, to avoid these problems. This new method can solve not only one order ellipsoid but also irregular asymmetric 3D earth model. Our primary result of the FCN period is 435 sidereal days.",

Its contributing elements however may correspond to a range of strategies of life-cycle function; more specifically, plants with different hydraulic strategies may co-exist in the same environment but convey contrasting patterns of response to the hydroclimatic driver. The current generation of land-surface models treats plant hydraulic relations in a simplified fashion. There is still limited understanding whether such an approach can be reliable, particularly when vegetation performance during drought intervals is of concern. This research highlights examples of hydraulic differences in plant function in the above-surface and below-surface domains, using observations and numerical analysis.

            "abstract": "Aerosol optical depth (AOD), the column-integrated ambient aerosol light extinction, is determined from satellite and ground-based remote sensing measurements. AOD is the parameter most often used to validate earth system model simulations of aerosol mass. Relating aerosol mass to AOD, however, is problematic due to issues including aerosol water uptake as a function of relative humidity (RH) and the complicated relationship between aerosol physicochemical properties and light extinction. Measurements of aerosol microphysical, chemical, and optical properties help to constrain the relationship between aerosol mass and optical depth because aerosol extinction at ambient RH is a function of the abundance, composition and size distribution of the aerosol.\nWe use vertical profiles of humidity and dry aerosol extinction observed in the southeastern United States (U.S.) to examine the relationship between submicron aerosol mass concentration and extinction at ambient RH. We show that the κ-Köhler parameterization directly, and without additional Mie calculations, describes the change in extinction with varying RH as a function of composition for both aged aerosols typical of the polluted summertime continental boundary layer and the biomass burning aerosols we encountered. We calculate how AOD and the direct radiative effect in the eastern U.S. have likely changed due to trends in aerosol composition in recent decades. We also examine the sensitivity of AOD to the RH profile and to aerosol composition, size distribution and abundance.",

            "abstract": "The bandwidth and coherence coefficient of lower-band whistler mode waves are analyzed using THEMIS waveform data for rising tone, falling tone, and hiss-like emissions separately. We also evaluate their dependences on the spatial location, electron density, the ratio of plasma frequency to local electron gyrofrequency, and the wave amplitude. Our results show that the bandwidth normalized by the local electron gyrofrequency (fce) of rising and falling tones is very narrow (~0.01 fce), much smaller than that of the hiss-like emissions (~0.025 fce). Meanwhile, with the increasing wave amplitude, the normalized bandwidth of discrete emissions gradually decreases, whereas that of hiss-like emissions increases slowly. The coherence coefficient of rising and falling tones is extremely large (~1), while the coherence coefficient of hiss-like emissions is a little smaller, but is still larger than 0.5. For all categories of whistler-mode waves, the normalized bandwidth increases at larger L-shells. Furthermore, the normalized bandwidth is positively correlated with the ratio of plasma frequency to local electron gyrofrequency, but is inversely correlated with the electron density. Interaction between radiation belt electrons and whistler mode waves has been widely described within quasi-linear diffusion theory. Our observations show that the quasi-linear theory is not entirely applicable for modeling electron interaction with rising and falling tones due to their narrow bandwidth and high coherence coefficient. However, it is suitable to simulate wave-particle interaction between electrons and hiss-like emissions. Moreover, the correlations between the normalized bandwidth of chorus waves (especially the discrete emissions) and other parameters may provide insights for the generation mechanism of chorus waves.",

This talk will survey the range of current statistical methods that are available to estimate the tails of a distribution and to quantify the uncertainty in those estimates. A particularly useful recent development is the combination of extreme value distributions with (Bayesian) hierarchical models that can include the dependence of parameters across spatial locations, trends over time, and the effects of other variables. These techniques are applied to pattern scaling as an example of extending model experiments beyond mean quantities to lesscertain climate statistics such as extremes.",

            "abstract": "Paleosols (fossil soils) preserved in ancient floodplain systems represent one of the most widely used and potentially powerful continental paleoclimatic archives. At the same time, to apply most of the quantitative paleoclimate proxies requires the deconvolution of floodplain dynamics from pedogenic processes. For example, a paleosol could be weakly developed because of low atmospheric CO2 levels, low amounts of precipitation, or because of short formation duration due to frequent channel avulsion. The interpretation of local floodplain dynamics in paleo-floodplain systems is often simplistic, assuming both straightforward uniformitarianism and also that a single vertical section represents that lateral diversity of environments, however, these assumptions have rarely, if ever, been put to the test. Herein, a variety of paleoclimatic and paleobiological proxies will be examined in well-preserved paleo-floodplain settings in Spain, Wyoming, and Montana to test those assumptions. Multi-proxy (phytolith, stable isotope) paleovegetation studies along paleo-floodplain transects in Montana (Miocene, Eocene) indicate substantial heterogeneity at the scale of tens to hundreds of meters, floodplain dynamics-driven succession, and cryptic paludal or everwet areas that are not recognizable purely on the basis of sedimentology. Similarly, rapidly aggrading floodplains in fluvial distributary systems (Spain, Miocene) or in dryland basins (Montana) often record significant mismatches between paleosol-based and paleobotanically based estimates of paleoprecipitation, likely due to variable sediment accumulation rates. Both of those sets of results indicate that single vertical sections are unlikely to represent the breadth floodplain environments and properties operating across paleo-floodplain systems. In contrast, newly described mineralogical proxies based on rock magnetics that can be used to reconstruct paleoclimatic/paleoenvironmental properties appear to be robust at the km-scale, and also to reflect the position of the paleo-water table, suggesting they are less subject to floodplain-scale variability in sediment supply or channel dynamics and may provide new tools for linking modern process-based floodplain observations and measurements to paleo-floodplain settings.",

There were 10 gully type debris flows by landslides were triggered while no debris flow was triggered in the 12 neighboring catchments. The hydrological conditions in the different sub-catchments within short distance were almost identical during this large range rainfall event. Neighboring catchments with similar geological conditions were available and could be selected. Therefore the only decisive factors for debris flow formation which differ in these sub-catchments must be related to topography. The gradient range of 25 - 45 degrees shows to be most sensitive for the triggering of debris flows. The catchment size A, the average gradient of a stream J, and the percentage (S) of catchment area with hill terrain gradient (25° - 45°) are selected as the topographical parameters. A new factor T = SJ0.8(A/A0)0.15 (A0 is unit catchment size = 1km2) is proposed as a single topographical indicator, which may be used as a threshold for the formation of gully type debris flows by landslides. The probability of debris flow formation increases with increasing T-values. The role of the slope gradient and the average gradient of a stream are far more important than the role of catchment size. The T-factor was successfully validated in debris flow gullies with the same initiation mechanism in the Dayi area, Guizhou, China. It may be used for other areas with the geological factor and rainfall factor because the relationship is partly from the formation mechanism of gully type debris flow by landslides.",

            "abstract": "There have been growing interests in the large-height swell-like wave (LSW) in the east coast of Korea because such big waves have caused human victims as well as damages to facilities such as breakwaters in the coast. The LSW was found to be generated due to an atmospherically great valley in the north area of the East Sea and then propagate long distance to the east coast of Korea in prominently southwest direction (Oh et al., 2010).\nIn this study, we will perform two methods, real-time data based and numerical-model based predictions in order to predict the LSW in the east coast of Korea. First, the real-time data based prediction method uses information which is collected by the directional wave gauge installed near Sokcho. Using the wave model SWAN (Booij et al., 1999) and the wave ray method (Munk and Arthur, 1952), we will estimate wave data in open sea from the real-time data and predict the travel time of LSW from the measurement site (near Sokcho) to several target points in the east coast of Korea. Second, the numerical-model based method uses three different numerical models; WW3 in deep water, SWAN in shallow water, and CADMAS-SURF for wave run-up (CDIT). The surface winds from the 72 hours prediction system of NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) GFS (Global Forecast System) will be inputted in finer grids after interpolating these in certain domains of WW3 and SWAN models. The significant wave heights and peak wave directions predicted by the two methods will be compared to the measured data of LSW at several target points near the coasts. Further, the prediction method will be improved using more measurement sites which will be installed in the future.\n",

            "abstract": "Understanding hydrologic model uncertainty and meaningful representation of hydrological processes leads to more reliable hydrologic forecasts, which can be in particular critical under extreme hydrometeorologic conditions. Therefore, hydrologic model development and evaluation should not only focus on the simulated streamflow (model output), but also on other key land surface variables. However, scale discrepancy between available observations and modeling resolution is often neglected.\nIn this study we introduce multiscale and multivariable parameter estimation approach to bridge the scaling gap. The basic components of this framework include the mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM 5.1, http://www.ufz.de/mhm) and the multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique. This framework enables assimilation of various sources of information at their native spatial scales. Additionally, it allows to scrutinize model simultaneously at multiple spatial scales.\nThe application of this framework is demonstrated over 7 large European basins and evaluated for 350 smaller basins. Besides traditional calibration of hydrologic model against observed discharge, model parametrization is further constrained by a range of other variables available at different spatial scales: GRACE terrestrial water storage content (1° × 1° resolution), eddy flux data (≈500 m footprint) and ESA soil moisture product (0.25° × 0.25° resolution). Initial results shows that model parameterization constrained by streamflow only can not be outperformed. However, while parameterization based on complementary data sets leads to slight deterioration in streamflow performance, this marginal loss is balanced by improved simulation of other model states and fluxes. This becomes beneficial especially during the forecast applications, for which correct model initialization is crucial.",

The Magnetotelluric (MT) method is well suited to map the depth to the LAB. The electric lithosphere is defined as the resistive outer shell overlying a highly conducting zone (astenosphere) in the upper mantle. A few extensive field campaigns have been undertaken in the Summers of 2011 to 2014 within the framework of the project “Magnetotellurics in the Scandes”. The MaSca survey crosses two important boundaries: (i) the transition zone from the stable Precambrian cratonic interior to passive continental margin beneath the Caledonian orogen and the Scandinavian Mountains in western Fennoscandia; (ii) the boundary between the Archaean and Proterozoic crust and upper mantle. In this study we present the electrical resistivity models obtained from 279 MT sites (70 long-period stations among them) acquired from 2011 to 2013. We also used other sources of data available in the study area: the IMAGE observatory data, the BEAR array and two small arrays of Finnish Geological Survey (GTK). We present the results of 2D lithospheric-scale inversions obtained along four selected profiles: three profiles are NW-SE directed, thought to be perpendicular to estimated regional strike and one profile crosses the Archaean-Proterozoic boundary, thus NE-SW directed. The final interpretation models revealed thickest lithosphere is in the Palaeoproterozoic Svecofennian province and reaches depth of 300 km. The Archaean lithosphere is thinner, with depth of 200 km to 250 km.",

            "abstract": "The combined effects of tectonic and climatic forcing govern the evolution of landscapes, modifying erosional processes, changing river profiles, and ultimately impacting depositional systems. The complexity of the response, however, often means that we cannot predict a priori how a given landscape will react to climatic changes.\nThe Del Medio catchment is located in the Humahuaca Basin, an intermontane valley of the Eastern Cordillera. This area coincides with a climatic divide between a sub-humid and a semi-arid environment. An extensive debris-flow fan sourced in the Del Medio catchment covers ca. 18.6 km2 of the lower basin. To investigate rates and timing of its evolution, we analyzed cosmogenic 10Be concentrations on large boulders from the fan surface, river sands and pebbles in 3 active channels, a depth profile, and bedrock exposed atop the drainage basin margins. Our CRN results illustrate the rapid rate at which the fan surface is subject to change, with each of the 16 analyzed boulder samples providing ages of < 400 years. The 15-m deep depth profile exposes three cycles of activity in the recent past. In addition, river sands record very high denudation rates (from several mm/yr to tens of mm/yr), despite bedrock denudation rates of < 0.04 mm/yr from most bedrock ridges. Interestingly, modern pebbles from tributaries with recent landslide activity consistently yield denudation rates that are faster than those from sands, while tributaries without landslide activity show the opposite pattern, documenting the importance of grain-size dependency for inferring the main mechanism of sediment transport within a catchment.\nFarther upstream in the more arid Humahuaca Basin, abandoned fluvial terrace sequences have been linked to wetter episodes during the late Quaternary. Within those fills, preliminary paleo-denudation rates reach values similar to those currently observed in the Del Medio catchment, while modern denudation rates from river sands are similar to the low rates observed from bedrock ridges. Taken together, these observations indicate that the Del Medio fan could be a modern analog of those older fill sequences, providing a unique opportunity to link present-day processes to those that were likely active in the past during wetter climate episodes.",

This is a remarkably large discrepancy - mineralogical models for the mantle and the outer core match the observed velocities to around 1%. In no other large volume of the Earth does such a difference exist. There have been a number of arguments put forward over the years to account for the difference, but none have been universally accepted and our inability to explain the seismic velocities of the inner core remains an uncomfortable truth.\nHere, we present results from ab initio molecular dynamics calculations performed at 360 GPa and core temperatures on hcp and fcc iron, and on fcc-Fe alloyed with nickel and hcp-Fe alloyed with silicon. The calculated shear modulus, and therefore seismic velocities, of pure hcp-Fe reduces dramatically just prior to melting, providing an elegant explanation for the observed velocities. Calculations on fcc-Fe show no such strong reduction in VS, with a transformation to an hcp-type structure prior to melting; addition of 6.5 atm% and 13 atm% Ni to fcc-Fe raises the temperature of this transition.\nWhen silicon is added to hcp-Fe, the pre-melting behaviour is found to be very similar to that of pure hcp-Fe with a strong nonlinear shear weakening just before melting and a corresponding reduction in VS. Because temperatures range from T/Tm = 1 at the inner-outer core boundary to T/Tm ≈ 0.99 at the centre, this strong nonlinear effect on VS should occur in the inner core, providing a compelling explanation for the low VS observed.",

The relationships among them are mutually responding and driving, and they have attracted much more attention in the context of global change. With great challenges of traditional spatiotemporal analysis to deal with their relationships, we propose a novel algorithm for exploring marine association patterns before / when / after ENSO occurrence using the remote sensing images at large scale. The main works are as follows.\nFirstly, monthly anomalies are defined and used to represent marine abnormal changes, and their quantitative levels are calculated with a continuous interval to represent intensity of variations.\nSecondly, this paper designs a recursive mining algorithm to find frequent items within the context of ENSO occurrence. The key implementations are as follows.\nStep 1: Scan the database one time, for each item, i.e. marine parameter, and each variation type, i.e. -2, -1, 0, 1 and 2, calculate its probability, denoted as, and conditional probability when ENSO occurrence, denoted as, respectively, where, i is one of marine parameters, K is one of variation types of marine parameters, L is one of variation types of ENSO events. And find the frequent 1-items if and only if is not less than.\nStep 2: Generate candidate 2-items according to the Apriori’s linking algorithm, and for each candidate 2-item scan the database, calculate its probability and conditional probability when ENSO occurrence, and generate frequent 2-items.\nStep 3: Generate frequent (m+1)-items from m-items using a recursive algorithm with “Linking-Pruning-Generating”, where m is not less than 2. In Linking phase, Apriori’s linking algorithm is done to generate the candidate (m+1)-items, Pruning phase is to remove the (m+1)-items whose sub items are not frequent on the property of non- monotonicity, while Generation phase is to generate the frequent (m+1)-items by checking its conditional probability when ENSO occurrence is great than its probability in databases.\nFinally, marine bio-optical and dynamical parameters over Pacific Ocean from remote sensing imagery with periods from January 1998 to December 2012 are selected to demonstrate the algorithm and discover their ENSO-related spatiotemporal association patterns.",

            "abstract": "During the last decade, significant efforts have been directed towards establishing and improving flood forecasting systems for large river basins. Examples include the European Flood Alert System, and the Bureau of Meteorology Flood Warning Systems in Australia. A number of attempts have also been made to increase the accuracy of the forecasted flood volumes from these systems. One attractive way in which this can be achieved is to use remotely sensed surface soil moisture contents to constrain the hydrologic model predictions. Satellite missions such as SMOS can provide very useful information on the wetness conditions of these basins, which in many cases is an important initial condition for discharge generation. Assimilation of these satellite data is thus a logical way to proceed. We will present results from two different assimilation strategies for the Murray-Darling basin in Australia using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Firstly, the SMOS soil moisture data are assimilated into the hydrologic model at their original spatial resolution. As the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data (25 km) is coarser than the spatial resolution of the model (10 km), a multiscale data assimilation algorithm needs to be implemented. Secondly, the SMOS data are downscaled to the model resolution, prior to their assimilation. In this presentation, the impact of the assimilation of both products on the accuracy of the forecasted flood volumes is assessed.",

            "abstract": "With more than 3,000 Gt of carbon released over ≤10 ka [1-3], the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) arguably represents our closest geologic analogue for the long-term effects of present-day and future fossil fuel carbon combustion. The PETM carbon isotopic excursion (CIE) was initiated at ~55.9 Ma [4] and lasted for ~170 ka [5]. This event was associated with pronounced ocean acidification, recently reported to amount to a drop in oceanic mixed-layer pH on the order of 0.3 pH units at the central North Pacific Shatsky Rise [6].\nHere, a new boron isotope record (expressed in δ11B) will be presented from mixed-layer dwelling foraminiferal species Morozovella subbotinae across the PETM from DSDP Site 401 in the North Atlantic. We convert the δ11B data into mixed layer pH, complemented by elemental records and new carbon and oxygen isotope data generated from the same samples. Our records cover the time interval from about 300 ka prior to the CIE to more than 400 ka after the CIE. The bulk carbonate content decreased from 80 to 30 wt% at the onset of the CIE, but calcareous microfossils in the interval show no signs of carbonate dissolution [7, and this study].\nWe find significantly lowered pH for almost 100 ka following the CIE onset and furthermore, no complete post-PETM recovery of surface ocean pH to pre-PETM values, likely tracing the longer-term climatic trajectories leading to the subsequent Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM 2) [8]. Based on this surface ocean pH record, atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the PETM are estimated using the GENIE Earth System Model [9, 10].\n",

            "abstract": "Polar cap patches, which are islands of enhanced plasma density drifting anti-sunward, are one of the outstanding phenomena in the polar cap F region ionosphere. In the last decade, data from all-sky airglow imagers have been extensively used for better understanding the propagation of patches in the central polar cap region. But still, it has been rather difficult to capture the birth of patches in their generation region near the dayside cusp, because, in most places, the dayside part of the polar cap ionosphere is sunlit even in winter. In Longyearbyen (78.1N, 15.5E), Norway, however, optical observations are possible near the dayside cusp region in a limited period around the winter solstice. This enables us to directly image how polar cap patches are born in the cusp. In this paper, we present a few intervals of daytime optical observations, during which polar cap patches were generated within the field-of-view of an all-sky imager in Longyearbyen. During all the intervals studied here, we identified several signatures of poleward moving auroral forms (PMAF) in the equatorward half of the field-of-view, which are known as ionospheric manifestations of dayside reconnection. Interestingly, patches were directly produced from such poleward moving auroral signatures and propagated poleward along the anti-sunward convection near the cusp. In the literature, Lorentzen et al. (2012) first reported such a direct production of patches from PMAFs. During the current observations, however, we succeeded in tracking the propagation of patches until they reached the poleward edge of the field-of-view of the imager. This confirms that the faint airglow structures produced from PMAFs were actually transported for a long distance towards the central polar cap area; thus, polar cap patches were produced. From this set of observations, we suggest that polar cap patches during moderately disturbed conditions (i.e, non-storm time conditions) can be directly produced by the transient aurora in the cusp, i.e., the periodic occurrence of dayside equatorial reconnection process. This implies that the fundamental characteristics of patches (i.e., repetition period, shape, luminosity etc.) are primarily determined by the nature of the pulsed reconnection process on the dayside equatorial magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "Understanding, characterizing, and modeling hydrodynamic mixing and transport in unsteady and turbulent flows remains a tremendous challenge despite decades of work. A wide array of techniques have been applied to mixing, ranging from statistical mechanics to stochastic modeling to decompositions of the flow field into discrete coherent structures. Recent years have seen significant progress in applying the tools and methods of dynamical systems theory to turbulent mixing. Such methods are usually applied in the Lagrangian framework, and are based on studying advection directly. Using data from quasi-two-dimensional laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, I will discuss the roles played by one particular mixing diagnostic: so-called Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs). LCSs are defined to be distinguished material lines that are the dominant barriers to fluid transport and that organize advection. Here, I will demonstrate that they also play other roles. In particular, I will show that they separate regions of the flow field with distinct spectral dynamics, that they act as aligning structures for transported anisotropic particles, and that they can be attractors for self-motile particles.",

Ground based and airborne measurements were taken in remote desert regions of Mali, Mauritania and Algeria. This presentation will show new in-situ aircraft measurements of Saharan dust from the 2011 flights, with size distributions extending to 300 μm, representing measurements extending further into the coarse mode than previously published for airborne Saharan dust. A significant coarse mode was present in the size distribution measurements with effective diameter from 2.3 to 19.4 μm and coarse mode volume median diameter from 5.8 to 45.3 μm. The mean size distribution had a larger relative proportion of coarse mode particles than previous aircraft measurements with significant contribution from the ‘giant mode’ – particles larger than 38 microns.\nProperties of dust size distribution and optical properties will be presented in relation to dust age since uplift, dust event type and altitude. Vertical distributions of dust over desert (for both fresh and aged dust events) and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean from 42 aircraft profiles will be presented, demonstrating how size distributions and optical properties change during the early stages of the dust lifecycle. Size distributions show a loss of 60 to 90% of particles larger than 30 microns 12 h after uplift. Single scattering albedo increases from 0.92 to 0.94 to 0.95 between fresh, aged, and Eastern Atlantic dust profiles. Finally the impact of transport and changing optical properties on the radiative effect of dust will be examined.",

            "abstract": "The complex land-sea distribution and topography of the maritime continent acts to disrupt or even completely block the eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific. This leads to changes in tropical latent heat release and subsequent impacts on global circulation. Convection over the maritime continent is dominated by the diurnal cycle. Where the mean diurnal cycle is strong (over the islands and surrounding seas), 80% of the MJO precipitation signal in the maritime continent is accounted for by changes in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle. The canonical view of the MJO as the smooth eastward propagation of a large-scale precipitation envelope also breaks down over the islands of the Maritime Continent. Instead, a vanguard of precipitation jumps ahead of the main body by approximately 6 days or 2000 km. Hence, there can be enhanced precipitation over Sumatra, Borneo or New Guinea when the large-scale MJO envelope over the surrounding ocean is one of suppressed precipitation. This behaviour is discussed in terms of an interaction between the diurnal cycle and the MJO circulation. The diurnal cycle is also strong in the ocean. Seaglider measurements taken during the CINDY/DYNAMO campaign show the existence of a diurnal warm layer in the upper few metres of the ocean. This has a significant effect on the surface fluxes, of an order of Watts per square metre. The diurnal warm layer is favoured during the inactive phase of the MJO and may act to help precondition the atmosphere to convection. The activities of the MJO Task Force and Subseasonal to Seasonal Prediction project will be discussed in this context.",

            "abstract": "Urban drainage networks have been developed to promote the efficiency of a system in terms of drainage time so far. Typically, a drainage system is designed to drain water from developed areas promptly as much as possible during floods. In this regard, an artificial drainage system have been considered to be more efficient compared to river networks in nature. This study examined artificial drainage networks and the results indicate they can be less efficient in terms of network configuration compared with river networks, which is counter-intuitive. The case study of 20 catchments in Seoul, South Korea shows that they have wide range of efficiency in terms of network configuration and consequently, drainage time. This study also demonstrates that efficient drainage networks are more sensitive to spatial and temporal rainfall variation such as rainstorm movement. Peak flows increase more than two times greater in effective drainage networks compared with inefficient and highly sinuous drainage networks. Combining these results, this study implies that the layout of a drainage network is an important factor in terms of efficient drainage and also safety in urban catchments. Design of an optimal layout of the drainage network can be an alternative non-structural measures that mitigate potential risks and it is crucial for the sustainability of urban environments.",

            "abstract": "Global surface temperature plays a significant role in the public perception of climate change. However, observations are not uniformly distributed over the surface of the planet. The lack of data for the rapidly warming Arctic in the Met Office HadCRUT4 dataset has led to a systematic underestimation of the rate of warming over the past decade and a half. Smaller biases have also been detected in other versions of the temperature record.\nThis underestimation of recent temperature trends is one contributory factor (of several) to the apparent 'hiatus' in global warming. The use of the putative hiatus as an argument against action on global warming has created a social context in which what should have been a minor technical paper appeared to take on a much greater significance. From a scientific perspective, the apparent hiatus is irrelevant to our understanding of long term greenhouse warming, and should therefore have no bearing on policy. However the misinformation context into which science is communicated means that any scientific work can take on a policy significance which is determined not by the work itself, but by the societal context.\nThis raises challenging ethical questions for scientists. In an information environment in which interested parties have already attached policy implications to many aspects of climate science, it becomes impossible to publish or communicate a scientific work without implicitly taking a position. Different segments of the public have different and often contradictory perceptions of the scientific context, and as a result the words of the scientist may convey completely different messages to different hearers. Communicating science in a way which does not mislead is difficult, however abandoning the effort at communication can lead to the public being more misled.",

            "abstract": "Much of the United States faces growing risks from wildfire. Collectively and individually, these wildfires can profoundly affect water flow and quality both within and downstream of the areas burned. Given their extent and tendency to have large severe patch sizes, megafires can have substantial watershed effects that include areas with slow or improbable recovery. Management efforts to engineer community resilience through restoring fire or other broad scale fuels treatments can also affect flow regimes. Restoration efforts often include thinning uncharacteristically high stand densities, creating heterogeneous structural patterns, or shifting species composition towards more fire-tolerant and often more drought-tolerant species. The strategic intent is to increase landscape resilience even as wildfire or climate regimes worsen. Prioritization efforts that affect how landscapes are managed also balance the needs of human communities, including municipal water supplies, while reducing the societal costs of wildfire response. Thus, the overall effects of wildfire represent a combined, synergistic interaction of the wildfires and management actions taken to mitigate their potential effects. Strategic plans such as the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy and individual State Forest Action Plans provide forums for assessing system-wide interactions of fire and water, but implementation is challenging. This talk presents the strategic thinking behind existing efforts, outlines how water-associated tradeoffs can be integrated, and illustrates the utility of existing hydrological, climate and vegetation datasets and models to establish scenarios and directional likelihoods that illuminate planning options.",

            "abstract": "El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the stratosphere are two prominent tropical phenomena on the interannual timescale. In this work, we analyze the effect of ENSO on the QBO utilizing an atmospheric general circulation model in a comprehensive experimental setup. We construct two ensembles of different QBO initial conditions, with the onset of a westerly (QBOW) and easterly (QBOE) jet at 10 hPa. In the course of a 18 months simulation period, the two sets of initial conditions experience each El Nino (EL) and La Nina (LA) SSTs as boundary conditions.\nDue to the increased tropospheric temperatures during EL conditions compared to LA conditions, the simulation shows an increase in tropospheric wave activity which increases QBO forcing in the stratosphere in EL. The underlying easterly jet of QBOW is weaker during EL compared to LA, while the underlying westerly jet of QBOE is stronger during EL compared to LA. On one hand, the weaker underlying jet in QBOW and the increase in QBO forcing due to waves cause a faster downward propagation of the westerly jet of QBOW during EL. On the other hand, the stronger underlying jet of QBOE opposes the increased QBO forcing due to waves for QBOE during EL. Therefore the downward propagation speed of the easterly jet of QBOE is similar during EL and LA conditions. Changes in stratospheric tropical upwelling associated with EL and LA do not affect QBO properties in the simulation.",

            "abstract": "Geographic information science and the coupled database and software systems that have grown from it have been evolving since the early 1990s. The multi-file shapefile package, invented early in this evolution, is an example of a highly generalized file format that can be used as an archival, interchange, and format for program execution. There are other formats, such as GeoTIFF and NetCDF that have similar characteristics. These de-facto standard (in contrast to the formally defined and published standards) formats, while not initially designed for machine-readable web-services, are used in them extensively. Relying on these formats allows legacy software to be adapted to web-services, but may require complicate software development to handle dynamic introspection of these legacy file formats’ metadata. A generalized system of web-service types that offer archive, interchange, and run-time capabilities based on commonly implemented file formats and established web-service specifications has emerged from exemplar implementations. For example, an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service is used to serve sites or model polygons and an OGC Sensor Observation Service provides time series data for the sites. The broad system of data formats, web-service types, and freely available software that implements the system will be described. The presentation will include a perspective on the future of this basic system and how it relates to scientific domain specific information models such as the Open Geospatial Consortium standards for geographic, hydrologic, and hydrogeologic data.",

            "abstract": "Rockfalls, debris flows and rock avalanches represent a major natural hazard for the population in mountainous, volcanic and coastal areas but their direct observation on the field is very difficult. Recent field studies showed that gravitational instabilities can be detected, localized and characterized thanks to the seismic signal they generate. Therefore, a burning challenge for risks assessment related to these events is to obtain quantiative informations on the characteristics of the rockfalls (mass, speed, extension,...) from the properties of the signal (seismic energy, frequencies,...).\nUsing a theoretical model of viscoelastic impact of a sphere on a plane, we develop analytical scaling laws relating the energy radiated in elastic waves, the energy dissipated in viscoelasticity during the impact and the frequencies of the generated acoustic signal to the mass m and the impact speed Vz of the sphere and to the elastic parameters of the involved materials. The elastic energy is shown to vary as m5/3Vz11/5 on plates and as mVz13/5 on blocks, regardless of the elastic parameters. The energy dissipated in viscoelasticity does not depend on the support thickness and varies as m2/3Vz11/5. The mean frequency of the generated signal is inversely proportional to the impact duration.\nThen, we conduct simple laboratory experiments that consist in dropping spherical beads of different size and materials and small gravels on thin plates of glass and Plexiglass and rock blocks. The elastic energy emitted by an impact on the supports is first quantitatively estimated and compared to the potential energy of fall and to the potential energy change during the shock. We observe a quantitative agreement between experimental data and the analytical scaling laws, even when we use small gravels instead of spherical beads as impactors. These experiments allows to valid the theoretical model and to establish the energy budget of an impact. In the experiments, piezoelectric accelerometers are used to record the signals in a wide frequency range: 1 Hz to 56 kHz. The experiments are also monitored optically using fast cameras.",

            "abstract": "Unraveling the P–T–t evolution of deep crustal rocks requires the use of multiple high-temperature geochronometers integrated with careful petrography and quantitative phase equilibria modeling. As an example, in situ U–Pb monazite ages and Lu–Hf garnet geochronology are used to distinguish mineral parageneses associated with overprinting suprasolidus metamorphic events in migmatitic paragneisses and orthogneisses from the Fosdick migmatite–granite complex in West Antarctica. Then phase equilibria modeling is used to quantify the P–T conditions for each event.\nIn the Fosdick complex, U–Pb monazite ages define two populations at 365–300 Ma (minor population; cores of polychronic grains) and 120–96 Ma (dominant population; monochronic grains and rims of polychronic grains). For seven samples, Lu–Hf ages of garnet range from 116 to 111 Ma, which are interpreted to record the approximate timing of peak metamorphism during the overprinting Cretaceous metamorphic event. Phase equilibria modeling constrains peak P–T conditions to 720–800°C at 0.45–1.0 GPa for the older (Devonian–Carboniferous) metamorphic event and 850–880°C at 0.65–0.80 GPa for the overprinting Cretaceous event. This younger metamorphic event is dominant throughout the Fosdick complex; it has extensively reworked evidence of the older metamorphic event as indicated by resorbed Devonian–Carboniferous cores of polychronic monazite grains that are always surrounded by Cretaceous overgrowths.\nWithin the Cretaceous monazite population, the paucity of ages predating peak metamorphism suggests that prograde monazite growth was limited or prograde monazite was obliterated. Y-enriched overgrowths on monazite spatially associated with cordierite and biotite yield ages of 106–97 Ma, which are interpreted to record growth during breakdown of garnet in the presence of melt in the course of exhumation and cooling of the complex. Most monazite in the Cretaceous population yields ages that range from 106 to 96 Ma with a peak at c. 100 Ma. The c. 100 Ma age, which post-dates the metamorphic peak and corresponds to the timing of regional extension and exhumation of the complex, is interpreted to record crystallization of residual melt along grain boundaries throughout cooling to an elevated solidus.",

            "abstract": "We investigate mantle rocks associated with hydration, dehydration and shear above the Farallon flat-slab at its contact with the base of North America. The rocks we focus on are ultramafic inclusions hosted within serpentinized ultramafic microbreccia diatremes of the Navajo Volcanic Field (New Mexico) that erupted to the surface at the waning stages of the Laramide orogeny. A large number of petrological and geochronological studies have pinpointed the origin of these rocks to the hydrated mantle wedge above the Farallon slab as well as tectonically eroded and entrained fragments of the plate interface. We combine petrological observations and EBSD measurements of olivine grainsize and LPO to examine the effects of hydration on olivine fabric development in different parts of the supra-subduction zone mantle. The rocks examined include weakly deformed to strongly foliated tectonites we interpret to represent partially hydrated fragments of the upper plate mantle; and mylonites and ultramylonites we interpret to represent deformed fragments of the plate interface. The rocks deformed at temperatures ranging from 500-900°C based on thermometry, and olivine compositions in some record heating just before incorporation in the diatreme mix. We observe the following:\nTectonites exhibit A-type bulk olivine LPOs, but show transitions to B-type LPO in local, fine-grained, dynamically recrystallized regions associated with hydrous minerals.\nMylonites and ultramylonites with stable chlorite and/or antigorite and recrystallized grainsizes of less than 10µm show strong B-type olivine LPOs. \nA single mylonite with recrystallized grainsizes of ~35µm shows evidence for prograde metamorphism and dehydration through the chlorite breakdown reaction at temperatures above ~770°C. It contains no hydrous minerals and shows a strong A-type olivine LPO.\nTogether these rocks demonstrate a strong correlation between hydration under high stress conditions, and B-type olivine LPO, consistent with experimental studies that indicate this fabric forms at high water contents and high stress. If interpreted in terms of supra-subduction zone seismic anisotropy, these rocks are consistent with a transition from trench-parallel fast directions close to the trench to trench-perpendicular fast directions away from the trench.",

            "abstract": "The accessibility, complexity, and data-richness of the North American Cordillera have made this region an excellent, and often utilized, laboratory for broadening our understanding of the interactions between orogenesis, paleotopography, and paleoclimate. Regional studies have developed a broad range of topographical proxies that frequently support multiple theoretical and physical models of Cordilleran evolution. In an effort to address this complexity and more tightly constrain the parameter space of changing Cordilleran elevations, recent studies have combined paleoelevation proxy data with numerical simulation of climate. Here we connect climate simulation and stable isotopic elevation proxies to investigate the early/middle Eocene (~49Ma) relationship between the Sierran Arc and Sevier fold and thrust belt to the west and Laramide uplifts and foreland deformation to the east. Modeled δ18Opt from a suite of simulations that systematically varies elevations west of the thrust front and elevation, width, and roughness east of the thrust front is in general agreement with δ18Opt proxies from the Laramide region. This result suggests that as long as there are key similarities, multiple paleotopographic reconstructions could result in the observed proxy signatures. It may not, therefore, be possible to definitively describe the particular details of a given region. We should, however, be able to clearly define the broader orogenic and topographic context which that region occupies. In the case of the simulations we present here, the broader context appears to rest primarily upon hinterland elevations which, in spite of significant geographical and elevation differences in our implementation of Laramide topography, exert the primary control on δ18Opt in the Laramide region. Furthermore, these simulations indicate that δ18Opt in the Laramide region increases as hinterland elevations increase. This is counter to the trend over the high peaks/plateau proper and highlights the need for careful consideration of water source when assessing fluvially-derived δ18Opt proxies in the foreland.",

            "abstract": "Several planetary missions are contemplated as flybys of planets, asteroids, and natural satellites. In many cases the option to orbit the body is impractical and observations during one or many flybys represent the only reasonable option. A laser altimeter provides measurements of topography and shape, surface roughness, and normal reflectivity at the laser wavelength and has been shown to be very effective at Mars, Mercury and the Moon when in orbit about the body and also when in proximity of an asteroid. But flyby missions are less able to provide the coverage and uniformity of the data being acquired by the instruments on the s/c because of the variation in range of the spacecraft from the body during a flyby. To address this problem, we have modified the design of our single beam Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA), currently collecting observations on the MESSENGER mission, to provide an operating range of several thousand kilometers by increasing the output from the laser, providing a variable pulse-rate while maintaining constant electrical power, that can provide quasi-contiguous altimeter pixels during the flyby, and by storing the complete output from the detector. This approach will provide accurate topographic and shape data and enable improved orbit determination of the spacecraft by the use of orbital crossovers with minimal interpolation errors between measurements. The mass, power and data rate of the instrument is compatible with typical constraints in planetary missions.",

            "abstract": "There is a fundamental challenge in evaluating performance of global land-surface and climate modeling systems, given that few in-situ observation sets adequately sample surface conditions representative at the global model pixel scale (10-100km). For example, a typical micrometeorological flux tower samples a relatively small footprint ranging from 100m to 1km, depending on tower height and environmental conditions. There is a clear need for diagnostic tools that can effectively bridge this gap in scale, and serve as a means of benchmarking global prognostic modeling systems under current conditions. This paper discusses a multi-scale energy balance modeling system (the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse model and disaggregation utility: ALEXI/DisALEXI) that fuses flux maps generated with thermal infrared (TIR) imagery collected by multiple satellite platforms to estimate daily surface fluxes from field to global scales. These diagnostic assessments, with land-surface temperature (LST) as the primary indicator of surface moisture status, operate under fundamentally different constraints than prognostic land-surface models based on precipitation and water balance, and therefore can serve as a semi-independent benchmark. Furthermore, LST can be retrieved from TIR imagery over a broad range of spatiotemporal resolutions: from several meters (airborne systems; periodically) to ~100m (Landsat; bi-weekly) to 1km (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - MODIS; daily) to 3-10km (geostationary; hourly). Applications of ALEXI/DisALEXI to flux sites within the US and internationally are described, evaluating daily evapotranspiration retrievals generated at 30m resolution. Annual timeseries of maps at this scale can be useful for better understanding local heterogeneity in the tower vicinity and dependences of observed fluxes on wind direction. If reasonable multi-year performance is demonstrated at the tower footprint scale for flux networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), the aggregated output from such diagnostic modeling systems can provide valuable scale-appropriate benchmarks for coarser-resolution models at the tower sites, and some degree of independent verification in areas with sparse or inexistent ground-based measurements.",

            "abstract": "Prescribed fire can be used to return wild lands to their natural fire cycle, control invasive weeds, and deter wildfire, but there are knowledge gaps in the understanding of post-disturbance responses of vegetation and hydrology. The impact of a prescribed fire and subsequent aspen cutting on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow was assessed for a small mountainous watershed by capitalizing on the unique long-term knowledgebase developed for the Upper Sheep Creek Catchment, a 26-ha headwater catchment dominated by low sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush and aspen within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed. The 2007 prescribed fire consumed 100% of the mountain big sagebrush area and approximately 21% of the low sagebrush area. The aspen, which were mostly untouched by the fire, were cut in the fall of 2008. Post-disturbance recovery of vegetation and evapotranspiration depended heavily on the loss of rooting depth. ET of mountain big sagebrush zone having deep-rooted shrubs that were destroyed by the fire took several years to recover, while that from the low sagebrush area with limited rooting depth recovered within two years of the fire. ET from the aspen trees, which can sprout from existing roots, recovered within two years. The prescribed fire and aspen cutting had no discernible impact on streamflow. ",

            "abstract": "Regional climate and land cover interact in a complex, non-linear manner to alter the local cycling of mass and energy. It is often difficult to isolate the role of either mechanism on the resultant fluxes. Here, we attempt to isolate these mechanisms through the use of network of 4 Ameriflux eddy covariance towers installed over different land cover and land use classes along a pronounced rainfall gradient. The land cover types include: annually burned C4 grassland, a 4 year burn site experiencing woody encroachment, an abandoned agricultural field and a new perennial agricultural site. We investigated the impact of rainfall variability, drought, and heat waves on the water and carbon budgets using data analysis, remote sensing, and modeling approaches. In addition, we have established a network of mini-meteorological stations at the annually and 4-year burn sites to assess micro-scale variability within the footprints of the towers as a function of topographic position, soil depth and soil water availability. Through the use of a wavelet multiscale decomposition and information theory metrics, we have isolated the role of environmental factors (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, etc.) on the fluxes across the different sites. By applying a similar analysis to model output, we can assess the ability of land-surface models to recreate the observed sensitity. Results indicate the utility of a network of measurement systems used in conjunction with land surface modeling and time series analysis to assess differential impacts to similar regional scale climate forcings. Implications for the role of land cover class in regional and global scale modeling systems will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The absence of a thermal anomaly associated with the San Andreas fault, and low driving stress resolved on it, suggest that such mature faults weaken dramatically during seismic slip. Thermal pressurization (TP) and thermal decomposition (TD) are two mechanisms to explain this co-seismic weakening. Both rely on elevated pore pressures in a fluid-saturated gouge, with TP achieving this through thermal expansion of native pore fluid and TD by releasing additional pore fluid (e.g., H2O or CO2) during a reaction.\nWe use a one-dimensional model for a fluid-saturated gouge layer sheared between two undeforming half-spaces to study how TP (Rice et al., Platt et al., JGR-B, 2014) and TD (Platt et al., submitted JGR-B) drive seismic strain localization. A linear stability analysis is first used to predict the localized zone thickness for each of the weakening mechanisms. Using representative parameters for fault gouge we predict localized zone thicknesses of a few tens of microns, in line with laboratory (Kitajima et al., 2010) and field (Chester and Chester, 1998) observations. Next we use numerical simulations to study how the localized zone develops once nonlinear effects become important. These show that the final localized zone thickness is very similar to the linear stability prediction. In the simulations, the onset of localization accelerates fault weakening, making co-seismic strain localization an important consideration, apparently neglected in all current earthquake simulations.\nFinally we show how a secondary instability can lead to migration of the deforming zone across the gouge layer. This instability is driven by hydrothermal diffusion for TP, and by reactant depletion for TD. Our results show that migration must be taken into account when inferring the width of the deforming zone from field observations. Even when the zone of localized straining is only a few tens of microns wide, migration can lead to a final strain profile with a zone of roughly uniform strain on the order of a millimeter wide. Migration also distributes frictional heating over a broader region, leading to a lower temperature rise when compared with a stationary shear zone. Our results rarely show temperatures above the melting temperature, providing a possible explanation for the scarcity of frictional melt products on mature faults.",

            "abstract": "Coastal populations and marshes have been intertwined for centuries, where humans both influence and depend on the enormous ecosystem services that marshes provide. Although marshes have long been considered vulnerable to climate change, recent work identifies fascinating feedbacks between plant growth and geomorphology that enable them to actively resist sea level rise. Here, we will review existing literature and provide new data to examine how humans alter these feedbacks. Measurements of accretion and elevation change suggest that most marshes will survive present day sea level rise rates by building vertically. Numerical models predict that these marshes will survive moderate accelerations in the rate of sea level in places where dams do not limit sediment delivery to the coast. However, these results also suggest that marsh survival under faster accelerations in sea level will depend on their ability to migrate inland. Marsh transgression into uplands is influenced not only by topography, but also by human land use and decisions to harden shorelines. Preliminary numerical model experiments will be used to explore how basic biophysical and anthropogenic drivers determine whether sea level change will lead to marsh loss (erosion+drowning > transgression), marsh expansion (transgression > erosion), or dynamic equilibrium (transgression = erosion).",

            "abstract": "A new triggering mechanism for deep convection named Heated Condensation Framework (HCF) is implemented into the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2). The new trigger is implemented as an additional criterion in the Simplified Arakawa-Schubert scheme for deep convection. Seasonal forecasts are performed to evaluate the influence of the new triggering mechanism in the representation of the Indian Summer Monsoon in the CFSv2. The HCF trigger improves the seasonal representation of precipitation over the Indian Subcontinent. Although the improvement is small in comparison to the overall precipitation bias in the CFSv2, there is a significant improvement. In addition, the new trigger improves the representation of the annual precipitation cycle of the Indian monsoon, including onset dates. The mechanism whereby the HCF improves convection over India seems to be related not only to a better representation of the background state of atmospheric convection but also to a reduction in the frequency in which the convective scheme is triggered. When the convection scheme is triggered less often, the convective available potential energy can build up. Once the convective scheme is triggered, intense precipitation occurs.",

            "abstract": "Permeability heterogeneity and channel morphology both control surface water-groundwater exchange (hyporheic exchange) and therefore influence stream ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycles. However, the effects of permeability heterogeneity are less understood than channel morphology due to the challenge of measuring permeability at relevant scales in the field. Permeability fields in streambeds often have sharp, discontinuous contrasts ranging by orders of magnitudes (e.g. sand-clay contacts). To better understand the effects of permeability heterogeneity we modeled hyporheic exchange in bimodal permeability fields consisting of sand and clay in a representative low-gradient stream. Heterogeneity was developed using a Markov Chain approach for representing sand and clay stratasets using commonly observed characteristics of sediments including volumetric proportions and mean lengths. The channel topography was generated and characterized using Fourier series. Hydraulic head was assigned along the streambed as a function of topography and stream velocity. Initial results show that sedimentary structure, specifically the positioning of sand strata, controls hyporheic exchange depth and fluxes. Particle tracing simulations test the hypothesis that uncertainty in solute residence times increases as the connectivity of permeable sand strata increases due to the partitioning of solutes between connected and stagnant flow paths. These results will lead to a better understanding of how heterogeneity and the structure of highly permeable strata influences hyporheic residence times and biogeochemical processes.",

            "abstract": "The La Paz basin in the eastern Bolivian Andes has been a hotspot for large-scale, deep-seated gravitational slope deformation during the Holocene. In less than 2 Ma, a network of steep-sided valleys up to 800 m deep formed in sediments of the Altiplano Plateau and underlying basement rocks. We characterize the distribution, extent, mechanisms, and modern activity of large-scale failures within this landscape using optical image interpretation, existing geologic maps, synthetic RADAR interferometry (InSAR), and field investigation. Deposits of nearly 20 landslides larger than 100 Mm3 occur within the basin. Most failures have occurred in weakly lithified Late Miocene to Pliocene sedimentary rocks and include earth flows, translational and rotational landslides, and plug flows. Failures in underlying tectonized Paleozoic sedimentary rocks include bedding-parallel rockslides. The largest failure is the 3 km3 Achcocalla earth flow (ca. 11 ka BP), which ran out ~20 km. Other dated events span the period from the early Holocene to nearly the Colonial historic period. InSAR results show that many large slope failures, including the Achocalla earth flow, are currently moving at rates of a few centimeters to a few decimeters per year. Rapid deposition, shallow burial, and rapid incision of the basin fills produced steep slopes in weak geologic materials that, coupled with groundwater discharge from the valley walls, are the primary controls on instability. In contrast, the Altiplano surface has changed little in 2 Ma and the adjacent slopes of the Cordilleran Real, although steep, are relatively stable. Of the over 100 landslides that have occurred in the city of La Paz since the early twentieth century, most are at the margins of large, deep-seated prehistoric failures, and two of the most damaging historic landslides (Hanko-Hanko, 1582; Pampahasi, 2011) were large-scale reactivations of previously failed slopes. Improved understanding of large, deep-seated landslides in the La Paz basin provides insights into evolution of the Central Andes and the geologic contribution to the exceptionally high landslide risk in the modern city of La Paz.",

In this study, an agent-based model is used to simulate the life cycle and movement of individual malaria vector mosquitoes in a Niger Sahel village, with individual simulated mosquitoes interacting with their physical environment as well as humans. Various processes that are known to be epidemiologically important, such as the dependence of parity on flight distance between hydrologically-controlled developmental habitat and blood meal hosts and therefore spatial relationships of standing water and houses, are readily simulated using this modeling paradigm. Impacts of perturbations can be evaluated on the basis of vectorial capacity, because the interactions between individuals that make up the population- scale metric vectorial capacity can be easily tracked for simulated mosquitoes and human blood meal hosts, without the need to estimate vectorial capacity parameters.\nAs expected, model results show pronounced impacts of pool source reduction from larvicide application and draining, but with varying degrees of impact depending on the spatial relationship between pools and human habitation. Results highlight the importance of spatially-explicit simulation that can model individuals such as in an agent-based model.The impacts of perturbations on village scale malaria transmission depend on spatial locations of individual mosquitoes, as well as the tracking of relevant life cycle events and characteristics of individual mosquitoes. This study demonstrates advantages of using an agent-based approach for village-scale mosquito simulation to address questions in which spatial relationships are known to be important.",

            "abstract": "Atom Probe Tomography (APT) allows 3D mapping of elements and isotopes with near atomic resolution, at concentrations down to the 10’s of ppma. Direct characterization of nanoscale chemical heterogeneity down to trace element levels permits novel interrogations of geochemical processes acting at the nm-scale, and further informs us about elemental or isotopic data gathered by larger-scale techniques. We have studied four zircons including a 2.5 Ga xenocryst from a 29 Ma granitoid (ARG2.5), a 4.3 Ga zircon from the quartz monzodiorite clast of lunar sample 15405 (15Q4), and two Jack Hills zircons dated at 4.0 Ga (JH4.0) and 4.4 Ga (JH4.4) (Valley et al. 2014, Nat. Geosci.). JH4.4 and ARG2.5 contain enrichments of Y, REE, and Pb in ~10 nm clusters, in contrast to the uniform distribution of these elements in JH4.0 and 15Q4. Despite varying amounts of nanoscale trace element heterogeneity, all terrestrial zircons have total 207Pb/206Pb ratios consistent with concordant U-Pb ages obtained by SIMS. This proves that zircon cores remained closed U-Pb systems at the micron scale. In JH4.4 and ARG2.5, the 207Pb/206Pb ratio within clusters is a function of the timing of cluster formation, and precludes clusters from being primary features. Instead, the timing of element mobility and cluster formation is linked with known high temperature geological events. The lack of clustering within JH4.0 and lunar zircon 15Q4 suggests no nm-scale element mobility has occurred, and supports the concordant ages obtained by SIMS. The size, shape, distribution and composition of clusters reflect the time-integrated influence of radiation damage, annealing, and temperature on intracrystalline trace element mobility, and can be used to further understand the thermal history of zircons and their structural evolution since crystallization. The combination of spatial resolution and detection limits for APT has exciting potential for many geochemistry and mineralogy studies.",

In EuTRACE, researchers from the natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities have joined forces to assess various proposed geoengineering techniques concerning their radiative forcing potential and side effects, ethical aspects, economics aspects, as well as governance and regulation aspects. A comprehensive assessment report will be submitted to the EC in autumn 2014.\nWe will present some highlights of the part of the EuTRACE assessment that deals with the natural science aspects of proposed Radiation Modification (RM) techniques. The techniques considered are: a) Stratospheric Sulfur Injections; b) Marine Cloud Brightening; c) Desert Brightening; d) Vegetation Brightening; and e) Cirrus Cloud Thinning. A large number of publications in the scientific literature has been considered, as well as recently published assessment reports by the Royal Society in the UK and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.\nSome of the findings of the assessment are:\nGlobally averaged, the current anthropogenic radiative forcing could conceivably be offset by the RM techniques considered. The RM techniques could have a significant global effect already after 1 year or less.\nModel simulations consistently show that Solar RM leads to regional imbalances due to different spatial footprints of solar and carbon dioxide radiative forcings. This may have significant consequences for precipitation patterns and the hydrological cycle.\nVery rapid warming is virtually certain if RM were to be stopped abruptly or over a period of one to a few years. \nModel studies of RM usually assume that the techniques are technologically feasible. In fact, the technological challenges are poorly known, and in many cases the physical processes involved are poorly understood.\nWe will end by discussing key research questions and knowledge gaps.",

            "abstract": "On April 23, 2014, Ahyi Volcano, a submarine cone in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), ended a 13-year-long period of repose with an explosive eruption lasting over 2 weeks. The remoteness of the volcano and the presence of several seamounts in the immediate area posed a challenge for constraining the source location of the eruption. Critical to honing in on the Ahyi area quickly were quantitative error estimates provided by the CTBTO on the backazimuth of hydroacoustic arrivals observed at Wake Island (IMS station H11). T-phases registered across the NMI seismic network at the rate of approximately 10 per hour until May 8 and were observed in hindsight at seismic stations on Guam and Chichijima. After May 8, sporadic T-phases were observed until May 17.\nWithin days of the eruption onset, reports were received from NOAA research divers of hearing explosions underwater and through the hull on the ship while working on the SE coastline of Farallon de Pajaros (Uracas), a distance of 20 km NW of Ahyi. In the same area, the NOAA crew reported sighting mats of orange-yellow bubbles on the water surface and extending up to 1 km from the shoreline. Despite these observations, satellite images showed nothing unusual throughout the eruption.\nDuring mid-May, a later cruise leg on the NOAA ship Hi’ialakai that was previously scheduled in the Ahyi area was able to collect some additional data in response to the eruption. Preliminary multibeam sonar bathymetry and water-column CTD casts were obtained at Ahyi. Comparison between 2003 and 2014 bathymetry revealed that the minimum depth had changed from 60 m in 2003 to 75 m in 2014, and a new crater ~95 m deep had formed at the summit. Extending SSE from the crater was a new scoured-out landslide chute extending downslope to a depth of at least 2300 m. Up to 125 m of material had been removed from the head of the landslide chute and downslope deposits were up to 40 m thick. Significant particle plumes were detected at all three CTD casts of Ahyi volcano. Plumes with optical anomalies up to 0.4 NTU were found south and west of Ahyi at 100-175 m water depth, corresponding to the depth of the new summit crater. We plan to combine the extensive T-phase, hydroacoustic, CTD, and bathymetry data from Ahyi to characterize submarine volcanic processes and quantify the size and total radiated energy of the eruption.",

            "abstract": "It was almost 15 years ago, when the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) flew for a few days to map the elevation of earth’s surface. SRTM has since become the community standard for a global digital elevation model (DEM) and has triggered numerous studies that require elevation information. One particular avenue that has benefited the hydrologic community is the space-borne discharge estimation using water slope information that is afforded by the spatial imaging concept of SRTM. Numerous feasibility studies involving SRTM data for discharge estimation in rivers have led to adopting a similar concept for the proposed Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission (launch date: 2020). Because SWOT is expected to have significantly higher accuracy and smaller spatial scale in resolving the elevation characteristics of a water surface, it is important to understand the extent of improvement that SWOT will afford for discharge estimation once it is launched. In this study, we explored geophysical sources of uncertainty of satellite interferometric-based discharge estimation in Bangladesh delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM) river basins. This exploration was carried out for two scenarios: A) using SRTM elevation data and B) using SWOT-simulated elevation data. We contextualized the improvement in accuracy as a function of river’s geophysical characteristics (river width, reach averaging length, bed/water slope) and also to explored a pragmatic approach to further uncertainty reduction using water level climatology. The discharge was estimated according to the slope-area (Manning’s) method using elevation data assuming availability of in-situ river bathymetry (in order to remove uncertainty due to river cross section data). A high resolution hydrodynamic model was accurately calibrated (against in-situ water level data) to simulate water level and flow dynamics along the entire river reaches of the GBM river network and served as reference for comparison with satellite-based estimates. For simulation of space-borne water elevations expected during the SWOT-era, we used a comprehensive simulator that can mimic all the likely measurement issues related to SWOT’s planned orbit, inclination and sensor characteristics.",

Experimental and computational results consistently show a significantly lower water storage capacity in MgSiO3 perovskite, the dominant mineral of the Earth’s lower mantle. This disparity in water solubility predicts widespread melting at the base of the transition zone in mantle downwellings or some other process to create a transition zone “water filter.”\nWe present the results of ab-initio calculations on the hydrogen incorporation in ringwoodite, majorite, ilmenite, calcium silicate perovskite, and magnesium silicate perovskite. We demonstrate a multiplicity of OH defect mechanisms at the base of the transition zone, including vacancies on the Mg and Si sites, as well as coupled substitutions with aluminum. We calculate the partitioning of water between each phase. While the partitioning of water between ringwoodite and MgSiO3 is >100, we find that partitioning of water between CaSiO3-perovskite and ringwoodite exceeds unity under the conditions of cold downwellings at the base of the transition zone, suggesting that a significant fraction of the water can be stored in minor phases of the lower mantle instead of requiring a filter at the base of the transition zone. This finding significantly relaxes the constraints on the Earth’s total water budget and suggests a mechanism for sequestering deep water through subduction.",

            "abstract": "Geographic isolation does not imply hydrological isolation; indeed, local groundwater exchange between geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) and surrounding uplands may yield important controls on regional hydrology. Differences in specific yield (Sy) between aquifers and inundated GIWs drive differences in water level responses to atmospheric fluxes, leading to frequent reversals in hydraulic gradients that cause GIWs to act as both groundwater sinks and sources. When distributed across the landscape, these reversals in local groundwater fluxes are predicted to collectively buffer the surficial aquifer and its regulation of baseflow delivery, a process we refer to as landscape hydrologic capacitance. To test this hypothesis, we integrated models of daily soil moisture, upland water table, and wetland stage dynamics to simulate hydrology of a low-relief landscape with GIWs. Simulations explored the influences of cumulative wetland area, individual wetland size, climate, and soil texture on water table and baseflow variation. Increasing cumulative wetland area and decreasing individual wetland size reduced water table variation and the frequency of extremely shallow and deep water tables. This buffering effect extended to baseflow deliveries, decreasing the standard deviation of daily baseflow by as much as 50%. For the same total wetland area, landscapes with fewer (i.e., larger) wetlands exhibited markedly lower hydrologic capacitance than those with more (i.e., smaller) wetlands, highlighting the important role of small GIWs in regulating regional hydrology. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have limited federal protections for GIWs except where a “significant nexus” to a navigable water body is demonstrated. Our results suggest that GIWs regulate downstream baseflow, even where water in GIWs may never physically reach downstream systems, providing a significant “hydraulic” nexus to distant water bodies.",

            "abstract": "Records of southwestern Greenland ice sheet retreat from the last glacial maximum are primarily limited to the late deglaciation, when the ice margin withdrew inland of its modern coastline. Therefore, southwestern ice sheet response to earlier deglacial retreat forcings is largely unknown. We use grain size, oxygen isotope, radiocarbon, and sedimentation rate data from southeastern Davis Strait core HU87033-008 to reconstruct southwestern Greenland ice margin response to early deglacial forcings. We calculate peak sediment fluxes of ~100 cm ka-1 during the global last glacial maximum, suggesting an ice margin position at or near the continental shelf break. By ~18 ka, sedimentation rate drops to ~40 cm ka-1, concurrent with a decrease in planktic oxygen isotopes to near interglacial values. We interpret this reduction in sediment supply to be a result of early retreat from the outermost continental shelf. A further decrease in sedimentation rate to ~25 cm ka-1 at ~17 ka suggests a middle to inner shelf position of the ice margin, where it remained until 12-11 ka when our 10Be record from coastal boulders show ice-margin retreat off of the shelf. Regional air and ocean temperatures remained near glacial levels during the period of early deglacial outer shelf retreat. However, the first major deglacial rise in global mean sea level, due to meltwater pulse 19 ka, was coincident with our peak in sedimentation rate. We conclude that a change in relative sea level in southwestern Greenland initiated repositioning of the ice margin, followed by rapid ice retreat inland of the outer shelf. This reconstruction supports an ice margin that was highly sensitive to sea-level changes while on the outer shelf, but also raises the question of why later sea-level rise did not drive complete Greenland ice sheet retreat off of the continental shelf, which only occurred much later.",

These studies have been limited in number and geographic scope. Here, we combine the measurements of previous studies with new measurements for a total of 2,857 conductivity-density measurements covering all of the world’s major oceans to derive empirical equations for the effect of silica and total alkalinity on the density and absolute salinity of the global oceans and recommend an equation applicable to most of the world oceans.

            "abstract": "First we will discuss the fundamental difference in the theory of operation between NDIR (Non-dispersive Infrared) based and laser-based gas analyzer. Taking LI-7500A (an open-path CO2 gas analyzer) as an example for a NDIR-based gas analyzer, the wavelength of the infrared radiation for making the gas concentration measurement is from 4.20 to 4.34 μm which includes many absorption lines. While the LI-7700 (an open-path methane gas analyzer) is a laser-based analyzer. It uses a single absorption line at 1.651 μm to make the methane concentration measurement. It employs a Herriott cell configuration with mirror spacing of 0.47 m and a total optical path length of 28.2 m. Methane density is measured using wavelength modulation spectroscopy. As a result, the measured methane density is affected by sensible heat and latent heat flux, and also by spectroscopic effects (e.g., line broadening) due to changes in temperature and water vapor content. Here we propose a new procedure to account for spectroscopic effects. Since both density effects and spectroscopic effects are predictable with the ideal gas law and HITRAN respectively, the spectroscopic effect can be incorporated into WPL correction. In this paper, we will discuss the details of this new procedure to account for the spectroscopic effect in the methane flux calculation. Field experiment results will be presented to show the accuracy of this new procedure.",

            "abstract": "Submarine channel systems transport vast amounts of terrestrial sediment into the deep sea. Understanding the dynamics of the gravity currents that create these systems, and in particular, how these flows interact with and form bends, is fundamental to predicting system architecture and evolution. Bend flow is characterized by a helical structure and in rivers typically comprises inwardly directed near-bed flow and outwardly directed near-surface flow. Following a decade of debate, it is now accepted that helical flow in submarine channel bends can exhibit a variety of structures including being opposed to that observed in rivers. The new challenge is to understand what controls the orientation of helical flow cells within submarine flows and determines the conditions for reversal. We present data from the Black Sea showing, for the first time, the three-dimensional velocity and density structure of an active submarine gravity current. By calculating the forces acting on the flow, we evaluate what controls the orientation of helical flow cells. We demonstrate that radial pressure gradients caused by across-channel stratification of the flow are more important than centrifugal acceleration in controlling the orientation of helical flow. We also demonstrate that nonlocal acceleration of the flow due to topographic forcing and downstream advection of the cross-stream flow are significant terms in the momentum balance. These findings have major implications for conceptual and numerical models of submarine channel dynamics, because they show that three-dimensional models that incorporate across-channel flow stratification are required to accurately represent curvature-induced helical flow in such systems.",

            "abstract": "Turbidite paleoseismology has the potential to reveal extended earthquake records. The concept of turbidite paleoseismology is underpinned by two assumptions: i) every large earthquake produces a turbidite (i.e. the integrated record for an area is complete); and ii) earthquake-triggered turbidites have special characteristics that enable them to be distinguished from turbidites triggered by other mechanisms (i.e. the record is extractable). The most reliable characteristic for inferring an earthquake trigger is probably evidence of widespread triggering (due to widespread ground shaking), which may be inferred from synchronous triggering or confluence tests given sufficiently precise age control.\nTesting whether every large earthquake produces a widespread turbidite requires independent evidence of the timing of earthquakes. Coring in the region of the 2004 (Mw 9.1) and 2005 (Mw 8.7) Sumatran earthquakes suggests that they did not produce widespread turbidites within intraslope basins. Coherent landslides are rare on this margin and as yet no landslide has been found that correlates in age with a known earthquake. Whilst smaller-scale landslides are more common, analogy with larger scale failures suggests that any earthquake record encapsulated within them is likely to be complicated (including potentially by other triggers) and incomplete.\nSome settings may be more or less appropriate to apply turbidite paleoseismology because of earthquake characteristics such as the nature of slip, or margin characteristics such as sedimentation rates, material properties, mechanism of slope failure and the frequency of seismic events. Further work is needed in locations with well characterized records of recent major earthquakes, and comparisons between the sedimentary records on these margins, in order to understand the types of earthquakes and settings that provide a complete and extractable record of major earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "There is a clear need for comprehensive quantification of simulation uncertainty when using geophysical models to support and inform decision-making. Further, it is clear that the nature of such uncertainty depends on the quality of information in (a) the forcing data (driver information), (b) the model code (prior information), and (c) the specific values of inferred model components that localize the model to the system of interest (inferred information). Of course, the relative quality of each varies with geophysical discipline and specific application.\nIn this talk I will discuss a structured approach to characterizing how ‘Information’, and hence ‘Uncertainty’, is coded into the structures of physics-based geophysical models. I propose that a better understanding of what is meant by “Information”, and how it is embodied in models and data, can offer a structured (less ad-hoc), robust and insightful basis for diagnostic learning through the model-data juxtaposition. In some fields, a natural consequence may be to emphasize the a priori role of System Architecture (Process Modeling) over that of the selection of System Parameterization, thereby emphasizing the more creative aspect of scientific investigation – the use of models for Discovery and Learning.",

            "abstract": "The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) agencies, established in 1984 to coordinate civil space-borne observations of the Earth, through its Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS), have initiated a community access project, the CEOS WIGSS Integrated Catalog (CWIC), to connect the CEOS agency data systems to the Group of Earth Observations (GEO) System of Systems.\nCurrent CWIC data partners offering access or developing access to their Earth Observation data include NASA, NOAA, USGS, National Institute for Space Research (Brazil), Canadian Center for Mapping and Earth Observations (CCMEO), the Academy for Opto-Electronics (China), the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and EUMETSAT. Additional data partners are considering offering their data through CWIC.\nThere are vast quantities of data accessible via CWIC. Offering access to only the data and services of interest to each science and application community through the development of a tailored community client helps lead the users directly to data access and the direct use of the data more quickly. The community clients can offer other services associated with using the data – such as tools for subsetting, reprojection, data integration, etc. The development of these specialized clients gets the communities more directly engaged with the data providers and their feedback can lead to improvements in the access services that are offered.\nIn October 2013, the GEO Director noted that CWIC offered access to about 2/3 of the satellite data accessible via GEO. Why has CWIC succeeded? The broader CWIC team makes decisions as a group (e.g. which standards that CWIC should support). The CWIC support team builds the translations from the CWIC supported standards to the data partner systems into CWIC. The data partner does not have to make any changes to the native data system. The CWIC support team provides very strong technical support for and the constant engagement of the partners. These are big factors in CWIC’s success. In late 2012, US government agencies, NASA, NOAA, and USGS, agreed to provide long term funding commitment for the CWIC project, ensuring that partners can count on the CWIC services for many years.",

            "abstract": "Individuals with disabilities are not entering pathways leading to the geoscience workforce; the reasons for which continue to elude access-focused geoscience educators. While research has focused on barriers individuals face entering into STEM disciplines, very little research has considered the role that practitioner perceptions play in limiting access and accommodation to scientific disciplines. The authors argue that changing the perceptions within the geoscience community is an important step to removing barriers to entry into the myriad fields that make up the geosciences.\nThis paper reports on an investigation of the perceptions that geoscientist practitioners hold about opportunities for engagement in geoscience careers for people with disabilities. These perspectives were collected through three separate iterations of surveys at three professional geoscience meetings in the US and Australia between 2011 and 2012. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which individuals with specific types of disabilities would be able to perform various geoscientific tasks.\nThe information obtained from these surveys provides an initial step in engaging the larger geoscience community in a necessary discussion of minimizing the barriers of access to include students and professionals with disabilities. The results imply that a majority of the geoscience community believes that accessible opportunities exist for inclusion regardless of disability. This and other findings suggest that people with disabilities are viewed as viable professionals once in the geosciences, but the pathways into the discipline are prohibitive. Perceptions of how individuals gain entry into the field are at odds with perceptions of accessibility. This presentation will discuss the common geoscientist perspectives of access and inclusion in the geoscience discipline and how these results might impact the future of the geoscience workforce pathway for individuals with disabilities.",

First, we perform a statistical study of the influence of coronal holes on CME trajectories for more than 50 events during years 2010-2014. Second, we use the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) to model CME propagation in the Alfven Wave Solar Model (AWSoM), which includes a sophisticated treatment of the physics of coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. The major progress in these simulations is that the initial conditions of the eruptions are highly data-constrained. From the simulations, we determine the CME’s trajectory and expansion. We calculate the pile-up of material along the front and sides of a CME due to its expansion, and constrain the properties of the pile-up under a range of conditions. Finally, we will discuss the connection between these plasma density structures and the acceleration of protons to energies relevant to space weather.",

The transition of natural forest and cerrado ecosystems to pastureland and agricultural crops is predicted to create warmer and drier atmospheric conditions than the native vegetation. Using a coupled ecosystem- regional atmospheric model (ED-BRAMS) we investigate the impacts of predicted future land use on the climate of South America. We find that the climate response in our model is consistent with expectations - with drier conditions resulting from deforestation, however the changes in precipitation are moderate. Local drying is driven primarily by decreases in evapotranspiration associated with the loss of leaf area, and coincident increases in runoff. Significant consistent changes are seen in convectively available potential energy and convective inhibition suggesting that the decrease in surface latent heat flux is indeed leading to a drier atmosphere, however these changes occur at mean state values that are already very favorable for convection leading to little change in precipitation. If large-scale circulation changes occur in the future to push the atmosphere over the Amazon towards a drier state as predicted by the CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives, we postulate that land use change could accelerate the movement across a convective threshold.",

An expansion of dark forests increases the absorption of solar energy and increases surface temperature, particularly in regions where the land surface is unable to compensate with latent heat flux due to water limitation. Atmospheric circulation redistributes the anomalous energy absorbed in the northern hemisphere, in particular toward the south, through altering the Hadley circulation, resulting in the northward displacement of the tropical rain bands. Precipitation decreases over parts of the Amazon basin affecting productivity and increases over the Sahel and Sahara regions in Africa. We demonstrate that the remote and local forcing of atmospheric circulation by vegetation can lead to different dynamical patterns with consequences for precipitation across the globe. These ecoclimate teleconnections represent the linkages between the land surface in different regions of the globe and by inference show that proxy records of plant cover represent not only the response of vegetation to local climate but also that vegetation's influence on global climate patterns. The ability of vegetation to affect remote circulation also has implications for strategies for climate mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The rainfall-runoff process is of critical importance for ecosystem sustainability in semi-arid regions. Recent studies have disclosed complex feedbacks between rainfall, vegetation patches, microtopography and soil characteristics, emphasizing the important role of soil surface sealing of the bare intershrub areas. Soil surface sealing involves the formation of a compact seal layer at the vicinity of the bare soil surface, inducing a drastic reduction of the soil inﬁltrability, which determines the local rainfall-runoff relationship. To quantify the interplay of surface sealing, microtopography and vegetation patches in semiarid region hydrology, a modeling approach is developed which couples a two-dimensional surface runoff model and a two-layer conceptual inﬁltration model, and also includes elaborate numerical treatment to study the rainfall-runoff process with the presence of a seal layer. Applying this model in a semi-arid field plot in the Lehavim LTER in Southern Israel reveals the complex interactions between these factors and the hydrological response at the hillslope scale. The seal and vegetation are major controls of the runoff generation process and runoff amount, while microtopography significantly affects the spatial pattern of overland flow and runoff routing. Also, vegetation patches can receive much more water through runon than direct rainfall could provide, which implies an important mechanism for water resources allocation in dryland ecosystems. Furthermore, the model has been applied to plots of multiple scales to examine scaling effects in the rainfall-runoff process. In agreement with observed trends, results show a decrease of runoff with increasing spatial scales, and an increase of runon effect across scales. However, this scaling effect of runoff is not linear; rather, power-law relationships are observed.",

            "abstract": "During the much of the 20th Century, the Yellow River, China, carried between 1.1 and 1.6 Gt y-1 of sediment derived from the over-used Loess Plateau. A portion of this sediment load accumulates inside the artificial levees, reducing the accommodation space and subsequently building up the modern channel-belt >10m above the surrounding floodplains. Historical levees often failed along the older Yellow River courses resulting in >1000 floods in 3000 yrs. In the last millennium, the river has shifted its lower course every ~25 years, breached its levees once a year; in mid 17th century up to 3 breaches occurred per year.\nA novel methodology is employed to quantitatively reconstruct and interpret flood dynamics on the Yellow River. A reduced-complexity model is developed to explore how climate change and human activity affect levee breaches and river avulsions. The model integrates yearly morphological change along a channel belt with daily river fluxes, and hourly evolution of levee breaches. The model calculates breach characteristics at the scale of 100yr and 200km. To cope with the sparseness in historical records and to incorporate the complex and uncertain nature of flood behavior, 17,118 experiments are conducted to explore dominant factors controlling flood frequency and their likely values in historical times. Model sensitivity analyses reveal that under natural conditions, super-elevation of the channel belt dominates flood frequency. However, when there is significant human-accelerated basin erosion and breach repair, the dominant factors shift to a combination of mean annual precipitation, super-elevation, critical shear stress of weak channel banks, and the interval between breach initiation and its repair. With human perturbation, breaching became more sensitive to precipitation and channel bank strength. Applying uncertainty analyses, the most likely values of the dominant factors for six historical periods between 850BC and 1839AD are explored and used to quantitatively reconstruct the history of Yellow River floods. During 850BC-1839AD when the sediment load increased fourfold, the major breach recurrence interval was shortened from more than 500 years to less than 6 years, and the breach outflow rate increased ~27 times.",

            "abstract": "Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (EAB)) is an invasive insect that effectively kills ash trees (genus: Fraxinus) greater than 2.5 cm in diameter, resulting in near-complete stand mortality within 3-4 years. Black ash wetlands occupy approximately 270,000 ha in Michigan, and have 40 to 90% of the basal area occupied by black ash (F. nigra Marshall); hence the loss of black ash may result in dramatic changes in the canopy hydrology and nutrient deposition. We assessed the impact of a simulated EAB invasion on throughfall and stemflow quantity and nitrogen (N) content in 9 uninfected black ash wetlands located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Within the 9 stands, 3 stands were left untreated (‘Control’), 3 stands had all the black ash trees manually girdled (‘Girdled’) and 3 had all the black ash trees felled by chainsaw (‘Clearcut’). We measured the quantity and inorganic-N content of throughfall using an array of randomly placed collectors (n = 16 per site). Stemflow was monitored at 2 sites (n = 12 trees) on the 3 most common tree species (black ash, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) and red maple (Acer rubra L.)). Preliminary results indicate that relative to the Control, average monthly throughfall was 25% and 1% greater in the Clearcut and Girdled sites, respectively. While the loss of the ash trees resulted in greater throughfall inputs in the Clearcut sites, water table heights did not significantly change as a result of the treatments. Stemflow from live black ash trees was lower than from the yellow birch and red maple trees. As a result, we predict stemflow will increase over time as species with smoother bark and less upright branching begin replacing the black ash. Hence, the change in tree species may result in a greater concentration of inorganic-N inputs to the base of the trees, thereby altering the distribution of inorganic-N inputs into the wetland. Our preliminary results show no significant change in the total inorganic-N deposition via throughfall. Despite the severity of the disturbance that resulted from the simulated EAB infestation, preliminary results suggest that that these wetlands may show some short-term resiliency to the impacts of ash mortality, resulting in relatively unchanged hydrologic and nutrient deposition regimes.",

            "abstract": "Southern California is experiencing the worst drought on record and facing more dramatic decreases in water supply due to regional climate change trends. In Los Angeles, evapotranspiration (ET) from irrigated landscapes is likely to be a major contributor to the urban water budget. However, data on water use by irrigated urban plants is very scarce and ET patterns from urban vegetation are not well quantified. Methods currently used for estimating water use by urban lawns are mainly based on Penman-Monteith model, which depends on a set of empirical coefficients that are hard to define, as well as a simplified crop coefficient approach that has low accuracy. Previously, we performed continuous in-situ measurements of transpiration from 126 urban trees in the Los Angeles area using sapflux sensors and ET from 8 turfgrass lawns using portable chambers. Here, we synthesize the results of those measurements as well as literature data and construct biologically meaningful equations for assessment of ET from urban landscapes. The resulting empirical model is reasonably accurate yet relatively simple for managers to apply with basic weather and tree inventory data. It explains 72% of tree transpiration variability and 79% of turfgrass ET variability. The parameters of the model currently include vulnerability of branches to cavitation for trees, turfgrass area and percent tree canopy cover for lawns, and incoming solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit of the air and soil water content for defining environmental conditions. To give an illustration, the model estimate of the highest ET from a vegetated area in Los Angeles during a typical summer day is 5 – 8 mm/d (high transpiring street trees with turfgrass groundcover or unshaded turfgrass) and the lowest ET is 0.6 – 0.8 mm/d (low-transpiring trees without groundcover). The next step is to substitute vulnerability to cavitation, the only model parameter that requires laboratory equipment, with parameters that can be more easily applied by non-specialists. The results of this study will inform the general public and decision makers and help develop modifications to urban landscape design and management practices for efficient outdoor water conservation. The equations will be also used with a region-specific hydrologic model to simulate spatially resolved ET at larger scales.",

            "abstract": "The densely populated, low-lying coast of Bangladesh is famously associated with vulnerability to sea-level rise, storms, and flooding. Simultaneously, land-use change has significantly altered local sediment transport, causing elevation loss and degradation of drainage. The rapid growth of shrimp aquaculture has also affected soil chemistry in former agricultural areas and the stock of riverine fisheries through intense larval harvesting. To understand the net impact of these environmental changes on the region’s communities, it is necessary to examine interactions across scale – from externally driven large scale environmental change to smaller scale, but often more intense, local change – and also between the physical environment and social, political, and economic conditions.\nWe report on a study of interactions between changing communities and changing environment in coastal Bangladesh, exploring the role of societal and physical factors in shaping the different outcomes and their effects on people’s lives. Land reclamation projects in the 1960s surrounded intertidal islands with embankments. This allowed rice farming to expand, but also produced significant elevation loss, which rendered many islands vulnerable to waterlogging and flooding from storm surges. The advent of large-scale shrimp aquaculture added environmental, economic, social, and political stresses, but also brought much export revenue to a developing nation. Locally, attempts to remedy environmental stresses have produced mixed results, with similar measures succeeding in some communities and failing in others.\nIn this context, we find that people are continually adapting to changing opportunities and constraints for food, housing, and income. Niches that support different livelihood activities emerge and dwindle, and their occupants' desires affect the political context. Understanding and successfully responding to the impacts of environmental change requires understanding not only the physical environment, but also the human livelihoods, interpersonal interactions, and human-environmental interactions within a socio-ecological system.",

            "abstract": "The geometry and kinematics of the active, and potentially seismogenic, fault structures within the hinterland of the Himalaya have proven challenging to constrain in the past, primarily because active faults in this region tend to be buried beneath the subsurface and active seismicity often does not align with surficially mapped fault traces. Here we present a series of complementary datasets, including results from low temperature thermochronology, basin-wide erosion rates from 10Be concentrations, and topographic and longitudinal profile analyses, that place constraints on the spatial distribution of fault-related rock uplift and erosion across a ~400-km long region of the lower and high Himalaya of northwest India. Results from our analyses reveal that hillslope morphology and channel steepness are relatively invariant parallel to strike but vary significantly across strike, with the most prominent and abrupt variations occurring at the physiographic transition between the lower and high Himalaya (PT2), near the axial trace of the ramp-flat transition in the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). The cross-strike changes in geomorphology observed across the PT2 correlate with an order of magnitude northward increase in basin-wide erosion rates (~0.06-0.8 mm/a) and a corresponding decrease in apatite (~5-2 Ma) and zircon (U-Th)/He (~10-2 Ma) cooling ages. Combined with published geophysical and seismicity data, we interpret these results to reflect spatial variations in rock uplift and exhumation induced by a segment of the MHT ramp-flat system that is at least ~400 km long and ~125 km wide. The relatively young (U-Th)/He ages (<10 Ma) greater than 20 km south of the MHT ramp-flat transition preliminarily suggest that the kinematics of this system are best explained by a model which incorporates an accreting duplex on the MHT ramp but additional forthcoming analyses, including thermal modeling, will confirm if this hypothesis is robust.",

            "abstract": "The dependence of the isotopic and trace element composition of calcium carbonate minerals on growth conditions including temperature, pH, and salinity is widely used to infer paleoclimate conditions. These inferences rely heavily on phenomenological observations of biogenic and inorganic precipitation both in and ex situ, where only limited variability in solution conditions can be explored. Ionic fluxes between the mineral surface and aqueous growth solution govern the net uptake of both stoichiometric and trace species during calcification, so developing a mechanistic understanding of the reactions governing these fluxes is critical to refine existing proxies and to develop new ones. The micro-scale mechanisms of calcite precipitation from aqueous solution have been extensively studied, and net ionic uptake post-nucleation is known to occur primarily at monomolecular kink sites along step edges at the mineral surface. In this talk, I will present a theoretical framework that uses the quasi-elementary ion attachment and detachment reactions governing ion uptake at kink sites to simultaneously model bulk mineral growth kinetics and tracer partitioning during calcite precipitation. Several distinct processes occur during ion uptake at kink sites that can influence the distribution of trace species, directly impacting the composition of various carbonate paleoproxies including δ44Ca, δ18O, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca. The distribution of these trace species will be shown to depend on (1) the relative rates of ion desolvation during attachment to kink sites, (2) the relative rates of bond breaking during detachment from kink sites, and (3) the equilibrium partitioning of trace aqueous species. This model accounts for the impact of solution conditions on net ion fluxes and surface speciation, which in turn controls the population of kink sites available for direct ion exchange with the aqueous phase. The impacts of solution variables including pH, temperature and salinity can be treated independently, which unlike traditional partitioning studies allows the impacts of these parameters to be deconvolved. The type of theoretical framework discussed here can be readily extended to explicitly account for each of the major solution composition variables that are implicated in paleoproxy composition.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the global precipitation of magnetospheric electrons into Titan’s atmosphere by coupling a two-stream electron transport model to a three-dimensional model of Titan's plasma interaction. First we run several simulations assuming an ‘ideal’ geometry for the magnetospheric interaction, we find that most of the energy from auroral electrons is deposited on the magnetospheric wake-side of Titan's thermosphere and the least amount of energy is deposited on the magnetospheric ram-side. The globally averaged peak energy deposition rates vary between 10 and 13 eV cm-3 s-1 near 1200 to 1300 km altitude, depending on the electron distributions in Saturn’s magnetosphere. We find that shorter electron bounce times in Saturn’s magnetosphere and magnetic mirroring above Titan's atmosphere can both strongly reduce the flux of magnetospheric electrons entering Titan’s atmosphere. The total power deposited in Titan's thermosphere by magnetospheric electrons is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the power deposited by solar EUV during the 2007 to 2009 solar minimum. This indicates that magnetospheric electrons are a less significant source of energy for Titan’s upper atmosphere than solar EUV and is comparable to that of magnetospheric ions. Finally, we move beyond idealized simulation geometries and attempt to realistically simulate magnetospheric electron precipitation during a specific flyby. The results of these simulations are directly compared to data from Cassini’s electron spectrometer.",

            "abstract": "Reconciling the needs of nature and people in California’s Sacramento – San Joaquin River Delta represents one of the most critical ecosystem management imperatives in western North America. Over 150 years the Delta has been managed for near-term human benefits and in the process 95% of riverine and deltaic wetlands have been lost throughout the region. Despite extensive land conversion and alteration of hydrological and physical processes, the Delta remains important habitat for migratory birds and is home to over 60% of California’s native fish species. It is also the waterwheel for the state’s vast water distribution network and is maintained by a system of constructed levees that are at risk from catastrophic failure due to sea level rise, floods, and/or seismic activity. Such a collapse would have dire consequences for > 25M humans and world’s 10th largest economy that depend on its freshwater. Thus, the ultimate cost of this ecosystem alteration and simplification is a riverscape that is no longer reliable for nature or people. For 30 years, attempts to ‘restore’ Delta ecosystems and improve reliability have met with mixed results. For example, reconnection of floodplains to floodwaters has resulted in improved ecological health for native fishes and recharge to localized aquifers. Uncoordinated releases of discharges below dams, however, have resulted in diminished water quality and populations of indicator species. Attempts to create wildlife friendly farms have been countered by an increase in perennial agriculture and commensurate increases in irrigation water demand. From these lessons learned, we demonstrate three key components of a reconciled Delta that will be necessary in the future: 1) full restoration of critical habitats, reconnecting land and water to rebuild ecosystem function; 2) landscape redesign, incorporating natural and engineered infrastructure to create a biologically diverse, resilient landscape to support both agriculture and natural ecosystems, while reducing the impacts of climate change; and 3) recognition that some ecosystem components, including less resilient species, may be lost and other novel components may emerge. These findings serve to reconcile conflicting demands and restoring ecosystem functions in highly altered wetland landscapes worldwide.",

In addition to the traditional planar current sheets, other types of coherent current structures have been observed in 3D fully kinetic simulations with initial conditions relevant to the solar wind. These structures are discussed in detail. In 3D global hybrid simulations of the interaction between solar wind and planetary magnetospheres, the foreshock dynamics driven by reflected ions is shown to have a significant impact on the structure of the bow shock, as well as on the magnetosheath turbulence.

Also evident is the result that the zonal winds are higher in speed for the Peru measurements when compared with the zonal winds measured in Brazil. Within the 4 degree latitude separation of Arequipa and Jicamarca, the zonal winds observed are generally the same. The Brazil site shows a difference in the meridional winds across a spatial separation of 500 km of about 20 to 40 ms-1 decrease from south to north. This gradient is seen consistently during the local summer months. Comparison of Brazil and Peru zonal winds for simultaneous nightly measurements and for averaged monthly results shows the zonal winds in the mid-evening period (21-23 LT) are generally faster by about 30 to 75 ms-1 for the Peru site which is located near or at the geomagnetic equator. These results are interpreted in terms of an inertial instability mechanism that is activated as a result of a steady state unbalanced flow.

            "abstract": "The study of submarine landslides has advanced considerably in the last decade. A multitude of geoscience disciplines, including marine, petroleum and planetary geology, as well as geohazard assessments, are concerned with the study of these units. Oftentimes, researchers working in these fields disseminate their findings within their own communities and a multidisciplinary approach seems to lack. This presentation showcases several case studies in which a broader approach has increased our understanding of submarine landslides in a variety of geologic settings. Three-dimensional seismic data from several continental margins (Trinidad, Brazil, Morocco, Canada, GOM), as well as data from outcrop localities are shown to explore geomorphological complexities associated with submarine landslides. Discussion associated with the characterization and classification of submarine landslides is also part of this work. Topics that will be cover include: 1) how data from conventional oil and gas exploration activities can be used to increase our understanding of the dynamic behavior of submarine landslides, 2) analogies between terrestrial submarine landslides and potential Martian counterparts, 3) impact of submarine landslides in margin construction, as well as their economic significance and 4) the importance of quantifying the morphology of submarine landslides in a systematic fashion.",

            "abstract": "Electron distribution functions can provide \"smoking-gun\" evidence for the detection of electron diffusion regions in collisionless magnetic reconnection. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal evolution of electron distributions during reconnection is significantly lacking, and will further elucidate the outstanding questions of how, where, and when electrons are energized during reconnection. Based on spacecraft observations and PIC simulations of symmetric reconnection, electrons in the inflow region are known to exhibit a temperature anisotropy Te// > Te⊥. Studies of exhaust electrons have reported hot and isotropic electrons, while others have reported anisotropic exhaust structures. Electron distributions in the vicinity of the X-line have a triangular, 3D velocity space structure with distinct striations corresponding to the number of times electrons reflect within the electron current layer. Here, we report the spatial and temporal evolution of electron distributions from the vicinity of the X-line to the end of the electron outflow jet, with the discovery that the discrete striations swirl and rotate as electrons re-magnetize, forming arc and ring structures. Highly structured, time-dependent electron anisotropy develops in the exhaust distributions only near or after the peak reconnection rate, explaining the previous discrepancy concerning the degree of electron anisotropy in the exhaust, and suggesting a technique to infer the evolution stage of reconnection using spacecraft measurements. We also present a theory for predicting the spacing of the striations of electron distributions in the vicinity of the X-line based on local measurements, which could be directly tested by spacecraft observations. Electron data from Cluster magnetotail reconnection inflows and exhausts exhibit many anisotropic structures as predicted by simulation. Observed distributions near the reconnection mid-plane (Bx ~ 0 nT) are often highly structured with populations exhibiting Te⊥ > Te// in addition to lower energy field-aligned beams. Our work advances the understanding of electron distribution evolution, setting a foundation to successfully interpret the high resolution electron data anticipated from NASA’s upcoming Magnetospheric Multi-Scale Mission.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence is emerging for the presence of strong seismic anisotropy in D'' based on the observation of various seismic phases. To explain these observations in terms of crystal preferred orientation, and test for the presence and deformation mechanisms of post-perovskite, we apply a multi-disciplinary forward model approach. Our setup in this study is quite similar to our earlier study in 2D (Wenk et al., 2011). We employ a 3D geodynamical model with temperature-dependent viscosity and kinematic velocity boundary conditions defined at the surface of the Earth to form a broad downwelling slab. Tracers in the geodynamical model track the velocity gradient tensor in the slab at the surface down to the core-mantle boundary. The deformational information in the lower mantle is fed into a viscoplastic polycrystal plascticity model, in which we assume all deformation is accommodated by dislocation creep. We test models of either perovskite or post-perovskite mixed with periclase. For the post-perovskite phase we vary which slip system is most active. We average single crystal elastic constants over the crystal pole orientations to obtain seismically distinguishable models of anisotropy.\nThe four resulting synthetic anisotropy models are evaluated against published seismic observations by comparing different anisotropic components: the radial anisotropy, the splitting for (sub-)vertical phases (i.e. azimuthal anisotropy), and the splitting for sub-horizontal phases. The patterns in shear radial anisotropy and splitting in sub-horizontal phases are consistent with post-perovskite with dominant slip on the (010)- and (001)-planes, confirming our earlier results in 2D. Overall, the (001)-model shows stronger anisotropy than the (010)-model, and its strongest patch localizes where the slab impinges on the core-mantle boundary. Radial anisotropy for P-waves could further constrain whether a slip system on the (010)-plane or the (001)-plane is most active. The azimuthal anisotropy patterns for all post-perovskite models shows fast axis directions at the edges of the slab (sub-)parallel to flow directions, suggesting horizontal flow directions may be mapped out in the lowermost mantle using seismic observations.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric forecasting has traditionally focused upon, and been limited by, our ability to forecast magnetospheric drivers one to two days in advance of a geomagnetic storm. The advances in this area are significant as physics-based solar wind propagation models have been transitioned to operations, and provide the time of arrival of a solar disturbance. Although predicting the magnetic field orientation and strength is still a challenge, once the solar wind drivers are forecast, the accuracy of the ionospheric predictions are dependent on the ability of thermosphere-ionosphere models to correctly capture the physical processes in the upper atmosphere response to magnetospheric energy and momentum dissipation. Many of the storm-time thermosphere responses impacting the ionosphere can be modeled reasonably well, such as changes in winds, gravity waves, temperature, density, and composition. However, some of the electric field effects driving storm enhanced plasma density and the disturbance dynamo are still a challenge. Under quieter geomagnetic conditions, forecasting solar extreme ultraviolet radiation becomes more important, as does the impact of forcing from the lower atmosphere. These two new research thrusts are also showing promise to provide the drivers of ionospheric prediction several days in advance. There is also a possibility that whole atmosphere models could provide the background conditions for forecasting ionospheric irregularities.",

            "abstract": "The Unified North American Soil Map (UNASM) was developed by Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) to provide more accurate regional soil information for terrestrial biosphere modeling. The UNASM combines information from state-of-the-art US STATSGO2 and Soil Landscape of Canada (SLCs) databases. The area not covered by these datasets is filled by using the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.21 (HWSD1.21). The UNASM contains maximum soil depth derived from the data source as well as seven soil attributes (including sand, silt, and clay content, gravel content, organic carbon content, pH, and bulk density) for the topsoil layer (0–30 cm) and the subsoil layer (30–100 cm), respectively, of the spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees in latitude and longitude. There are pronounced differences in the spatial distributions of soil properties and soil organic carbon between UNASM and HWSD, but the UNASM overall provides more detailed and higher-quality information particularly in Alaska and central Canada. To provide more accurate and up-to-date estimate of soil organic carbon stock in North America, we incorporated Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database (NCSCD) into the UNASM. The estimate of total soil organic carbon mass in the upper 100 cm soil profile based on the improved UNASM is 365.96 Pg, of which 23.1% is under trees, 14.1% is in shrubland, and 4.6% is in grassland and cropland. This UNASM data has been provided as a resource for use in terrestrial ecosystem modeling of MsTMIP both for input of soil characteristics and for benchmarking model output.",

These “methane windows” are exploited by the VIMS instrument on Cassini. After accounting for the atmospheric contribution to the VIMS data, we use a Radiative Transfer code (RT) that includes the most recent evaluations of the aerosol and methane opacity characteristics [1;2] in order to simulate the spectra and to infer the surface properties as well as any possible evolution with time. We focus on some equatorial regions that have been identified as possibly subject to changes, having particular spectral properties and possibly being the strongest cryovolcanic candidate regions, that is: Sotra Patera, Hotei Regio and Tui Regio [3;4;5]. In addition, we examine some test cases and a vast expansion of terrain called the ‘Blandlands’, which are all not expected to change with time as confirmed by our results. The only changes with time we find are for Tui Regio darkening from 2005-2009 while Sotra Patera brightens from 2005-2006 at all wavelengths, indicating that dynamical processes control the regions, compatible with their complex morphology. We also use a despeckle filtering technique [6] on RADAR data in order to retrieve more revealing information on the morphology of these regions. We also associate radiometric and topographic data with the compositional information from VIMS to derive constraints on the chemical composition and the geology of the surface and the nature of these regions [5].\n[1] Hirtzig, M., et al.: Icarus, 226, 470-486, 2013.

In a Lagrangian setting for the particle trajectory, Fickian has been assumed synonymous with linear in time mean square displacement (msd), while in an Eulerian setting for the concentration, it’s synonymous with a constant diffusion coefficient in Fick’s law. For a Fickian process the two settings are related; the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the coefficient that relates the msd to time. A Fickian process must be continuous with stationary, independent and Gaussian increments. The biggest weakness of the Fickian model is the assumption of independent increments, followed by stationarity and to a lesser extent the assumption of Gaussian increments. The conductivity field in most geological media is correlated over space, many times over a multitude of scales. The conductivity is related to the velocity through Darcy’s law and that in turn is the derivative of the position process, so why would one expect increments in the position process to be independent? Moreover, the conductivity is often nonstationary or has nonstationary increments so again why would one expect the position process to have stationary increments. We present a multitude of examples with correlated and/or nonstationary and/or non-Gaussian increments to illustrate problems with the Fickian assumption and the Fickian classification scheme.",

The IRTAM version 0.1B builds and publishes every 15-minutes an updated “global weather” map of the peak density and height in the ionosphere, as well as a map of deviations from the classic IRI climate.\n\nIncidentally, the IRTAM verification and validation efforts shed light on the forecasting capabilities of the assimilative IRI extension, even though it has not yet involved external activity indicators. At the core of the assimilative computations, a Non-linear Error Compensation Technique for Associative Restoration (NECTAR) seeks agreement between IRI prediction and the 24-hour history of latest observations at GIRO sensor sites to produce the one map frame. The NECTAR first evaluates the diurnal harmonics of the observed deviations from the IRI climatology at each GIRO site to then independently compute the spatial maps for each diurnal harmonic. Thus obtained “corrective” coefficients of the spatial-diurnal expansion are added to the original IRI set of coefficients to obtain the IRTAM specification.

            "abstract": "Over the past several years, there have been several breakthroughs in our ability to detect the very small fluorescence emitted by chlorophyll in vegetation globally from space. There are now multiple instruments in space capable of measuring this signal at varying temporal and spatial resolutions. We will review the state-of-the-art with respect to these relatively new satellite measurements and ongoing studies that examine the relationships with photosynthesis. Now that we have a data record spanning more than seven years, we can examine variations due to seasonal carbon uptake, interannual variability, land-use changes, and water and temperature stress. In addition, we examine how clouds and satellite viewing geometry impact the signal. We compare and contrast these variations with those from popular vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), related to the potential photosynthesis as well as with measurements from flux tower gas exchange measurements and other model-based estimates of Global Primary Productivity (GPP). Vegetation fluorescence can be simulated in global vegetation models as well as with 1D canopy radiative transport models. We will describe how the satellite fluorescence data are being used to evaluate and potentially improve these models.",

            "abstract": "Understanding permafrost distribution, rate of change, and influence on groundwater movement are critical for assessing climate change impacts in northern ecosystems. Lake-rich lowlands in interior Alaska provide important habitat for migratory waterfowl, ungulates, and other wildlife. Despite low annual precipitation, the Yukon Flats area in the north central Yukon River Basin of Alaska (USA) supports over 20,000 lakes, due in part to the presence of permafrost. The fate of this lake-rich lowland and, by proxy, similar circumboreal lowland systems under projected climate warming is the focus of a series of recent studies highlighted here. Lake water chemistry analyses of over 200 lakes in the Yukon Flats reveal a large degree of spatial heterogeneity suggestive of a hydrologically disconnected system, a conclusion also supported by abrupt spatial changes in lake elevation. Airborne geophysical characterization shows a laterally continuous shallow gravel layer (~25-m thick) that would offer good hydraulic connectivity throughout the lowlands. However, the gravel layer is generally frozen (as permafrost) except beneath surface water bodies; thus inhibiting lateral pathways of groundwater flow under current conditions. Ground-based geophysical characterization provides a high resolution of permafrost distribution and relevant hydrogeologic features at several lake study sites. Relatively recent thaw in the gravel layer appears to be associated with lakes that have experienced change in size (area) over the past several decades, whereas lakes with taliks (unfrozen conduits) that fully penetrate the permafrost layer are more likely to be stable. Multi-scale permafrost characterization provides the basis for numerical models that simulate permafrost dynamics, lake-talik evolution, supra-, intra-, and sub-permafrost groundwater flow, lake-groundwater exchange, active layer dynamics, and permafrost aggradation response to lake recession. Collective field and simulation results provide insight into expected alterations in groundwater flowpaths, water budgets, lake distribution, and lake chemistry in discontinuous permafrost lowlands given continued climate and permafrost change.

However, much of the world’s soil C lies below this surface zone, and the dynamics of this carbon in response to global change may differ considerably from those at the surface. We have implemented a vertically-resolved soil biogeochemistry model into the Community Land Model (CLM4.5), and discuss the uncertainties in adding this level of increased complexity as well as the implications of this representation on the response of C cycle feedbacks. We focus on the uncertainty of how decomposition rates differ between the surface and depth, and show that this uncertainty maps strongly onto the response of soil C to warming, which is primarily due to the response of permafrost soils and their post-thaw decomposition dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The projected population growth and changes in climate and dietary habits will further increase the pressure on water resources globally. Within precision farming, a host of technical solutions has been developed to reduce water consumption for agricultural uses. Examples are the shift from scheduled to demand-based irrigation and the use of sophisticated water distribution techniques. The next frontier for a more sustainable agriculture is the combination of reduced water requirements with enhanced ecosystem services. Currently, staple grains are obtained from annuals crops. Enhanced ecosystem services could be obtained shifting from annual to perennial crops, obtained by means of targeted breeding. In fact, perennial plants, with their continuous soil cover and the higher allocation of resources to the below ground, contribute to the reduction of soil erosion, water and nutrient losses, while enhancing carbon sequestration in the root zone. We explore here the implications for water management at the field- to farm-scale of both improved irrigation methods and targeted breeding. A probabilistic description of the soil water balance and crop development is employed to quantify water requirements and yields and their inter-annual variability, as a function of rainfall patterns, soil and crop features. Optimal irrigation strategies are thus defined in terms of maximization of yield and minimization of required irrigation volumes and their inter-annual variability. The probabilistic model is parameterized based on an extensive meta-analysis of traits of co-generic annual and perennial species (including both selected and wild species) to explore the consequences for water requirements of shifting from annual to perennial crops under current and future climates. The larger and more developed roots of perennial crops may allow a better exploitation of soil water resources than annual species. At the same time, perennial crops may require adequate water supply for longer periods and lead to lower yields per unit area, thus requiring irrigation of larger areas.",

            "abstract": "S-wave splitting analyses using high SNR low frequency earthquake (LFE) templates at 3-component stations across northern Cascadia indicate the presence of a heterogeneous distribution of crustal anisotropy in the North American plate. On southern Vancouver Island (SVI), we investigate the contribution to anisotropy from the Leech River Complex (LRC), an allochthonous terrane comprising strongly foliated greenschist-facies phyllites and amphibolite-facies schists with steeply dipping foliations striking E-W. Estimates of initial S-wave polarization direction are consistent with radiation patterns predicted from LFE focal mechanisms, providing corroboration for thrust along the plate boundary. Fast directions across mainland SVI are subparallel to the dominant foliation direction in the LRC. An eastward increase in depth normalized delay times combined with small-scale azimuthal variations in fast directions suggest a heterogeneous distribution of anisotropy. We test azimuthally anisotropic LRC models constrained by surface geology and seismic reflection studies using 3D spectral element method simulations. The preferred model of a NNE shallowly dipping wedge of LRC material with varying orientation of anisotropy terminating at mid crustal levels is able to recreate mean and azimuthal variations in fast directions along with variations in delay times, supporting the hypothesis of the LRC as a primary contributor to crustal anisotropy beneath SVI. For select stations where anisotropic LRC models do not recreate observations, fast directions are subparallel to local estimates of maximal compressive horizontal stress, suggesting fluid-filled cracks could be a source of anisotropy. We refute the idea that anisotropy along mainland SVI is primarily due to stress related cracks as has been suggested by prior studies. Fast directions at northern Washington stations exhibit variations with azimuth and incidence angle suggesting complex anisotropy interpreted as due to a combination of cracks and preferred mineral orientation of metamorphosed slates of the Olympic core rocks. These slates may also underlie stations on SVI and represent another source of anisotropy.",

Mud Lake (Mashkiigwaagamaag), located on the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Reservation in Carlton County, Minnesota, USA, once supported an extensive population of wild rice (manoomin). However, early 20th century attempts to ditch and drain surrounding wetlands for landuse intensification severely altered the natural hydrological system that supports wild rice. Fond du Lac Resource Management (FDLRM) technicians are currently working to increase the wild rice population in Mud Lake. As part of these efforts, this phytolith study was undertaken to better understand how wild rice abundance has fluctuated over the past 400 years, with particular emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. Phytoliths are microscopic opal silica plant remains that are incorporated into soils and lake sediments after the plant-parts that contain them decay. Wild rice produces phytolith morphotypes that are unequivocally diagnostic. Mud Lake core MNMN-MUD11-1C-1P-1 (46°43'38.39\"N, 92°42'2.45\"W) was piston cored by LacCore (National Lacustrine Core Facility) and FDLRM technicians on 24 May 2011. Initial core descriptions, multi-sensor core logging, phytolith sampling and phytolith extractions were completed during the summer of 2014 at LacCore. Wild rice phytolith identification and quantification was conducted on twelve samples using brightfield microscopy at 400x magnification. Wild rice phytolith concentration values ranged from 68 to 2,300 phytoliths/cm3. Wild rice accumulation rates ranged from 9 to 383 phytoliths/ cm2/yr, peaking in 1952 AD. Wild rice abundance in Mud Lake appears to be influenced by a complex set of variables that include anthropogenic disturbance, climatic events and aquatic plant community succession.",

Significant differences between models are identified in the magnitude of primary emissions, secondary OA (SOA) formation, the number of OA species used, the complexity of OA parameterizations (gas-particle partitioning, chemical aging, multiphase chemistry, aerosol microphysics), and the OA physical, chemical and optical properties. The diversity of the global OA simulation results has increased since earlier AeroCom experiments, mainly due to the increasing complexity of the SOA parameterization in models, and the implementation of new, highly uncertain, OA sources. Diversity of over an order of magnitude exists in the modeled vertical distribution of OA concentrations pointing to uncertainties in the parameterization of the semi-volatile character of OA and its temperature dependence, as well as OA long-range transport.\nFine aerosol organic carbon (OC) and OA observations from continuous monitoring networks and individual field campaigns have been used for model evaluation. Τhe combined model/measurements analysis suggests the existence of increased OA levels during summer due to biogenic SOA formation over large areas of the USA that can be of the same order of magnitude as the POA, even at urban locations, and contribute to the observed urban seasonal pattern. The global models are able to simulate the high secondary character of OA observed in the atmosphere as a result of SOA formation and of POA aging, although, the amount of OA present in the atmosphere remains largely underestimated.\nThe models skill with increasing model complexity with regard to OC or OA mass concentration will be presented and thoroughly discussed.

            "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interactions occur at sub-grid scale in most atmospheric models and remain as one major source of uncertainty in climate projection. The coarse (1-2 degrees) resolution typically employed in global climate models is insufficient to resolve these processes and is believed to lead to biases. In this study, we use the Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 (CAM5) running at grid spacing of 2, 1, 1/2, and 1/4 degrees, nudged toward the very high-resolution Year Of Tropical Convection (YOTC) analysis, to explore the resolution dependence of the model physics contributing to the simulation biases of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions.\nUsing satellite retrievals as well as surface and aircraft measurements, we find that many biases commonly observed in global climate models are significantly reduced by increasing resolution. The high-resolution model produces a more realistic simulation of extreme events of aerosol concentration and precipitation, cloud susceptibility to aerosols, and aerosol transport into the Arctic. These characteristics are related to the change of balance of physics that leads to stronger accretion over autoconversion in warm clouds, stronger but less frequent cloud droplet nucleation, and less collocation of aerosols and clouds. The estimate of aerosol indirect forcing is greatly reduced as a result. Although many of the aerosol and cloud processes remain sub-grid scale even at the highest resolution we explore here, our results suggest that a better characterization of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions can be achieved by increasing model resolution to better resolve meso-scale processes such as eddy transport and moisture convergence. Further improvement might rely on adequately addressing other sources of uncertainty in the model including the representation of physical processes (such as interactions between aerosols and convective clouds) and boundary forcing (such as aerosol emissions).",

I will present the case for key deficiencies in models that could explain their incorrect response. The first is a lack of explicit basal ice-shelf meltwater, which is instead parameterized\ncrudely to give mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheet and shelves. The second is a lack of ocean waves. The third is the zonal symmetry of stratospheric ozone trends when prescribed and/or biases in the ozone distribution in models with ozone predicted. The fourth is a misrepresentation of recent trends in the tropical sea surface temperature, and the attendant errors in atmospheric teleconnection to the Antarctic. I will show integration results that illustrate how and why the first and last of these deficiencies give rise to expanding sea ice. Finally, I will discuss how sea ice physics plays a role in combination with these missing processes.",

            "abstract": "Collection of physical samples in the field is an essential part of research in the Earth Sciences. Samples provide a basis for progress across many disciplines, from the study of global climate change now and over the Earth’s history, to present and past biogeochemical cycles, to magmatic processes and mantle dynamics. The types of samples, methods of collection, and scope and scale of sampling campaigns are highly diverse, ranging from large-scale programs to drill rock and sediment cores on land, in lakes, and in the ocean, to environmental observation networks with continuous sampling, to single investigator or small team expeditions to remote areas around the globe or trips to local outcrops. Cyberinfrastructure for sample-related fieldwork needs to cater to the different needs of these diverse sampling activities, aligning with specific workflows, regional constraints such as connectivity or climate, and processing of samples. In general, digital tools should assist with capture and management of metadata about the sampling process (location, time, method) and the sample itself (type, dimension, context, images, etc.), management of the physical objects (e.g., sample labels with QR codes), and the seamless transfer of sample metadata to data systems and software relevant to the post-sampling data acquisition, data processing, and sample curation.\nIn order to optimize CI capabilities for samples, tools and workflows need to adopt community-based standards and best practices for sample metadata, classification, identification and registration. This presentation will provide an overview and updates of several ongoing efforts that are relevant to the development of standards for digital sample management: the ODM2 project that has generated an information model for spatially-discrete, feature-based earth observations resulting from in-situ sensors and environmental samples, aligned with OGC’s Observation & Measurements model (Horsburgh et al, AGU FM 2014); implementation of the IGSN (International Geo Sample Number) as a globally unique sample identifier via a distributed system of allocating agents and a central registry; and the EarthCube Research Coordination Network iSamplES (Internet of Samples in the Earth Sciences) that aims to improve sharing and curation of samples through the use of CI.",

            "abstract": "‘Map your Hazards’ is an educational module developed within the NSF Interdisciplinary Teaching about Earth for a Sustainable Future program (InTeGrate). The module engages students in place-based explorations of natural hazards, social vulnerability, and the perception of natural hazards and risk. Students integrate geoscience and social science methodologies to (1) identify and assess hazards, vulnerability and risk within their communities; (2) distribute, collect and evaluate survey data (designed by authors) on the knowledge, risk perception and preparedness within their social networks; and (3) deliver a PPT presentation to local stakeholders detailing their findings and recommendations for development of a prepared, resilient community. ‘Map your Hazards’ underwent four rigorous assessments by a team of geoscience educators and external review before being piloted in our classrooms. The module was piloted in a 300-level ‘Volcanoes and Society’ course at Boise State University, a 300-level ‘Environmental Sociology’ course at Central Washington University, and a 100-level ‘Natural Disasters and Environmental Geology’ course at the College of Western Idaho. In all courses students reported a fascination with learning about the hazards around them and identifying the high risk areas in their communities. They were also surprised at the low level of knowledge, inaccurate risk perception and lack of preparedness of their social networks. This successful approach to engaging students in an interdisciplinary, place-based learning environment also has the broad implications of raising awareness of natural hazards (survey participants are provided links to local hazard and preparedness information). The data and preparedness suggestions can be shared with local emergency managers, who are encouraged to attend the student’s final presentations. All module materials are published at\nserc.carleton.edu/integrate/\nand are appropriate to a wide range of classrooms.",

            "abstract": "Reservoirs (aquifers) in fluvial channel belt sandstones can have very different subsurface flow behavior depending on the degree and distribution of internal heterogeneities. Fluvial channel belts are composed of multiple “storeys” formed as individual channel segments increase in sinuosity and then are cut off and abandoned. Heterogeneities are defined by depositional variations across storeys and inter-story connectivity patterns along the channel belt. Although commonly inferred to reflect the formative river pattern (sinuosity & braiding), the spatial arrangement of facies depend most directly on the relative preservation of deposits formed within different areas of the migrating channels and the lateral stacking arrangement of storeys due to style of bend cutoff. Grains are poorly sorted across the inner bank along upstream parts of channel bends and become better sorted laterally in downstream areas adjacent to a deeper thalweg scour. If deposition occurs evenly along the entire inner bank (bar), this grain size pattern leads to an elliptical body in planview with weak vertical grain size trends upstream and more fining-upward trend downstream. As channel bend segments migrate to a greater extent downstream, preserved inner-bank-bar deposits are increasingly dominated by upward-fining deposits and more outer-bank-deposits are preserved (“concave bank” deposits). Although concave bank deposits have highly variable character in different systems, vertical-grainsize trends tend to be weaker in straighter systems dominated by downstream-accretion, and more strongly upward-fining in higher sinuosity systems where these deposits form by eddy accretion or low flow aggradation. River cutoffs of straighter channel segments abandon slowly, leading to more gradual vertical fining. Subsurface heterogeneity prediction requires documentation of shape and character of deposits preserved in different zones within the channel (upstream and downstream inner bank, concave bank, thalweg scour lags, and abandonment fill). Systems with similar paleochannel pattern can leave deposits with very different subsurface heterogeneity arrangement.",

            "abstract": "Rapid kinematic slip inversions immediately following earthquake rupture is traditionally limited to teleseismic data and delayed many hours after large events. Regional data such as strong motion is difficult to incorporate quickly into images of the source process because baseline offsets render the long period portion of the recording unreliable. Recently it’s been demonstrated that high rate GPS can potentially produce rapid slip inversions for large events but is limited to very long periods. With an example of the 2011 M9 Tohoku-oki event we will demonstrate that the optimal on-the-fly combination of GPS and strong motion through a seismogeodetic Kalman filter produces reliable, broadband strong motion displacement and velocity waveforms that can be used for kinematic inversion. Through joint inversion of displacement and velocity waveforms we will show that it is possible to obtain a broadband image of the source. Furthermore, we will also show that it is possible to include offshore geophysical observables such as sea surface measurements of tsunami propagation from GPS buoys and ocean bottom pressure sensors into the kinematic inversion. These data better constrain the shallowest part of rupture. We will use the time-dependent deformation of bathymetry predicted from the inversion results as an initial condition for tsunami propagation and inundation modeling. Through a comparison to post-event survey observations we will demonstrate that it is possible to reproduce the inundation pattern along the coastline in great detail and argue that detailed site-specific forecast of tsunami intensity is achievable with current methods and instrumentation.",

            "abstract": "In the end-Ordovician Hirnantian stage, pyrite-sulfur and carbon isotope excursions coincide with a mass extinction and major glaciation [1]. The sulfur isotopic composition of Carbonate Associated Sulfate (δ34SCAS) is routinely measured as a proxy for the composition of ancient seawater sulfate, which offers a measure of Earth’s surface redox balance during this time. However, the variance among bulk-rock CAS samples commonly greatly exceeds analytical precision. CAS analytical techniques typically require large samples (normally >30g CaCO3), so integration of different synsedimentary and diagenetic components may explain this scatter.\nUsing a new sulfur isotope MC-ICP-MS analytical technique [2], we analyzed 5-10mg of well-preserved secondary layer fibrous calcite of brachiopod fossils collected from Late Ordovician-early Silurian sections on Anticosti Island, Canada, and compared these values to those obtained from texture-specific sampling of other carbonate phases found in these rocks. Brachiopod secondary layer calcites show a range of δ34SCAS values with only 2‰ variability—much less than the 21‰ range observed among less well-preserved and/or diagenetic components. Notably, micrite— a phase often valued for CAS analysis— is as much as 15‰ lower than brachiopods in the same hand sample. Recrystallized fossils and late diagenetic cements are enriched up to 6‰ from brachiopods. Thus, diagenetic processes can strongly impact and overprint CAS signals, even in carbonate rocks of exceptionally low thermal maturity.\nOur analysis of brachiopod CAS from these sections indicates that there was no marine sulfate excursion coeval with the Hirnantian carbon isotope excursion and glacial maximum. These observations support Jones and Fike’s interpretation of the noisier bulk-rock δ34SCAS record from Anticosti Island [1]. In addition, we measured the sulfur isotopic composition of CAS in a modern brachiopod to confirm that it provides a robust archive of seawater sulfate. A modern Terebratalia transversa from San Pedro, CA (20.52±0.11‰, V-CDT) is very slightly depleted relative to modern seawater (20.97±0.10‰, V-CDT) [2]. We are further exploring the range of modern brachiopod CAS.\n[1] Jones & Fike (2013) EPSL 363, 144-155. [2] Paris et al. (2013) Chem. Geol. 345, 50-61.",

The application of a riparian flow concentration integration model (RIM) explained a major part of variation in stream [DOC] arising from changing flow-pathways in riparian soils during the pre-treatment period (r2= 0.4-0.7), but less well after the harvest. Model residuals were highly sensitive to changes in soil temperature. The linear regression models for the temperature dependence of [DOC] in soils were not different in the disturbed and undisturbed catchments, whereas a non-linear response to soil moisture was found. Overall these results suggest that the increased DOC mobilization after forest disturbance is caused by (i) increased GW levels leading to increased water fluxes in shallow flow-path in riparian soils and (ii) increased soil temperature increasing the DOC availability in soils during summer. These relationships indicate that the mechanisms of DOC mobilization after forest disturbance are not different to those of undisturbed catchments, but that catchment soils respond to the higher hydro-climatic variation observed after clear-cutting. This highlights the sensitivity of boreal streams to changes in the energy and water balance, which may be altered as a result of both land management and climate change.",

A better understanding of the flow field from a levee breach allows the decision maker to assess risks and to prepare emergency plans. For this purpose, a two-dimensional numerical model is developed to simulate the levee breach. The model solves the shallow-water equations using the MacCormack explicit, finite- difference two-step, predictor-corrector scheme. The scheme is second-order accurate in time and space. The artificial viscosity technique is used to smooth the high-frequency oscillations in the computed results. The numerical results compare satisfactorily with the experimental results. A parametric study is carried-out to investigate the effect of main channel width, breach width on the computed flow field.",

            "abstract": "The Qinling orgenic belt resulted from collision between the North China plate and the Yangtze blocks during Triassic. In the South Qinling orogenic belt, there are lots of small porphyry bodies with area <0.5 km2. These porphyry bodies consist mainly of granodiorite porphyries in petrography. They are closely related to Cu, Mo, Au and Fe mineralization. In this presentation, we carry out an integrated study of LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating, geochemical and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic compositions for the porphyry bodies. U-Pb zircon dating shows that they have magma crystallization ages of 145~150 Ma.They are high-potassium calc-alkaline, characterized by high Sr (up to 1300 ppm) and Ba (up to 5000 ppm). Rear earth element data for the porphyries display moderately fractionated REE patterns with (La/Yb)N=9~26 and Eu/Eu*=0.8~1.0. Geochemical characteristics of the granodiorite porphyries are good consistent with high Ba-Sr granitoids [1,2]. These granodiorite porphyries have whole-rock initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from 0.7046 to 0.7075, εNd (t) values ranging from - 4.6 to - 2.5, and zircon εHf(t) values ranging from - 2.2 to +0.8. We suggest that their magma was derived from partial melting of enriched mantle sources. The strong enrichment of Sr and Ba imply that the mantle sources could be metasomatized by fluid or melt released from subducting slab (including sediments) due to previous subduction of the Ma-Lue ocean slab at the south of the South Qinling orogenic belt. Lithospheric delamination at ~150 Ma can account for their magma generation for the porphyries.\n",

            "abstract": "Although skill in forecasting the tracks of tropical cyclones (TCs) by operational forecast centers have improved steadily over the last 25 years, corresponding forecasts of TC intensity have shown little improvement until recently. These recent improvements in TC intensity forecasts appear to be related to a combination of better data assimilation, improved physics, and increased resolution in global operational numerical weather prediction models and new knowledge gained from a variety of recent TC-related field programs such as BGRIP, IFEX,and PREDICT. The first part of this presentation will briefly review the state of the art of TC track and intensity forecasting. The bulk of this presentation will address important TC-related science and operational challenges. These challenges include: 1) determining the physical processes that govern TC clustering, mutually interacting TCs, and the existence of different TC genesis pathways, 2) establishing how tropical-midlatitude interactions associated with recurving and transitioning (extratropical transition) TCs can trigger downstream baroclinic development, the subsequent formation of eastward-propagating Rossby wave trains, and the ensuing occurrence of extreme weather events well downstream, and 3) identifying critical TC-related forecast problems such as forecasts of the timing and extent of coastal storm surges and inland flooding associated with landfalling TCs). These important science and operational challenges will be illustrated with brief case studies.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) and dust deposited on snow and glacier surfaces can reduce the surface albedo, accelerate melt, and trigger albedo feedback. Assessing BC and dust concentrations in snow and ice in the Himalaya is of interest because this region borders large BC and dust sources, and seasonal snow and glacier ice in this region are an important source of water resources. Snow and ice samples were collected from crevasse profiles and snowpits at elevations between 5400 and 6400 m asl from Mera glacier located in the Solu-Khumbu region of Nepal. The samples were measured for Fe concentrations (used as a dust proxy) via ICP-MS, total impurity content gravimetrically, and BC concentrations using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2). BC and Fe concentrations are substantially higher at elevations < 6000 m due to post-depositional processes including melt and sublimation and greater loading in the lower troposphere. Because the largest areal extent of snow and ice resides at elevations < 6000 m, the higher BC and dust concentrations at these elevations can reduce the snow and glacier albedo over large areas, accelerating melt, affecting glacier mass-balance and water resources, and contributing to a positive climate forcing. Radiative transfer modeling constrained by measurements at 5400 m at Mera La indicates that BC concentrations in the winter-spring snow/ice horizons are sufficient to reduce albedo by 6-10% relative to clean snow, corresponding to localized instantaneous radiative forcings of 75-120 W m-2. The other bulk impurity concentrations, when treated separately as dust, reduce albedo by 40-42% relative to clean snow and give localized instantaneous radiative forcings of 488 to 525 W m-2. Adding the BC absorption to the other impurities results in additional radiative forcings of 3 W m-2. While these results suggest that the snow albedo and radiative forcing effect of dust is considerably greater than BC, there are several sources of uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "The Horizontal Wind Model (HWM) provides a framework for summarizing five decades of satellite, rocket, and ground-based observations. The development of a statistical consensus of these data provided the means to accurately specify the climatological spatiotemporal variability of upper atmospheric winds as function of day-of-year, time-of-day, latitude, longitude, and altitude. HWM includes representations of annual and semi-annual variations of the general circulation patterns and migrating tides via Fourier modulated vector spherical harmonics, B-splines, and 17,4000 optimally estimated coefficients. The approach works well for the thermosphere which is dominated by forced periodic oscillations driven by in-situ solar heating under the influence of the earths rotation, tilt, and orbit around the sun. Where average climatological specification are adequate for basic research and engineering applications HWM provides a readily accessible observationally based alternative to the need to compute them from first principles. Results from the newly updated version of the model (HWM14) are presented. In this update new satellite- and ground-based observations fill data gaps in the prior observational database of the 250 km altitude region. Additional changes where made to the model formulation to rectify problems near the poles. The model parameter estimation procedure was also improved. In the new approach all 17,400 unknown model parameters are simultaneously estimated using error-weighted sequential optimal estimation theory. This mitigates difficulties from local-time aliasing of synoptically sampled single satellite datasets; however the utilization of multiple satellite- and ground-based datasets is essential. Construction of the reference model also provides the opportunity to inter-compare the new measurements. Results are presented highlighting important aspects of; 1) the thermosphere zonal mean general circulation, 2) equatorial local time variations, 3) the geomagnetic controlled high latitude wind patterns, and 4) day-to-day variability. Lastly examples of where existing data coverage hampers current observational specifications, and thus validation of the theoretical understanding, are presented.\nThis work sponsored by the Office of Naval Research.",

            "abstract": "Unusually heavy rainfall occurred over the Colorado Front Range during early September 2013, with record or near-record totals recorded in several locations. It was associated predominantly with a stationary large-scale weather pattern (akin to the North American Monsoon, which occurs earlier in the year) that drove a strong plume of deep moisture inland from the Gulf of Mexico against the Front Range foothills. The resulting floods impacted several thousands of people and many homes, roads, and businesses. To diagnose possible anthropogenic contributions to the odds of such heavy rainfall, we adapt an existing event attribution paradigm of modelling a ‘world that was’ for September 2013 and comparing it to a modelled ‘world that might have been’ for that same time but for the absence of historical anthropogenic drivers of climate. Specifically, we first perform ‘world that was’ simulations with the regional WRF model at 12 km resolution over North America, driven by NCEP2 re-analysis. We then re-simulate, having adjusted the re-analysis to ‘world that might have been conditions’ by modifying atmospheric greenhouse gas and other pollutant concentrations, temperature, humidity, and winds, as well as sea ice coverage, and sea-surface temperatures – all according to estimates from global climate model simulations. Thus our findings are highly conditional on the driving re-analysis and adjustments therein, but the setup allows us to elucidate possible mechanisms responsible for heavy Colorado rainfall in September 2013. For example, preliminary analysis suggests that, given no change in the pattern of large-scale driving weather, there is an increase in atmospheric water vapour under anthropogenic climate warming leading to a substantial increase in the odds of heavy rainfall over the Front Range.",

            "abstract": "E. coli is widely used as an fecal indicator bacteria in streams. It has been shown that the interaction between sediments and the bacteria is an important factor in determining its fate and transport in water bodies. In this presentation parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis of a mechanistic model of bacteria-sediment interaction respectively using a hybrid genetic algorithm and Makov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach will be presented. The physically-based model considers the advective-dispersive transport of sediments as well as both free-floating and sediment-associated bacteria in the water column and also the fate and transport of bacteria in the bed sediments in a small stream. The bed sediments are treated as a distributed system which allows modeling the evolution of the vertical distribution of bacteria as a result of sedimentation and resuspension, diffusion and bioturbation in the sediments. One-dimensional St. Venant's equation is used to model flow in the stream. The model is applied to sediment and E. coli concentration data collected during a high flow event in a small stream historically receiving agricultural runoff. Measured total suspended sediments and total E. coli concentrations in the water column at three sections of the stream are used for the parameter estimation. The data on the initial distribution of E. coli in the sediments was available and was used as the initial conditions. The MCMC method is used to estimate the joint probability distribution of model parameters including sediment deposition and erosion rates, critical shear stress for deposition and erosion, attachment and detachment rate constants of E. coli to/from sediments and also the effective diffusion coefficients of E. coli in the bed sediments. The uncertainties associated with the estimated parameters are quantified via the MCMC approach and the correlation between the posterior distribution of parameters have been used to assess the model adequacy and parsimony.",

            "abstract": "In northern Ghana, groundwater is the main source of household water and is generally considered safe to drink. However in some areas it contains fluoride (F-) concentrations above the 1.5 ppm limit recommended by the World Health Organization, putting the users at risk of fluorosis. The study area in the Upper East Region of Ghana has pockets of groundwater F- up to 4.6 ppm and, as a result, also has a high percentage of residents with dental fluorosis. They have no alternative water source and, because of poverty and limited access to technology, lack the capacity to set up advanced treatment systems. One proposed solution is to attach F- adsorption filters to the wells, since adsorption is considered a simple and cost effective approach for treating high F-drinking water.\nThis study evaluates activated alumina as a sorbent for use in de-fluoridation filters in the study area. We evaluated the long-term adsorption capacity of activated alumina, and changes in F- adsorption rate and capacity with grain size. We measured differences in positive surface charge (C m-2) via slow acid titration, as well as F- loading with varied prior hydration time. Results from this research show no notable change in F- adsorption or positive surface charge when the activated alumina surface was pre-equilibrated in distilled water from 24 hours to 30 weeks. The results of F- loading show a maximum of ~3.4 mg F- sorbed per gm activated alumina (initial pH ~6.9, initial F- 1 to 60 ppm, 20 hr reaction time). The pH dependent surface charge is ~0.14 C m-2 at pH of ~4.4 and is zero at pH ~8.6.\nF- loading experiments were conducted with grain size 0.125 to 0.250 mm and 0.5 to 1.0 mm to evaluate changes in F- adsorption rate (initial pH ~6.9, initial F- 10 ppm) and F- loading (initial pH ~6.9, initial F- 1 to 60 ppm, 20 hr reaction time). The F- loading did not change with grain size. However time to equilibrium increased dramatically with a decrease in grain size - after one hour of reaction time, the larger grain size adsorbed only 59% of F-, while at the finer grain size 90% was adsorbed. Future work will determine the volume of high F- water that can be treated before activated alumina needs to be regenerated or changed. These data will aid in the design of a small-scale F- adsorption filter in the study area, and will predict the longevity of activated alumina as the sorbent.",

            "abstract": "The fundamental geological structure, geodynamics, and rheology of the Tibetan Plateau have been debated for decades. Two end-member models have been proposed: (1) the deformation of Tibet is broadly distributed and associated with ductile flow in the mantle and middle or lower crust, (2) the Tibetan Plateau formed during interactions between rigid lithospheric blocks with localization of deformation along major faults. The nature and distribution of continental deformation are governed by the varying rheology of rocks and faults in the lithosphere. Insights into lithospheric rheology can be gained from observations of postseismic deformation, which represents the response of the Earth’s interior to coseismic stress changes. Here we use up to 2 years of InSAR and GPS measurements to investigate postseismic displacements following the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in eastern Tibet and probe the differences in rheological properties across the edge of the Plateau. We find that near-field displacements can be explained by shallow afterslip on the Beichuan Fault, which is anti-correlated with the coseismic slip distribution. Far-field displacements cannot be explained by a homogeneous rheology, but instead require a viscoelastic lower crust (from 45 to 60 km depth) beneath Tibet with an initial effective viscosity of 4.4×1017 Pas and a long-term viscosity of 1018 Pas, whereas the Sichuan Basin block has a high-viscosity upper mantle (>1020 Pa s) underlying an elastic 35-km-thick crust. The inferred strong contrast in lithospheric rheologies between the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin is consistent with models of ductile lower crustal flow that predict maximum topographic gradients across the Plateau margins where viscosity differences are greatest.",

Different types of regionalization techniques have been developed which comprise regional climate models and statistical downscaling approaches such as conditional weather generators, artificial neural networks, synoptic studies, and transfer functions.\nIn the scope of climate variability and climate change the variations and changes of extremes are of special importance. Extreme events are not only of scientific interest but also have a profound impact on society. For the statistical downscaling of extremes, promising approaches have been introduced and/or developed further in the last few years.\nAspects of recent developments in the scope of statistical downscaling of extremes will be presented. In this context, various approaches to downscale extremes, particularly those associated with extreme precipitation events, will be discussed. Key problems related to statistical downscaling of extremes will be addressed. Furthermore, information on Working Group 4 \"Extremes\" of the EU COST action VALUE (www.value-cost.eu) will be provided.

Recent hydrographic data from Disko Bay (DB) showed a significant warming from the below of the cold Polar Water entering DB from the mid-to-late\n1990\ns onward, and the sill at the fjord mouth prevented the modified West Greenland Irminger Waters (WGIW) to fill the IIF basin. Here we identify and attempt to quantify the fluxes associated with the small-scale processes that contribute to the upward diapycnal fluxes of heat, salt and from the modified WGIW to the surface-mixed layer using five years of summer data (2009 - 2013). The interaction between the WGIW and Egedesminde Dyb trough cutting across the continental shelf from the shelf break into DB creates the cold/warm layering of water masses which contribute to the formation of double diffusive thermohaline staircases. We found evidence of thermohaline staircase consists of series of sharp interfaces across which both\nT\nand\nS\nincrease with depth separated by thick well-defined convective layers. We hypothesize that the warming of the PW layer in DB may have been caused by the upward heat fluxes from the AW driven double diffusive convection. Vertical heat fluxes estimated from laboratory-based flux laws for the diffusive regime of double diffusive convection were up to\n0.2\nWm\n−2\n. The other major player responsible for the Atlantic water heat loss is shear instabilities in the internal wave and tides generated by barotropic tidal flow over the Egedesminde Dyb trough, the continental shelf and across the sill at the entrance of IIF. Using moored pressure data, we found that the fjord could be described as a wave-fjord during neap tide and turns into a tidal jet-fjord during spring tide, therefore a weak nonlinear response due to supercritical conditions with flow separation over the sill and a linear baroclinic tidal response due to the deeper right side of the sill could be expected. We found enhanced eddy diffusivity\nK\nρ\nand dissipation rate\nϵ\nup to\n1.1×\n10\n−4\nm\n2\ns\n−1\nand\n9.81×\n10\n−6\nWkg\n−1\nrespectively in the deeper water inside IIF extending over an area more than\n10\nkm from the sill depth. We attribute this high level of mixing rate to an internal wave radiated far away from the sill where it was previously generated.",

Thus, in order to generate decadal or centennial projections of runoff and mass change of these glaciers it is important to be able to quantify the impact of surface debris on ice ablation.\nWhile exposed ice cliffs, ponded water and fluvial action are all important contributors to ablation within debris-covered areas, the focus here is on assessing the performance of a number of models of sub-debris melt of varying complexity. The goal is to determine the impact simplifying assumptions can be expected to have on glacier ablation over seasonal, annual and decadal timescales.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus is considered to possess a subsurface ocean interacting with the rock components [1,2]; yet, the chemical conditions of the interactions are poorly constrained. Cassini’s discovery of nano-silica particles derived from Enceladus implies the presence of high-temperature water–rock interactions [3]. However, the lack of N2 in the plumes [4] may question the presence of high-temperature conditions, because formation of N2 from NH3 is expected from equilibrium calculations [5]. Here, we report results from hydrothermal experiments to further constrain the conditions of water–rock interactions. To sustain the formation of nano-silica in Enceladus, the composition of the rocky core would need to be similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites, rather than highly-differentiated ultramafic rocks. We suggest that a change in pH of fluids upon mixing with seawater requires high reaction temperatures (≥~150°C) to sustain formation of nano-silica in Enceladus. Nano-silica particles in the ocean would readily dissolve if high-temperature reactions ceased, supporting the occurrence of present-day hydrothermal activity. Our results also show that formation of N2 from NH3 is kinetically inhibited even under high-temperature conditions. Under the conditions required for water–rock interactions to explain the observations, oxidization of ferrous iron and H2 production would proceed efficiently, which may provide a habitable environment for chemoautotrophic life on Enceladus.\n [1] Postberg et al., Nature 459, 1098 (2009).

After about 112 h of flight, it was captured by the Moon on 6 December, and entered a polar, near circular lunar orbit with an altitude of approximately 100 km. The probe’s flight on 100 km*100 km and 100 km*15 km orbit lasted about 4 days respectively, then the probe soft landed on the east of Sinus Iridum area at 13:11 UTC on 14 December successfully. Results on precision orbit determination and positioning of the lander and the rover are presented here. We describe the data, modeling and methods used to achieve position knowledge. In addition to the radiometric X-band range and Doppler tracking data, Delta Differential One-way Ranging (ΔDOR) data are also used in the calculation, which shows that they can improve the accuracy of the orbit reconstruction. Total position overlap differences are about 20 m and 30 m for the 100 km*100 km and 100 km*15 km lunar orbit respectively, increased by ~50 % with respect to CE-2. A kinematic statistical method is applied to determine the position of the lander and relative position of the rover with respect to the lander. The location of the lander is computed as: 44.1216º N, 19.5124º W and -2632.0 m in the lunar Mean Axes coordinate system. The position difference of the lander is better than 50 m compared to the result of the LRO photograph. From 15 to 21 December, the rover walked around the lander, and took photos of each other at the parking point A, B, C, D, E (max distance from the lander is about 25 m). The delta VLBI phase delay data are used to compute the relative position of the rover at the parking points, and the accuracy of the relative position can reach to 1-2 m comparing with the results of visual method.",

Their circumpolar spatial and temporal patterns are important for the understanding of land atmosphere exchange and changes in ground thermal properties. Datasets based on remotely sensed data are frequently used to evaluate climate models or to conduct trend analyses with respect to climate change. Although many circumpolar to global datasets are available, their applicability is often limited. A major challenge is the abundance of small lakes. This includes their impact on coarse resolution global products accuracy as well as their detection itself. Many studies have shown that the extent of the majority of tundra lakes is below the resolution of to date available global land cover datasets. An often followed strategy is to mosaic datasets from several months to years in order to overcome the problem of cloud coverage before application of long term change detection. However, many lakes vary seasonally in size. It can be shown that inundation patterns (with respect to lakes) are not limited to spring time by use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In addition seasonal changes of aquatic vegetation extent needs to be considered. This has been quantified over the Yamal region and a range of further sites (including PAGE21 sites, www.page21.eu) in Siberia.",

            "abstract": "Because of its great implications in the design and operation of hydraulic structures under changing environments (either climate change or anthropogenic changes), nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis has become so important and essential. Two important achievements have been made in methods. Without adhering to the consistency assumption in the traditional hydrological frequency analysis, the time-varying probability distribution of any hydrological variable can be established by linking the distribution parameters to some covariates such as time or physical variables with the help of some powerful tools like the Generalized Additive Model of Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). With the help of copulas, the multivariate nonstationary hydrological frequency analysis has also become feasible. However, applications of the nonstationary hydrological frequency formula to the design and operation of hydraulic structures for coping with the impacts of changing environments in practice is still faced with many challenges. First, the nonstationary hydrological frequency formulae with time as covariate could only be extrapolated for a very short time period beyond the latest observation time, because such kind of formulae is not physically constrained and the extrapolated outcomes could be unrealistic. There are two physically reasonable methods that can be used for changing environments, one is to directly link the quantiles or the distribution parameters to some measureable physical factors, and the other is to use the derived probability distributions based on hydrological processes. However, both methods are with a certain degree of uncertainty. For the design and operation of hydraulic structures under changing environments, it is recommended that design results of both stationary and nonstationary methods be presented together and compared with each other, to help us understand the potential risks of each method.",

            "abstract": "The northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) historically contains high concentration of multi-year ice (MYI). Previous research has shown that this region receives a continuous supply of MYI from the Arctic Ocean that is subsequently flushed southward into the Western Perry Channel during the summer melt season. This amount has never been quantified and the controls on southward advection have only been crudely investigated using coarse spatial resolution passive microwave observations that do not provide sufficient information regarding dynamics and thermodynamics for the sea ice in the northern CAA. This paper evaluates the utility of high spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to better understand the controls on sea ice dynamics within the northern CAA. SAR data was acquired from RADARSAT-1 between April and October, 2005, with an average temporal resolution of 3 days and spatial resolution of 100 m. A melt-freeze transition algorithm was developed to estimate the melt onset date. This is based on the temporal evolution of the backscatter coefficient (σo), which can be thresholded into melt onset for both seasonal first year ice (FYI) and MYI. The amount of sea ice flowing through the northern CAA was determined using the Canadian Ice Service Automated Ice Tracking System. Results indicate that melt onset dates for FYI are observed approximately two weeks earlier than MYI. The earlier melt onset date for FYI resulted in an increased open water area within the CAA, which provided more leeway for southward flow of MYI from the Arctic Ocean, via the northern CAA; leading to earlier than expected MYI flushed into the Western Parry Channel.",

            "abstract": "The objective of the Ocean Surface Mixing, Ocean Submesoscale Interaction Study (OSMOSIS) is to develop parameterizations of processes that deepen and shoal the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL). To meet this objective, a novel observational program was established to measure the evolution of the OSBL over an annual cycle (September 2012-September 2013). Observations include mooring-based measurements of temperature, salinity and velocity in the upper ocean (depths between 50 and 500 m), as well as continuous hydrographic measurements down to 1000-m depths from two ocean gliders within the mooring domain. The moorings were deployed in the North Atlantic over the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (48.69°N, 16.19°W), a region characterized by moderate mesoscale variability. Here, we present observations from five moorings spaced approximately 1.5 km apart.\nLateral gradients in velocity and buoyancy, coupled with seasonally varying stratification, depict a richness of structure characteristic of the submesoscale. Relative vorticity displays positive skewness during winter months (D-M) and zero skewness during summer months (J-N), with magnitudes reaching close to f. The former results indicate a preference for cyclonic motion during winter. Divergence and strain rate show less variation with season but divergence displays a slight negative bias, indicating a tendency for downward motion near the surface ocean. Lateral buoyancy gradients depict strong seasonal cycles, as well, with magnitudes during summer months exceeding those in winter months by a factor of 2 to 5. In all cases, standard deviations of the aforementioned quantities decrease with increasing depth. Observed statistics are supported by similar calculations from a seasonally varying, high-resolution (dx = dy = 500 m) numerical model. We close with estimates of potential vorticity, q, and discuss processes (e.g., frontogenesis, wind and buoyancy forcing) that may modify q and hence these turbulence statistics.",

            "abstract": "The Mars crustal density and thickness have been recently re-evaluated using petrological constraints from remote sensing, in-situ data, and SNC meteorites. This work indicates that the present-day Martian crust is denser and thicker than previously proposed if essentially basaltic in composition. As a consequence, the average crustal thickness would be commensurable with the depth of the basalt/eclogite transition, re-opening the question of crustal recycling on Early Mars and more generally throughout all its history. We have therefore investigated the conditions under which a thick ancient crust with an eclogitic root could survive through the history of Mars using numerical modelling. Delamination may occur if the combination of poorly constrained physical parameters induces the presence of gravitationally unstable layers and favors a rheological decoupling. To study the conditions and the time scales for the occurrence of crustal delamination on Mars, we investigated the influence of critical parameters for a plausible range of values corresponding to the Martian mantle. For each case we follow the dynamic evolution over geological times of a three-layer system (i.e., crust-mantle with a distinction between low pressure, buoyant basaltic crust and higher pressure, denser eclogitic material). We systematically varied four governing parameters within plausible ranges: (1) the basalt-eclogite transition depth, (2) the density difference between the mantle and the basaltic crust, (3) the density difference between the eclogitic crust and the lithosphere & mantle, (4) the viscous rheology. These experiments allow determining the average Martian crustal thickness at early and late evolutionary stages.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the inter-relationships between socio-economic factors and land cover pattern in the Idemili River Basin of South Eastern Nigeria. It is based on the concept of coupled human environment systems and focuses on the modelling of community scale relationships between critical land cover parameter and socio-demographic, economic and cultural factors in the basin. The modelling was implemented with pixel level NDVI indicators of vegetation cover density developed from NigeriaSat image with 32m resolution linked to eight indicators of socio-economic factors developed from a household survey of the basin. NDVI and socio-economic data were matched for 25 sampled localities in the basin and their relationships modelled with correlation, regression and Principal Component Analysis statistics. NDVI based image analysis showed a high level of human impact on vegetation. The Model output shows that bivariate relationships between vegetation cover dynamics and socio-demographic variables were the most significant, with R Square values > 0.60 for linear and non linear models. Vegetation cover density has high inverse correlations with population, urbanization levels and number of households in localities. Population/urbanization status of localities was also the most significant Principal Component or underlying dimension linked to spatial dynamics of vegetation cover in the basin accounting for 50% of factor variations. Relationships between vegetation cover densities and economic factors (occupational and household energy patterns) and socio-cultural factors (environmental knowledge, values and governance) were weaker and less significant. The study captured the linkages between landcover- represented by vegetation cover- and socio-economic parameters. It demonstrates that socio-economic factors are major drivers of change in the basin.\nKey Words: Socio-economic factors, Vegetation Cover, NDVI, Socio-ecological Systems, State Variables, South Eastern Nigeria",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of possible risks for shallow groundwater systems caused by brine displacement due to CO2 injection requires an investigation of possible vertical pathways in regional-scale structural settings. The project CO2BRIM investigates this crucial issue in collaboration with external stakeholders to integrate expert feedback on migration scenarios. To evaluate possible brine displacement scenarios we construct a regional-scale 3D structural model based on data which represent a typical geological setting of the North German Basin. The model has a horizontal size of 39 km times 58 km and includes 11 geological layers from the Permian Zechstein salt up to the Quaternary. It comprises an anticlinal structure on top of a salt pillow and an elongated salt wall that dissect the overburden. For the risk scenarios we include discontinuities in the regionally important Rupelian aquitard (Tertiary) and a transition zone along the salt flank as such discontinuities are supposed to provide permeable pathways for brines which could reach shallow drinking water horizons. Based on this model we develop scenarios in which we vary for example hydro-geological parameters of the geological discontinuities, the injection rate and the initial state of the system in terms of the salinity distribution. Furthermore we compare different levels of model complexity with regard to the physical processes considered and their effects on our results. During the process of scenario development, external experts were invited to participate and share knowledge and concerns on both brine migration risks and possible migration paths and mechanisms.\nThe results may help in site selection as they provide improved knowledge of pressure build-up in the reservoir and the overburden for such complex geological systems. Additionally, we want to identify the level of model complexity which is sufficient for this kind of setting with regard to the limited data availability at hand for the far field.",

For example, many pore-scale key features of reactive transport might not be properly resolved in Darcy-scale models. Their pore-scale counterparts might be “closer to reality\", but are computationally unfeasible when deployed on, e.g., field scale. Hybrid algorithms aim to combine the physical rigor of a pore-scale model with the computational efficiency of its continuum-scale representation. We present a hybrid model of immiscible displacement of one fluid by another, with a chemical reaction occurring in the region of contact between the two. Away from the reactive front, fluid flow in a fracture is described by one-dimensional Darcy’s law. In the vicinity of the reaction front, two-dimensional Stokes equations are used to model fluid flow and solute transport is described with advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The hybrid algorithm couples these two scales by introducing a small overlapping region, in which both models are solved. An iterative procedure is used to ensure the continuity of state variables and their fluxes across the interface between the two models. Results demonstrate significant improvement upon standard continuum-scale formulations.",

However, melt composition has been shown to strongly influence element partitioning [2], implying a control from the 'melt-chemistry' as well. Additionally, element partitioning can be pressure-dependent, in which case it is a useful marker of depth for planetary processes such as mantle melting, and crust or core formation.\nTo assess the effect of melt structure on partitioning at depth, we have investigated the local structure around trace and minor elements in melts at high pressure using two in situ techniques, high energy x-ray diffraction and EXAFS. X-ray diffraction data, once converted into pair distribution functions, are straightforward to interpret and give access to the full structure although overlaps between different contributions occur. In contrast, EXAFS is a chemically-sensitive probe that describes the local structure around a given element, but is model-dependent. Both methods will be illustrated by results obtained on two types of elements, some volatiles and some lithophiles.\n",

            "abstract": "Nucleation of mesospheric ice is assumed to occur on meteor smoke particles (MSP). Classical nucleation theory however includes several insufficiently known parameters when applied to the conditions at the mesopause for heterogeneous nucleation on MSP. This leads to a great uncertainty in the nucleation rate for mesospheric ice particles. By determining the parameters with the largest impact and comparing different theories we identified a possible range of nucleation rates. These nucleation rates were implemented in the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA).\nTo study the principal effects, CARMA was run in a one-dimensional setup with static background fields and also with dynamically driven fields from the Kühlungsborn Mechanistic Circulation Model (KMCM) for 69°N. The ice particle properties from both runs are compared with observational data from ALOMAR (69°N). We find that while the static background conditions lead to ice particles comparable to those measured by lidar above ALOMAR, the ice particles in the dynamically driven fields do not evolve to detectable populations. To account for the horizontal transport of ice particles, we extended the model to three dimensions and added a tracer algorithm, which enables us to follow the ice particles from their genesis to final evaporation and to analyse the whole life cycle of the ice particles.\nThe modelling studies are completed by a comparison to initial laboratory results for ice nucleation rates on nanometer sized particles under realistic mesopause conditions.",

These highly reactive systems have major consequences for lithospheric cooling, global geochemical cycles, carbon sequestration and microbial activity. However, little is known about the nature and distribution of microbial communities in subsurface ultramafic environments and the potential for a hydrogen-based deep biosphere in areas of active serpentinization and fluid circulation. The continuous flux of reduced compounds provides abundant thermodynamic energy to drive chemolithoautotrophy, however, carbon availability may be limited in these high pH environments and represent a challenge for microbial growth. Here we review serpentinization processes as fundamental to understanding the evolution of oceanic lithosphere and discuss open questions related to the impact of serpentinization on the subsurface biosphere. Motivations for drilling the shallow subseafloor of the Atlantis Massif include: (1) exploring the extent and activity of the subsurface biosphere in young ultramafic and mafic seafloor; (2) quantifying the role of serpentinization in driving hydrothermal systems, in sustaining microbiological communities and in the sequestration of carbon in ultramafic rocks; (3) assessing how abiotic and biotic processes change with aging of the lithosphere and with variations in rock type; and (4) characterizing tectono-magmatic processes at OCCs and the evolution of hydrothermal activity associated with detachment faulting.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological models frequently suffer from limited predictive power despite adequate calibration performances. This can indicate insufficient representations of the underlying processes. Thus ways are sought to increase model consistency while satisfying the contrasting priorities of increased model complexity and limited equifinality. In this study the value of a systematic use of hydrological signatures and expert knowledge for increasing model consistency was tested. It was found that a simple conceptual model, constrained by 4 calibration objective functions, was able to adequately reproduce the hydrograph in the calibration period. The model, however, could not reproduce 20 hydrological signatures, indicating a lack of model consistency. Subsequently, testing 11 models, model complexity was increased in a stepwise way and counter-balanced by using prior information about the system to impose “prior constraints”, inferred from expert knowledge and to ensure a model which behaves well with respect to the modeller’s perception of the system. We showed that, in spite of unchanged calibration performance, the most complex model set-up exhibited increased performance in the independent test period and skill to reproduce all 20 signatures, indicating a better system representation. The results suggest that a model may be inadequate despite good performance with respect to multiple calibration objectives and that increasing model complexity, if efficiently counter-balanced by available prior constraints, can increase predictive performance of a model and its skill to reproduce hydrological signatures. The results strongly illustrate the need to balance automated model calibration with a more expert-knowledge driven strategy of constraining models.",

Understanding the components and processes contributing to the global carbon cycle across a landscape is essential to understand climate change drivers and predicting future climate. Although the role of streams and rivers in transporting and processing nutrients from the land to the ocean has been widely recognized, most climate models still consider riverine systems as mere conduits without processing capacity. Evasion of carbon dioxide from inland waters has only been recently acknowledged to be an important source of carbon to the atmosphere and still, these estimations don’t take into account evasion from headwater streams due to a lack of data. Here we present a 10-year C budget for a small headwater stream draining a 96-ha watershed in western Oregon, USA. This stream exported ~5000 g C per m2 of stream area, approximately 9% of the ecosystem production of the catchment (NEP). Export is dominated by evasion of CO2 to the atmosphere (~2200 g C per m2/y) and by downstream transport of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC, ~1300 g per m2/y). Although highest in-stream pCO2 and DIC concentrations happen during summer low-flows, most stream export happens during winter high flows indicating at least a seasonal lag between CO2 production (i.e., respiration) and carbon export.",

Additionally, land use and land cover conditions have been shown to impact regional climate through changes in surface flux partitioning. This study aims to build on such prior work by assessing the impact of both carbon fertilization of vegetation growth and historical land use change (LUC) on the coupling between the land surface and the atmosphere. Multiple metrics of land-atmosphere coupling strength are analyzed from simulations with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Earth System Model ESM2G. We compare an ensemble of historical simulations, which include both a LUC reconstruction and enhanced vegetation growth in response to elevated CO2, to ensembles with (1) the LUC reconstruction removed, with vegetation replaced with potential vegetation, and (2) the CO2 fertilization effect removed, with the vegetation seeing preindustrial CO2 levels throughout the simulation. These simulations help to elucidate the potential impact of vegetation on the decadal and lower frequency evolution of climate, and how that impact might change in the future.",

            "abstract": "Meltwater released by glaciers can be of high importance for the overall run-off and thus affect society and development of mountainous regions and their forelands. However, glaciers are mostly located in harsh and remote environment and detailed in-situ measurements are impossible or limited to few glaciers. This lack of measurements of glacier characteristics (e.g. area, debris cover, flow) and mass budgets hampers a correct glacio-hydrologic modelling and representation of processes in advanced simulation models. Remote sensing has been proven a powerful tool in providing essential data to fill this gap. The most basic information in this respect is the location and area of the glaciers. A global and some regional inventories exist, but the uncertainties and differences among them are high, especially with respect to the upper accumulation area and debris cover. I here present a multi-method approach to map glaciers more precisely based on remote sensing data and combining image ratioing (using visible, infrared and thermal bands), micro-wave coherence images, terrain analysis, differencing of digital elevation models (DEMs) and, if available, high resolution images. DEM differencing is used to provide region-wide mass balance assessments, but volume to mass conversion and data voids introduce uncertainties. For High Mountain Asia (HMA), a crucial region in terms of water resources and glacier changes, most studies concentrate on the period after the year 2000 with the SRTM-DEM as baseline data set. However, declassified satellite data from the 1960s and 1970s also exist and allowed to extend the data record back in time for several regions in HMA. Using an example from an ice-covered area of ~5000 km² in the Aksu-Tarim catchment in Central Tien Shan the importance of remote sensing for glacio-hydrological modelling is shown. This is especially true for debris-covered and surge-type glaciers whose reaction to climate is still not fully understood. Therefore, special emphasis is given on the opportunities and challenges of remote sensing to assess the characteristics of the glaciers (e.g. debris thickness, presence of supra-glacial lakes and ice cliffs), as well as their changes in length, area, mass and velocity to provide calibration and validation data for glacio-hydrological models.",

The optimal interpretation of these datasets requires a new generation of multiple-resolution tomographic imaging approaches. Our recent anisotropic S-wave tomography model SAVANI is adaptive and multi-scale in the sense that it relies on a data-driven adaptive parameterization scheme, which automatically adjusts grid size to local ray sampling density, where demanded by the data. Such automatic rescaling of the parameterization grid provides an efficient means to stepwise improve upon a global background model by updating the tomographic system whenever new observations become available. Since our method employs phase and dispersion measurements from the complete time- and frequency range of the seismic record, it is akin to other types of waveform inversion and sensitive across the entire depth extent of the mantle. We present our current work towards an update of the purely ray-theoretical first version of SAVANI, which involves the reinterpretation of the regional portion of our global dataset using more accurate full-waveform based sensitivity functions that should facilitate an adequate extraction of high-resolution regional structure in areas where data coverage permits it. Adaptive-resolution tomography models, as developed with our algorithm, honour the multi-scale nature of mantle convection, and have various advantages over purely global models when applied in the study of global and regional geodynamics. We focus here on upper mantle dynamics and the evolution of the oceanic lithosphere. Importantly, we find a distinct decorrelation between anisotropy patterns as observed in our tomography and conceptual half-space cooling models or dynamic predictions of anisotropic texture, respectively. This observation implies that sub-oceanic anisotropy could be independent of the age of the ocean floor. We discuss associated shortcomings in tomographic resolution, evaluating a family of competing dynamic models of radial upper mantle anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to lower the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from 75 ppbv to a range of 60-70 ppbv on the basis of the latest health evidence. Rising Asian emissions, more frequent wildfires, and poorly understood deep stratospheric intrusions may pose challenges to achieving more stringent ozone standards over high-elevation Western U.S. (WUS) regions. Understanding the factors driving daily to decadal variability in sources of ozone is thus relevant to an effective implementation of the ozone NAAQS in WUS states. Here I present a detailed analysis of WUS surface ozone variability during 1980-2050, based on observations and a suite of chemistry-climate model simulations designed to isolate the role of changes in meteorology, background, STT, wildfires, methane, and Asian vs. North American anthropogenic emissions. Our analysis identifies the key role of stratospheric intrusion frequency on year-to-year variability in springtime high-ozone events measured at high-elevation WUS sites. We show more frequent late spring deep stratospheric intrusions when the polar jet stream meanders towards the southwestern United States, as occurs following strong La Niña conditions. Fewer and weaker intrusion events followed the pronounced positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation in response to volcanic aerosols from the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.\nWith Asian emissions, global methane, and meteorology varying with time, the model simulates a background ozone increase of 0.20-0.45 ppb yr-1 (P≤0.01) at high-elevation WUS sites for spring during 1988-2012. With global methane and meteorology varying with time, the model shows an increasing ozone trend of 0.1-0.2 ppb yr-1 in spring (0.01<P≤0.05). For summer, increasing Eurasian and North American boreal fires in the 2000s as compared to the 1980s contribute to simulated increases in background ozone over the northeastern U.S., with implications for possibly more frequent fires in a warming climate. I will further discuss the extent to which projected changes in methane and Asian emissions in RCP8.5 and 4.5 scenarios contribute to lower tropospheric ozone changes over the WUS during 2005-2050.",

            "abstract": "McCorkle and Emerson discovered in 1988 that the carbon isotope (δ13C) gradient between bottom water and pore-water at the anoxic boundary increases with increasing bottom water oxygen concentrations [O2]. Their observations agree remarkably well with stoichiometric pore-water δ13C and [O2] model predictions, suggesting that such a δ13C gradient can be used to calculate bottom water [O2]. We have refined the novel δ13C gradient proxy formulated by McCorkle and Emerson, adding new observations. We show that the δ13C gradient between bottom water and pore-water at the anoxic boundary can be approximated by the δ13C difference between bottom water and test carbonate d13C of benthic foraminifera Globobulimina spp. This species has a habitat adapted to the conditions as the dysoxic/anoxic boundary. The δ13C gradient measured by the δ13C difference between bottom water and deep infaunal Globobulimina spp. from moderns core-tops compare well with those obtained from bottom- and pore-water measurements, confirming that Globobulimina spp. δ13C reflects in situ anoxic boundary pore-water δ13C. Furthermore, the δ13C gradient between bottom water and pore-water at the anoxic boundary can be estimated from the δ13C difference between epifaunal Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi, which records bottom water δ13C DIC, and deep infaunal Globobulimina spp.\nApplication of this δ13C isotope gradient proxy on core MD95-2042, from the Iberian margin, provides quantitative constraints on changes in oxygen and respired carbon concentrations in the Northeast Atlantic over the last 150,000 years. Our reconstruction shows that bottom water oxygen concentrations were lower by 55 and 75 µmol/kg during the last and penultimate glacial maxima relative to present day concentrations, and that remineralized organic carbon concentrations were at least doubled. The glacial changes in deep Atlantic oxygen and respired carbon concentrations are due to decreased ventilation linked to ocean circulation change and possibly a globally improved biological pump.",

            "abstract": "Fluctuations in the ambient atmospheric pressure result in motion of air in porous fractured media. This mechanism, known as barometric pumping, efficiently transports gaseous species through the vadose zone to the atmosphere. This is of interest in fields, such as transport of trace gases from soil to atmosphere, remediation of contaminated sites, radon in buildings, leakage from carbon sequestration sites and detection of nuclear explosions.\nThe fractures are modeled as polygonal plane surfaces with a given transmissivity embedded in a permeable matrix. The slightly compressible fluid obeys Darcy’s law in these two media with exchanges between them. The solute obeys convection-diffusion equations in both media again with exchanges.\nThe fractures and the porous medium are meshed by triangles and tetrahedra, respectively. The equations are discretized by the finite volume method. A Flux Limiting Scheme diminishes numerical dispersion ; the solute transfer between the fractures and the porous medium is precisely evaluated. The resulting equations are solved by conjugate gradient algorithms.\nThis model is applied to the Roselend Natural Laboratory. At a 55 m depth, a sealed cavity allows for gas release experiments across fractured porous rocks in the unsaturated zone. The fractures are hexagons with a radius of 5m; their density is larger than 2.4 10-3 m-3; the aperture is about 0.5 mm. The pressure fluctuations are sinusoidal, of amplitude 0.01 bar and period 1 week. The solute concentration is equal to 1 at the bottom.\nSystematic results will be presented. First, the precision of the calculations is assessed. Second, the pressure and solute concentration fields are displayed and discussed. Third, the influence of the major parameters (fracture density, aperture, porosity, diffusion coefficient,…) is illustrated and discussed.\nThese results are discussed in terms of the amplification of solute transfer to the ground surface by the pressure fluctuations.",

            "abstract": "Magmas degas volatiles during ascent from the mantle and mafic melts with 7 wt% H2O attain volatile saturation at ~15km depth. Magmatic gases are dominated by H2O, CO2 and S species, independent of their tectonic setting. At rift volcanoes, C is sourced from the mantle whereas arc volcanoes sample both mantle and subducted C.\nVolcanic gases provide detailed information on volatile sources and degassing processes. Comparison of fumarole gases with melt inclusions and volcanic plumes shows that most fumaroles sample degassed magma. Water, CO2 and S vary significantly between tectonic settings. The Kuriles, Japan, and Kamchatka have H2O/CO2 of 40 to 800 while other arcs such as the Cascades, Central America, S. America, Java, and Aeolian have ratios of 1 to 70. Gases from rift volcanoes have H2O/CO2 between 3 and 9. Some of these variations are due to addition of meteoric and subducted water, as evidenced by O and H isotopes. Speciation of H and C in volcanic gases are typically controlled by redox buffer reactions imposed by the Fe3+-Fe2+ (i.e. QFM) rock buffer or the SO2-H2S gas buffer. In more exotic systems such as Poás, hydrothermal S phases such as liquid native S can play a role in high T gas C and H speciation.\nArcs dominate the global subaerial volcanic CO2 emission budget and arc total fluxes vary significantly i.e. only about 2 t/yr/km from the Aleutians and about 65 t/yr/km from Central America. Reasons for this are poorly constrained and may include variability in subducted material or slab/mantle conditions at depth. A large uncertainty results from use of generalized arc-wide C/S ratios, used in calculating C fluxes, and the paucity of data for remote arcs. Resolving C fluxes from subducted versus mantle or crustal (assimilated) C relies on C isotope ratios, which can vary spatially and temporally as a function of source or degassing processes. Therefore, when considering the deep C cycle and Cexchange between the interior and surface of the Earth, integrated studies with complete gas compositions, plume C/S and flux measurements, C isotopes and melt inclusions are needed.",

            "abstract": "Geological, geochemical, and geophysical research is often field based with travel to remote areas and collection of samples and data under challenging environmental conditions. Cross-disciplinary investigations would greatly benefit from near real-time data access and visualisation within the existing framework of databases and GIS tools. An example of complex, interdisciplinary field-based and data intensive investigations is that of volcanologists and gas geochemists, who sample gases from fumaroles, hot springs, dry gas vents, hydrothermal vents and wells. Compositions of volcanic gas plumes are measured directly or by remote sensing. Soil gas fluxes from volcanic areas are measured by accumulation chamber and involve hundreds of measurements to calculate the total emission of a region. Many investigators also collect rock samples from recent or ancient volcanic eruptions. Structural, geochronological, and geophysical data collected during the same or related field campaigns complement these emissions data.\nAll samples and data collected in the field require a set of metadata including date, time, location, sample or measurement id, and descriptive comments. Currently, most of these metadata are written in field notebooks and later transferred into a digital format. Final results such as laboratory analyses of samples and calculated flux data are tabulated for plotting, correlation with other types of data, modeling and finally publication and presentation.\nData handling, organization and interpretation could be greatly streamlined by using digital tools available in the field to record metadata, assign an International Geo Sample Number (IGSN), upload measurements directly from field instruments, and arrange sample curation. Available data display tools such as GeoMapApp and existing data sets (PetDB, IRIS, UNAVCO) could be integrated to direct locations for additional measurements during a field campaign. Nearly live display of sampling locations, pictures, and comments could be used as an educational and outreach tool during sampling expeditions. Achieving these goals requires the integration of existing online data resources, with common access through a dedicated web portal.",

            "abstract": "Systems at thermal equilibrium have their distribution function of particle velocities stabilized into a Maxwell distribution, which is connected with the classical framework of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. However, Maxwell distributions are rare in space plasmas; the vast majority of these plasmas reside at stationary states out of thermal equilibrium, which are described by kappa distributions. Kappa distributions do not embody BG statistics, but instead, they are connected with the generalized statistical framework of non-extensive statistical mechanics that offers a solid theoretical basis for describing particle systems like collisionless space plasmas. Through the statistical formulation of kappa distributions, basic thermodynamic variables like the temperature, thermal pressure, and entropy, become physically meaningful and determinable, similarly to their classical BG description at thermal equilibrium. In addition, useful formulations of kappa distributions were developed in order to describe multi-particle distributions, and particle systems with a non-zero potential energy. Finally, the variety of kappa distribution formulations and the proven tools of non-extensive statistical mechanics have been successfully applied to a numerous space plasmas throughout the heliosphere, from the inner heliosphere (e.g., the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres) to the outer heliosphere (e.g., the inner heliosheath) and beyond.",

            "abstract": "The breakup of the Northeast Atlantic in the Early Eocene was magma-rich, forming the major part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP). This is seen as extrusive and intrusive magmatism in the continental domain, and as a thicker than normal oceanic crust produced the first few million years after continental breakup. The maximum magma productivity and the duration of excess magmatism varies along the margins of Northwest Europe and East Greenland, to some extent as a function of the distance from the Iceland hotspot. The Vøring Plateau off mid-Norway is the northernmost of the margin segments in northwestern Europe with extensive magmatism. North of the plateau, magmatism dies off towards the Lofoten Margin, marking the northern boundary of the NAIP here. In 2003, as part of the Euromargins Program we collected an Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) profile from mainland Norway, across the Lofoten Islands, and out into the deep ocean. Forward velocity modeling using raytracing reveals a continental margin that shows transitional features between magma-rich and magma-poor rifting. On one hand, we detect an up to 2 km thick and 40-50 km wide magmatic underplate of the outer continent, on the other hand, continental thinning is greater and intrusive magmatism less than farther south. Continental breakup also appears to be somewhat delayed compared to breakup on the Vøring Plateau, consistent with increased extension. This indicates that magmatic diking, believed to quickly lead to continental breakup of volcanic margins and thus to reduce continental thinning, played a much lesser role here than at the plateau. Early post-breakup oceanic crust is up to 8 km thick, less than half of that observed farther south. The most likely interpretation of these observations, is that the source for the excess magmatism of the NAIP was not present at the Lofoten Margin during rifting, and that the excess magmatism actually observed was the result of lateral transport from the south around breakup time.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is increasingly used to reconstruct paleotemperatures of ancient terrestrial environments. One promising application is elucidating paleoelevation from carbonate archives such as paleosols, lacustrine marls, and fossil freshwater shells. Unlike conventional stable isotope approaches (e.g., mineral δ18O or δD), clumped isotope thermometry is independent of the isotopic composition of the precipitating waters and can therefore be used to reconstruct elevation by both the temperature-altitude relationship and the rainfall δ18O-altitude relationship. However, interpretation of clumped isotope data is not without its own complications. Like conventional stable isotopes, clumped isotope paleotemperatures can be effectively reset to warmer values by dissolution/reprecipitation-type diagenesis during sedimentary burial. It is also known that carbonate clumped isotope bonds (i.e., 13C-18O) are susceptible to ‘reordering’ in the solid mineral lattice at warmer burial temperatures, with laboratory studies of natural carbonates indicating activation of this phenomenon at temperatures as low as 100 °C over geologic timescales. A challenge in applying carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to natural samples is now evaluating terrestrial archives with respect to both types of alteration: ‘open-system’ alteration and ‘closed-system’ bond reordering. In this talk we will review our experimental efforts to constrain the kinetics of clumped isotope reordering, with relevance to low-temperature carbonates like fossil shells and early diagenetic minerals, and present new laboratory data that further inform our theoretical framework for the mechanism(s) of 13C-18O bond reordering. Together with traditional analytical and petrographic screening for recrystallization, empirical and laboratory studies of carbonate clumped isotope reordering represent the next steps in evaluating isotopic records of paleoclimate, paleobiology, and paleoelevation that are emerging from clumped isotope analyses.",

            "abstract": "One of the mysteries of Mars’ geology is the origin of widespread, layered, friable deposits that likely formed through air fall deposition. The enigmatic chaos terrains are largely composed of such deposits, as are many of the most intriguing layered, clay- and sulfate-bearing deposits of astrobiological interest. Such deposits are most likely of volcanic origin, but lack an obvious source, based on comparison with well-known volcanic provinces [1]. We suggest that these deposits may have been sourced from previously unrecognized explosive volcanoes in Arabia Terra. While Arabia is not traditionally considered to be a volcanic region, we propose that several of the large depressions in the area are in fact calderas that formed through a combination of structural collapse and explosive volcanism. These features are characterized by the observation of sets of nested depressions, association with ridged plains, development of ring fractures and faults, the presence of interior slump blocks, and direct association, in some cases, with friable deposits, lavas and evidence for lava lakes. Eden Patera is the type example and shows evidence for three nested calderas with >4000 km3 of collapse volume. Siloe Patera also contains a set of nested collapse features that occur within a zone of demagnetized crust that might indicate the presence of a magma chamber at shallow depth [2]. It is not yet clear why explosive volcanoes may have formed in Arabia Terra, but we suggest that they might represent the rapid rise of mafic magmas through a thin crust. They might represent more silicic or volatile-rich magmas, but these scenarios do not appear to be necessary [3]. We suggest that explosive mafic volcanism was an important aspect of early Martian geological processes.\n[1] Kerber, L., Head III, J., Madeleine, J. B., Forget, F. & Wilson, L.

            "abstract": "In this study, a new methodology is developed to improve the climate simulation of state-of-the-art coupled GCMs, by post-processing based on the inter-model diversity (i.e. ensemble spread from the Multi-Model Ensemble (MME)). Based on the close connection between the interannual variability and climatological state, the distinctive relation between the inter-model diversity of the interannual variability, and that of the basic state, is found. Based on this relation, the simulated interannual variabilities can be improved, by correcting their climatological bias. In order to test this methodology, the dominant inter-model difference in precipitation responses during the ENSO is investigated, and its relationship with climatological state. It is found that the dominant inter-model diversity of the ENSO precipitation in CMIP5 is associated with the zonal location shift of the positive precipitation center during El Nino. This dominant inter-model difference is significantly correlated with the difference in the basic state. The models with wetter (dryer) climatology than the climatology of the MME over the central Pacific, tend to shift positive ENSO precipitation anomalies to the east (west). Based on the model’s systematic errors in atmospheric ENSO response and bias, it is shown that the models with better climatological state tend to simulate more realistic atmospheric ENSO responses. Therefore, the statistical method to correct the ENSO response by minimizing mean bias mostly improves the ENSO response. After the statistical correction, the deficiencies in simulating the MME ENSO precipitation are improved, so that the pattern correlation of tropical atmospheric MME response is increased from 0.81 before the correction, to 0.92 after the correction. In particular, this improvement is robust in the models whose original response is far from realistic. These results provide the possibility that the methodology developed in this study can also be applied to improve climate projection and seasonal climate prediction.",

            "abstract": "We present the nowcast model for low energy (< 200 keV) electrons in the inner magnetosphere, operating online under the SPACECAST project (http://fp7-spacecast.eu) which is the version of the Inner Magnetosphere Particle Transport and Acceleration model (IMPTAM) for electrons. Low energy electron fluxes are very important to specify when hazardous satellite surface charging phenomena are considered. The presented model provides the low energy electron flux at all L-shells and at all satellite orbits, when necessary. The model is driven by the real time solar wind and Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) parameters with 1 hour time shift for propagation to the Earth’s magnetopause, and by the real time Dst index. Real time geostationary GOES 13 or GOES 15 (whenever which available) data on electron fluxes in three energies, such as 40 keV, 75 keV, 150 keV, are used for comparison and validation of IMPTAM running online. On average, the model provides very good agreement with the data, the basic level of the observed fluxes is very well reproduced. The best agreement between the modeled and the observed fluxes are found for <100 keV electrons. At the same time, not all the peaks and dropouts in the observed electron fluxes are reproduced. For 150 keV electrons, the modeled fluxes are often smaller than the observed ones by an order of magnitude. We estimate the The Normalized Root-Mean-Square Deviation (NRMSD), compute the binary event tables for 1 hour window to reveal the model hit rates and Heidke Skill Scores. This is the first attempt to model low energy electrons in real time at 10 minutes resolution. The output of this model can serve as an input of electron seed population for the higher-energy radiation belt modeling.",

            "abstract": "The solar wind displays temperature anisotropy associated with the protons that cannot be understood by double adiabatic theory alone. In the absence of significant heat flux or collisions, the kinetic plasma instabilities driven by these proton temperature anisotropy are considered to play a crucial role in regulating the temperature anisotropy. To understand this problem, linear and quasi-linear theories as well as particle simulation methods are often employed by researchers. However, application of these research tools has hitherto been largely confined to uniform plasmas. To employ these methods to an inhomogeneous solar wind is not so straightforward. The present paper employs quasi-linear theory to investigate quasi-stationary spatial distribution, structure, and characteristics of unstable proton-cyclotron and parallel firehose modes in inhomogeneous plasma by combining the kinetic-fluid model and quasilinear kinetic theory. The present paper considers diverging magnetic field along a one-dimensional flux tube, as well as the associated density models, with various source-region boundary conditions. With such an approach, the spatial locations at which the excitation, saturation, and damping of the proton-cyclotron and firehose instabilities occur, are investigated. From the present investigation, it is seen rigorously that the solar wind is bound by the temperature anisotropy threshold condition. The present approach can be further extended to include other instabilities, and can even help interprete satellite data, which is expected to become available from the near future Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter Missions.",

            "abstract": "Peatland organic matter is cellulose-like with an oxidation state of approximately zero. When this material decomposes by fermentation, stoichiometry dictates that CH4 and CO2 should be produced in a ratio approaching one. While this is generally the case in temperate zones, this production ratio is often departed from in boreal peatlands, where the ratio of belowground CH4/CO2 production varies between 0.1 and 1, indicating CO2 production by a mechanism in addition to fermentation. The in situ CO2/CH4 production ratio may be ascertained by analysis of the 13C isotopic composition of these products, because CO2 production unaccompanied by methane production produces CO2 with an isotopic composition similar to the parent organic matter while methanogenesis produces 13C depleted methane and 13C enriched CO2. The 13C enrichment in the subsurface CO2 pool is directly related to the amount of if formed from methane production and the isotopic composition of the methane itself. Excess CO2 production is associated with more acidic conditions, Sphagnum vegetation, high and low latitudes, methane production dominated by hydrogenotrophic methane production, 13C depleted methane, and generally, more nutrient depleted conditions. Three theories have been offered to explain these observations— 1) inhibition of acetate utilization, acetate build-up and diffusion to the surface and eventual aerobic oxidation, 2) the use of humic acids as electron acceptors, and the 3) utilization of organic oxygen to produce CO2. In support of #3, we find that 13C-NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FT IR) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) clearly show the evolution of polysaccharides and cellulose towards more decomposed humified alkyl compounds stripped of organic oxygen utilized to form CO2. Such decomposition results in more negative carbon oxidation states varying from -1 to -2. Coincident with this reduction in oxidation state, is the greater production of methane. Changing climatic conditions may alter the balance of the factors which affect the CO2/CH4 ratio by changing the water balance of the peatland, nutrient status, or temperature.",

            "abstract": "Urban streams are often characterized by diminished water quality resulting from an increase in polluted runoff from impervious surfaces. Storm activity further reduces urban stream water quality by temporarily increasing stormwater discharge from sewer overflows. This will often manifest itself in rapid declines of dissolved oxygen and peaks in specific conductivity in response to a rising biochemical oxygen demand which slowly recovers as the pollution load is washed through the stream system. This research developed a GIS-based model to track potential sources of pollution based on the dissolved oxygen and specific conductivity response of urban streams to a series of storm events, within the city of Louisville, Kentucky. Watershed outlet hydrographs were first obtained to determine the lag time of dissolved oxygen drops and specific conductivity peaks in response to set of storm events. Using a digital elevation model and the National Landcover Database, 10m resolution rasters were then created which calculated slope and flow direction/accumulation for both open channel and overland flow conditions across the watersheds. The rasters were merged and converted to flow velocities using a series of storms with different intensities. The final step utilized the Flow Length tool in ArcGIS which calculated the travel time to the watershed outlets from each pixel weighted by the open channel and overland flow conditions. Potential pollution sources could then be located by matching the dissolved oxygen and specific conductivity response lag times to the associated watershed travel times.",

            "abstract": "Several types of anorthosite can be recognized, some of which show distinct age restrictions in Earth and planetary history. Primordial, Archean and Proterozoic anorthosites are distinctly different and are restricted in time and space. Those of layered mafic intrusions and ophiolites show no apparent time restrictions. Primordial anorthosites form the bulk of the lunar crust, and have been provisionally detected on Mars; these probably formed in response to planetary accretion. No surviving crust of this nature has yet been found on Earth. Calcic (>An80) megacrystic anorthosites are restricted to the Archean, are associated with mafic volcanics of greenstone belts, and may have formed by accumulation of An-rich plagioclase from mafic to ultramafic magmas; high H2O content of parental melts may explain the calcic compositions, and the temporality might be linked to that of komatiitic magmatism, for which many tectonic settings, including subduction, have been proposed. Massif-type anorthosite is the most abundant of terrestrial types, and occurs as small plutons to huge composite batholiths that are entirely restricted to the Proterozoic. Compositions (An50 ± 10 vs. >An80), textures (lathy vs. equant plagioclase) and size (massifs to ~15,000 km2 vs. Archean bodies to ~560 km2) effectively distinguish Proterozoic from Archean anorthosites. An arc environment for massifs is suggested by the long, linear belts of coalescent anorthositic plutons, some of which have been emplaced into continental crust over extensive time periods (>100 m.y.). Magma derivation was from depleted mantle (not mafic lower crust), although there is evidence for substantial crustal contamination. Plagioclase-rich mushes formed by flotation in deep crustal chambers, and ascended diapirically to the mid-crust. Massif anorthosites have not yet been found in Phanerozoic continental arcs, although anorthositic layers are present as parts of layered gabbros in some deep crustal sections (e.g. Argentina). It is not clear if different subduction styles alone can explain the differences between Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic anorthosites. Their temporality might be caused by any combination of secular cooling of the Earth, secular variation in H2O content of arc magmas and insufficient depths of erosion of young arc terranes.",

            "abstract": "Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) undergo many reactions in the atmosphere and form a wide range of oxidised and water-soluble compounds. These compounds can partition into atmospheric water droplets, and react within the aqueous phase producing higher molecular weight and/or less volatile compounds which can remain in the particle phase after water evaporation and thus increase the organic aerosol mass (Ervens et al., 2011; Altieri et al., 2008; Couvidat et al., 2013). While this hypothesis is frequently discussed in the literature, so far, almost no direct observations of such a process have been provided.\nThe aim of the present work is to study SOA formation from isoprene photooxidation during cloud condensation-evaporation cycles.\nThe experiments were performed during the CUMULUS project (CloUd MULtiphase chemistry of organic compoUndS in the troposphere), in the CESAM simulation chamber located at LISA. CESAM is a 4.2 m3 stainless steel chamber equipped with realistic irradiation sources and temperature and relative humidity (RH) controls (Wang et al., 2011). In each experiment, isoprene was allowed to oxidize during several hours in the presence on nitrogen oxides under dry conditions. Gas phase compounds were analyzed on-line by a Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS), a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), NOx and O3 analyzers. SOA formation was monitored on-line with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and an Aerodyne High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). The experimental protocol was optimised to generate cloud events in the simulation chamber, which allowed us to generate clouds lasting for ca. 10 minutes in the presence of light.\nIn all experiments, we observed that during cloud formation, water-soluble gas-phase oxidation products (e.g., methylglyoxal, hydroxyacetone, acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and glycolaldehyde) readily partitioned into cloud droplets and new SOA mass was promptly produced which partly persisted after cloud evaporation. Chemical composition, elemental ratios and density of SOA, measured with the HR-ToF-AMS, were compared before, during cloud formation and after cloud evaporation.",

            "abstract": "During very active geomagnetic conditions, neutral thermospheric dynamics is dominated by magnetospheric momentum and energy input. Mid and high latitude horizontal winds can exceed many hundreds of meters per second, vertical winds many tens of meters per second, and the impulsive energy input can drive global wave surges of one to two hundred meters per second. The latitudinal change in global temperature and pressure from the energy input drives an altered circulation, neutral composition structure, and the disturbance dynamo, all of which have dramatic impact on the ionosphere. During more typical solar and geomagnetic activity conditions the balance between these solar and magnetospheric drivers, and forcing from the lower atmosphere, is not so clear. A whole spectrum of waves, including migrating and non-migrating tides and gravity waves, propagate from sources in the lower atmosphere, increase in amplitude, and drive winds throughout the thermosphere and at all latitudes. Some of these waves break in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere and mix the constituents. Some penetrate further into the thermosphere driving steep vertical gradients, and as they dissipate by molecular viscosity they deposit momentum. Much of the variability in electrodynamics is driven by the larger-scale tidal spectrum of waves driving neutral winds in the lower thermosphere dynamo region. The shorter period and smaller scale spectrum of gravity waves also drive neutral winds, and their impact is readily apparent in the ionosphere from incoherent scatter and dynasonde observations. The still sparse direct observations of neutral winds means that sometimes it is the impact on the ionosphere that must be used to indicate the presence of neutral atmospheric winds and waves.",

            "abstract": "Owing to the abundance of highly anisotropic minerals in the crust, the Voigt and Reuss bounds on the seismic velocities can be separated by more than 1 km/s. These bounds are determined by modal mineralogy and crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) of the constituent minerals, but where the true velocities lie between these bounds is determined by other fabric parameters such as the shapes, shape-preferred orientations, and spatial arrangements of grains. Thus, the calculation of accurate bulk stiffness relies on explicitly treating the grain-scale heterogeneity, and the same principle applies at larger scales, for example calculating accurate bulk stiffness for a crustal volume with varying proportions and distributions of folds or shear zones.\nWe have developed stand-alone GUI software – ESP Toolbox – for the calculation of 3D bulk elastic and seismic properties of heterogeneous and polycrystalline materials using image or EBSD data. The GUI includes a number of different homogenization techniques, including Voigt, Reuss, Hill, geometric mean, self-consistent and asymptotic expansion homogenization (AEH) methods. The AEH method, which uses a finite element mesh, is most accurate since it explicitly accounts for elastic interactions of constituent minerals/phases. The user need only specify the microstructure and material properties of the minerals/phases.\nWe use the Toolbox to explore changes in bulk elasticity and related seismic anisotropy caused by specific variables, including: (a) the quartz alpha-beta phase change in rocks with varying proportions of quartz, (b) changes in modal mineralogy and CPO fabric that occur during progressive deformation and metamorphism, and (c) shear zones of varying thickness, abundance and geometry in continental crust. The Toolbox allows rapid sensitivity analysis around these and other variables, and the resulting bulk stiffness matrices can be used to populate volumes for synthetic wave propagation experiments that allow direct visualization of how variables of interest might affect propagation at a variety of scales. Sensitivity analyses also illustrate the value of the more precise AEH method.\nThe ESP Toolbox can be downloaded here:\nhttp://umaine.edu/mecheng/faculty-and-staff/senthil-vel/software/",

            "abstract": "Shallow ice within Enceladus experiences oscillating tidal stresses and ambient stresses from lateral buoyancy contrasts between warm and cold ice. Ice does not distinguish between these remote sources of stress. Frictional failure occurs when the total stress on a crack surface exceeds its frictional strength. Failure on pervasive distributed cracks has the net effect of creep from internal friction. Strong tidal stresses drive net strain within the ice mass with the orientation to relieve modest buoyancy stresses and hence plate-like convection. Analogous processes occur when strong surface waves pass through the shallow subsurface. (1) The upmost 10s of meters moves down a shallow slope from ambient topographic stresses during shaking. The net effect, a sacking, is a slow deep landslide over many earthquakes. (2) The shallow ambient tectonic stress is relieved by distributed frictional slip during shaking. Deeper tectonic movements then restore the stress. Repeated events facilate long-term shallow tectonic deformation as on Enceladus. (3) The impinging surface waves impose strain boundary conditions on the shallow subsurface. Stiff rock fails in friction and cracks. The resulting damaged rock is more compliant than intact rock and experiences lower stresses during the net shaking. A seismic regolith where the shear modulus increases linearly with depth eventually self-organizes so the regolith layer barely reaches frictional failure during strong events. A tidal regolith of this type may exist on Enceladus. It barely fails down to its base at times of peak tidal stress. (4) Ice, like rock, becomes weak once frictional slip is underway. Large stress drops and even overshoot occur. Local residual stresses from one event become prestresses for the next event. Favorably oriented stress patches fail from tidal stresses that are below the nominal frictional criterion.",

This cloud information is needed to properly interpret the trace-gas slant columns and can be used for unique measurements between and inside clouds. We will review what has been learned about OMI cloud measurements facilitated by the unique opportunity of having near-simultaneous measurements from the CloudSat radar. We will then give an overview of how this knowledge is being applied using OMI cloud measurements alone as well as in conjunction with other A-train measurements such as those from MODIS and CERES. These applications include the detection of multi-layered clouds and estimation of top-of-atmosphere short-wave flux. This presentation will focus on the OMI rotational-Raman cloud product that utilizes the spectral structure produced by rotational Raman scattering of air molecules to estimate the photon pathlength of backscattered sunlight.",

            "abstract": "Chlorine radicals are a strong atmospheric oxidant, particularly in polar regions where levels of hydroxyl radicals can be quite low. In the atmosphere, chlorine radicals expedite the degradation of methane and tropospheric ozone and the oxidation of mercury to more toxic forms. Here, we present direct measurements of molecular chlorine levels in the Arctic marine boundary layer in Barrow, Alaska, collected in the spring of 2009 over a six-week period using chemical ionization mass spectrometry. We detected high levels of molecular chlorine of up to 400 pptv. Concentrations peaked in the early morning and late afternoon and fell to near-zero levels at night. Average daytime molecular chlorine levels were correlated with ozone concentrations, suggesting that sunlight and ozone are required for molecular chlorine formation. Using a time-dependent box model, we estimated that the chlorine radicals produced from the photolysis of molecular chlorine on average oxidized more methane than hydroxyl radicals and enhanced the abundance of short-lived peroxy radicals. Elevated hydroperoxyl radical levels, in turn, promoted the formation of hypobromous acid, which catalyzed mercury oxidation and the breakdown of tropospheric ozone. Therefore, we propose that molecular chlorine exerts a significant effect on the atmospheric chemistry in the Arctic. While the formation mechanisms of molecular chlorine are not yet understood, the main potential sources of chlorine include snowpack, sea salt, and sea ice. There is recent evidence of molecular halogen (Br2 and Cl2) formation in the Arctic snowpack. The coverage and composition of the snow may control halogen chemistry in the Arctic. Changes of sea ice and snow cover in the changing climate may affect air-snow-ice interaction and have a significant impact on the levels of radicals, ozone, mercury and methane in the Arctic troposphere.",

            "abstract": "The rate of soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization is known to be controlled by climatic factors as well as molecular structure, mineral-organic associations, and physical protection. What remains elusive is to what extent oxygen (O2) limitations impact overall rates of microbial SOM mineralization (oxidation) in soils. Even within upland soils that are aerobic in bulk, factors limiting O2 diffusion such as texture and soil moisture can result in an abundance of anaerobic microsites in the interior of soil aggregates. Variation in ensuing anaerobic respiration pathways can further impact SOM mineralization rates. Using a combination of (first) aggregate model systems and (second) manipulations of intact field samples, we show how limitations on diffusion and carbon bioavailability interact to impose anaerobic conditions and associated respiration constraints on SOM mineralization rates. In model aggregates, we examined how particle size (soil texture) and amount of dissolved organic carbon (bioavailable carbon) affect O2 availability and distribution. Monitoring electron acceptor profiles (O2, NO3-, Mn and Fe) and SOM transformations (dissolved, particulate, mineral-associated pools) across the resulting redox gradients, we then determined the distribution of operative microbial metabolisms and their cumulative impact on SOM mineralization rates. Our results show that anaerobic conditions decrease SOM mineralization rates overall, but those are partially offset by the concurrent increases in SOM bioavailability due to transformations of protective mineral phases. In intact soil aggregates collected from soils varying in texture and SOM content, we mapped the spatial distribution of anaerobic microsites. Optode imaging, microsensor profiling and 3D tomography revealed that soil texture regulates overall O2 availability in aggregate interiors, while particulate SOM in biopores appears to control the fine-scale distribution of anaerobic microsites. Collectively, our results suggest that texture and particulate organic matter content are useful predictors for the impact of O2 limitations on SOM mineralization rates.",

            "abstract": "Ground level ozone frequently exceeds the National Ambient Air Quality Standard in the Uintah Basin in northeastern Utah during the winter season. The basin is home to some of the most intensive oil and gas production in the region, activities that have been accelerated by new technologies in that industry. High ozone episodes are coincident with the presence of snow and “cold pool” conditions during which a stable shallow boundary layer persists for periods of up to 10 days. Local emissions of NOx and VOCs build up within this layer, but the sources of radicals that initiate the photochemistry have been unclear since low photolysis rates and water vapor make the traditional channel, ozone photolysis, quite inefficient. Intensive studies over the past 3 winter seasons have shown that unconventional radical sources; primarily carbonyls, and to a lesser extent nitryl chloride and nitrous acid, are responsible for radical production in this environment. The role of snow cover is to restrict vertical mixing, enhance photolysis rates through increased albedo, and reduce ozone deposition. The uptake and production of photo-labile species on the snow surface were observed, but appear to have only minor influences on the ozone photochemistry.",

            "abstract": "Secondary microseismic noise is generated by non-linear interactions between ocean waves at the ocean surface. The sources correspond to pressure fluctuations close to the ocean surface. They generate acoustic waves in the ocean, which are then converted into P, SV, and Rayleigh waves in the deeper Earth layers. Rayleigh waves are the most energetic noise signal but body wave amplitude can be extracted using beamforming analysis. We analyze several typhoons recorded by the Southern California Seismic Network and we show that the detected P-wave amplitudes are frequency dependent.\nIn order to understand the body wave generation mechanism, we model the P-wave amplitude. The sources are the power spectral density of the pressure derived from the ocean wave interaction model. They are distributed along the ocean surface and they are frequency dependent. We then compute the site effect of the ocean layer upon body waves generated by the noise sources. The site effect can be described as the constructive interference of multiply reflected P waves in the ocean that are then converted to P waves at the ocean–crust interface. It varies with frequency and ocean depth. Finally we compute the propagation from the source area to the network by taking into account seismic attenuation and geometrical spreading.\nWe show that the modeled P-wave amplitude reproduce well the frequency dependent variations of the measured P-wave. This frequency dependent effect is due to both the source and site effect. We define the effective source as the product of the power spectral density of the pressure close to the surface and the site effect. We show that its maximum is consistent with the source location obtained by back projecting the slowness derived from the beamforming analysis. Finally, we show that body wave analysis enable to efficiently constrain the amount of sources generated by ocean wave reflected at the coast.",

            "abstract": "Downstream fining, i.e. the tendency for a gradual decrease in grain size in the downstream direction, has been observed and studied in alluvial rivers and in laboratory flumes. Laboratory experiments and field observations show that the vertical sorting pattern over a small Gilbert delta front is characterized by an upward fining profile, with preferential deposition of coarse particles in the lowermost part of the deposit. The present work is an attempt to answer the following questions. Are there analogous sorting patterns in mixtures of sediment particles having the same grain size but differing density? To investigate this, we performed experiments at the Hydrosystems Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During the experiments a Gilbert delta formed and migrated downstream allowing for the study of transport and sorting processes on the surface and within the deposit. The experimental results show 1) preferential deposition of heavy particles in the upstream part of the deposit associated with a pattern of “downstream lightening”; and 2) a vertical sorting pattern over the delta front characterized by a pattern of “upward heavying” with preferential deposition of light particles in the lowermost part of the deposit. The observed downstream lightening is analogous of the downstream fining with preferential deposition of heavy (coarse) particles in the upstream part of the deposit. The observed upward heavying was unexpected because, considering the particle mass alone, the heavy (coarse) particles should have been preferentially deposited in the lowermost part of the deposit. Further, the application of classical fractional bedload transport relations suggests that in the case of mixtures of particles of uniform size and different densities equal mobility is not approached. We hypothesize that granular physics mechanisms traditionally associated with sheared granular flows may be responsible for the observed upward heavying and for the deviation from equal mobility.",

            "abstract": "In recent years 8 K-bentonite beds have been discovered in the Upper Ordovician of the Tungus basin on the Siberian Platform. All the beds were identified in the outcrops of the Baksian, Dolborian and Burian regional stages, which correspond roughly to the Upper Sandbian, Katian and probably lowermost Hirnantian Global Stages. The 4 lowermost beds from the Baksian and Dolborian Regional Stages were studied in detail. They are represented by thin beds (1-2 cm) of soapy light gray or yellowish plastic clays and usually easily identifiable in the outcrops. The beds were traced in the outcrops over a distance of more than 60 km along the Podkamennaya Tunguska River valley.\nAll K-bentonite beds have been found within the Upper Ordovician cool-water carbonate succession. The four lowermost K-bentonite beds, which were sampled, have been studied by powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy together with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The low percent of smectite in mixed-layer phases reflects a high degree of burial metamorphism since the time of their origin. The K-bentonites provide evidence of intensive explosive volcanism on or near the western margin of the Siberian craton in Late Ordovician time.\nThe K-bentonite beds from the Baksian and Dolborian regional stages (Katian) of the southwestern part of the Tungus basin in Siberia are thus derived from the alteration of volcanic ash falls. All four beds contain volcanogenic euhedral zircon and apatite phenocrysts. Zircon crystals from the uppermost K-bentonite bed within the Baksian regional stage provide a 206Pb/238U age of 450.58±0.27 Ma. The timing of volcanism is surprisingly close to the period of volcanic activity of the Taconic arc near the eastern margin of Laurentia. The Yenisei arc had its continuation along the western continental margin of Siberia and both of them constitute a single Taconic-Yenisei volcanic arc. Field studies of the Upper Ordovician succession along the Moyero River in the vicinity of the Anabar shield demonstrate an absence of K-bentonite beds along the eastern margin (in present day orientation) of the Siberian Platform. This contradicts popular palaeogeographic interpretations and points to the position of a subduction zone along the western but not the eastern margin of the Siberian palaeocontinent at this time.",

            "abstract": "When an eruption occurs in a large basaltic volcano as Piton de la Fournaise volcano (La Reunion, France), accelerations of surface displacements and seismicity rate are recorded before magma reaches the surface, with a hour to week time scale. These eruptions are understood as ruptures of pressurized magma reservoirs. When elastic models are used to account for surface deformation, such accelerations are modelled by an accelerating increase of the reservoir pressure. It is reached for magma flow or pressure conditions at the base of the magma feeding system that may be not realistic at this time scale. An alternative solution to explain such accelerations is the weakening of the volcanic edifice under the effect of magma pressure in the reservoir. In this study we have modelled such a weakening by the progressive damage of an initially elastic edifice. We used an incremental damage model, with seismicity as a damage variable with daily increments. Elastic moduli decrease linearly for each damage increment. When this damage model is used in an initially elastic edifice with a simple constant pressure condition at the base of the system (which leads to an equilibrium in a purely elastic model), surface displacement accelerations are well reproduced when damage is sufficient. We link the damage parameter to the crack density and show that process dynamics is controlled by the ratio between the incremental rupture surface and the surface to be ruptured, this later being directly dependent on reservoir depth. In that case the edifice strength decreases relative to the elastic strength, and magma reservoir pressure decreases with elastic moduli. This later characteristics may eventually cause gaz exsolution, which may generate non-linear instabilities during the eruptive process.",

            "abstract": "The up-and-down heave motion of a ship causes a similar motion on any instruments tethered on wireline cable below it. If the amplitude of this motion is greater than a few tens of cm, significant discrepancy in the depth below the ship is introduced, causing uncertainty in the acquired data. Large and irregular cabled motions also increase the risk of damaging tethered instruments, particularly those with relatively delicate sensors. In 2005, Schlumberger and Deep Down, Inc built an active wireline heave compensator (AHC) system for use onboard the JOIDES Resolution to compensate for heave motion on wireline logging tools deployed in scientific drill holes. The goals for the new AHC system were to (1) design a reliable heave compensation system; and (2) devise a robust and quantitative methodology for routine assessment of compensation efficiency (CE) during wireline operations. Software programs were developed to monitor CE and the dynamics of logging tools in real-time, including system performance under variable parameters such as water depth, sea state, cable length, logging speed and direction.\nWe present the CE results from the AHC system on the JOIDES Resolution during a 5-year period of recent IODP operations and compare the results to those from previous compensation systems deployed during ODP and IODP. Based on new data under heave conditions of ±0.2–2.0 m and water depths of 300–4,800 m in open holes, the system reduces 65-80% of downhole tool displacement under stationary conditions and 50-60% during normal logging operations. Moreover, down/up tool motion at low speeds (300–600 m/h) reduces the system’s CE values by 15–20%, and logging down at higher speeds (1,000–1,200 m/h) reduces CE values by 55–65%. Furthermore, the system yields slightly lower CE values of 40-50% without tension feedback of the downhole cable while logging. These results indicate that the new system’s compensation efficiency is comparable to or better than previous systems, with additional advantages that include upgradable compensation control software and the capability for continued assessment under varying environmental conditions. Future integration of downhole cable dynamics as an input feedback could further improve CE during logging operations.­",

            "abstract": "In a CO2 enriched atmosphere, vegetation-land-atmosphere interactions can change the intensity of extreme meteorological episodes like heatwaves, alter the timing of occurrence and modify the way they evolve. We propose to focus on the 2003 heatwave in Western Europe. How this extreme meteorological event would be different under CO2 atmospheric concentration expected for 2100?\nTo investigate this question, we couple an atmospheric model (WRF) to a surface model (ORCHIDEE). Both models use atmospheric CO2 concentration as an input parameter; both can have different CO2 concentrations without producing any conflict. Four simulations have been designed and run in order to quantify and understand the impact of the radiative forcing and the response of the vegetation to CO2 fertilization. Based on the actual recorded meteorology, a first simulation is performed with today’s CO2 concentration applied to both the atmospheric and surface models, defined as the control run (CTL). A second simulation is run with the 2100 CO2 concentration applied to the atmospheric model only (impacting radiation), the surface model being run with today’s conditions. This way we can evaluate the impact of the radiative forcing (RAD). In a third simulation, the surface model is run with the 2100 atmospheric CO2 concentration, while the today’s conditions are applied to the atmospheric model. This run enables us to quantify the response of the vegetation fertilization (and change in water use efficiency) in a CO2 enriched atmosphere (PHOT). A last simulation is achieved with 2100 conditions applied to both the atmospheric and surface models (FUT).\n We measure opposite effects on the surface temperature from the radiative forcing (warming effect) and from the vegetation response (cooling effect), even if in both cases the effect stays relatively small. Both effects partly compensate each other in future conditions simulation (see Figure 1). None of the investigated feedback overtakes the other one. Latent heat seems to play a key role.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and quantifying hydrothermal circulation is critical to testing models of the accretion of lower ocean crust and quantifying global geochemical cycles. However, our understanding is principally limited by a lack of direct observations from intact ocean crust. Key questions remain about the magnitude of hydrothermal fluid fluxes, the nature and distribution of fluid pathways and their global variability.\nODP Hole 1256D in the eastern equatorial Pacific samples a complete section of 15 Myr old upper ocean crust down to the dike/gabbro transition zone. A high spatial resolution Sr isotope profile is integrated with wireline studies, volcanostratigraphy, petrography and mineral geochemistry to document fluid pathways and develop a model for the evolving hydrothermal system during volcanic construction of the crust. Major off-axis fluid conduits in the volcanic sequence are restricted to the flow margins of two anomalously thick (>25 m) massive flows, indicating that massive flows act as a permeability barrier for fluid flow. Dike margins are pathways for both recharge and discharge hydrothermal fluids. Sub-horizontal channeling of high temperature fluids at the dike/gabbro boundary is a common attribute of most cartoons of mid ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. Hole 1256D provides the first in situ observations of the dike/gabbro transition zone and records lateral fluid transport along intrusive boundaries.\nThe time-integrated fluid flux in the sheeted dikes of Hole 1256D calculated using Sr isotope mass balance is ~1.8 x 106 kg/m2. This is similar to fluid fluxes from other studies (Hole 504B, Pito Deep, Hess Deep) despite large variations in the thickness and Sr isotope profiles of the sheeted dike complexes, suggesting that hydrothermal fluid fluxes are remarkably uniform and independent of the local structure of the crust. This fluid flux is not large enough to completely remove the heat flux from crystallizing and cooling the lower crust and requires deeper hydrothermal circulation in the lower crust.",

            "abstract": "The dominant component of atmospheric organic aerosol is that derived from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), so-called secondary organic aerosol (SOA). SOA consists of a multitude of organic compounds, only a small fraction of which has historically been identified. Formation and evolution of SOA is a complex process involving coupled chemical reaction and mass transport in the gas and particle phases. Current SOA models do not embody the full spectrum of reaction and transport processes nor do they identify the dominant rate-limiting steps in SOA formation. Based on molecular identification of SOA oxidation products, we show here that the chemical evolution of SOA from a variety of VOC precursors adheres to characteristic “molecular corridors” with a tight inverse correlation between volatility and molar mass. The slope of these corridors corresponds to the increase in molar mass required to decrease volatility by one order of magnitude (-dM/dlogC0). It varies in the range of 10-30 g mol-1 depending on the molecular size of the SOA precursor and the O:C ratio of the reaction products. Sequential and parallel reaction pathways of oxidation and dimerization or oligomerization progressing along these corridors pass through characteristic regimes of reaction-, diffusion-, or accommodation-limited multiphase chemical kinetics that can be classified according to reaction location, degree of saturation, and extent of heterogeneity of gas and particle phases. The molecular corridors and kinetic regimes help to constrain and described the properties of the products, pathways and rates of SOA evolution, thereby facilitating the further development of aerosol models for air quality and climate.",

            "abstract": "Significant debate exists regarding the processes of crustal formation and stabilization in the Archean, with some researchers advocating for continuous subduction-like processes throughout earth history, and others advocating crustal recycling by lithospheric delamination or ‘drip tectonics’. Much of the debate hinges on whether Archean mantle potential temperatures (Tp) were significantly hotter than the present day. The rock record of non-arc Archean primary magma compositions (Herzberg et al., 2010) has been used to infer higher ambient Tp (Tp = 1500-1650C) during the Archean, causing high melt fractions during decompression melting, and leading to extreme primary (oceanic) crustal thicknesses of 30-40 km (Herzberg and Rudnick, 2012). Such crustal thicknesses might inhibit subduction, in which case an alternative mechanism of crustal recycling would be required.\nIn their recent paper, Johnson et al. (2014) showed that at Tp > 1500C, the lower portions of a thick homogenous Archean primary crust generated would be density unstable with respect to the ambient mantle. Additionally, they showed that given realistic rheological constraints, large-scale lower crustal delamination is a very efficient crustal recycling mechanism at Tp >1600C. The Archean crust, however, is likely to be internally differentiated. Here we present pMELTS and Perple_X modeling results on the intracrustal differentiation of Archean primary crust, resulting in the formation of TTG-like granitoids in the upper crust and a lower crust dominated by clinopyroxenite. Using the composition and density profiles generated by intracrustal differentiation, our geodynamic modeling extends the Tp over which efficient crustal delamination will occur to lower values, consistent with those likely throughout the Archean. Efficient crustal differentiation and delamination of dense mafic residues throughout the Archean may explain the apparent paucity of mafic lithologies relative to TTGs that characterize the preserved Archean rock record.\n[1] Herzberg et al.

            "abstract": "This study investigates the moisture budgets and resolution dependency of precipitation extremes in an aquaplanet framework based on the Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4). Moisture budgets from simulations using two different dynamical cores, the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A) and High Order Method Modeling Environment (HOMME), but the same physics parameteri- zations suggest that during precipitation extremes the intensity of precipitation is approximately balanced by the vertical advective moisture transport. The resolution dependency in extremes from simulations at their native grid resolution originates from that of vertical moisture transport, which is mainly explained by changes in dynamics (related to vertical velocity v) with resolution. When assessed at the same grid scale by area- weighted averaging the fine-resolution simulations to the coarse grids, simulations with either dynamical core still demonstrate resolution dependency in extreme precipitation with no convergence over the tropics, but convergence occurs at a wide range of latitudes over the extratropics. The use of lower temporal frequency data (i.e., daily vs 6 hourly) reduces the resolution dependency. Although thermodynamic (moisture) changes become significant in offsetting the effect of dynamics when assessed at the same grid scale, especially over the extratropics, changes in dynamics with resolution are still large and explain most of the resolution dependency during extremes. This suggests that the effects of subgrid-scale variability of v and vertical moisture transport during extremes are not adequately parameterized by the model at coarse resolution. The aquaplanet framework and analysis described in this study provide an important metric for assessing sensitivities of cloud parameterizations to spatial resolution and dynamical cores under extreme conditions.",

            "abstract": "Large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulence and sediment suspension are conducted in both subaerial and submarine meandering channels. The Boussinesq approximation of buoyancy is applied to the spatially-filtered, Navier-Stokes equations through the simultaneous solution of the suspended sediment continuity equation with the Smith-McLean boundary condition. Production of turbulence and, consequently, turbulent kinetic energy is stronger at channel bends than in straight sections. This pattern is more pronounced in subaerial channels. Depth integrated, two-dimensional models of turbidity currents critically rely upon parameterization of the entrainment of water at the top of the flow and sediment exchange with the bed. Secondary flow and turbulence structure due to channel sinuosity significantly alter these parameterizations and the assumed vertical profiles of velocity and sediment concentration. Large turbulent structures episodically inject relatively clear water from the top to the base of the flow at the outside of channel bends, and, simultaneously, sediment laden fluid is ejected from the bed at the inside of channel bends. As a result, sediment deposition in sinuous channels is reduced compared to application of two-dimensional models. The LES turbidity current model is extended to channel morphodynamics by grid adjustment at each fluid and sedment time step. The LES morphodynamic model has been tested, thus far, in strongly depositional sinuous channel turbidity currents. Relatively uniform channel deposition and rapidly developing sharp-crested levees are built in these conditions. Further simulations involving partially erosional conditions and bedload transport will be presented.",

Very-long period (greater than 30s) ocean waves create pressure fields on the seafloor, and the displacement resulting from these fields depends on the density and elastic parameters of the oceanic crust; seafloor compliance is defined as the transfer function between the ground acceleration and the pressure. Compliance has been used as a geophysical prospecting tool for several decades, and still holds significant potential to explore shallow layers where other seismic data fail to provide the necessary resolution; in particular, seafloor compliance is a superior tool to investigate shear in ocean sediments.\nOur first data set comes from several deployments of the ADDOSS (Autonomously Deployed Deep-Ocean Seismic System) experiment in the San Diego Trough and the nearby deeper ocean. We analyze data from two different sites: one at 1000m depth (deployed for two weeks during the summer) and one at 4000m depth (deployed for 2.5 months during the winter). Our second data set is based on records from the 2005-2007 PLUME (Plume-Lithosphere Undersea Mantle Experiment) OBS deployment to investigate subsurface structure at nearly 70 stations between depths of 4500 and 5800 meters. The two PLUME deployments operated for one year each, with a station spacing of 75 and 200 kilometers respectively.\nWe perform extensive forward modeling to demonstrate the sensing capabilities and limitations of the method in our regions, and we provide results from our data analysis in the San Diego Trough and in the adjacent deep ocean, as well as around Hawaii. We pay particular attention to the implications of seasonal variability on compliance measurements.

            "abstract": "Nonlinear data assimilation for high-dimensional geophysical systems is a rapidly evolving field. Particle filters seem to be the most promising methods as they do not require long chains of model runs to start sampling the posterior probability density function (pdf). Up to very recently developments in particle filtering has been hampered by the ‘curse of dimensionality’, roughly meaning that the number of particles needed to avoid weight collapse growths exponentially with the dimension of the system. However it has been realised that for particle filtering it is not the dimension of the state vector but the number of independent observations that is the problem. Furthermore, proposal densities that ensure better positioning of the particles in state space before observations are encountered lead to much better performance.\nRecently particle filters have been proposed that do not suffer from weight collapse by construction. In this talk I will present several of these new filters, including the equivalent-weights particle filters, new combinations with the implicit particle filter, and filters using large-deviation theory. I will present basic ideas and applications to very high-dimensional systems, including a full climate model. Emphasis will be on the fruitful forward directions and on areas that still need attention, as we haven’t solved the problem yet.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers and seasonal snowpack in Washington State have undergone significant decline over the past 50 years. While warming global temperatures are widely recognized as the cause of glacial decline, the deposition of light absorbing impurities (LAI) can also contribute to increased melt. The primary sources of LAI are dust and black carbon (BC). These particles are subject to atmospheric transport and undergo both wet and dry deposition. When LAI are deposited, the albedo of the glacial surface is lowered resulting in increased energy absorption and melt. We analyzed a 158 m long ice core collected from the South Cascade Glacier in the North Cascades of Washington State to reconstruct 20th century LAI deposition. The ice core was analyzed for BC using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), and for dust using gravimetric filtration and ICP-MS. Pb210 analysis indicates that the bottom age of the ice core is 1916 +/- 18 AD, and tritium analysis is being conducted to further constrain the depth-age scale. Background and peak BC concentrations increased with depth over the top third of the core, indicating higher atmospheric BC loading at the time of deposition. Several segments of the ice core contained visible black impurity layers and analysis determined these outlying samples contained BC concentrations exceeding 100ng/g (maximum = 558 ng/g). These visible impurity layers are distributed throughout the entire length of the core and may originate from regional forest fire activity, a major natural source of BC. Dust concentrations were variable throughout the entire record, with elevated concentrations occurring between 48 – 60 m and 96 – 102 m. The BC and Fe ICPMS data are used to estimate the relative absorption of BC and dust. The chronology of LAI deposition throughout the 20th century will enable the modeling of historic albedo reductions on South Cascade Glacier, and aid in assessing the contribution of LAI to glacial melt.",

At year-to-year time scales, for instance, the annual growth rate of the Keeling curve have long been linked to variations of the natural climate-carbon system. But questions remain about what (ocean versus land), where (tropics versus mid-high latitudes) and how (e.g., temperature versus precipitation) different drivers affect the observed variability. At longer (multidecadal) timescales, on the other hand, the growths of atmospheric CO2 concentration have almost been constantly proportional (by the so-called “airborne fraction”) to the corresponding anthropogenic emissions. This study reviews the literature on these questions and presents a box model to describe carbon exchanges between the atmosphere and the surface reservoirs under the disturbances of anthropogenic emissions as well as global climate changes. The results show that the simple linear model can successfully simulate the observed changes/variations of the atmospheric CO2 concentration and its growth rate across interannual to multi-decadal time scales.",

            "abstract": "Microbial sulfate reducers (MSR) drive the Earth’s biogeochemical sulfur cycle. At the heart of this energy metabolism is a cascade of redox transformations coupling organic carbon and/or hydrogen oxidation to the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate to sulfide. The sulfide produced is depleted in the heavier isotopes of sulfur relative to sulfate. The magnitude of discrimination (fractionation) depends on: i) the cell-specific sulfate reduction rate (csSRR, Kaplan & Rittenberg (1964) Can. J. Microbio.; Chambers et al. (1975) Can. J. Microbio; Sim et al. (2011) GCA; Leavitt et al. (2013) PNAS), ii) the ambient sulfate concentration (Harrison & Thode (1958) Research; Habicht et al. (2002) Science; Bradley et al. in review), iii) both sulfate and electron donor availability, or iv) an intrinsic physiological limitation (e.g. cellular division rate). When neither sulfate nor electron donor limits csSRR a more complex function relates the magnitude of isotope fractionation to cell physiology and environmental conditions.\nIn recent and on-going work we have examined the importance of enzyme-specific fractionation factors, as well as the influence of electron donor or electron acceptor availability under carefully controlled culture conditions (e.g. Leavitt et al. (2013) PNAS). In light of recent advances in MSR genetics and biochemistry we utilize well-characterized mutant strains, along with a continuous-culture methodology (Leavitt et al. (2013) PNAS) to further probe the fractionation capacity of this metabolism under controlled physiological conditions. We present our latest findings on the magnitude of S and D/H isotope fractionation in both wild type and mutant strains. We will discuss these in light of recent theoretical advances (Wing & Halevy (2014) PNAS), examining the mode and relevance of MSR isotope fractionation in the laboratory to modern and ancient environmental settings, particularly anoxic marine sediments.",

            "abstract": "Nearly the entire state of California experienced exceptionally dry conditions during 2013 and early 2014. Statewide 12-month accumulated precipitation was less than 34% of average over this period, leading to a wide range of adverse impacts upon both human and natural systems. The California drought occurred in tandem with a persistent region of positive geopotential height (GPH) anomalies associated with high-amplitude ridging over the northeastern Pacific Ocean (i.e. the so-called “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”), which displaced the jet stream well to the north of its climatological mean position and prevented winter storms from reaching California during the canonical wet season. Remarkably, the extreme dipolar flow pattern induced by this recurrent anticyclone over the northeastern Pacific occurred during two consecutive winter seasons, which helped to accelerate the onset of severe drought conditions in California.\nWe find that the extreme GPH values during 2013 were observationally unprecedented over a vast region covering most of the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent land areas, and that California experienced both its driest calendar year and driest consecutive 12-month period in at least 119 years. We also assess the role of climate change in affecting the likelihood of occurrence of the large-scale conditions linked to the California drought, and find that global warming has very likely increased the likelihood of extreme GPH events in this region. Together, the complexity and severity of the observed drought impacts, coupled with our finding that global warming has increased the probability of large-scale conditions similar to those associated with the 2013/14 drought, suggest that understanding the link between climate change and persistent North Pacific ridging events will be crucial in characterizing the future risk of severe drought in California.",

There are several plausible controls on ∆13C2H6in natural gas: thermodynamically controlled homogeneous isotope exchange reactions analogous to those behind carbonate clumped isotope thermometry; inheritance from larger biomolecules that undergo thermal degradation to produce natural gas; mixing of natural gases that differ markedly in bulk isotopic composition; diffusive fractionation; or combinations of these and/or other, less expected fractionations. There is little basis for predicting which of these will control isotopic variations among natural ethanes, but we think it likely that addition of this new isotopic proxy will reveal new insights into the natural chemistry of ethane.\nWe have developed a method to measure the abundance of 13C2H6 in natural samples, using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We define ∆13C2H6 as 1000 . ((13C2H6/12C2H6)measured/(13C2H6/12C2H6)stochastic -1). We studied several suites of natural gas samples and experimentally produced or modified ethane. Natural ethanes, including closely related samples from a single natural gas field, exhibit surprisingly large ranges in ∆13C2H6 (4 ‰ overall; up to 3 ‰ in one gas field). Such ranges cannot be explained by thermodynamic equilibrium at a range of different temperatures, or by diffusive fractionation. Kinetic isotope effects associated with ‘cracking’ reactions, and/or inheritance of non-equilibrium carbon isotope structures from source organics are more likely causes. We observe a correlation between ∆13C2H6 and the concentration of alkanes other than methane in several suites of natural gases, suggesting the causes of clumped isotope variations are tied to the controls on gas wetness. An experiment examining ethane residual to high-temperature pyrolysis confirms this trend could be an isotopic fingerprint for ethane destruction.",

            "abstract": "Diverse metabolic activities have been documented in the deep biosphere. However, how these activities affect carbon cycling in the subsurface, and how they in turn affect the marine and global cycles of carbon are still unclear. Here we present natural-abundance 14C and 13C data from the uppermost 4.5 m of the sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin, California Borderland, showing active turnover of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within, and immediately below, the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ; ~1.25 m). DOC concentrations increased with depth throughout the core, indicating net production within the sediment column. Enhanced DOC production was observed near the sediment-water interface, and also at ~30 cm below the SMTZ (~1.55 m). ∆14C values of DOC increased across the sediment-water interface, then decreased with depth, consistent with net production of modern DOC near the sediment-water interface, and input of 14C-depleted DOC from deeper horizons. An isotope mixing plot constructed with these data shows that the DOC diffusing upward at the base of the core is devoid of 14C, yet the DOC diffusing into and out of the SMTZ is relatively enriched (-460‰ and -300‰, respectively). This difference in 14C content of the DOC flux can only be reconciled if the following two are occurring within, and immediately below, the SMTZ: (1) >90% of the 14C-dead basal DOC flux is removed from the pore water (by, e.g., oxidation, fermentation, methanogenesis, precipitation), and (2) this DOC is replaced by material produced in this region at a rate that exceeds the upward basal flux. The 14C and 13C signatures suggest sedimentary organic matter to be the dominant source of DOC in process (2). Our data provide a unique insight into the active transformation of DOC and sedimentary organic matter in the subsurface.",

They span the range from very tenuous, surface-bounded exospheres (e.g., Rhea, Dione) to quite robust exospheres with exobase above the surface (e.g., Io, Triton), and include many intermediate cases (e.g., Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus). The exospheres of these moons exhibit an interesting variety of sources, from surface sputtering, to frost sublimation, to active plumes, and also well illustrate another common characteristic of the outer planet satellite exospheres, namely, that the primary species often exists both as a gas in atmosphere, and a condensate (frost or ice) on the surface. As described by Yelle et al. (1995) for Triton, “The interchange of matter between gas and solid phases on these bodies has profound effects on the physical state of the surface and the structure of the atmosphere.” A brief overview of the exospheres of the outer planet satellites will be presented, including an inter-comparison of these satellites exospheres with each other, and with the exospheres of the Moon and Mercury.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic carbon emissions from cities and their power plants represent the single largest human contribution to climate change. Many cities with large fossil-fuel CO2 and CH4 fluxes are undergoing rapid change due to development, urbanization, energy sector transformations and/or climate mitigation actions. Meanwhile, flux estimation uncertainties at these finer spatial scales remain significantly larger than those at the continental and national scales addressed by traditional carbon estimation techniques. Improved quantification and understanding of underlying processes at the urban scale will not only provide policy-relevant information and improve the understanding of urban dynamics and future scenarios, but will translate into better global-scale anthropogenic flux estimates, and advance our understanding of carbon cycle and climate feedbacks across multiple scales. An observing system including a tiered set of surface, airborne, and satellite sensors combined with process-based flux quantification from the bottom-up, can be focused spatially and sectorally to address these challenges. A thoughtfully crafted research program that is grounded in sustained, dense observations relevant to estimating urban carbon fluxes and their controlling processes and is focused on a statistically significant sample of cities will advance our understanding of the carbon cycle. We describe the Megacities Carbon Project as an example for developing and validating the integrated application of atmospheric observations from localized surface networks, aircraft campaigns, and satellites with an analytical construct for linking atmospheric information with the human activities that drive emissions.",

            "abstract": "We measured crustal thickness and mapped Moho transition zone (MTZ) character over an 880 km2 section of the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) using the first full 3D multichannel seismic (MCS) dataset collected across a mid-ocean ridge (MOR). The 9°42’-9°57’N area was initially investigated using 3D poststack time migration, which was followed by application of 3D prestack time migration (PSTM) to the whole dataset. This first attempt at applying 3D PSTM to MCS data from a MOR environment resulted in the most detailed reflection images of a spreading center to date. MTZ reflections are for the first time imaged below the ridge axis away from axial discontinuities indicating that Moho is formed at zero age at least at some sections of the MOR system. The average crustal thickness and crustal velocity derived from PSTM are 5920±320 m and 6320±290 m/s, respectively. The average crustal thickness varies little from Pacific to Cocos plate suggesting mostly uniform crustal production in the last ~180 Ka. However, the crust thins by ~400 m from south to north. The MTZ reflections were imaged within ~92% of the study area, with ~66% of the total characterized by impulsive reflections interpreted to originate from a thin MTZ and 26% characterized by diffusive reflections interpreted to originate from a thick MTZ. The MTZ is dominantly diffusive at the southern (9°37.5’-9°40’N) and northern (9°51’-9°57’N) ends of the study area, and it is impulsive in the central region (9°42’-9°51’N). No data were collected between 9°40’N and 9°42’N. More efficient mantle melt extraction is inferred within the central region with greater proportion of the lower crust accreted from the axial magma lens than within the northern and southern sections. This along-axis variation in the crustal accretion style may be caused by interaction between the melt sources for the ridge and the local seamounts, which are present within the northern and southern survey sections. Third-order, but not fourth-order ridge discontinuities are associated with changes in the Moho reflection character and/or near-axis crustal thickness. This suggests that the third-order segmentation is governed by melt distribution processes within the uppermost mantle while the fourth-order ridge segmentation arises from mid- to upper-crustal processes.",

            "abstract": "The ability to reproduce scientific results is a cornerstone of the scientific method, and access to the data upon which the results are based is essential to reproducibility. Access to the data alone is not enough though, and research communities have recognized the importance of metadata (data documentation) to enable discovery and data access, and facilitate interpretation and accurate reuse. The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) was first funded in late 2006 by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) Biology and Chemistry Sections to help ensure that data generated during NSF OCE funded research would be preserved and available for future use. The BCO-DMO was formed by combining the formerly independent data management offices of two marine research programs: the United States Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (US JGOFS) and the US GLOBal Ocean ECosystems Dynamics (US GLOBEC) program.\nSince the US JGOFS and US GLOBEC programs were both active (1990s) there have been significant changes in all aspects of the research data life cycle, and the staff at BCO-DMO has modified the way in which we manage data contributed to the office. The supporting documentation that describes each dataset was originally displayed as a human-readable text file retrievable via a Web browser. BCO-DMO still offers that form because our primary audience is marine researchers using Web browser clients; however we are seeing an increased demand to support machine client access. Metadata records from the BCO-DMO data system are now extracted and published out in a variety of formats. The system supports ISO 19115, FGDC, GCMD DIF, schema.org Dataset extension, formal publication with a DOI, and RDF with semantic markup including PROV-O, FOAF and more.\nIn the 1990s, data documentation helped researchers locate data of interest and understand the provenance sufficiently to determine fitness for purpose. Today, providing data documentation in a machine interpretable form enables researchers to make more effective use of machine clients to discover and access data. This presentation will describe the challenges associated with and benefits realized from layering modern Semantic Web technologies on top of a legacy data system.\nhttp://bco-dmo.org/",

            "abstract": "The geosciences have had a chronic problem of underrepresentation of students from diverse ethnic, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds. While many programs and efforts focus on the recruitment of minorities, a strategic approach to increase retention is equally important for a student’s success. Students from diverse backgrounds often face isolation in majority schools, and lack role models and guidance as they navigate through the academic system. Research has shown that continuous and individualized support can greatly strengthen a student’s performance and chance of staying in the field. Successful strategies include a strong mentoring system, early involvement in research, cohort building, and creating a welcoming campus climate. At the SOARS Center for Undergraduate Research, we have found that offering students research topics that allow them to give back to society increases engagement and retention significantly. All interventions need to be applied early, often and on a continuous basis in a student’s college experience. A long-term mentor assigned to the student beyond a class or a summer research experience can provide follow-up and champion the student’s progress. This presentation will share successful approaches of retaining diverse students in the geosciences and discuss how we can support each other in the community to provide such resources.",

            "abstract": "The systematic behavior of earthquake rupture as a function of earthquake magnitude and/or tectonic setting is key in our understanding of the physical mechanisms involved during earthquake rupture. Following the dip of an idealized subducting plate, we observe a great diversity of earthquake rupture behavior, slow tsunamigenic near the trench, high frequency radiation in the seismogenic zone, tectonic tremor and finally intermediate-depth and deep focus earthquakes. Although all these events have a common source mechanism, predominantly they all represent shear slip along a fault, both static and dynamic source parameters may vary as a function of depth. We will show here a thorough analysis of global and regional records of intermediate-depth and deep earthquakes to try and better understand the mechanisms that may help explain the differences between these deep earthquakes and shallow seismicity in a subduction setting. We present results for earthquake location, source duration/corner frequencies, stress drops and radiated energies for earthquakes at the global scale, intermediate-depth earthquakes in Alaska and South America, and an intraplate earthquake in North America. Some differences between different subduction zones are evident, although there is no clear correlation with plate age. Some of the differences can be explained by local control of the geometry of the slab. Several contrasting behavior is also observed between intermediate-depth earthquakes in Alaska and Southamerica, and also when comparing non-subduction related earthquakes. We discuss how some of the proposed mechanism for deep earthquakes, agree or not with the observed source parameters.",

Thus, the description, characterization, and prediction of fractured systems requires careful conceptualization and a defensible modeling approach that is tailored to the objectives of a specific application. We review some of these approaches and the related data needs, and discuss the use of multi-physics joint inversion techniques to identify and characterize the relevant features of the fracture system. In particular, we demonstrate the potential use of a non-isothermal, multiphase flow simulator coupled to a thermo-poro-elastic model for the calculation of observable deformations during injection-production operations. This model is integrated into a joint inversion framework for the estimation of geometrical, hydrogeological, rockmechanical, thermal, and statistical parameters representing the fractured porous medium.",

            "abstract": "The last four decades have seen a remarkable decline in the spatial extent of the Arctic sea ice cover, presenting both challenges and opportunities to Arctic residents, government agencies and industry. After the record low extent in September 2007 effort has increased to improve seasonal, decadal-scale and longer-term predictions of the sea ice cover. Coupled global climate models (GCMs) consistently project that if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, the eventual outcome will be a complete loss of the multiyear ice cover. However, confidence in these projections depends o HoHoweon the models ability to reproduce features of the present-day climate. Comparison between models participating in the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and observations of sea ice extent and thickness show that (1) historical trends from 85% of the model ensemble members remain smaller than observed, and (2) spatial patterns of sea ice thickness are poorly represented in most models. Part of the explanation lies with a failure of models to represent details of the mean atmospheric circulation pattern that governs the transport and spatial distribution of sea ice. These results raise concerns regarding the ability of CMIP5 models to realistically represent the processes driving the decline of Arctic sea ice and to project the timing of when a seasonally ice-free Arctic may be realized.\nOn shorter time-scales, seasonal sea ice prediction has been challenged to predict the sea ice extent from Arctic conditions a few months to a year in advance. Efforts such as the Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) project, originally organized through the Study of Environmental Change (SEARCH) and now managed by the Sea Ice Prediction Network project (SIPN) synthesize predictions of the September sea ice extent based on a variety of approaches, including heuristic, statistical and dynamical modeling. Analysis of SIO contributions reveals that when the September sea ice extent is near the long-term trend, contributions tend to be accurate. Years when the observed extent departs from the trend have proven harder to predict. Predictability skill does not appear to be more accurate for dynamical models over statistical ones, nor is there a measurable improvement in skill as the summer progresses.",

            "abstract": "In California’s Central Valley, due to competing demands for limited water resources, it is critical to monitor evaporative water loss and crop conditions at both individual field scales and over larger areas in support of water management decisions. This is particularly important for viticulture because grape vines must be maintained under highly controlled conditions in order to maximize production of quality fruit. Thus, regular high resolution temporal monitoring of hundreds of acres is required, a task only efficiently achieved with satellite remote sensing, combining multiple earth observations. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring evapotranspiration (ET) and crop water stress applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season.\nThe system employs a data fusion methodology (STARFM: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model) combined with multi-scale ET modeling (ALEXI: Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse Model) to compute daily 30 m resolution ET. ALEXI ET fluxes (4 km resolution, daily) are integrated with ET fluxes from Landsat 8 thermal data (30 m resolution, ~16 day) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily). The high spatial resolution Landsat retrievals are then fused with high temporal frequency MODIS data using STARFM to produce daily estimates of crop water use that resolve within field variation in ET for individual vineyards.\nEstimates of daily ET generated in two fields of Pinot Noir vines of different maturity agreed well with ground-based flux measurements collected within each field with relative errors of about 15%. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET correspond to yield estimates and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require additional management strategies due to variation in soil type/texture, nutrient conditions and other environmental factors.",

            "abstract": "Infrared gas analyzers (IRGAs) are a key component in the\neddy-covariance measurement of water vapor and carbon dioxide exchange\nbetween the surface and atmosphere. Historically, closed-path IRGAs\nhave been used for the fast (> 10 Hz) measurement of atmospheric H2O\nand CO2. In order to use them in the field, these IRGAs were typically\nhoused in temperature-controlled enclosures or buildings that were\ntens of meters away from the measurement location. This necessitated\nthe use of long tubing and pumps to bring the air sample to the IRGA\ncell. Attenuation of H2O and CO2 fluctuations within the tubing was a\npersistent problem with such a setup, especially for H2O. As an\nalternative, open-path IRGAs have frequently been utilized, but the\nkey trade-offs with the open-path design are: (i) precipitation and\ndew-related data gaps, and (ii) the need to account for WPL density\neffects. Over the past five years a new type of closed-path IRGA has\nemerged which is weather-proof, compact, and low-maintenance. Because\nof its small size, short intake tubing can be used, which places the\nsampling cell close to the sonic anemometer and reduces high frequency\nsignal loss. Two such IRGAs are the LI-COR LI-7200 and the Campbell\nScientific EC155, which is part of the CPEC200 eddy covariance system.\nThe Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux tower has used a LI-COR LI-6262 IRGA to\nmeasure CO2 fluxes above a subalpine forest since November, 1998.\nStarting in summer 2013, a LI-7200 (along with an open-path LI-7500)\nwere deployed at 21.5 m on the AmeriFlux tower. In Fall 2013, a\nEC155/CPEC200 was added so that a side-by-side comparison between all\nfour IRGAs was possible. The preliminary results presented in our\nstudy compare the CO2 and H2O mean and variance measured by each IRGA,\nthe vertical wind statistics from three side-by-side sonic\nanemometers, as well as the corresponding spectra and cospectra from\nthese sensors as well as other important aspects of system\nperformance.",

Here, we infer deep ocean warming in the context of global sea level rise and Earth’s energy budget between January 2005 and December 2013 based on satellite altimetry, GRACE and Argo floats. Direct measurements of ocean warming above 2000m depth explain 0.9 +/- 0.15 mm/yr of the observed 2.78 +/- 0.32 mm/yr rate of global mean sea level rise. Over the entire water column, independent estimates of ocean warming yield a contribution of 0.77+/-0.28 mm/yr in sea level rise and agree with the upper ocean estimate to within the estimated uncertainties. Accounting for additional possible systematic uncertainties, the deep ocean (below 2000m) contributes -0.13 +/- 0.72 mm/yr to global sea level rise and -0.08 +/- 0.43 W/m2 to Earth’s energy balance. The net warming of the ocean implies an energy imbalance for the Earth of 0.64 ± 0.44 W/m2 from 2005 to 2013.",

            "abstract": "Separating the contributions from different current systems from point magnetic field measurements and interpreting them is very difficult, and caution must be used when deciphering near-Earth currents from either data or modeling results. At the same time, there are other continuously measured quantities, which can provide, though indirectly, information about the dynamics of the magnetospheric current systems. The SYM-H and ASY-H indices, computed from the observations of magnetic field at low latitude ground-based stations, contain contributions from major magnetospheric current systems, such as the symmetric and asymmetric ring current, tail current, magnetopause currents and field-aligned currents. Highly distorted magnetospheric magnetic field during storm times due to disturbances in the current systems is reflected in the SYM-H and ASY-H observed variations.\nUsing empirical magnetospheric models we study the relative contribution from different current systems to the SYM and ASY mid-latitude indices. It was found that the models can reproduce ground based mid-latitude indices rather well. The good agreement between the indices computed using magnetospheric models and real ones indicates that purely ionospheric current systems, on average, give modest contribution to these indices. The superposed epoch analysis of the indices computed using the models shows that the cross-tail current gives dominant contribution to SYM-H index during the main phase though this contribution can not be separated from FAC region 2 and partial ring current contributions since these systems are overlapped. The relative contribution from symmetric ring current to SYM-H starts to increase a bit prior or just after SYM-H minimum and attains its maximum during recovery phase. The ASY-H and ASY-D indices are controlled by interplay between three current systems which close via the ionosphere. The region 1 FAC gives the largest contribution to ASY-H and ASY-D indices during the main phase, though, region 2 FAC and partial ring current contributions are also prominent. The partial ring current is the main contributor to the ASY indices during the recovery phase. In addition, we discuss the application of these results to resolving the long-debated inconsistencies of the substorm-controlled geomagnetic storm scenario.",

These lakes typically form on the tongue of stagnant debris-covered glaciers with gentle slopes where there is significant amount of differential melting due to the spatial variation of debris thickness. Once the lake develops, the water acts as a heat sink thereby increasing the rate of mass loss as the lake expands rapidly due to calving retreat. Imja Lake is an excellent example of a glacial lake that developed in the 1950’s and has been undergoing rapid expansion due to calving retreat for many decades.

            "abstract": "The disintegration of several ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula since 1995 initiated a rapid increase in ice flow, altering the regional mass balance. A key element of disintegration appears to be the formation of surface melt ponds, which can trigger a run-away hydrofracturing process. A shelf’s firn layer must be saturated with ice for ponds to form at the surface. This study presents a comparison of wintertime satellite-derived active microwave backscatter and surface melt-day data, revealing a distinctive pattern that can be used to assess the state of ice shelf firn. Low melt areas (1 to 10 days of melting per year) have few refrozen meltwater lenses within the firn to serve as scatterers, so they have low backscatter values (-10 to -5 dB σo). As the mean number of melt days and therefore the abundance of ice lenses in the firn increases, backscatter values rise significantly to a peak at approximately 30 to 50 days of melt and approximately -1 dB σo. With increasing melt beyond this threshold, mean wintertime backscatter declines, reaching -5 dB σo at 80 to 100 melt days/year. This drop in backscatter reflects an increase in specular reflections from an ice-saturated firn layer. All ice shelves that have previously collapsed plot above this threshold. This pattern mirrors the characteristics of snow facies as observed in these same data types for transects across the Greenland Ice Sheet. Backscatter values on Antarctic ice shelves are also sensitive to accumulation rate, with higher accumulation requiring more melt days to produce the same level of backscatter increase. We hypothesize that, as the atmosphere warms in the future, ice shelves will evolve upwards along this pattern until they reach the firn saturation threshold where collapse is imminent. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of Antarctic ice shelves using scatterometry indicates which shelves are presently most vulnerable to surface-melt-induced collapse, and which shelves are likely to be vulnerable in the relatively near future.",

Stream stage, groundwater heads and temperatures were continuously monitored in streambed piezometers and stream bank wells for two transects across Leary Weber Ditch. Periodic manual measurements of stage, head and temperature were also made upstream and downstream of these transects. The data were used to develop two-dimensional (2D), cross-sectional (transverse) models of streambed water, heat, and nitrate transport perpendicular to the stream and a 2D longitudinal model along the axis of the stream. Model-estimated SW-GW exchange was influenced by physical heterogeneity in the streambed, stream channel topography, and local GW heads. Transverse modeling indicated that SW-GW exchange was generally greater near the banks and decreased toward the center of the channel. However, streambed heterogeneity modified this pattern with smaller flux at locations where fine silt was observed in cores, and greater and more temporally variable flux where the fine silt was absent. Transverse SW-GW exchange occurred mostly through lateral GW flow in shallow sediments, with different GW heads on the stream banks leading to transverse flow underneath the streambed at depth. The longitudinal modeling indicated that stream channel topography and streambed heterogeneity resulted in hyporheic flow paths within the streambed. Nitrate bearing stream water entered the streambed as a result of hyporheic flow, rapid stream stage rise during high flow events, and lowered GW levels leading to losing conditions. Field measurements of streambed nitrate concentration and simulation results suggest rapid denitrification in the anaerobic streambed, such that streambed nitrate removal was primarily determined by spatial and seasonal SW-GW exchange patterns.",

            "abstract": "Since the establishment of the IAEA-WMO precipitation-monitoring network in 1961, it has been observed that isotope ratios in precipitation (δ2H and δ18O) generally decrease from coastal to inland locations, an observation described as the continental effect. While discussed frequently in the literature, there have been few attempts to quantify the variables controlling this effect despite the fact that isotopic gradients over continents vary by orders of magnitude. In a number of studies, traditional Rayleigh fractionation has proven inadequate in describing the global variability of isotopic gradients due to its simplified treatment of moisture transport and its lack of moisture recycling through evapotranspiration (ET). We use a one-dimensional idealized model of water vapor transport along a storm track to investigate the dominant variables controlling isotopic gradients in precipitation across terrestrial environments. We find that the sensitivity of these gradients to progressive rainout is controlled primarily by ET with secondary controls exerted by eddy transport. A comparison of modern isotopic gradients within high elevation continental interior regions shows that the effects of seasonal changes in ET are of the same order of magnitude as the effects of rainout due to orographic precipitation. This implies that changing climate and associated changes in ET rates may amplify or completely negate isotopic signals of uplift. We further apply the model to a spatial compilation of Cenozoic isotopic records throughout Central Asia. Over the past 50 Ma, extensive recycling of water via ET has likely masked isotopic signals of the uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau, Tian Shan, Altai, and Hangay ranges as revealed by complimentary methods of measuring uplift timing and rates. Our results highlight the importance of the coupling between topography, atmospheric circulation, and biological processes in controlling isotopic records of past climate.",

            "abstract": "While mature faults like the San Andreas operate at extremely low stress levels, most other faults host earthquakes at ratios of shear to effective normal stress around 0.6. Dynamic weakening of fault strength, from thermal pressurization and other processes, can explain the low stresses on mature faults. But if dynamic weakening is as ubiquitous as suggested by high-velocity friction experiments, then one might expect low-stress operation of all faults. We present a possible reconciliation of these ideas, based on dynamic rupture simulations of ruptures on rough faults with dynamic weakening and off-fault plasticity. Fault geometric complexity introduces an additional resistance to slip, or roughness drag, that acts in addition to frictional resistance. Roughness drag is negligible only for the smoothest faults, which then operate at low stresses like the San Andreas. On other faults, stress levels are ultimately determined by the strength of the off-fault material. We also explore related issues regarding heat production and the earthquake energy balance. Strain energy release is converted to radiated energy and dissipated by both frictional sliding and off-fault plasticity. The latter shifts some fraction of the heat production from the fault to the surrounding medium, reducing local temperature rise on the fault. We examine implications of this for both fault melting and long-term heat flow measurements.",

The ExoCube mission is designed to acquire global knowledge of in-situ densities of [H], [He], [O] and [H+], [He+], [O+] in the upper ionosphere and lower exosphere in combination with incoherent scatter radar ground stations distributed in the north polar region. The Heliophysic Division of GSFC has developed a compact Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) for in situ measurements of ions and neutrals H, He, N, O, N2, O2 with M/dM of approximately 10 at an incoming energy range of 0-50eV. The INMS is based on front end optics, post acceleration, gated time of flight, ESA and CEM or MCP detectors. The compact sensor has a dual symmetric configuration with the ion and neutral sensor heads on opposite sides and with full electronics in the middle. The neutral front end optics includes thermionic emission ionization and ion blocking grids, and the ion front end optics includes spacecraft potential compensation grids. The electronics include front end, fast gating, HVPS, ionizer, TOF binning and full bi directional C&DH digital electronics. The data package includes 400 mass bins each for ions and neutrals and key housekeeping data for instrument health and calibration. The data sampling can be commanded as fast as 10 msec per frame (corresponding to ~80 m spatial separation) in burst mode, and has significant onboard storage capability and data compression scheme. Experimental data from instrument testing with both ions and neutrals will be presented. The instrument is successfully integrated in the CubeSat and passed vibration, thermal and shock testing. The ExoCube mission is scheduled to fly in Nov 2014 in a 445 x 670 km polar orbit with the INMS aperture oriented in the ram direction. This miniaturized instrument (1.5U), weighing only 560 g and requiring nominal power of 1.6W, will provide the first in situ measurement of exospheric hydrogen and will measure in situ atomic oxygen for the first time in decades.",

            "abstract": "Martian atmospheric loss processes change the isotopic composition of H, C, O, N, and Ar. Escape process to space enrich heavier isotopes in the atmosphere over geological time. The SAM instrument on the Curiosity rover has measured these isotopes in H2O, CO2, N2, and Ar multiple times over the course of the mission. In addition to this present record, volatiles extracted from ancient rocks such as the clays sampled in Yellowknife Bay mudstones of Gale crater may be able to reveal the isotopic composition of light elements much earlier in martian history.\nSmall samples of mudstone rocks acquired by the Curiosity drill were analyzed by SAM for their volatile content. The SAM Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) measured the D/H ratio in water and the Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (QMS) determined the D/H ratio in hydrogen released from these samples by stepwise heating.\nClay materials on Earth are known to contain water in several forms. Molecular water bound loosely in pore spaces may be removed by drying under ambient conditions. Water also may be adsorbed on the surface of clay mineral surfaces or reside in interlayer positions or within structural channels in the clays. Finally, clay minerals contain hydroxyl units bound structurally in the minerals that at elevated temperatures (>~ 450°C) produce water and hydrogen of dehydroxylation; this high-temperature component is most likely to reflect the isotopic composition of water (and atmosphere) present at the time of clay formation.\nWe have designed and implemented a stepped extraction protocol to more precisely measure the D/H ratio in both the low and high temperature water in martian clays. The D/H in the high temperature water reflects the D/H of the water that formed these clay minerals. We will discuss the implications for water loss over the past 3+Ga and compare our findings with those of related martian meteorite studies.\nThis research was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

            "abstract": "Following the discovery of episodic tremor and slip, one of the key questions raised is whether the phenomena can be a harbinger of megathrust earthquakes. Several recent large subduction earthquakes have provided an opportunity to investigate this question. The March 20, 2012 Mw 7.4 Ometepec earthquake in southern Mexico represents one such opportunity as it occurred in an area with a joint seismic and geodetic network in the source region that can examine whether patterns in the episodic tremor and slip were related to the earthquake. GPS data indicate that a 5-month-long slow slip episode (SSE) migrated toward and reached the vicinity of the mainshock source zone a few weeks before the earthquake. With multi-station waveform matching of templates constructed from visible aftershock signals, we find an increase in seismic activity during the SSE. The fault patches represented by these templates fill in the gap between the earthquake epicenter and the primary SSE. Analysis of other seismic swarms in Oaxaca near the down-dip end of the seismogenic zone with multi-station template matching also shows an increase in seismicity during SSEs. This evidence adds to a growing number of published accounts that indicate slow slip, whether geodetically or seismically inferred, is becoming a more commonly observed pre-earthquake signature. We use RSQSim earthquake simulations to model these scenarios using a subduction interface with a shallow seismogenic zone, deep SSE zone, and a microseismicity zone in between. Simulations where the microseismicity zone is assigned varying effective normal stresses and slip speeds over small distances generate cases in which microseismicity primarily occurs when a SSE migrates up-dip to the point enough stress is transferred to nucleate an earthquake on elements with a higher effective normal stress. Together these observations support the notion that SSE can trigger traditional earthquakes, not just tremor and low-frequency earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Big Data world in the Earth Sciences so far exists primarily for disciplines that generate massive volumes of observational or computed data using large-scale, shared instrumentation such as global sensor networks, satellites, or high-performance computing facilities. These data are typically managed and curated by well-supported community data facilities that also provide the tools for exploring the data through visualization or statistical analysis. In many other domains, especially those where data are primarily acquired by individual investigators or small teams (known as ‘Long-tail data’), data are poorly shared and integrated, lacking a community-based data infrastructure that ensures persistent access, quality control, standardization, and integration of data, as well as appropriate tools to fully explore and mine the data within the context of broader Earth Science datasets.\nIEDA (Integrated Earth Data Applications, www.iedadata.org) is a data facility funded by the US NSF to develop and operate data services that support data stewardship throughout the full life cycle of observational data in the solid earth sciences, with a focus on the data management needs of individual researchers. IEDA builds on a strong foundation of mature disciplinary data systems for marine geology and geophysics, geochemistry, and geochronology. These systems have dramatically advanced data resources in those long-tail Earth science domains. IEDA has strengthened these resources by establishing a consolidated, enterprise-grade infrastructure that is shared by the domain-specific data systems, and implementing joint data curation and data publication services that follow community standards. In recent years, other domain-specific data efforts have partnered with IEDA to take advantage of this infrastructure and improve data services to their respective communities with formal data publication, long-term preservation of data holdings, and better sustainability. IEDA hopes to foster such partnerships with streamlined data services, including user-friendly, single-point interfaces for data submission, discovery, and access across the partner systems to support interdisciplinary science.",

            "abstract": "IODP Exp. 345 Holes U1415 I & J cored a ~30m thick unit of conspicuously layered gabbroic rocks from the lower plutonic crust at Hess Deep. These rocks likely come from >1500m below the dike gabbro transition and thus provide an unique opportunity to study the origin of layering and the formation of relatively deep, fast spread plutonic crust formed at the EPR. Here we report the initial results of a comprehensive high-resolution petrologic, geochemical and petrographic study of this unit, which focuses on a fairly continuous 1.5m long section recovered at Hole I. The rocks consist of opx-bearing olivine gabbro, olivine gabbro and gabbro and exhibit 1-10cm scale modal layering. Some layers host spectacular 2-3 cm diameter cpx oikocrysts encapsulating partially resorbed plagioclase laths. Downhole variations in mineral chemistry are complicated. Olivine, cpx and opx Mg#’s partly reflect equilibration and show a subtle metre-scale variation (1-2 Mg#), whereas, for example, plagioclase anorthite, and cpx TiO2 contents reveal a more complicated 10-20 cm-scale variation (2-4 An, and 0.2 TiO2). Mineral zonation, for all but Mg# in equilibrated olivine, is of higher magnitude than downhole variations in average mineral compositions. Trace element geochemistry reveals rather homogeneous plagioclase and opx compositions; however cpx exhibits variation at the mineral scale. Cpx shows an increased range of, and highest REE concentrations, in the more olivine rich, near cotectic, composition gabbros, whereas the more plagioclase rich, cumulates show no variation of, and low REE, concentrations.Plagioclase fabrics are moderate to weak and partially modally controlled, but the strength of the plagioclase crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) varies dramatically, within the 1.5m core showing a significant part of the variation recorded by Oman ophiolite plutonic crust. Plagioclase shape preferred orientation and CPO match well suggesting that diffusion enabled compaction was not significant. Overall, our combined observations and the similarity of composition and textures to those found in the Rum layered mafic intrusion (Scotland); an intrusion built by multiple ~100m thick replenishments of magma, suggests that the studied layered sequence is best interpreted as having formed in a lower crustal sill.",

There are many methods that people suggest using to develop models of environmental systems with long-range consequences, yet rarely are these methods tested for their predictive skill in practical problems. Of interest is how to determine if there are model development methods that tend to produce such long-term predictions with greater skill than other model development methods. Here three tests of groundwater flow and transport are discussed and compared. One test uses spatially defined cross-validation to inspect predictive capability, while two tests use paired complex and simple models. Results are analyzed in the context of how increasing model complexity affects predictive skill for the problems considered.",

            "abstract": "Levels and chemical composition of secondary organic aerosols affect their climate effects and properties. Organosulfates (OS) are formed through heterogeneous reactions involving oxidized sulfur compounds, primarily originating from anthropogenic sources. Availability of authentic standards have until now been an obstacle to quantitative investigations of OS in atmospheric aerosols. We have developed a new, facile method for synthesis and purification of OS standards. Here we have used 7 standards to quantify OS and nitrooxy organosulfates (NOS) observed in aerosols collected at four sites in coniferous forests in USA and Europe during spring or summer. The two American sites were Storm Peak Laboratory, Colorado (Rocky Mountains, elevation 3220 m a.s.l) and Sierra Nevada Mountains, California (as part of BEARPEX 2007 and 2009). The European sites were Hyytiälä Forest Station, Finland (in the boreal zone) and Silkeborg, Denmark (temperate forest). Aerosol filter samples were extracted and analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatograph coupled through an electrospray inlet to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HPLC-QTOF-MS). We identified 11 carboxylic acids using authentic standards, while 16 different OS and 8 NOS were identified based on their molecular mass and MS fragmentation patterns, as well as comparison with available standards. OS were ubiquitous in the atmospheric aerosol samples, even at the high elevation mountain station. Levels of carboxylic acids from oxidation of monoterpenes were 8-25 ng m-3 at Silkeborg and Storm Peak Laboratory, while concentrations at the sites with strong regional monoterpene emissions (Sierra Nevada Mountains and Hyytiälä) were much higher (10-200 ng m-3). At all sites, the dominant group of OS were derived from isoprene (IEPOX) and related compounds, while OS of monoterpenes showed lower concentrations, except at Hyytiälä during periods of north-westerly winds when monoterpene OS were at similar or higher levels than isoprene-derived OS. This indicates that isoprene OS were long-range transported to Hyytiälä from southerly regions with high emissions of isoprene and related compounds. Influence of formation mechanisms and long-range transport on concentrations of OS, NOS and carboxylic acids will be discussed in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Explicit chemical mechanisms aim to embody the current knowledge of the transformations occurring in the atmosphere during the oxidation of organic matter. These explicit mechanisms are therefore useful tools to explore the fate of organic matter during its tropospheric oxidation and examine how these chemical processes shape the composition and properties of the gaseous and the condensed phases. Furthermore, explicit mechanisms provide powerful benchmarks to design and assess simplified parameterizations to be included 3D model. Nevertheless, the explicit mechanism describing the oxidation of hydrocarbons with backbones larger than few carbon atoms involves millions of secondary organic compounds, far exceeding the size of chemical mechanisms that can be written manually. Data processing tools can however be designed to overcome these difficulties and automatically generate consistent and comprehensive chemical mechanisms on a systematic basis. The Generator for Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A) has been developed for the automatic writing of explicit chemical schemes of organic species and their partitioning between the gas and condensed phases. GECKO-A can be viewed as an expert system that mimics the steps by which chemists might develop chemical schemes. GECKO-A generates chemical schemes according to a prescribed protocol assigning reaction pathways and kinetics data on the basis of experimental data and structure-activity relationships. In its current version, GECKO-A can generate the full atmospheric oxidation scheme for most linear, branched and cyclic precursors, including alkanes and alkenes up to C25. Assessments of the GECKO-A modeling tool based on chamber SOA observations will be presented. GECKO-A was recently used to design a parameterization for SOA formation based on a Volatility Basis Set (VBS) approach. First results will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative relationships between global climate indices and hurricane activity in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans have not been widely studied. A few studies have explored qualitative relationships between hurricane activity and such climate indices as the North Atlantic Oscillation and sea-surface temperatures, among others. The current work presents the most comprehensive analysis of the potential relationships between 39 different climate indices and hurricane activity using regression and frequency analysis. Attempts are made to develop statistical relationships between any one of these indices and hurricane activity in the eastern and western Pacific as well as the Atlantic Oceans. There were three climate indices, one per region, showing significantly higher correlation in each region. They were the ENSO Precipitation Index (EPI) in the western Pacific, the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) in the eastern Pacific, and the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) in the Atlantic. The linear relationships between each index and hurricane numbers resulted in Pearson-R values of near 0.65 or greater. In addition, the Madden-Julian Oscillation showed some correlation with hurricane activity in each region and therefore was included in the analysis. Several important results were found during these analyses. For instance, the relationship between the AMM index and hurricane numbers in the Atlantic Ocean revealed that the average July – October AMM index was greater than -0.5 within a range of -5.0 to 5.0 for years within the last 70 years when the number of hurricanes during that same period was greater than 7. It is also shown that the number of hurricanes expected to be exceeded or not exceeded at frequencies of 50- to 100-years, for example, varies substantially depending on the range of AMM index values being analyzed. Similar results are shown for the eastern and western Pacific Ocean as well. Such relationships provide forecasters with a simple tool using only one variable that provides a rough estimate of hurricane activity for the upcoming hurricane season.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning (BB) is one of the major sources of optically and chemically potent carbonaceous aerosols, gaseous aerosol precursors, and volatile organic compounds. It is, therefore, important to represent these emissions as accurately as possible in the global and regional models.\nTo correctly simulate BB emissions from a fire, the model needs two key inputs: emission source strength for the fire and the emission injection height. Based on pilot studies of injection height by M. Val Martin et al. (2010, 2012), and of source strength by M. Petrenko et al. (2012), we proposed an AeroCom-coordinated multi-model BB experiment. The core objectives of the experiment are:\nTo inter-compare and quantify the accuracy and diversity of the AeroCom model simulated BB AOD using a common emissions inventory.\nTo propose a region-by-region emission correction scheme based on the comparisons of model output with satellite snapshots of smoke-plume optical depth from the MODIS and MISR instruments. This will allow us to bring the widely used GFED v3 emissions inventory to the levels needed to improve model-observation comparisons.\nTo test smoke injection height–emission intensity relationships used in global models against MISR multi-angle smoke-plume-height retrievals.\nWith the first stage of the BB experiment focused on the source strength, this talk will provide an update on development and testing the method of using satellite-measured aerosol optical depth snapshots to constrain BB aerosol emissions in the global models. The global datasets of fire-and-smoke events, observed by MISR and MODIS during 2006, 2007 and 2008, to be used for model-satellite comparisons, will also be described. These events were selected according to a number of criteria to be suitable for model-observation comparison at the scales of global model resolution.\nIn addition, we will showcase preliminary results of model inter-comparisons within the BB experiment, outline plans for future output analysis, and summarize the expected results of this experiment.",

            "abstract": "A sentinel discovery by the first in situ measurements on Mars was the high sulfur and chlorine content of global-wide soils. A variety of circumstantial evidence led to the conclusion that soil S is in the form of sulfate, and the Cl is probably chloride. An early hypothesis states that these volatiles are emitted as gases from magmas, and quickly react with dust, soil, and exposed rocks. Subsequent determination that SNC meteorites are also samples of the martian crust revealed a significantly higher S content, as sulfide, than terrestrial igneous rocks but substantially less than in soils. The ensuing wet chemical analyses by the high-latitude Phoenix mission discovered not only chloride but also perchlorate and possibly chlorate. MSL data now also implicate perchlorate at low latitudes. Gaseous interactions may have produced amorphous material on grain surfaces without forming stoichiometric salts. Yet, when exposed to liquid water, Phoenix samples released electrolytes, indicating that the soils have not been leached by rain or fresh groundwater. Sulfate occurrences at many locations on Mars, as well as some chloride enrichments, have now been discovered by remote sensing, Landed missions have discovered Cl-enrichments and ferric, Mg, Ca and more complex sulfates as duricrust, subsurface soil horizons, sandstone evaporites, and rock coatings – most of which cannot be detected from orbit. Salt-forming volatiles affect habitability wherever they are in physical contact: physicochemical parameters (ionic strength, freezing point, water activity); S is an essential element for terrestrial organisms; perchlorate is an oxidant which can degrade some organics but also can be utilized as an energy source; the entire valence range of S-compounds has been exploited by diverse microbiota on Earth. Whether such salt-induced conditions are “extremes” of habitability depends on the relative abundance of liquid H2O.",

            "abstract": "Electrical conductivities of metallic fluid H and ionic fluids H2O and Synthetic Uranus (SU) have been measured experimentally under dynamic quasi-isentropic compression up to 180 GPa and several 1000 K. SU is a mixture of H2O, NH3 and C3H8O with composition representative of “Ice”. Pressures P and temperatures T of the conductivity experiments were similar to P and T in interiors of Uranus and Neptune (U/N). Fluid H semiconducts at ~90 GPa and becomes a degenerate fluid metal with conductivity 2000/(ohm-cm) at 140 GPa, 0.64 g/cm3 and T/TF~0.01, where TF is Fermi temperature, conditions near the envelope/core boundaries of U/N. Metallization density is within a few% of the insulator-metal transition predicted by Wigner and Huntington in 1935. SU and water have conductivities of ~100/(ohm-cm) at 150 GPa. Podolak et al have shown a mixture of 75% Rock-25% Gas (by mass) behaves similarly to “pure” Ice in region that encompasses most mass of Uranus. The bandgap of water is predicted to close at 300 GPa and ~7000 K by Cavazonni et al. Models of pressure, temperature and density in U/N based on Voyager II gravity data have been developed by Helled et al. Stanley and Bloxham (SB) have developed MHD models that calculate non-dipolar and non-axisymmetric magnetic fields similar to those of U/N. The MHD models of SB assume that materials at planetary radii below the thin-shell dynamos that make the magnetic fields are stably stratified. The purpose of this paper is to develop a common picture for the deep interiors of U/N based on Voyager II gravity and magnetic data, measured electrical conductivities of planetary fluids, theoretical computations of interior conditions and the likely source of unusual magnetic fields, and extrapolation of existing experimental data for materials at 180 GPa to greater planetary depths. Main conclusions are the magnetic fields of U/N are probably made primarily by fluid metallic H at radii out to ~0.8 or more of U/N outer radii. Most of the cores of U/N might well be a mix of metallic H and Rock. At the centers of U/N pressures and temperatures are ~700 GPa and ~7000 K at which materials are metallic - either solids, as the solid-Fe inner-core of Earth, or fluids with viscosities so large that convection is effectively quenched. Thus, it is reasonable to assume the deep interiors of U/N are stably stratified.",

            "abstract": "Located at the center of the western North Pacific subtropical gyre, the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) along 18-28N is not only abundant in mesoscale eddies, but also exhibits prominent submesoscale eddy features. Output from a 1/30-deg high-resolution OGCM simulation and a gridded satellite altimetry product are analyzed in this study to contrast the seasonal STCC variability in the mesoscale vs. submesoscale ranges. Resolving the eddy scales of > O(150 km), the altimetry product reveals that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity have a seasonal maximum in May and April, respectively, a weak positive vorticity skewness without seasonal dependence, and an inverse (forward) kinetic energy cascade for wavelengths larger (shorter) than ~ 250 km. In contrast, the submesoscale-resolving OGCM simulation detects that the STCC eddy kinetic energy and rms vorticity both appear in March, a large positive vorticity skewness with strong seasonality, and an intense inverse kinetic energy cascade whose shortwave cutoff migrates seasonally bewteen the 35 and 100\\,km wavelengths. With the aid of a 2.5-layer reduced gravity model with an embedded surface density\ngradient, we show that these differences are due to the seasonal evolution of two concurring baroclinic instabilities. Extracting its energy from the surface density gradient, the frontal instability in the 2.5-layer model has a growth timescale of O(7 days), a dominant wavelength of O(50 km), and is responsible for the surface-intensified submesoscale eddy signals. The interior baroclinic instability, on the other hand, extracts energy from the vertically-sheared STCC system. It has a slow growth timescale of O(40 days), a dominant wavelength of O(250 km) and, together with the kinetic energy cascaded upscale from the submesoscales, determines the mesoscale eddy modulations.",

            "abstract": "Scientific research on spatially-resolved, bottom-up quantification of urban greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at urban scales has advanced considerably in the last decade. It has been primarily focused on contributing prior information to top-down approaches aimed at GHG emissions validation via atmospheric monitoring of GHG mixing ratios. However, bottom-up quantification has a number of other contributions to both scientific and policy topics. In order to do so, however, it must expand beyond current capabilities. Among these are the need to quantify both consumption- and production-based data products, utilization of remote-sensing, prognostic capabilities, expansion outside of the US, and uncertainty quantification. Such advances will allow it to make significant contributions to scientific research on urban science and energy analysis. In the arena of climate change policy, spatially-resolved, bottom-up quantification efforts can baseline and guide urban emissions mitigation, educate and engage the public, and offer a much more consistent and comprehensive means to compare cities across national and international domains. It can also find inconsistencies in existing reported regulatory data such as recent bottom-up research on examining US power plant CO2 emissions. I will review the current bottom-up GHG emissions quantification and review the opportunities and challenges associated with satisfying both climate change science and policy needs.",

The Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna river networks carve the low lying deltaic plains of the southern part of the country. Much of the tidal mangrove forest ecosystem of the lower delta was converted to poldered islands that sustain a Bangladesh population of 150 million though shrimp farming and rice production. These polder inhabitants lack potable water resources due to pathogen laden surface water and saline groundwater. This study examines polder groundwater-surface water interactions of fresh and saline water sources. Preliminary sampling of the polder groundwater suggests unpredictable apportioning of freshwater in the brackish aquifer. Using a broadband electromagnetic induction technique, we examine the conductivity profile of the shallow subsurface stratigraphy to identify potential rainwater recharge sites. Transects of nested piezometers, equipped with conductivity, temperature, and depth sensors, help determine the extent of tidal channel-aquifer interactions. Lithology from cores indicates that a highly variable clay cap likely regulates recharge. A better understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions will aid in the search for potable groundwater.",

            "abstract": "Passive samplers have been used for atmospheric gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) concentration and dry deposition measurements over the last decade; however, there are still uncertainties associated with these methods. This study investigated GOM ambient air concentrations (box sampler) and dry deposition (surrogate surface) at 10 sites in California and Nevada. Measured and modeled (multiple-resistance model) GOM dry deposition were compared. Higher GOM concentrations and dry deposition were observed at high elevation sites (>2000 m) relative to those at low elevation sites (<2000 m) (n= 5-27 depending on the site), except for one that was located in a topographic bowl. High dry deposition was associated with high wind speed, turbulence, and input from the free troposphere at high elevation sites. Dry deposition of GOM at two high elevation sites was calculated using the passive sampler data and a multiple-resistance model. A previously developed relationship between the sampling rate of the passive sampler and GOM concentrations was used to estimate dry deposition and a scaling factor of 3 was used to adjust derived concentrations due to the underestimation by KCl-coated denuder measurements. The GOM dry deposition velocity at these two sites was ~2.2 cm/s without canopy resistance; however, the velocities were ~0.4 and 0.90 cm/s as α=β=2 and α=β=10, respectively. The GOM dry deposition fluxes measured by surrogate surface at two sites ranged from 2.3 to 2.9 ng m-2/ hr-1. With the scaling factor of 3, modeled deposition was similar to measured; however, dry deposition did not correlate consistently with either model (α=β=2 and α=β=10). This implies that different GOM compounds were present. Based on trajectory (72-h) probability analyses and10-day back-trajectory analyses high GOM dry deposition at these sites were attributed to Asian air mixed with regional/local urban emissions.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic environment has been undergoing profound changes; the most visible is the dramatic decrease in Arctic sea ice extent (SIE). These changes pose a challenge to our ability to measure surface temperature across the Polar Regions. Traditionally, the International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) and International Programme for Antarctic Buoys (IPAB) have measured surface air temperature (SAT) at 2-m height, which minimizes the ambiguity of measurements near of the surface. Specifically, is the temperature sensor measuring open water, snow, sea ice, or air? But now, with the dramatic decrease in Arctic SIE, increase in open water during summer, and the frailty of the younger sea ice pack, the IABP has had to deploy and develop new instruments to measure temperature. These instruments include Surface Velocity Program (SVP) buoys, which are commonly deployed on the world’s ice-free oceans and typically measure sea surface temperature (SST), and the new robust Airborne eXpendable Ice Beacons (AXIB), which measure both SST and SAT. “Best Practice” requires that these instruments are inter-compared, and early results showing differences in collocated temperature measurements of over 2°C prompted the establishment of the IABP Arctic Observing Experiment (AOX) buoy test site at the US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site in Barrow, Alaska. Preliminary results showed that the color of the hull of SVP buoys introduces a bias due to solar heating of the buoy. Since then, we have recommended that buoys should be painted white to reduce biases in temperature measurements due to different colors of the buoys deployed in different regions of the Arctic or the Antarctic. Measurements of SAT are more robust, but some of the temperature shields are susceptible to frosting. During our presentation we will provide an intercomparison of the temperature measurements at the AOX test site (i.e. high quality DOE/ARM observations compared with unattended buoy measurements, and satellite retrievals). We will also show how these data may be used to improve our record of temperature over polar environments.",

However, there is a growing need to provide the provenance of these datasets as scientists increasingly need more transparency of the data products to improve their understanding and trust of the science results. Lessons learned from Climategate show that there is public demand for more transparency and understanding in the science process. Science data systems are key to enabling the capture, management, and use of production provenance information. Science analysis now also may involve merging multi-sensor datasets where lineage can facilitate the understanding of the data. But there does not exist a formal recommendation for an interoperable standard for provenance representation for use in NASA's Earth Science Data Systems.\nThe W3C Provenance Working Group has a specification for the representation of provenance information. The standard is very general and intended to support the breadth of any domain. To better serve the needs of specific domain communities, the standard has several built in points of extensibility. We will present efforts by NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems Working Group (ESDSWG) on Provenance to develop an Earth Science extension to the PROV specification (PROV-ES) and how it can be used in science data system to capture, consume, and interpret provenance information.",

            "abstract": "The reactive uptake of isoprene-derived epoxydiols (IEPOX) is thought to be a significant source of atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, the IEPOX reaction probability (γIEPOX) and its dependence upon particle composition remain poorly constrained. We report measurements of γIEPOX for trans-b-IEPOX, the predominant IEPOX isomer, on submicron particles as a function of composition, acidity, and relative humidity (RH). Particle acidity had the strongest effect. γIEPOX is more than 500 times larger on ammonium bisulfate (γ ~ 0.05) than on ammonium sulfate (γ ≤ 1 x 10-4). We could accurately predict γIEPOX using an acid-catalyzed, epoxide ring-opening mechanism and a high Henry’s law coefficient (1.6 x 108 M/atm). Suppression of γIEPOX was observed in particles containing both ammonium bisulfate and polyethylene glycol (PEG-300), likely due to diffusion and solubility limitations within a PEG-300 coating, suggesting that IEPOX uptake could be self-limiting. Using the measured uptake kinetics, the predicted atmospheric lifetime of IEPOX is a few hours in the presence of highly acidic particles (pH < 0), but is greater than a day on less acidic particles (pH > 3). We connect these net reactive uptake measurements to chamber studies of the SOA yield from IEPOX multiphase chemistry and discuss the implications of these findings for modeling the anthropogenic influence upon SOA formation from isoprene.",

            "abstract": "Mt. Pagan is a small (570 m ASL), active basaltic cone filling a caldera that sits atop one of the largest (2160 km3) volcanoes in the Mariana Arc Front. A VEI 4 eruption in 1981 that forced the evacuation of the island was the most recent serious activity, although low-level activity persists with a robust degassing plume and occasional small ash explosions. A new monitoring network was installed in 2013, consisting of 7 intermediate band seismometers, 2 6-component infrasound arrays, and 2 web cameras. Additionally, 12 campaign broadband seismometers recorded for 10 months in 2013-2014. Crater-rim multi-GAS sampling and remote sensing of the volcanic plume indicate a shallowly degassing magmatic system producing ~600 tonnes/day of sulfur dioxide (SO2). The seismic activity to date is dominated by frequent long-period (LP) events (~1000 events/day) with energy peaked from 0.6-2 Hz. These events are accompanied by a 3 s very-long-period (VLP) signal in the infrasound. Continuous beamforming of waveforms from the infrasound arrays shows that degassing from the summit vent is an impressive source of nearly continuous, low frequency sound. The network has also recorded infrequent, extended (minutes duration), emergent seismo-acoustic signals associated with minor ash emissions. These small explosions are accompanied by VLP seismic signals with a period of 70 s and duration of ~200 s.\nIn order to understand how the shallow conduit system produces nearly continuous degassing as well as discrete explosions, we performed full waveform inversions of the LP and VLP seismicity with a combination of campaign and permanent stations. The best-fit location for a 6 moment plus 3 force source mechanism lies at ~500 m beneath and at the western margin of the summit vent. The source time function is dominated by the diagonal components of the moment tensor with a minor contribution from the vertical single force. We suggest that these signals are caused by fluid transport through the magmatic system and subsequent response of the magma column and chamber to the fluid flux. The best-fit source location for the LP seismicity is beneath the vent, several hundred meters above the VLP source. The mechanism is dilatational and forward modeling indicates a geometry that most likely represents a subvertical dike.",

            "abstract": "Ground-based measurements of changes in tree diameter and subsequent calculation of carbon storage provide validation of indirect estimates of forest productivity from remote sensing platforms, and measurements made with high temporal resolution provide critical information about the responsiveness of tree growth to variations in important physical drivers (e.g. temperature and water availability). We have developed an environmentally robust instrument for automated measurement of expansion and contraction in tree diameter that can be deployed in remote locations (TreeHuggers; TH). TH uses a membrane potentiometer to measure changes in circumference with resolution ≤ 6 mm at user-selected intervals (≥ 1 min). Simultaneous measurement of temperature is used to correct for the thermal properties of the stainless steel band. Data are stored on micro SD cards and transmitted tree-to-tree to a base station. Preliminary measurement of beech trees shows the precise initiation of growth and the emergence of diel changes in stem diameter associated with sap flow. Because of their low cost and on-board data logging and communication packages, TH will greatly increase the capacity of the scientific community and private sectors to monitor tree growth and carbon storage. Possible applications include deploying TH in the footprint of eddy covariance sites to help interpret drivers affecting net ecosystem exchange and evapotranspiration. A large scale implementation of TH will contribute to our ability to forecast changes in the carbon sink strength of forests across environmental gradients and biotic disturbances, and they could prove useful in assessing changes in forest stocks as part of evaluating carbon offsets purchased by commercial entities.",

            "abstract": "Developing confident, capable geoscientists from a diverse array of backgrounds requires, among many variables, the development of confident, capable mentors to help guide and support students along the path to professional positions. The geosciences are lagging behind other STEM fields in increasing the diversity of participants, and shifting the perspectives of those both inside and outside of the field requires intentional attention to ensuring undergraduate success. UNAVCO, Inc. is well-situated to both prepare undergraduate students for placement in geoscience technical positions and advanced graduate study and to provide mentoring resources for faculty engaged in supporting undergraduates from diverse backgrounds. UNAVCO is a university-governed consortium facilitating research and education in the geosciences. For the past 10 years, UNAVCO has managed Research Experiences in the Solid Earth Sciences for Students (RESESS), an NSF-funded multiyear geoscience research internship, community support, and professional development program. The primary goal of the RESESS program is to increase the number of historically underrepresented students entering the geosciences, whether continuing academic studies or moving into the workforce.\nBeginning in 2014, UNAVCO will add a second internship program to its portfolio. Leading Undergraduates in Challenges to Power Academic Development in the Geosciences (LAUNCHPAD) is aimed at involving two-year college students and lower-division undergraduates in projects that prepare them for independent research opportunities at UNAVCO and with other REU programs. LAUNCHPAD will assist early-academic career students in understanding and developing the skills necessary to transition to undergraduate research programs or to prepare for positions in the geoscience technical workforce. In order to ensure a continued student support structure, UNAVCO will host and run a two-day institute, the Faculty Institute for RESESS Mentoring Excellence (FIRME), for faculty mentors to develop their mentoring acumen, with particular focus on mentoring and supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds. This presentation will focus on the ongoing work at UNAVCO to meet the needs of students and faculty dedicated to preparing the future geoscience workforce.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface thermal erosion is triggered by convective heat transfers between flowing water and permafrost. For inland ice-wedge polygon terrains, heat advection due to infiltration of run-off in the massive ice wedges and the ice-rich upper portion of permafrost creates sink holes and networks of interconnected tunnels in the permafrost. Mass movements such as collapse of tunnel’s roof, retrogressive thaw-slumping along exposed permafrost and active layer detachment slides lead to the development of extensive gully networks in the landscape. These gullies drastically change the hydrology of ice-wedge polygon terrains and the fluxes of heat, water, sediment and carbon within the permafrost geosystem. Exportation of sediments by fluvial processes within gullies are positive mechanical feed-back effects that keep gully channels active over decades. Along gully margins, drainage of disturbed polygons and ponds, slope drainage, soil consolidation, plant colonization of disturbed gully slopes and wet to mesic plant succession of drained polygons change the thermal properties of the active layer and create negative feedback effects that stabilize active erosion processes and promote permafrost recovery in gully slopes and adjacent disturbed polygons. On Bylot Island (Nunavut), over 40 gullies were mapped and monitored to characterize gully geomorphology, thermal and mechanical processes of gully erosion, rates of gully erosion over time within different sedimentary deposits, total volume of eroded permafrost at the landscape scale and gully hydrology. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to quantify heat convection processes and speed of ice wedge ablation in order to derive empirical equations to develop a numerical, fully-coupled, heat and mass (water) transfer model of ice-wedge thermal erosion. We used data collected over 10 years of geomorphological gully monitoring, regional climate scenarios, our physics-based numerical thermal erosion model and our field/laboratory-based empirical thermal erosion model to evaluate the potential response of ice-wedge polygon terrains to changes in snow, permafrost thermal regime and hydrological conditions over the coming decades and its implication for the short and long term dynamics of arctic permafrost geosystems.",

While the physical controls on calving are not well understood, recent field and remote sensing observations from Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland, suggest calving is dependent on both glacier and fjord conditions. This presentation investigates the sensitivity of calving rates to ice velocity, ocean temperature and mélange composition using a combination of in situ and satellite observations. Ocean properties in Sermilik Fjord for 2009-2014 are reconstructed using mooring data, and an object-based image analysis (OBIA) that inventories icebergs, sea-ice and small icebergs quantifies mélange composition several times a season. Ice velocity from InSAR and optical imagery is used to calculate calving rates and investigate the role of longitudinal gradients on calving.\nIce velocity appears to be the dominant control on calving rates at Helheim Glacier. However, calving rates exhibit a complex pattern of seasonal and interannual variability, which does not simply mimic ice velocity patterns. We explore the relative roles of ocean properties, glacier geometry, and mélange composition on calving rates from 2001–2014 in order to improve physically-based glacier models.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies of converted seismic phases in regions of mantle upwelling and melting have identified Sp phases originating from a depth similar to the expected depth of melting onset. Using 1D melt migration models together with 1D synthetic receiver functions, we have investigated the conditions required to generate the observed converted phases. The magnitude of the synthetic melting onset phases increases with increasing upwelling velocity, increasing shear viscosity, and decreasing water content. The water content of erupted lavas at Hawaii and Galapagos suggest a hydrated mantle source. For the standard relationship of seismic velocity on melt fraction used here, if water is homogeneously distributed within the mantle source, the resulting seismic velocity gradients would not produce the observed converted phases. One way to explain the observed phases is that wet and dry components in the mantle source are heterogeneously distributed and melt independently. A relatively dry plume that entrains water as it passes through a hydrated transition zone could result in favorable conditions for generation the observed phases. Alternatively, experiment and theory show a sharp reduction in relaxed elastic modulus at the onset of melting, attributed to decreasing diffusion length scales upon the formation of an interconnected melt network. Thus, a stronger dependence of seismic velocity on low melt fractions at melting onset may account for the observed converted phases.",

            "abstract": "Operational drought monitoring has long suffered from poor representation of evaporative dynamics, with popular drought indices—such as the PDSI that informs much of the US Drought Monitor (USDM)—primarily relying on precipitation and temperature (T) to represent hydroclimatic anomalies. When evaporative demand (Eo) has been used, it has most often been derived from poorly performing T-based parameterizations that are then used in LSMs to derive actual evapotranspiration (ET). Our goal is to create a drought index that both improves the representation of evaporative dynamics in drought and offers a useful leading indicator of both flash and sustained droughts. This presentation will outline the physical basis for such an index: the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI).\nEDDI measures the physical response of Eo to surface drying anomalies that occur due to two distinct land surface/atmosphere interactions. In sustained drought, when moisture is limited at the land surface, Eo and ET vary in a complementary relationship: as ET declines, Eo increases due to the energy balance tipping to favor sensible heating. In flash droughts (before surface moisture limitations), ET and Eo both rise in response to increases in advection, radiation, or temperature, or decreases in humidity. Thus, Eo rises in response to both drought types (in contrast to ET-based drought measures), suggesting strong potential for use as a leading indicator of both drought types.\nFor Eo, we use reference ET (ETo) from the ASCE Standardized ",

The HiCLIMB seismic transect is interpreted to show Indian lithospheric mantle attached to Indian lower crust and underthrusting horizontally to the northernmost extent of that crust at ~31°N at ~85°E. The older INDEPTH seismic transect had been interpreted to show Indian lithospheric mantle detaching from Indian crust (at the “mantle suture”) beneath the surface trace of the YZS, ~29.5°N at ~90°E.\nWe present P-wave and S-wave receiver-function CCP images along a new seismic transect, with about double the station density of the INDEPTH transect, along 92°E from the High Himalaya across the Tethyan Himalaya and Lhasa terrane, to the Bangong-Nujiang Suture. We image a prominent converter dipping c. 25°N from near-surface to c. 150 km depth that we interpret as the Yarlung-Zangbo Suture in the crust and the Tibetan lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in the mantle. Sub-parallel and structurally deeper we interpret other converters as top and base of subducting Indian lithospheric mantle, detaching from underhtrusting Indian crust at the mantle suture >50 km south of the surface trace of the YZS. Based on this and the HiCLIMB image, as well as body-wave and surface-wave tomography, and potential-field and geochemical data, we believe the mantle suture is not parallel to the YZS at the surface, but rotated 25°CW.\nIn contrast, Indian crust seems to penetrate a fairly uniform distance beneath Tibet over a large sector of the orogen at least from 85° to 92°E, to the \"Indian crustal front\" >150 km north of the YZS. Thus underplating of Indian crust beneath the Lhasa Terrane may controlled by the geometry of collision as recorded by the Yarlung-Zangbo Suture at the surface, whereas progressive detachment of Indian mantle lithosphere from Indian crust may be related to stresses at the eastern syntaxis associated with ongoing subduction of the Burma plate. Irrespective of the cause, we infer that the relative geometry of subduction of Indian crust and Indian mantle lithosphere varies dramatically from west to east across Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Seismic noise holds a two-fold interest for global geophysics. It is a source of energy that may be used to form 3D tomographic images of the Earth. It is also an observable that provides a continuous, and in some cases, multi-decadal record of ocean storm activity. Potential insights include the understanding of global changes in patterns of storm location and severity, and inputs to models of carbon dioxide entrainment into the oceans. While any continuous seismic record has the potential to contribute knowledge on ambient seismic noise (microseisms), seismic arrays provide information that includes inference of the seismic slowness and backazimuth of incoming signals. Given that noise observations have no onset time, array techniques are very important in contributing signal properties that allow backprojection and hence location determination for storm sources.\nSeismic arrays located in Australia and southeast Asia enable deep ocean noise sources from much of the Southern Ocean and western Pacific to be investigated. We analyze seismic records including those from the Warramunga (WRA), Alice Springs (ASAR) and Pilbara (PSAR) arrays together with WAVEWATCH III oceanographic reanalysis models. We use the IAS Capon technique to identify incoming signals with the aim of detecting multiple noise sources impinging on the array at any one time. The combination of multi-decadal records from WRA, and multi-array perspectives for recent years provides an opportunity to observe seismic noise across a range of frequencies and across many years of seasonal variation.\nWe find some noise sources are consistent between different arrays, but others seem to be much better observed by a particular single array. We summarize these insights with a view to optimizing decadal plans for future installations of multiple arrays. Further, we address the challenge of using new arrays together with existing arrays with contrasting station configurations. Multiple array methods afford the opportunity of better understanding complex, extended ocean sources of seismic energy.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of several sequences of earthquakes in New Zealand in the last few years has meant that GNS Science has gained significant recent experience in aftershock hazard and forecasting. First was the Canterbury sequence of events which began in 2010 and included the destructive Christchurch earthquake of February, 2011. This sequence is occurring in what was a moderate-to-low hazard region of the National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM): the model on which the building design standards are based. With the expectation that the sequence would produce a 50-year hazard estimate in exceedance of the existing building standard, we developed a time-dependent model that combined short-term (STEP & ETAS) and longer-term (EEPAS) clustering with time-independent models. This forecast was combined with the NSHM to produce a forecast of the hazard for the next 50 years. This has been used to revise building design standards for the region and has contributed to planning of the rebuilding of Christchurch in multiple aspects.\nAn important contribution to this model comes from the inclusion of EEPAS, which allows for clustering on the scale of decades. EEPAS is based on three empirical regressions that relate the magnitudes, times of occurrence, and locations of major earthquakes to regional precursory scale increases in the magnitude and rate of occurrence of minor earthquakes. A second important contribution comes from the long-term rate to which seismicity is expected to return in 50-years. With little seismicity in the region in historical times, a controlling factor in the rate is whether-or-not it is based on a declustered catalog. This epistemic uncertainty in the model was allowed for by using forecasts from both declustered and non-declustered catalogs.\nWith two additional moderate sequences in the capital region of New Zealand in the last year, we have continued to refine our forecasting techniques, including the use of potential scenarios based on the aftershock forecasts. These scenarios provide example of how the sequence might eventuate, including the understanding of nearby faults and the Hikurangi megathrust. They have been developed with input from social scientists and have been provided to the public and government officials, and have proven useful in aiding the interpretation of the aftershock probabilities.",

            "abstract": "The surface uplift history of the Central Andean Plateau remains one of the most important unresolved issues in the tectonics of South America. Several studies have suggested that the region was rapidly uplifted during the Miocene as an isostatic response to delamination of a crustal root, but other studies have disputed these interpretations. A wealth of geological data have been brought to bear on the problem, but stable isotope paleoaltimetry is particularly relevant for understanding the surface uplift history of an orogen because it is based on the relationship between surface elevation and precipitation isotopic composition. To the extent that the altitude effects on isotopic composition can be disentangled from other atmospheric influences on proxy records, the technique can provide unique constraints on the surface elevation history of a region.\nChanges in water vapor sources, evaporation, and air parcel trajectories have all been recognized as influencing paleoelevation proxies. Precipitation in the Central Andean Plateau is affected by the South American Monsoon, where atmospheric deep convection can exert a very large influence on water vapor isotopic composition. Recent theoretical advances and observational studies have provided new constraints on these influence, with important implications for isotope-based paleoaltimetry studies.\nTwo important processes that are active in South America can induce substantial deviations from the traditional Rayleigh paradigm. Subcloud evaporation and vapor recycling during continental convection can lower water vapor dD values by several 10s of per mil below that predicted by Rayleigh distillation, and mixing between moist and dry air parcels can raise water vapor dD by a similar amount above that predicted by Rayleigh distillation. Furthermore, small shifts in the position of the Bolivian high can induce very rapid, large changes in the lateral distribution of precipitation d values. We use isotopic data from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) to show that the magnitude of these changes is comparable to those induced by surface uplift of the Central Andean Plateau, suggesting that the history of monsoonal and mixing influences in the region must be better constrained for successful paleoaltimetry interpretations.",

            "abstract": "The ocean is essential for life on our planet. It covers 71% of the Earth’s surface, is the source of the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the food we eat. Yet, the exponential growth in human population is putting the ocean and thus life on our planet at risk. However, based on student evaluations from our introductory oceanography course it is clear that our students have deficiencies in ocean literacy that impact their ability to recognize that the ocean and humans are inextricably connected. Furthermore, life present in deep subsurface marine environments is also interconnected to the study of the ocean, yet the deep biosphere is not typically covered in undergraduate oceanography courses. In an effort to improve student ocean literacy we developed an instructional module on the deep biosphere focused on gas hydrate deposits. Specifically, our module utilizes Google Earth and cutting edge research about microbial life in the ocean to support three inquiry-based activities that each explore different facets of gas hydrates (i.e. environmental controls, biologic controls, and societal implications). The relevant nature of the proposed module also makes it possible for instructors of introductory geology courses to modify module components to discuss related topics, such as climate, energy, and geologic hazards. This work, which will be available online as a free download, is a solid contribution toward increasing the available teaching resources focused on the deep biosphere for geoscience educators. ",

            "abstract": "We have examined relativistic electron flux losses at geosynchronous orbit under quiet geomagnetic conditions. One 3-day period, from 11 to 13 October 2007, was chosen for analysis because geomagnetic conditions were very quiet (3-day average of Kp < 1), and significant losses of geosynchronous relativistic electrons were observed. During this interval, there was no geomagnetic storm activity. Thus, the loss processes associated with geomagnetic field modulations caused by ring current buildup can be excluded. The >2 MeV electron flux at geosynchronous orbit shows typical diurnal variations with a maximum near noon and a minimum near midnight for each day. The flux level of the daily variation significantly decreased from first day to third day for the 3-day period by a factor of >10. The total magnetic field strength (BT) of the daily variation on the third day, however, is comparable to that on the first day. Unlike electron flux decreases, the flux of protons with energies between 0.8 and 4 MeV adiabatically responses to the daily variation of BT. That is, there is no significant decrease of the proton flux when the electron flux decreases. During the interval of quiet geomagnetic conditions, well-defined electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves were detected at geosynchronous spacecraft. Low-altitude polar orbiting spacecraft observed the precipitation of energetic protons and relativistic electrons in the interval of EMIC waves enhancement. From these observations, we suggest that the EMIC waves at geosynchronous orbit cause pitch-angle scattering and electron loss to the atmosphere under quiet geomagnetic conditions.",

The former tell us a great deal about morphology but little about kinematics, while the latter record kinematics but tell us relatively little about morphology. We present examples of both extremes as well as intermediate cases in which the stratal surfaces resemble geomorphic surfaces even though they are highly composite. Only fully intact geomorphic surfaces represent time horizons. We use a ‘coherent migration distance’ to measure the distance over which a particular geomorphic feature migrates before losing its identity and show that the greater the distance of coherent migration, the worse the correspondence between geomorphic and stratigraphic surfaces. Thus in a sense, well preserved geomorphic surfaces imply spatially incoherent kinematics. We also review measures for the degree of time transgression of surfaces and relate these to migration coherence, and show how serious errors of reconstruction can result from assuming that stratal surface represent geomorphology when they do not.",

The present study describes empirical methods for removing artifacts from satellite-derived surface radiation flux data and for quantifying the surface radiative impact of variability in visually-observed cloud cover.

            "abstract": "For over 200 years, fossil fuels have been the basis for an industrial revolution that has delivered a level of prosperity to modern society unimaginable during the previous 5000 years of human civilization. However, society’s dependence on fossil fuels is coming to an end for two reasons. The first reason is because our fossil fuel reserves are running out, oil in this century, natural gas during the next century, and coal a few centuries later. The second reason is because fossil fuels are having a devastating impact on the habitability of our planet, disrupting our climate system and acidifying our oceans. So the question is not whether we will discontinue using fossil fuels, but rather whether we will stop using them before they do irreparable damage to the Earth’s life-support systems.\nWithin our geoscience community, climate scientists have determined that a majority of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain unburned if dangerous climate change and ocean acidification are to be avoided. In contrast, Exxon-Mobil, Shell, and other members of the fossil fuel industry are pursuing a business model that assumes all of their reserves will be burned and will not become stranded assets. Since the geosciences have had a long and mutually beneficial relationship with the fossil fuel industry, this inherent conflict between climate science and industrial interests presents an ethical dilemma for many geoscientists. This conflict is further heightened by the fossil fuel divestment movement, which is underway at over 400 college and university campuses around the world. This presentation will explore some of the ethical and financial issues being raised by the divestment movement from a geoscientist’s perspective.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of clumped isotopes of carbonate-bearing minerals are a powerful tool for reconstructing past surface temperatures and thermal histories of shallow crustal rocks. Because the clumped-isotope thermometer is based on homogenous-phase equilibrium, a sample’s clumped-isotope temperature is susceptible to resetting through, for example, intracrystalline diffusion and redistribution of C and O isotopes during (re)heating or slow cooling. Quantitative knowledge of the kinetics of this resetting have received increasing attention (1-3) and is critical for understanding the meaning of clumped-isotope temperatures of samples with complex burial histories.\nTo better constrain these kinetics and complement previous work (1-3) we performed heating experiments (400-700°C) on optical calcites and carbonate-bearing apatites. As previously observed (2-3), calcites exhibit non-first-order kinetics. The data were fit using a model that incorporates both diffusion and isotope-exchange reactions (4). The kinetics derived with this model using the optical-calcite heating experiments of (2) and those measured here are indistinguishable. The model predicts that subtle changes (>10°C) in measured calcite clumped-isotope temperatures can occur at burial temperatures between 60-100°C on million-year timescales. Though small, such changes may have an impact on clumped-isotope-based reconstructions of past surface temperatures and thermal histories.\nThe derived kinetics were compared to clumped-isotope measurements of cogenetic calcites and apatites from slowly cooled carbonatite intrusions. Apparent temperatures are 70-140°C for apatites and 120-190°C for calcites. Measured temperatures for calcites match modeled temperatures using reasonable geological cooling rates. Natural apatite samples yield lower apparent temperatures than predicted based on the model. We propose that this difference is the result of annealment of structural damage in apatites (e.g., generated by radiation damage) during experiments.\n(1) Dennis and Schrag, 2010; (2) Passey and Henkes, 2012; (3) Henkes et al., 2014.

In the upper water column, the July-August-September water temperatures increased 0.8–1.0°C over the 29 years.

            "abstract": "We analyze the ability of global and regional climate models to simulate extreme daily precipitation and supporting processes for midlatitude and Arctic regions of North America. Regional model output comes from the NARCCAP archive and simulations by an Arctic version of WRF; global model output comes from the CMIP5 archive. The NARCCAP results also include output from a time-slice, high-resolution global simulation. All regional model output is at half degree resolution, whereas the CMIP5 resolutions vary but are coarser than the regional model resolutions. The combined analysis allows us to assess added value of finer resolution in simulating extreme precipitation. Analysis focuses on selected regions of North America for winter (DJF) and summer (JJA), building on several previous analyses focused on this region. In addition to comparing results from the different models, we also compare simulated precipitation and supporting processes with those obtained from observed precipitation and reanalysis atmospheric states.\nIn the central U.S., the models generally reproduce well the precipitation-vs.-intensity spectrum seen in observations, with a tendency for coarse-resolution global models to produce somewhat less intense precipitation. In contrast, all models are deficient in high intensity precipitation in Alaska. Further analysis focuses on precipitation events exceeding the 99.5 percentile that occur simultaneously at several points in the region, yielding so-called “widespread events”. Analysis of 500 hPa heights, near-surface circulation and fields such as temperature and humidity reveal the processes leading to extreme events in the models and observations. The finer resolution models generally reproduce the physical behavior of these extreme events, with the coarser models showing a smoother rendition. In the central U.S., for winter, these events are produced by slowly moving low-pressure systems that all models simulate fairly well. In Alaska, these events tend to occur through orographic uplift in both observations and simulations. This difference in physical behavior between the two regions suggests reasons for the deficiency in Alaska’s simulated, high intensity precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Mobile regolith is produced as weathered saprolite is entrained into the mobile layer. The rate of mobile-regolith production and its residence time on hillslopes shapes the topography and evolution of hillslopes. We calculate the production rate of mobile regolith and the mobile-regolith residence times on active hillslopes in Gordon Gulch, within the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO), Colorado. We find mobile-regolith production rates (average 3.1 cm/ka) and residence times (average 10-20 ka) derived from both in situand meteoric methods agree. Lowering-rates derived from our study are also comparable to basin-averaged denudation rates for small basins in the Colorado Front Range (Dethier and Lazarus, 2006).\nIn this study, we have measured both in situ and meteoric 10Be in saprolite and mobile regolith separately. We find that, on average, two-thirds of in situ 10Be is produced within saprolite, and that at least one-tenth of the meteoric 10Be inventories are stored in saprolite. In the case of in situ 10Be, this simply reflects the exponential fall-off in production rates through a thin mobile-regolith cover. In the case of meteoric 10Be, our calculations suggest that >40% of the meteoric 10Be deposition occurs within the saprolite. Most studies that utilize 10Be report residence times and soil-production rates based on concentrations in either the mobile regolith or saprolite; therefore, our 10Be data highlight the importance of clearly identifying mobile and immobile portions of the regolith, constraining its 10Be inventory, and use of consistent terminology for the mobile-layer.",

            "abstract": "Semi-distributed river system models are traditionally calibrated using a reach-by-reach calibration approach from that starts from headwater gauges and moves downstream toward the end of the system. Such a calibration method poses a unique problem since errors related to over-fitting, poor gauging data and uncertain physical connection are passed downstream. Reach-by-reach calibration, while efficient, cannot compensate for limited/poor calibration data of some gauges. To overcome the limitations of reach-by-reach calibration, a system calibration approach is proposed in which all the river reaches within a river basin are calibrated together using a global objective function for all stream flow gauges. In this approach, relative weights can be assigned in the global objective function for different gauges based on the magnitude and quality of available data. The system calibration approach was implemented in a river network covering 11 stream flow gauges within Murrumbidgee catchment (Australia). This study optimises flow at the selected gauges within the river network simultaneously (36 calibrated parameters) utilising a process-based semi-distributed river system model. The model includes processes such as routing, localised runoff, irrigation diversion, overbank flow and losses to groundwater. Goodness of fit is evaluated at the 11 gauges and a flow based weighting scheme is employed to find posterior distributions of parameters using an Approximate Bayesian Computation. The method is evaluated against a reach-by-reach calibration scheme. The comparison shows that the system calibration approach provides an overall improved goodness-of-fit by systematically de-valuing poor quality gauges providing an overall improved basin-wide performance. Clusters of viable parameter sets are determined from the posterior distributions and each examined to assess the effects of parameter uncertainty on internal model states. Such a method of calibration provides a lot more flexibility in the calibration process, however because of the equifinality problem; it has increased potential to allow the model to produce unrealistic model states. The use of supplementary data (flood extent) is tested as a means of reducing parameter uncertainty, and producing more realistic model states.",

            "abstract": "Accurate instrument calibration and retrieval algorithms are essential for estimating atmospheric CO2 or CH4 from reflected sunlight. Since the GOSAT launch in 2009, retrieval accuracy has been improved gradually mainly by: (1) Radiometric degradation correction, (2) Non-linearity correction in spectral radiance, (3) Aerosol scattering treatment, (4) CO2 and O2 line parameters by laboratory spectroscopy, and (5) simultaneous retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence. Other small systematic biases have not yet been identified.\nOCO-2 uses grating spectrometers while GOSAT uses a Fourier transform spectrometer to record spectra near 0.76, 1.6 and 2.0 μm with different observing strategies, integration times, and spatial and spectral resolutions. After the successful launch of OCO-2, measurements from the two independent instruments can be compared to distinguish common forward calculation errors such as line parameters, aerosol scattering, and ocean glint reflection from instrument specific errors. Multiplexed and large throughput signal from the FTS requires a larger dynamic range and has higher possibility of non-linearity. Grating spectrometers have more complicated instrument line shape functions and pixel-to-pixel non-uniformity. These characteristics have to be properly modeled in retrieval process.\nThe initial steps of this inter-comparison are (1) radiometric comparison from a common vicarious calibration site at Railroad Valley in Nevada, where surface reflectance and bi-directional reflection distribution functions have been characterized over 5 years and XCO2 data are also available from air-borne and ground-based instruments, (2) spectral comparisons from the Lunar calibration data, and (3) comparisons of XCO2 from spatially and temporally coincident observations. Once the two instruments are characterized, they can view common targets from different geometries. This capability provides additional constraints on aerosol scattering, which is the largest uncertainty for CO2 retrieval from space. With the recent launch of OCO-2 in July 2014, it is now possible to provide initial comparisons of these new space-based high spectral resolution SWIR observations to those measured from the well characterized GOSAT satellite.",

            "abstract": "Throughfall - rain that drops through forest canopies - greatly varies in space. Yet, this spatial variation is not similar across forests; instead, recent research provides evidence that forest structure influences the strength and range of throughfall autocorrelations. Moreover, previous studies showed that throughfall patterns can be temporally persistent, which hints at their potential hydrological relevance. Whether or not these patterns indeed influence the hydrological response of forested hillslopes remains an open question. Some studies reported an influence of throughfall spatial structures on runoff generation whereas others indicate that throughfall patterns are of secondary importance. Most of the previous studies considered only a few realizations of throughfall spatial structures and neglected soil variability. In this study I try to overcome these limitations by combining multiple high-resolution, throughfall and soil permeability datasets from different forest ecosystems. Based on stochastic simulations I investigate the effect of throughfall and soil permeability spatial patterns on overland flow connectivity by calculating the size of connected patches where throughfall intensities exceed the permeability in the topsoil. An increasing connectivity of the patches indicates an increasing likelihood of overland flow generation. So far, the simulations provide strong evidence that spatially structured throughfall patterns decrease overland flow connectivity. That is, an increasing autocorrelation in throughfall always decreases the connectivity of those patches in which throughfall intensities exceed soil permeability. Interestingly, the simulations further indicate that throughfall patterns in old-growth forests have more impact on overland flow connectivity than patterns typically found in young forests. Based on these results I discuss the hypothesis that forest succession, which typically results in an increasingly structured canopy, involves a decrease in overland flow connectivity.",

These huge volcanoes exhibit large deformation areas such as rift zones, and strong ground displacements with more or less mobile flanks, which respond to long-lasting stress field conditions (gravitational stress, magmatic processes and/or regional tectonics...). Piton de la Fournaise (La Réunion, Indian ocean) is one of the most active basaltic volcano in the world and displays all of these features. We study the dynamics and the origin of Piton de la Fournaise deformation through the observation of temporal and spatial strain distribution. With the densification of the volcano observatory permanent GNSS network in 2009 and thanks to their high sampling rates, for the first time we have calculated strain maps derived from GNSS displacements on this volcano. We present temporal and spatial distribution of strain on Piton de la Fournaise, on the whole edifice from the summit to the coastline, during both eruptive and rest periods. Main deformation allows us to distinguish four main sectors displaying distinct behaviors in response to volcanic and rest activities: (1) the summit, (2) the terminal cone, (3) the base of the cone, and (4) the eastern flank. Principal strains are maximal on the terminal cone -with an antagonist pattern between the summit and the slope of the terminal cone where the strains are one order of magnitude lower than on the summit-, while decay rates of compressive strain is observed in the eastern flank up to the coastline. Even if the strains are low in the eastern flank, we evidence compressive strain there, whereas the coastline appears to be more stable. The eastern flank sliding damps with the distance, suggesting stress accumulates in the slopes of the Grandes Pentes/Grand Brûlé areas. This evaluation provides new insights for the assessment of potential hazards associated with edifice instabilities, and especially the generation of future flank destabilizations, but also with the propagation of large distal eruptions.",

Since the 1980s, the tropical CPTT has shown not only interannual variations, but also a decreasing trend. However, the factors controlling the variations in the tropical CPTT since the 1980s remain elusive. The present study reveals that the continuous expansion of the area of the Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) since the 1980s represents an increase in the total heat energy of the IPWP available to heat the tropospheric air, which is likely to expand as a result. This process lifts the tropical cold-point tropopause height (CPTH) and leads to the observed long-term cooling trend of the tropical CPTT. In addition, our analysis shows that Modoki activity is an important factor in modulating the interannual variations of the tropical CPTT through significant effects on overshooting convection.",

            "abstract": "Although hydrogen isotopes (δ2H) of leaf wax lipids are increasingly being applied as (paleo-) hydrological proxies, we still do not understand some of the basic processes that shape the δ2H values of these compounds. In general, it is believed that three variables shape the δ2H values of leaf wax lipids: source water δ2H values, evaporative deuterium (2H) enrichment of leaf water and the biosynthetic fractionation (εbio) during the synthesis of organic compounds. While the influences of source water δ2H values and leaf water evaporative 2H enrichment have been well documented, very little is known how εbio shapes the δ2H values of plant-derived lipids.\nI will present the results from recent experiments, where we show that the magnitude of εbio, and thus the δ2H value of plant-derived lipids, strongly depends on the carbon (C) metabolism of a plant. Specifically, I will show that plants that rely for their tissue formation on recently assimilated C have δ2H values in their n-alkanes that are up to 60‰ more negative than plants that depend for their tissue formation on stored carbohydrates. Our findings can be explained by the fact that NADPH is the primary source of hydrogen in plant lipids and that the δ2H value of NADPH differs whether NADPH was generated directly in the light reaction of photosynthesis or whether it was generated by processing stored carbohydrates. As such, the δ2H values of plant-derived lipids will directly depend on whether the tissue containing these lipids was synthesized using recent assimilates, e.g. in a C autonomous state or, if it was synthesized from stored or otherwise aquired C sources, e.g. in a not C autonomous state. Given the magnidude of this effect, our results have important implications for interpretation of plant-derived lipid δ2H values when used as (paleo-) hydrological proxies. In addition, our results suggest, that δ2H values of plant-derived lipids could be employed as a new tools to assess the C metabolism in plants.",

Here we review techniques and methodologies used to measure sound velocities in metals at Mbar pressures, with specific focus on the compressional sound velocity of hexagonal close-packed iron. A critical comparison of literature results, coherently analyzed using the same metrology (pressure scale, equation of state,), allowed us to propose reference relations for the pressure and density evolution of the compressional velocity of hexagonal close-packed iron at ambient temperature. This provides a key base line upon which build on complexity, including high-temperature effects, pre-melting effects, effects of nickel and/or light element inclusion, necessary for an accurate comparison with seismic models, and ultimately to constrain Earth’s inner core composition.",

However, even the direct interaction of aerosols with incoming sunlight is at present insufficiently constrained. Here we compare the output of 15 recent aerosol climate models (AeroCom Phase II), both column averaged and vertically resolved. Through a simple MonteCarlo approach, we show that the model based total anthropogenic aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) uncertainty may be underestimated. Constraining modelled vertical profiles of black carbon (BC) concentration to aircraft measurements in remote regions, we further show that recent BC DRF estimates may be biased high. A short modelled BC lifetime is indicated as a necessary, though not sufficient, requirement for reproducing measurements. Finally, modeled sulphate aerosol DRF is discussed in the context of differences in representation of humidity and hygroscopic growth in the models.",

            "abstract": "We study coupling mechanisms at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) of terrestrial bodies of the Solar system, and in particular, calculate the pressure torque acting on the topography of the CMB. The CMB topography is usually considered to have a smooth spherical or elliptical shape, however, in reality it is bumpy (for the Earth, the CMB mountains and valleys represent local height differences of the order of a kilometer). The torque related to the topography is due to an incremental flow in the core at the CMB with respect to the Poincare fluid motion when the nutations are considered. The additional pressure and the torque depend on the shape of the CMB and can be related to the spherical harmonic coefficients of the CMB topography. We follow the philosophy of the computation of Wu and Wahr [Geophys. J. Int., 128(1), 18-42, 1997] and determine the coefficients of the velocity field in the core at the CMB in terms of the topography coefficients.\nWe confirm that some topography coefficients may enhance length-of-day changes and nutations at selected frequencies, and show that these increased rotation variations are due to resonance effects with inertial waves in the incremental core flow. The total torque therefore sensitively depends on the geometry of the CMB. Enhancements of rotation variations were previously shown with an example in Wu and Wahr (1997), but their use of numerical values did not allow deciding whether the enhancements were due to the topography amplitudes themselves or to some resonance effect. Here we show that these enhancements are not an artifact of the choice of the topography but rather a general fact for some frequencies close to inertial wave frequencies. However, for frequencies far from the inertial wave frequencies, the contribution to nutation might still be related to a large amplitude of the topography.",

            "abstract": "The spatial scales relevant to soil microbial activity are much finer than scales relevant to whole-ecosystem function and biogeochemical cycling. On the one hand, how to link such different scales and develop scale-aware biogeochemical and ecohydrological models remains a major challenge. On the other hand, resolving these linkages is becoming necessary for testing ecological hypotheses and resolving data-theory inconsistencies. Here, the relation between microbial respiration and soil moisture expressed in water potential is explored. Such relation mediates the water availability effects on ecosystem-level heterotrophic respiration and is of paramount importance for understanding CO2 emissions under increasingly variable rainfall regimes. Respiration has been shown to decline as the soil dries in a remarkably consistent way across climates and soil types (open triangles in Figure). Empirical models based on these respiration-moisture relations are routinely used in Earth System Models to predict moisture effects on ecosystem respiration. It has been hypothesized that this consistency in microbial respiration decline is due to breakage of water film continuity causing in turn solute diffusion limitations in dry conditions. However, this hypothesis appears to be at odds with what is known about soil hydraulic properties. Water film continuity estimated from soil water retention (SWR) measurements at the ‘Darcy’ scale breaks at far less negative water potential (<-0.1 MPa) levels than where microbial respiration ceases (approximately -15 MPa) as shown in the Figure (violet frequency distribution). Also, this threshold point inferred from SWR shows strong texture dependence, in contrast to the respiration curves. Employing theoretical tools from percolation theory, it is demonstrated that hydrological measurements can be spatially downscaled at a micro-level relevant to microbial activity. Such downscaling resolves the inconsistency between respiration thresholds and hydrological thresholds. This result, together with observations of residual microbial activity well below -15 MPa (dashed back curve in Figure), lends support to the hypothesis that soil microbes are substrate-limited in dry conditions.",

In the phenological parameterization, we introduced the growing season index (GSI) model which combined the air temperature, day length and vapor pressure deficit simultaneously into an index to quantify the greenness of vegetation throughout the year and established the relationships between the GSI index and the carbon phenology fluxes. We tested this phenology scheme against observations focusing on two vegetation function types (deciduous forest and grass land). Preliminary results show that DLM has a better performance for simulating phenological events than CLM across the global eddy-covariance sites, and describes the deciduous vegetation seasonal changes more reasonably. As the same time, simulations for the other two important variables related with phenology closely, i.e., leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP), by DLM are also in agreement with the observed and better than those by CLM. And, DLM can track the vegetation reversible nature of the spring recovery which is the shortcoming for CLM.",

            "abstract": "Integrated modelling and assessment (IMA) is best regarded as a process that can support environmental decision-making when issues are strongly contested and uncertainties pervasive. To be most useful, the process must be multi-dimensional and phased. Principally, it must be tailored to the problem context to encompass diverse issues of concern, management settings and stakeholders. This in turn requires the integration of multiple processes and components of natural and human systems and their corresponding spatial and temporal scales. Modellers therefore need to be able to integrate multiple disciplines, methods, models, tools and data, and many sources and types of uncertainty. These dimensions are incorporated into iteration between the various phases of the IMA process, including scoping, problem framing and formulation, assessing options and communicating findings. Two case studies in Australia are employed to share the lessons of how integration can be achieved in these IMA phases using a mix of stakeholder participation processes and modelling tools. One case study aims to improve the relevance of modelling by incorporating stakeholder’s views of irrigated viticulture and water management decision making. It used a novel methodology with the acronym ICTAM, consisting of Interviews to elicit mental models, Cognitive maps to represent and analyse individual and group mental models, Time-sequence diagrams to chronologically structure the decision making process, an All-encompassing conceptual model, and computational Models of stakeholder decision making. The second case uses a hydro-economic river network model to examine basin-wide impacts of water allocation cuts and adoption of farm innovations. The knowledge exchange approach used in each case was designed to integrate data and knowledge bearing in mind the contextual dimensions of the problem at hand, and the specific contributions that environmental modelling was thought to be able to make.",

The characteristics of these pore scale events affect residual phase entrapment and the resulting unsaturated transport properties behind the front. Experimental studies using acoustic emissions technique (AE), rapid imaging, and pressure measurements help characterize pore scale processes during drainage and imbibition in model porous media. Imbibition and drainage produce different AE signatures (obeying a power law). For rapid drainage, AE signals persist long after cessation of front motion indicative of redistribution and interfacial relaxation. Rapid imaging revealed that interfacial jumps exceed mean front velocity and are highly inertial (Re>1000). Imaged pore invasion volumes and pore volumes deduced from waiting times between pressure fluctuations were in remarkable agreement with geometric pores. Differences between invaded volumes and geometrical pores increase with increasing capillary numbers due to shorter pore evacuation times and onset of simultaneous invasion events. A new mechanistic model for interfacial motions through a pore-throat network enabled systematic evaluation of inertia in interfacial dynamics. Results suggest that in contrast to great sensitivity of pore scale dynamics to variations in pore geometry and boundary conditions, inertia exerts only a minor effect on average phase entrapment. Pore scale invasion events paint a complex picture of rapid and inertial motions and provide new insights on mechanisms at displacement fronts essential for improving the macroscopic description of multiphase flow in porous media.",

            "abstract": "Slip along subduction megathrusts generally ranges from seismogenic, to slow slip events (SSE) and aseismic creep. Although temperature and clay mineralogy are widely believed to play key roles in governing modes of slip, little is known about the microphysical mechanisms controlling this diverse behaviour, and laboratory friction data for realistic materials at in-situ conditions are few. Recently, we have published a series of large strain, rotary shear experiments on synthetic gouges consisting of phyllosilicates and quartz, sheared at in-situ PT conditions and low sliding velocities V (1-100 µm/s) relevant to earthquake nucleation. Here, we report new results for natural megathrust materials exhumed from different depths on Shikoku, SW Japan. These natural gouges were deformed at sample-specific, peak in-situ PT conditions with fluid overpressure ratios λ between 0.4 and 0.9, and V=0.1-100 µm/s. The simulated and natural materials show broadly consistent behaviour with rate strengthening [(a-b)>0] at T<~200-300°C (Regime 1), rate weakening [(a-b)<0] that would potentially allow nucleation of unstable slip at T up to ~400-500°C (Regime 2) and again rate strengthening at T>~500° C (Regime 3). These observations suggest the potential for earthquake nucleation in Regime 2. In addition, (a-b) tends to become more positive with increasing λ and with increasing V up to ~200-300°C, suggesting possible SSE nucleation in Regime 1, where high λ values have a stabilizing effect. These observations can be explained by a quantitative microphysical model for the steady state frictional behaviour of illite-quartz gouges, which includes rate independent slip on phyllosilicates and time dependent pressure solution of quartz clasts.",

            "abstract": "We present results from a temporary seismic network of 32 broad-band stations located around the Rwenzori region of the Albertine rift at the border between Uganda and DR Congo. The study aims to constrain seismic anisotropy and mantle deformation processes in relation to the formation of the rift zone. Shear-wave splitting measurements from local and teleseismic earthquakes are used to investigate the seismic anisotropy in the crust and upper mantle beneath the Rwenzori region. At most stations, shear-wave splitting parameters obtained from individual earthquakes exhibit only minor variations with backazimuth. We therefore employ a joint inversion of SKS waveforms to derive hypothetical one-layer parameters. The corresponding fast polarizations are generally rift-parallel and the average delay time is about 1 s. On the other hand, shear phases from local events within the crust are characterized by an average delay time of 0.04 s. This observation suggests that the dominant source region for seismic anisotropy beneath the rift is located within the mantle. We use finite-frequency waveform modeling to test different models of anisotropy within the lithosphere/asthenosphere system of the rift. The results show that the rift-parallel fast polarizations are consistent with HTI anisotropy caused by magmatic intrusions or lenses located within the lithospheric mantle - as it would be expected during the early stages of continental rifting. Furthermore, the short-scale spatial variations in the fast polarizations observed in the southern part of the study area can be explained by effects due to sedimentary basins of low isotropic velocity in combination with a shift in the orientation of anisotropic fabrics in the upper mantle.

            "abstract": "Seismic noise in the period band 3-10s is generated at the surface of the ocean by the interaction of ocean gravity waves. Noise signal is dominated by Rayleigh waves and is recorded worldwide, both on the ocean seafloor and on continent. Microseismic Rayleigh waves, like any other elastic wave, loose energy when traveling from the ocean to the continent. Thus, the noise records on continent are affected by the propagation of microseismic waves, especially across the boundary between the ocean and the continent, the main structural boundary along the source-receiver path. At the ocean-continent boundary, Rayleigh waves dissipate a significant amount of energy (e.g. McGarr, 1969) and noise Love waves may be generated (e.g. Gregersen, 1977).\nIn order to investigate the effect of the ocean-continent boundary on seismic noise records, we simulate the propagation of the seismic wavefield across the seafloor using the spectral-element method in the secondary microseismic period band (3-10s). A single noise source is located at the surface of the ocean and the signal is recorded at the seafloor, both in deep and shallow ocean regions and on continent. The seismograms computed in a model with continental slope are compared to those computed in a model with flat seafloor, for varying periods and slopes. In the presence of the continental slope, the seismic records are affected by a secondary virtual source, generated by the seafloor topography. The effect of the spatial distribution of noise sources is also investigated.",

            "abstract": "Due to global climate change, tropical forest, savanna, and grassland biomes, and the transitions between them, are expected to undergo major changes in the future. Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) are largely used to understand vegetation dynamics under present climate, and to predict its changes under future conditions. However, several DGVMs display high uncertainty in predicting vegetation in tropical areas. Here we present the results of a comparative analysis of three different DGVMs (JSBACH, LPJ-GUESS-SPITFIRE and aDGVM) with regard to their different representations of the ecological mechanisms and feedbacks that determine the forest, savanna and grassland biomes, in an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap between ecology and global modelling. We compared model outcomes to observed tree cover along a mean annual precipitation gradient in Africa. Through these comparisons, and by drawing on the large number of recent studies that have delivered new insights into the ecology of tropical ecosystems in general, and of savannas in particular, we identify two main mechanisms that need an improved representation in the DGVMs. The first mechanism encompasses water limitation to tree growth, and tree-grass competition for water, which are key factors in determining savanna occurrence in arid and semi-arid areas. The second is a grass-fire feedback, which maintains both forest and savannas in mesic areas. Grasses constitute the majority of the fuel load, and at the same time benefit from the openness of the landscape after fires, since they recover faster than trees. Additionally, these two mechanisms are better represented when the models also include tree life stages (adults and seedlings), and distinguish between fire-prone and shade-tolerant savanna trees, and fire-resistant and shade-intolerant forest trees. Including these basic elements could improve the predictive ability of the DGVMs, not only under current climate conditions but also and especially under future scenarios.",

Among a number of emerging space-based remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) seems the most promising for important innovation in landslide and subsidence hazards assessment and monitoring. MTI is appealing to those concerned with terrain instability hazards because it can provide very precise information on slow displacements of the ground surface over vast areas with limited vegetation cover. Although MTI techniques are considered to have already reached the operational level, it is apparent that in both research and practice we are at present only beginning to benefit from the high-resolution imagery that is currently acquired by the new generation radar satellites (e.g. COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X). In this overview we illustrate the great potential of high resolution MTI and explain what this technique can deliver in terms of detection and monitoring of slope and subsidence hazards. This is done by considering different areas characterized by a wide range of geomorphic, climatic and vegetation conditions, and presenting selected case study examples of local to regional scale MTI applications from Europe, China and Haiti. We envision that the current approach to assessment of hazard can be transformed by capitalizing more on the presently underexploited advantage of the MTI technique, i.e. the capability to provide regularly spatially-dense quantitative information for large areas currently unaffected by instabilities, but where the terrain geomorphology and geology may indicate potential for future ground failures.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the links between climate and water cycle is essential in the current context of global warming. The water isotopic composition, quantified as δD, δ18O or δ17O, has a great potential to trace the organization of present-day hydrological cycle. When recorded in various archives as tree rings, sediments, ice cores, they have also been largely used to reconstruct the past evolution of climate and water.\nThe Antarctic cap is extremely sensitive to climate change. Moreover, this region is under the influence of exchanges between the troposphere and the stratosphere because of the presence of the polar vortex. Tritium (3H) has been shown to be an appropriate tracer for the intrusion of stratospheric air masses into the lower troposphere. Natural tritium is mainly produced by the interaction of cosmic radiations with the upper atmosphere. This tritium enters the hydrological cycle in the form of tritiated water molecules (HTO) and has a radioactive half-life of 4500±8 days.\nIn an approach combining data and model, we have first implemented tritium in the coupled Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique Zoom (LMDZ) Atmospheric General Circulation Model developed at IPSL [Risi et al., 2010]: LMDZ-iso. The implementation of natural tritium uses the same model architecture as for the other water isotopes, after a correct description of associated cosmogenic production terms [Masarik and Beer, 2009]. The model is used in a configuration dedicated to the simulation of the stratosphere, with 39 layers.\nIn this presentation, we will focus on the modeling of spatial and temporal natural variations of tritium content in precipitation. The model is validated against a compilation of available data for natural tritium. We show that the continental and latitudinal effects are well reproduced by the model and that simulated seasonal variations of the tritium content of precipitation are coherent with our current knowledge of troposphere-stratosphere exchanges.\nMasarik and Beer (2009) J.

            "abstract": "To understand the storage and cycling of carbon in/through Earth’s deep mantle it is vital to examine carbon speciations at relevant pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity (fO2). In particular redox conditions of the mantle critically influence the mobility of carbon bearing phases in the silicate matrix; oxidized species are generally more mobile (carbonatites, carbonated silicate melts) or have a larger impact on silicate solidi (carbonated peridotite/eclogite) than reduced species (diamond, carbides, metals). Within garnet bearing mantle lithologies, fO2 can be expected to decrease with depth [1], eventually reaching values similar to the iron-wüstite equilibrium which implies the precipitation of a Fe-Ni metal phase at pressures corresponding to the base of the upper mantle [2]. Because Ni is more noble than Fe, Ni partitions strongly into the reduced phases such that at low metal fractions the metal phase reaches XNi > 0.5. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the mantle contains ~0.1 wt.% Fe,Ni metal at ~300 km depth [3], increasing to ~1 wt% in the lower mantle [4]. To understand the nature of carbon bearing reduced phases in the Earth mantle, we examine experimentally phase relations and melting behavior in the system Fe-Ni-C at 10 and 23 GPa. Dependent on Fe-Ni ratio and related fO2, C content, P and T we observe a variety of phases, namely (Fe,Ni)3C and (Fe,Ni)7C3 carbides, carbon bearing Fe-Ni metal, diamond and carbon rich metal-melt. In the subsolidus, mantle bulk C contents of 50 to 500 ppm [5] would result in the phase association (Fe,Ni)3C + metal + diamond at 10 GPa. In the uppermost lower mantle, about 1 wt.% metal would dissolve ca. 100 ppm C, any further C would lead to (Fe,Ni)3C carbide saturation. The solidus temperatures of theses phase assemblages however are considerably lower than the geotherm at upper and lower mantle pressures. We therefore suggest that reduced carbon bearing phases in the deep mantle are largely molten [6].\n[1] Stagno et al. 2013. Nature 493, 84-88. [2] Rohrbach et al. 2007, Nature 449, 456-458.

With a few exceptions we find that the models reproduce reasonably well the mean and extreme climatology of temperature and precipitation over the region, with the RegCM4 improving the simulation of daily precipitation frequency and duration of dry and wet events compared to CAM4 due to its higher resolution. In the near future simulation both models show a warming of up to 2 degrees locally. In addition, both models show an increase in maximum and minimum temperature extremes and a prevailing shift towards a hydroclimatic regime of more intense and less frequent precipitation events. The global and regional models exhibit quite different patterns of bias and change, an indication of the importance of internal variability and process representation for the simulation of surface climate. Given the good performance shown by the nested CAM4-RegCM4 system, we plan to use these models to generate an ensemble of projections for use in impact assessment studies for the region.",

            "abstract": "In the upward current region of the aurora, about two thirds of the total voltage between the auroral ionosphere and the equatorial magnetosphere can be concentrated in a stationary double layer at an altitude of about one earth radius, as Vlasov simulations of the plasma on a magnetic field line have shown (Gunell, et al., Ann. Geophys., 31, 1227–1240, 2013).\nWe perform numerical experiments, changing the total voltage between the ionosphere and the equatorial magnetosphere during the course of the simulation. In the initial state, the total acceleration voltage is 3 kV and there is a double layer approximately 5000 km above the ionospheric end of the system. When the voltage is increased, electrons are trapped between the double layer and the magnetic mirror in a region of velocity space that initially was empty. When the voltage is decreased to its initial value these trapped electrons are released upwards. If the voltage is lowered first and then raised back to where it started, the newly trapped electrons remain trapped. As a consequence of the difference between the two cases, the electron pitch angle distribution, below the double layer, carries information about the recent history of the acceleration voltage. In both cases, most of the change in voltage, ΔV, is assumed by the double layer, in agreement with a study of Cluster data that could confine most of ΔV to altitudes below the spacecraft (Forsyth et al., JGR, 117, A12203, 2012). Hysteresis effects in the double layer position are seen in connection with the electron trapping.\nThis work was supported by the Belgian Science Policy Office through the Solar-Terrestrial Centre of Excellence and by PRODEX/Cluster contract 13127/98/NL/VJ(IC)-PEA 90316.",

On the other hand, recent studies have also suggested that the direct and indirect radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols can perturb the large-scale circulation and cause significant changes in cloud cover and precipitation including those associated with the monsoon systems through the so-called dynamical path. Studies focused on these aerosol effects on the monsoons have formed an active research direction. Despite advancement in research, disagreement regarding the forcing mechanisms through which aerosols particularly absorbing aerosols and aerosol-cloud interaction affect the monsoons still exists.

Since this is the case of most minerals of the upper mantle (olivine, pyroxene, …), we anticipate that, besides dislocation creep that is responsible for the development of strongly pronounced lattice preferred orientations, other deformation mechanisms such as diffusion, grain boundary sliding, disclinations, … must be active in-situ. It has been established that such an accommodation mechanism completely controls the effective flow stress of the mantle rock. In this presentation, using a scale transition model that allows relating polycrystal and grain behaviors, we will show that they also have a huge influence of the effective stress sensitivity (stress exponent). For example if one consider that n=3.5 as for the slip of dislocation in individual grains, one cannot reach the commonly adopted value n=3.5 at the polycrystal scale, if the accommodation mechanism is linear (n=1) as for e.g. diffusion creep. This raises the question about possible deformation mechanisms active in-situ.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the sources, mineralogy and rates of iron supply to the Southern Ocean may have global impact and significance, by influencing plankton growth rates and nutrient take-up in this, the largest of the high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the world ocean. Iron ‘fertilization’ in the Southern Ocean may increase rates of carbon export production and thus the ocean uptake flux of atmospheric CO2, and also diminish the northward flow of residual nutrients to the extra-polar ocean, especially the HNLC regions of the Pacific. Changes in Southern Ocean export production may contribute to global climate change over glacial-interglacial timescales.\nThe key sources of iron for the Southern Ocean are reported to be windblown dust and sedimentary supply; their relative significance an issue of much long-standing debate. Links between aeolian dust fluxes to the Southern Ocean and to the Antarctic ice cores have been proposed for the Scotia Sea region of the Southern Ocean, downwind from the South American land mass. Regional downcore variations in the magnetic susceptibility of sediments from the Scotia Sea show remarkable similarity to variations in dust concentration and flux in East Antarctic ice cores (with glacial stages characterised by increases in ice dust and sediment magnetic susceptibility). Indeed, the strength of the ice dust/sediment magnetism correlations (r ~ 0.7) provides a pragmatic basis for use of the sedimentary magnetic susceptibility records as a chronostratigraphic proxy, a boon in the carbonate-free deep-sea sediments of the Southern Ocean.\nHowever, the source and causal basis of the sediment magnetism/ice dust co-variations remain controversial; aeolian dust, bacterial magnetite and wind-driven current transport of marine sediment have all been invoked as possible key sources. Here, we use magnetic and isotopic methods to resolve this debate, and identify and quantify the sources of magnetic material to the Scotia Sea for the last glacial cycle.",

Detailed understanding of the causal links between PM exposure and specific health impacts, and possible means to reduce PM exposure require knowledge of PM concentrations, compositions and sources at the fine-scale; i.e. beyond the current resolution of spatially-sparse conventional PM monitoring, non-unique elemental analyses, or poorly-validated PM modelling.\nMagnetically-ordered iron oxide minerals appear to be a ubiquitous component of urban PM. These minerals derive partly from the presence of iron impurities in fuels, which form, upon combustion, a non-volatile residue, often dominated by magnetite, within glassy, spherical condensates. Iron-rich, magnetic PM also arises from abrasion from vehicle components, including disk brakes, and road dust. The ubiquity and diversity of these magnetic PM phases, and the speed and sensitivity of magnetic analyses (down to trace concentrations), makes possible rapid, cost-effective magnetic characterization and quantification of PM, a field of study which has developed rapidly across the globe over the last 2 decades.\nMagnetic studies of actively-sampled PM, on filters, and passively-sampled PM, on tree leaves and other depositional surfaces, can be used to: monitor and map at high spatial resolution ambient PM concentrations; address the controversial issue of the efficacy of PM capture by vegetation; and add a new, discriminatory dimension to PM source apportionment.",

            "abstract": "The nature of how anaerobic microbes have come to distribute themselves within Earth’s crust is an ecologic question that must be posed subject to the laws of thermodynamics, but a question that cannot be understood in light of thermodynamics alone. We use here the results of theory and quantitative modeling, field observations, and long-term laboratory experiments to argue that subsurface communities are composed of groups of microbes that cooperate as well as compete, and whose existence reflects a tight balance between reproduction and cell death.\nThe most significant functional groups colonizing the anoxic crust, classified by electron accepting process, are the methanogens, sulfate reducers, and ferric iron reducers. An anaerobe can harvest the energy it needs to live and reproduce only to the extent that energy available to it in the environment exceeds the cell’s internal levels. When methanogens transfer or dismutate electrons, they capture little energy, so as to preserve a thermodynamic drive for their catabolic reaction. In this way, they maximize their environmental range, but grow slowly. Sulfate reducers adopt a different strategy, striving to capture energy quickly and grow rapidly. Iron reduction consumes acid, so the energy available to iron reducers varies sharply with pH. The iron reducers can grow rapidly under acidic conditions, but an alkaline environment may leave them insufficient energy to live.\nMethane producers are vulnerable to exclusion in the subsurface, as is broadly appreciated, but not because of energetic limitations. Instead, the methanogens require abundant energy substrates in order to reproduce quickly enough to replace cells as they die. Sulfate reducers and iron reducers, instead of working to exclude each other by competing for limited energy sources, as is commonly believed, thrive in mutualistic communities. The three functional groups by necessity compete in their environments for limited sources of energy, but the manner in which the groups have come to colonize the subsurface is richer and more nuanced than can be explained by competition alone.",

            "abstract": "The earth’s surface is tightly coupled to the global climate system by the vertical exchange of energy and matter. Thus, to better understand and potentially predict changes to our climate system, it is critical to quantify the surface-atmosphere exchange of heat, water vapor, and greenhouse gases on climate-relevant spatial and temporal scales. Currently, most flux observations consist of ground-based, continuous but local measurements. These provide a good basis for temporal integration, but may not be representative of the larger regional context. This is particularly true for the Arctic, where site selection is additionally bound by logistical constraints, among others. Airborne measurements can overcome this limitation by covering distances of hundreds of kilometers over time periods of a few hours. The Airborne Measurements of Methane Fluxes (AIRMETH) campaigns are designed to quantitatively and spatially explicitly address this issue: The research aircraft POLAR 5 is used to acquire thousands of kilometers of eddy-covariance flux data. During the AIRMETH-2012 and AIRMETH-2013 campaigns we measured the turbulent exchange of energy, methane, and (in 2013) carbon dioxide over the North Slope of Alaska, USA, and the Mackenzie Delta, Canada. Here, we present the potential of environmental response functions (ERFs) for quantitatively linking flux observations to meteorological and biophysical drivers in the flux footprints. We use wavelet transforms of the original high-frequency data to improve spatial discretization of the flux observations. This also enables the quantification of continuous and biophysically relevant land cover properties in the flux footprint of each observation. A machine learning technique is then employed to extract and quantify the functional relationships between flux observations and the meteorological and biophysical drivers. The resulting ERFs are used to extrapolate fluxes over spatio-temporally explicit grids of the study area. The presentation will focus on 2012 sensible and latent heat fluxes observed over the North Slope of Alaska and the scaling performance of the ERF approach.",

            "abstract": "The present study has examined the behavior of extreme high and low temperatures in Euirope since the mid-20th century, in terms of the ratio of number of days per year with record Tmax and record Tmin. The investigations have shown that there has been a clear and massive increase in the number of high Tmax: low Tmin ratios in the most recent decade of the 1951-2013 temperature record for 30 selected observation stations in Europe. This sharp increase is seen to occur despite an apparent hiatus – or at least a reduction in the rate of warming – since the early 2000s, as observed not only in Europe but on a hemispheric basis too. The «explosion» of record high:record low temperature ratios since 2000, despite relatively small increases in mean temperatures in the last 10-15 years of the observational record, can be explained by a non-linear (quadratic) relation between mean temperatures and the Tmax:Tmin record ratios. It is suggested here that the increases are probably a consequence of increasing dryness during the summer in the Mediterranean region (where today there are on average 30 more dry days than in the 1950s), and a reduction in the cold season conducive to snow days in Arctic summers and Northern European springs (with up to 40 days less freezing days than 60 years previously). Both effects can serve to amplify positive temperature feedbacks in the lower atmosphere that result in strong increases in the number of Tmax record high temperatures and correspondingly strong reductions in the number of Tmin record low temperatures.",

While seasonal predictability is often very limited by physical and modeling constraints, harnessing additional predictable components of the climate system may in some cases substantially increase their usable information content, and provide more flexible forecasts in terms of the kinds of management decisions that can be informed.\nHere we present an example of combining season and year-ahead streamflow forecasts as input to a multi-use reservoir optimization model, applied to the Bhakra Dam in NW India. Bi-timescale forecasts are made with a seasonal periodic autoregressive (PAR) model with exogenous climate-forecast inputs, together with an annual PAR model fit to observed flows used as a baseline for year-ahead forecasts. Annual net revenue from irrigation and hydropower supplies are calculated with contracts optimized using the reservoir optimization model. With Bhakra Dam inflows deriving from both winter storms/snow melt and the summer monsoon, it is found that net annual revenue is maximized when new contracts are initiated in March and June. We explore various choices of PARX model seasonal predictors based on climate model output and data and show that, with the choice of a good start date, even forecasts with relatively low skill can have value.",

For example, Brownian motion is often used to model diffusion in complex pore networks, and Gillespie-type algorithms allow one to handle multicomponent chemical reactions with uncertain reaction pathways. Yet such models can be computationally more intensive than their continuum-scale counterparts, e.g., advection-dispersion-reaction equations. Combining the discrete and continuum models has a potential to resolve the quantity of interest with a required degree of physicochemical granularity at acceptable computational cost. We present computational examples of such “hybrid models” and discuss the challenges associated with coupling these two levels of description.",

The non-thermal line broadening is proportional to the amplitude of Alfvenic waves. Using a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) magnetic field model, we trace the evolution of line widths along inferred magnetic field lines. In order to mitigate line of sight effects, we select regions that are isothermal and where the field lines remain oriented close to perpendicular to the line of sight. Our results indicate that the waves are damped starting at a height that is positively correlated with the overall length of the loop. That is, for longer loops, the damping occurs starting at a larger height. This suggests that heating of quiet Sun loops occurs over a region centered on the loop top and extends over a large fraction of the loop. We estimate that there is enough energy flux in waves injected at the base of quiet Sun regions to account for coronal heating in such structures.",

            "abstract": "Landfill methane emissions are difficult to estimate due to limited observation and uncertainty of the data. The tracer dilution method is a widely used approach that uses a tracer gas released at a known rate from one or more point sources, and the ratio of the concentration of tracer gas to concentration of methane measured at a downwind point is used to calculate the methane emissions rate. Here we use a high-resolution atmospheric model to examine the set-up of the tracer dilution method and its effects on the accuracy of methane emissions calculations. This method relies on optimal weather conditions and is limited by availability of locations where downwind measurements can be taken. Therefore using limited measurements taken with this method to estimate annual landfill emissions will yield totals of dubious accuracy.\nThe Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is a mesoscale meteorological model that is commonly used for atmospheric research as well as operational forecasts. Here, a scalar tracking subroutine is added to WRF to simulate the methane emissions from the surface of the landfill and the tracer gas from point sources. Using this model, many different tracer release configurations (number and placement of tracer release points and downwind measurement locations) are simulated and compared. Wind speed dependence of methane emissions is examined by prescribing surface flux as a function of local wind speed. The tracer dilution method can only collect landfill emissions data during ideal weather conditions, so modeling emissions during non-ideal conditions will give a better idea of how to predict total annual emissions taking into account the emissions on days when emissions cannot accurately be measured. The WRF output is compared to output of an analogous model adapted from the existing atmospheric model Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and to observation data from Sandtown Landfill in Delaware, USA. Future work includes adding methane transport to the soil model component of WRF to gain a more accurate understanding of diurnal and seasonal variations in methane emissions.",

            "abstract": "Adequate knowledge and prediction of mechanical properties of shale are pivotal to the design of hydraulic fractures. The urgent technical challenge of such an endeavor is how to translate the highly heterogeneous nature of shale into a predictive model of the mechanical properties. Our group addressed this challenge by adopting a combined experimental and numerical approach to investigate fracture processes and failure mechanisms of shale.\nLattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), having shown superior capabilities in predicting qualitative and quantitative behavior of concrete and concrete-like materials, as shown in Fig. 1, has been adopted to simulate mesoscale behavior of shale. The polyhedral cell system defining the geometric attributes of the rock microstructure is built via a 3D tessellation procedure based on X-ray microtomography results of microstructure and grain size distribution of shale specimens. The adopted tessellation procedure makes use of well-established packing algorithms for no-contact spherical particle placement and non-overlapping volume tessellation. The polyhedral particles interact through triangular facets where appropriate measure of stresses and strains are defined. Especially, LDPM is extended to simulate transversely isotropic materials by using orientation-dependent and strain-dependent strength limits coupled with orientation-dependent normal and shear stiffnesses on each facet. Appropriate interface constitutive equations are formulated to simulate all phenomena occurring at a scale that is smaller than the resolution of LDPM system, including microscopic fracture, frictional contact, particle breakage, pore collapse, and distributed damage. Bedding planes and natural joints are characterized by greatly decreased strength limits for facets within that region.\nTo calibrate/validate the LDPM model, microscopic and mesoscopic experiments, including Brazilian tests, uniaxial compression tests, and three point-bending tests, are conducted on grey shale and Marcellus black shale specimensto study their mechanical properties, as shown in Fig. 2.",

This can be mitigated by the use of longer wavelength instruments and time series techniques, but measurement remains a challenge particularly in areas where the deformation rates are low. Here we discuss techniques developed to work with low coherence data in a project to measure sub-island scale subsidence rates across the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta using SBAS processing of L-band UAVSAR data collected between July 2009 and February 2014. Determination of rates in this area is particularly valuable because of the Delta’s critical importance as a water resource for the State of California and as an enormously productive estuarine ecosystem. Subsidence across the region has left most of the man-made islands below mean sea level and the levees maintaining their integrity are subject to a wide range of threats, including failure during earthquakes on the nearby Hayward and San Andreas fault.\nThis research was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

This ensures that information on provenance, processing, modelling and inversion is systematically archived, thus facilitating reproducibility. Furthermore, tools for automised window selection, misfit measurements and input file generation for various forward solvers are provided.\nTo enhance resolution in regions poorly covered by earthquake data, we incorporate ambient noise correlations in the inversion. Since correlations are affected by the distribution of noise sources, we only measure the more robust traveltime differences of narrow-band surface waves; disregarding waveform details that would be exploitable in the case of earthquake data.\nTo quantify resolution of full waveform inversion models at minimal computational cost, we employ a newly developed stochastic sampling technique that extracts various resolution proxies from the Hessian through the application of quasi-random test models.\nThe Western Mediterranean serves as the real-data testing ground for our developments. Data from the IberArray project combined with noise and earthquake recordings from nearly 1000 stations throughout Europe provide exceptional coverage. Embedded within a multi-scale model of the Globe, our tomographic images provide a detailed snapshot of Western Mediterranean geodynamics, including, for instance, the lateral extent and fine-scale details of subducted lithospheric slabs in the region.",

Soil erosion induces a substantially lateral redistribution of soil organic carbon ranging from 0.64 to 1.04 Pg C yr-1. The erosion-induced carbon flux ranges from a 0.19 Pg C yr-1 source to a 0.24 Pg C yr-1 carbon sink in the terrestrial ecosystem, which is comparable to the total carbon budget of China (0.19 to 0.26 Pg yr-1).

            "abstract": "The MISMIP and MISMIP3D marine ice sheet model intercomparison exercises have become popular benchmarks, and several modeling groups have used them to show how their models compare to both analytical results and other models. Both sets of experiments studied grounding line migration in response to changes to (in effect) properties of the grounded ice, either perturbations to the basal traction coefficient (C), or to ice softness (A). In particular, both exercises concluded that careful treatment of the grounding line was required in numerical models, either through fine resolution (typically better than 1 km), or higher order methods, or modifications to the discretization scheme.\nGiven the success of these experiments, we propose a sequel. Like MISMIP3D, the experiments take place in a idealized, three-dimensional setting and compare full 3D (Stokes) and reduced, hydrostatic flow models. Unlike the earlier exercises, the primary focus will be the response of models to changes in ice shelf conditions, especially sub-shelf melting. The chosen configuration features an ice shelf that experiences substantial lateral shear and buttresses the upstream ice, and so is well suited to melting experiments. We also aim to design an experiment in which differences between the steady states of each model are minor compared to the response to melt-rate perturbations, a choice that reflects typical real-world applications where parameters are chosen so that the initial states of all models tend to match observations (and hence each other).\nWe will present the MISMIP+ experiments, and show how results computed with the BISICLES ice sheet model are affected by mesh resolution, choice of flow model, and choice of melt-rate.",

The provinces include western and eastern Anatolia, experiencing extensional and compressional regimes, respectively, and the North Turkish province experiencing strike-slip tectonics associated with the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ). He-isotope compositions display a range of values from 0.27-1.67 Ra for western Anatolia, 0.85-7.76 Ra for eastern Anatolia, and 0.28-2.19 Ra for NAFZ fluids, with δ13C values between -8.04 and +0.35 ‰, -14.59 and +1.30 ‰ , and -1.92 and +1.52‰ , respectively. CO2/3He ratios lie between 1.66x109-2.35x1013, 2.4x105-3.7x1013and 32x109-26x1013for the fluids of western and eastern Anatolia and the NAFZ, respectively. Combined He-CO2 systematics suggest that degassing and preferential CO2 loss significantly affects some samples resulting in the fractionation of elemental CO2/He ratios.Quantitative assessment of the volatile inventory suggests ~97% and 10% mantle-derived component in the He- and C-inventories, the C-budget being dominated by carbonate contributions in agreement with the composition of basement metamorphics (containing marble) and reservoir lithologies (marble, limestone) in most fields. The highest mantle-He contribution, accompanied by the highest mantle-C, is recorded in eastern Anatolia in the vicinity of the most recently-active Nemrut volcano. Relatively high mantle-He and mantle-C contributions in the Tuzla field of western Anatolia display close spatial association with young, alkaline volcanics. Along the NAFZ, the highest mantle contributions are recorded at the most seismically-active western-central segment. Collectively, these observations suggest the addition of mantle volatiles to crust by young magmatic activities and their transfer to the surface via fault zones of these tectonic provinces.",

            "abstract": "Mercury’s and the Moon exospheres have many common characteristics. They are surface bounded exospheres essentially formed from the interaction of our Sun with their regolith. However, their interaction with their plasma environment and their respective distance to the Sun induce many remarkable discrepancies between these two objects. Mercury’s exosphere is clearly much denser than the Moon’s but remains much more difficult to observe remotely or in situ. Mercury’s intrinsic magnetic field induces a complex and variable interaction between the solar wind and the surface whereas the Moon regularly interacts with various plasma types (solar wind, magnetospheric…). In terms of observables, they are very complementary. Only few exospheric species have been observed so far on both objects despite many attempts, but observations from the Moon surface or very close to it allowed detecting species not yet observed at Mercury. Many features induced by the solar wind interaction with the Moon surface have been identified: as an example the surface charge, the backscattered population, planetary ions and signatures of the long term space weathering of the regolith. All these features are keys to understand the formation and evolution of these exospheres. On the other hand, Mercury’s exosphere is denser and brighter than the Moon’s one. As a consequence, exospheric spatial structures have been identified, in association with the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere or to specific source regions or suggesting some global exospheric dynamic around these objects. It has been also possible to reconstitute their time variations on several time scales, another way to constrain formation and evolution of these objects.\nIn this talk, I will underline what could be common and different on these two objects and will provide few clues how a comparative approach could be helpful to better understand surface bounded exospheres.",

The simulations with and without BC were conducted and the difference between these two runs is the corresponding response due to BC. Both atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model simulation (CGCM with full ocean) and the fixed SST runs (AGCM with prescribed sea surface temperature and sea ice temperature) were used to study the effects from ocean boundary conditions. The regional effects due to BC may be much larger than models have assumed (Andreae and Ramanathan, 2013; Bond et al., 2013). There are many studies used simplified mixed-layer ocean under prescribed surface heat flux to estimate the climate effect of BC (Kim et al., 2014), however these ocean-atmosphere coupled processes act on seasonal and annual time scales more real than non-ocean-atmosphere coupled models. Our results showed that the comprehensively sea-air interaction amplified the heating effect of black carbon aerosols; the presence of BC affected climate not only at local source areas but also at remote regions due to changes on energy transport processes and atmospheric circulations; we also discussed how the feedback of SST induced by BC affected on the distribution and magnitudes of climate response such as temperature, precipitation and cloud coverage between CGCM and AGCM runs.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude regions are experiencing rapid and extensive changes in ecosystem composition and function as the result of increases in average air temperature. Increasing air temperatures have led to widespread thawing and degradation of permafrost, which in turn has affected ecosystems, socioeconomics, and the carbon cycle of high latitudes. Further warming could lead to increasing ground temperatures, thickening active-layers, and accelerated thawing and degradation of permafrost. Despite permafrost’s influence on ecosystem structure and functions, relatively little has been done to quantify permafrost properties across extremely large areas and at high resolutions. Detection and mapping of permafrost are difficult, however, because it is a subsurface condition of the ground, heterogeneous in nature, and largely exists in remote locations. Here we overcome complex interactions among surface and subsurface conditions to map permafrost through empirical modeling approaches that statistically and spatially extend field observations using remotely sensed imagery, climatic data, and thematic maps of a wide range of surface and subsurface biophysical characteristics. The data fusion approach generated high-resolution (30-m pixels) maps of near-surface (within 1 m) permafrost, active-layer thickness, and associated uncertainty estimates throughout most of Alaska. Our calibrated models were then used to quantify changes in permafrost distribution under varying future climate scenarios assuming no other changes in biophysical factors. The mapping of permafrost distribution across Alaska is important for land-use planning, environmental assessments, and a wide-array of geophysical studies.",

            "abstract": "The concept of source scaling is used to determine the source time functions of the three announced nuclear tests of 2006, 2009 and 2013 of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Two explosions at essentially the same source location, but at different times, have scaled source time functions. In an x-y plot of these functions, the ground motion axis (y) and the time axis (x) scale by the same factor, which is the cube-root of the energy ratio. The seismograms from these two events, measured at a given seismometer, share the same path effect, or Earth impulse response. The two seismograms and the scaling law provide three equations that can be solved for the three principal unknowns: the two source time functions and the Earth impulse response. This concept is applied to seismograms recorded at Mudanjiang (MDJ) for the three DPRK events, using two novel steps. First, the spectral ratio of the two source time functions is calculated in the time domain directly from the seismograms. Second, the scale factor is calculated directly from the data. The energy partition is independent of event size. So the ratio of the energies of the P-waves, for example, is equal to the ratio of the source energies. The ratio of the energies of the Pn phase was computed for the 2009 and 2013 events. The scaling factor is the cube-root of this ratio. The source time functions of the 2009 and 2013 events were recovered using the two seismograms and the scaling law, and the seismograms were deconvolved for these source time functions to recover the Earth impulse response. If everything is done correctly the recovered Earth impulse response should be the same for each event. I show that the recovered impulse responses for the 2009 and 2013 events are nearly identical. Presuming the DPRK test site to be in granite, relative reduced displacement potentials for the three events give yields of 0.11, 1.98 and 7.11 kt, with errors up to 46 %.",

The mass balance methods are typically restricted in terms of the area that can be represented (e.g., surface area of weighing lysimeter (LYS) or equivalent representative area of neutron probe (NP) and soil core sampling techniques), and can be biased with respect to ET from the surrounding area. The area represented by flux sensing methods such as eddy covariance (EC) is typically estimated with a flux footprint/source area model. The dimension, position of, and relative contribution of upwind areas within the source area are mainly influenced by sensor height, wind speed, atmospheric stability and wind direction. Footprints for EC sensors positioned several meters above the canopy are often larger than can be economically covered by mass balance methods. Moreover, footprints move with atmospheric conditions and wind direction to cover different field areas over time while mass balance methods are static in space. Thus, EC systems typically sample a much greater field area over time compared with mass balance methods. Spatial variability of surface cover can thus complicate interpretation of flux estimates from EC systems. The most commonly used flux estimation method is EC; and EC estimates of latent heat energy (representing ET) and sensible heat fluxes combined are typically smaller than the available energy from net radiation and soil heat flux (commonly referred to as lack of energy balance closure). Reasons for this are the subject of ongoing research. We compare ET from LYS, NP and EC methods applied to field crops for three years at Bushland, Texas (35° 11’ N, 102° 06’ W, 1170 m elevation above MSL) to illustrate the potential problems with and comparative advantages of all three methods. In particular, we examine how networks of neutron probe access tubes can be representative of field areas large enough to be equivalent in size to EC footprints, and how the ET data from these methods can address bias and accuracy issues.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the continuous volcanic degassing emissions as an important natural source of sulfur-rich gases and aerosols. To investigate the impact of volcanic degassing on atmospheric chemistry and climate forcing, chemical transport models rely on emission inventories compiled from various sources. For example, the emission database from the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AEROCOM) project derives eruptive SO2 emissions from past literature, Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), and limited observations from satellite and in situ instruments. Additionally, for all volcanoes with historic eruptions, AEROCOM simply assigns a constant SO2 degassing rate of 6.2x10-4 kt/day. This rudimentary estimate can lead to large uncertainties in model simulations of the volcanic SO2lifecycle and its impact on the atmospheric composition.\nIn this study, we propose to apply inverse modeling techniques to estimate top-down SO2 emission rates from the Turrialba Volcano (10.025°N, 83.767°W) using in situ SO2 measurements from unmanned aerial systems (UASs) during March 2013. We predict SO2 mixing ratios along the UASs’ flight paths based on the AEROCOM a priori SO2 emission dataset and the atmospheric trajectories and surface influence simulated by the WRF-STILT model. We incorporate a high-resolution (~ 30 m) terrain data into the model in order to account for the effects of the complex orography on the wind conditions near the volcano. The predicted SO2 mixing ratios are compared with measurements in a statistical procedure to minimize the model-data difference thereby yielding improved posterior estimates of volcanic SO2 degassing emission rates. A detailed uncertainty analysis will be conducted during this study taking into account all sources of error in the inverse modeling approach, such as the SO2 measurements, meteorological inputs, model configurations (e.g., spatial resolution, model physics parameterizations), and back trajectory calculations.",

            "abstract": "Karst landscapes are formed by the self-reinforcing dissolution of limestone and other soluble rocks, and these positive feedbacks can create a variety of landforms depending on initial topography, climate, bedrock characteristics, and potentially, the activity of biota. In Big Cypress National Preserve (BICY), a low-relief karst landscape in southwestern FL (USA), depressional wetlands, are interspersed within an upland matrix in a regular pattern. This landscape is characterized by over-dispersion of wetland patches, periodic variation in bedrock depth and soil thickness, and distinct bi-modality of these and other soil properties. We hypothesize that the structure of the BICY landscape reflects the concurrent effects of local positive feedbacks among hydroperiod, vegetation productivity and bedrock dissolution; these local processes may ultimately be constrained by landscape scale limitations of water volume. We further hypothesize that low relief and shallow water tables are essential boundary conditions for the emergence of regular patterning of wetlands. To explore these hypotheses, we have developed a quasi-spatial model of a single nascent wetland and its catchment, where the expansion of the wetland basin is driven by acidity associated with belowground root production and aquatic metabolism and their effects on carbonate mineral dissolution, and by the lateral and vertical discharge of water between wetlands and bedrock porosity. This model can, depending on boundary conditions, recreate a range of karst features, including vertical dissolution holes, extensive wetlands that overtake the entire basin, or smaller wetlands whose size equilibrates at a small proportion of the catchment area. This last endpoint, a landform similar to those observed in BICY, occurs only in response to relatively shallow water tables, limited hydrologic inputs, and strong positive feedbacks of biotic activity on dissolution.",

            "abstract": "Root water uptake (RWU) affects underground water dynamics, with consequences on plant water availability and groundwater recharge. Even though hydrological and climate models are sensitive to RWU parameters, no consensus exists on the modelling of this process. Back in the 1940ies, Van Den Honert’s catenary approach was the first to investigate the use of connected hydraulic resistances to describe water flow in whole plants. However concerns such as the necessary computing when architectures get complex made this approach premature.\nNow that computing power increased dramatically, hydraulic RWU models are gaining popularity, notably because they naturally produce observed processes like compensatory RWU and hydraulic redistribution. Yet major concerns remain. Some are more fundamental: according to hydraulic principles, plant water potential should equilibrate with soil water potential when the plant does not transpire, which is not a general observation when using current definitions of bulk or average soil water potential. Other concerns regard the validation process: water uptake distribution is not directly measurable, which makes it hard to demonstrate whether or not hydraulic models are more accurate than other models. Eventually parameterization concerns exist: root hydraulic properties are not easily measurable, and would even fluctuate on an hourly basis due to processes like aquaporin gating.\nWhile offering opportunities to validate hydraulic RWU models, newly developed observation techniques also make us realize the increasing complexity of processes involved in soil-plant hydrodynamics, such as the change of rhizosphere hydraulic properties with soil drying. Surprisingly, once implemented into hydraulic models, these processes do not necessarily translate into more complex emerging behavior at plant scale, and might justify the use of simplified representations of the soil-plant hydraulic system.",

            "abstract": "Modern topsoils, as well as many paleosols, display enhanced induced magnetizations compared to their parent materials. Such enhanced magnetism has been successfully correlated with local Mean Annual Rainfall (MAR), but a generally applicable deduction of MAR from magnetic properties remains difficult to establish. In fact, there are enough cases of observed departures from the above model to warrant a number of provisos that require knowledge of variability in parent material character, precipitation minus evaporation, and perhaps other local data. Another problem is that we lack the knowledge to construct a forward model that proceeds from fundamental parameters like mineralogy, particle size, non-stoichiometry and structural defects. Increasing knowledge about iron oxide, oxyhydroxide and sulfide nanoparticles, likely first stages of parent material alteration, should help in constructing competing forward models as defined above.\nIn this talk we try to learn from observed magnetic behavior of fully characterized synthetic ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite, their alteration to second phases such as goethite, magnetite, maghemite and hematite, as well as further alterations of some secondary phases to more stable ones. We find that the multiple pathways of alteration depend on structural order, impurities, non-stoichiometry and kinetic stability of end products. By ranking the effects of these parameters, we can try to modify current forward models of alteration based on thermodynamic stability of iron oxides in parent materials. The ultimate goal should be to determine degrees of confidence in our claims of past climatic or environmental conditions.",

In order to understand the relationship between climate processes in the source areas and the properties of aerosols at distant receptor sites, we must be able to identify the source provenance of dust. Here we present a multiproxy study that characterizes the temporal variability in the geochemical composition of long-range African dust (LRAD) collected between 2003 and 2011 in the trade winds on the Caribbean island of Barbados. We find systematic differences between Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic composition and rare earth element anomalies of individual dust events and evidence of seasonal shifts in dust source activity and transport. These results indicate that coherent geochemical source signatures of LRAD can be preserved even after transport across thousands of kilometers. We investigated the possibility of identifying the potential source areas through comparisons with literature data. However, these data are almost entirely based on measurements of soil and sediment samples; this could lead to biases because of soil-aerosol particle size and composition differences. Nonetheless, our data suggest that many samples are linked to sources in Mali and sub-Saharan regions. Radiogenic Nd-Hf composition of aerosols can potentially be a useful proxy to study the proximity of mineral dust sources to depositional sites. In order to establish firmer links between LRAD and dust source areas, however, we require much more data on the geochemical composition of aerosols from potential source areas in North Africa.",

            "abstract": "The He-band electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are studied using our global model of ring current (RC) ions, electric field, plasmasphere, and EMIC waves. In contrast to the approach by Gamayunov et al. [2009], however, we do not use the bounce-averaged kinetic equation for waves but instead use a complete, non bounce-averaged, equation to model EMIC wave power spectral density. The major results of our study can be summarized as follows. (1) The thermal background level for EMIC waves is too low to allow waves to grow up to the observable level during one pass between the “bi-ion latitudes” (the latitudes where the given wave frequency is equal to the O+-He+ bi-ion frequency) in conjugate hemispheres. As a consequence, quasi-field-aligned EMIC waves are not typically produced in the model if the thermal background level is used, but routinely observed in the Earth’s magnetosphere. To overcome this model-observation discrepancy we suggest a nonlinear energy cascade from the lower frequency range of ULF waves into the frequency range of EMIC wave generation as a possible mechanism supplying the needed level of seed fluctuations that guarantees growth of EMIC waves during one pass through the near equatorial region. The EMIC wave development from a suprathermal background level shows that EMIC waves are quasi-field-aligned near the equator, while they are oblique at high latitudes, and the Poynting flux is predominantly directed away from the near equatorial source region in agreement with observations. (2) An abundance of O+ strongly controls the energy of oblique He-band EMIC waves that propagate to the equator after their reflection at “bi-ion latitudes”, and so it controls a fraction of wave energy in the oblique normals. (3) The RC O+ not only causes damping of the He-band EMIC waves but also causes wave generation in the region of highly oblique wave normal angles, typically for θ > 82o, where a growth rate γ > 10-2 rad/s is frequently observed. The instability is driven by the loss-cone feature in the RC O+ distribution function. (4) The oblique and intense He-band EMIC waves generated by RC O+ in the region L~2-3 may have an implication to the energetic particle loss in the inner radiation belt.

            "abstract": "One of the key issues in landslide modeling is to define the appropriate rheological behavior of these natural granular flows. In particular the description of the static and of the flowing states of granular media is still an open issue. This plays a crucial role in erosion/deposition processes. A first step to address this issue is to derive models able to reproduce laboratory experiments of granular flows.\nWe propose here a mechanical and numerical model of dry granular flows that quantitatively well reproduces granular column collapse over inclined planes, with rheological parameters directly derived from the laboratory experiments. We reformulate the so-called μ(I) rheology proposed by Jop et al. (2006) where I is the so-called inertial number in the framework of Drucker-Prager plasticity with yield stress and a viscosity η(||D||, p) depending on both the pressure p and the norm of the strain rate tensor ||D||. The resulting dynamic viscosity varies from very small values near the free surface and near the front to 1.5 Pa.s within the quasi-static zone. We show that taking into account a constant mean viscosity during the flow (η = 1 Pa.s here) provides results very similar to those obtained with the variable viscosity deduced from the μ(I) rheology, while significantly reducing the computational cost. This has important implication for application to real landslides and rock avalanches.\nThe numerical results show that the flow is essentially located in a surface layer behind the front, while the whole granular material is flowing near the front where basal sliding occurs. The static/flowing interface changes as a function of space and time, in good agreement with experimental observations. Heterogeneities are observed within the flow with low and high pressure zones, localized small upward velocity zones and vortices near the transition between the flowing and static grains. These instabilities create 'sucking zones' and have some characteristics similar to experimental observations. They may play a crucial role in erosion processes by helping extracting material from erodible beds.\nP. Jop, Y. Forterre, and O. Pouliquen, 2006, Nature 441, 727-730.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, diffusion chronometers have evolved from a niche tool into one of routine application, with more practitioners, new tools and increasingly large datasets. As we expand the horizons of diffusional geochronometry, it is worth taking stock of developments in methodologies and data acquisition, and taking time to revisit the underpinnings of the technique. Data collected as part of recent projects on Campi Flegrei, the Bishop Tuff and Fimmvörðuháls–Eyjafjallajökull are here used to investigate the initial state assumption, an absolutely vital aspect underpinning most diffusional work and one that is rarely evaluated despite its fundamental importance. To illustrate the nature of the problem we consider two widely-used element-mineral systems for felsic and mafic systems, respectively.\nFirst, barium and strontium profiles within sanidine crystals, modelled independently, can give strongly contrasting timescales from the same crystal zone. We can reconcile the datasets only for a situation where the initial boundary within the crystal was not a sharp step function, but relatively fuzzy before diffusion onset. This fuzziness effectively starts both chronometers off with an apparent, and false, pre-existing timescale, impacting the slower-diffusing barium much more strongly than the faster-diffusing strontium, yielding thousands of years of non-existent diffusion history. By combining both elements, a starting width of tens of microns can be shown, shortening the true diffusive timescales from tens of thousands of years to hundreds.\nSecond, in olivine, we encounter different growth-related problems. Here, Fe-Mg interdiffusion occurs at a rate comparable to growth, with the compound nature of zonation making it difficult to extract the diffusion component. This requires a treatment of changing boundary conditions and sequential growth to generate the curvature seen in natural data, in order to recover timescales for anything but the outermost crystal zones with a high degree of confidence.\nDiffusion methods continue to drive our understanding of short-timescale processes in volcanic systems, with faster and better techniques, but as this study indicates, the initial state assumption for each timescale must be well-constrained for the value of those advances to be fully realised.",

The LAI in this study was measured by Leica ScanStation C 10 Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) and a hand-held Li-Cor LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer for understanding differences derived from the two sensors. A total of six different LAI estimates were generated using different methods for the comparisons. The results suggested that there was a reasonable agreement (i.e., correlations r > 0.50) considering a total of 30 plots and use of very different in situ foliage measurements. . The predicted LAI from spectral vegetation indices including WDVI, DVI, NDVI, SAVI, and PVI3 which were derived from Landsat TM imagery were used to identify statistical relationships and for the development of the Bayesian inference model. The Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) approach was used to scale up LAI estimates and to produce continuous field surfaces for the Oak Openings Region in NW Ohio. The results from the BLR provided details about the parameter uncertainties but also insight about the potential that different LAIs can be used to predict foliage that has been adjusted by removing the wooden biomass with reasonable accuracy. For instance, the modeled residuals associated with the LAI estimates from TLS orthographic projection that consider only foliage had the lowest overall model uncertainty with lowest error and residual dispersion range among the six spatial LAI estimates. The deviation from the mean LAI prediction map derived from the six estimates hinted that sparse and open areas that relate to vegetation structure were associated with the highest error. However, although in many studies TLS has been shown to hold a great potential for quantifying vegetation structure, in this study the quantified relationship between LAI and the vegetation indices did not yield any statistical relationship that needs to be further explored.",

            "abstract": "Solar radio emission, produced by energetic electrons in the low-beta solar corona, is highly dependent on coronal magnetic field strength and direction, hence offering a rich potential for constraining coronal magnetic fields. However, the observed radio intensity is contributed by several different emission mechanisms and moreover, is known to be sensitive to parameters other than the magnetic field, such as the electron distribution function. Collectively, they introduce ambiguities that are difficult to resolve in the absence of high-quality, broadband radio dynamic imaging spectroscopic observations with sufficiently high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Such observations have not been possible until very recently, thanks to the newly developed radio instruments such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA). In this talk, we will present first results obtained from the Jansky VLA demonstrating their ability of constraining the coronal magnetic fields in active regions. We will also introduce a forward-modeling tool currently under development, which can be used to reconstruct the 3D coronal magnetic fields based on the newly available radio observations.",

            "abstract": "With continuous, freely available moderate-resolution imagery of the Earth’s surface available, and with the promise of more imagery to come, change detection based on continuous process models continues to be a major area of research. One such method, exponentially weighted moving average change detection (EWMACD), is based on a mixture of harmonic regression (HR) and statistical quality control, a branch of statistics commonly used to detect aberrations in industrial and medical processes. By using HR to approximate per-pixel seasonal curves, the resulting residuals characterize information about the pixels which stands outside of the periodic structure imposed by HR. Under stable pixels, these residuals behave as might be expected, but in the presence of changes (growth, stress, removal), the residuals clearly show these changes when they are used as inputs into an EWMA chart. In prior work in Alabama, USA, EWMACD yielded an overall accuracy of 85% on a random sample of known thinned stands, in some cases detecting thinnings as sparse as 25% removal. It was also shown to correctly identify the timing of the thinning activity, typically within a single image date of the change. The net result of the algorithm was to produce date-by-date maps of afforestation and deforestation on a variable scale of severity. In other research, EWMACD has also been applied to detect land use and land cover changes in central Java, Indonesia, despite the heavy incidence of clouds and a monsoonal climate. Preliminary results show that EWMACD accurately identifies land use conversion (agricultural to residential, for example) and also identifies neighborhoods where the building density has increased, removing neighborhood vegetation. In both cases, initial results indicate the potential utility of EWMACD to detect both gross and subtle ecosystem disturbance, but further testing across a range of ecosystems and disturbances is clearly warranted.",

            "abstract": "Climate variability has been associated with a range of societal and individual outcomes including migration, violent conflict, changes in labor productivity, and health impacts. Some of these may be direct responses to changes in mean temperature or precipitation or extreme events, such as displacement of human populations by tropical cyclones. Others may be mediated by a variety of biological, social, or ecological factors such as migration in response to long-term changes in crops yields. Research is beginning to elucidate and distinguish the many channels through which climate variability may influence human behavior (ranging from the individual to the collective, societal level) in order to better understand how to improve resilience in the face of current variability as well as future climate change. Using a variety of data sets from South Africa, we show how climate variability has influenced internal (within country) migration in recent history. We focus on South Africa as it is a country with high levels of internal migration and dramatic temperature and precipitation changes projected for the 21st century. High poverty rates and significant levels of rain-fed, smallholder agriculture leave large portions of South Africa’s population base vulnerable to future climate change. In this study, we utilize two complementary statistical models - one micro-level model, driven by individual and household level survey data, and one macro-level model, driven by national census statistics. In both models, we consider the effect of climate on migration both directly (with gridded climate reanalysis data) and indirectly (with agricultural production statistics). With our historical analyses of climate variability, we gain insights into how the migration decisions of South Africans may be influenced by future climate change. We also offer perspective on the utility of micro and macro level approaches in the study of climate change and human migration.",

            "abstract": "Halogen activation – the conversion of relatively inert sea-salt derived halides, into reactive halogen species – has significant implications for perturbing the oxidative capacity of the boundary layer, as well as for mercury oxidation. Developing a good, mechanistic understanding of halogen activation chemistry – and particularly its pH dependence – requires knowledge of surface pH. Here we described the development and use of a surface-sensitive spectroscopic approach to investigate pH at frozen surfaces. The approach, which involves glancing-angle laser-induced fluorescence in conjunction with pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes (acridine and harmine), was used to study pH at frozen surfaces following the deposition of gas phase acids or bases. We demonstrate that frozen ‘pure water’ and frozen ‘salt water’ surfaces exhibit different responses. The responses are consistent with the presence of a chemically unique, disordered region at the frozen ‘pure water’ surface and the presence of liquid brine at the frozen ‘salt water’ surface. Significantly, we show that a frozen sea water surface is resistant to changes in pH, suggesting that some buffering capacity is maintained upon freezing. Finally the pH dependence of bromine and chlorine activation from artificial saline snow is presented. Bromine release is found to depend less strongly on pre-freezing snow pH, but the release of both species is favoured for low pre-freezing pH values. In the context of these pH and halogen activation studies, the potential importance of various frozen sea ice substrates for promoting halogen activation chemistry will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The spectral turbulence model of Lorenz, as modified for surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics by Rotunno and Snyder, is further modified to more smoothly approach nonlinear saturation. This model is used to investigate error growth starting from different distributions of the initial error. Consistent with an often overlooked finding by Lorenz, the loss of predictability generated by initial errors of small but fixed absolute magnitude is essentially independent of their spatial scale when the background saturation kinetic energy spectrum is proportional the -5/3 power of the wavenumber. Thus, because the background kinetic energy increases with scale, very small relative errors at long wavelengths have similar impacts on perturbation error growth as large relative errors at short wavelengths. To the extent that this model applies to practical meteorological forecasts, the influence of initial perturbations generated by butterflies would be swamped by unavoidable tiny relative errors in the large scales.\nThe rough applicability of our modified spectral turbulence model to the atmosphere over scales ranging between 10 km and 1000 km is supported by the good estimate it provides for the ensemble error growth in state-of-the-art ensemble mesoscale-model simulations of two winter storms. The initial error spectrum for the ensemble perturbations in these cases has maximum power at the longest wavelengths. The dominance of large-scale errors in the ensemble suggests that mesoscale weather forecasts may often be limited by errors arising from the large-scales instead of being produced solely through an upscale cascade from the smallest scales. These results imply the predictability of small-scale features in the vicinity of topography may be shorter than currently supposed.",

First, we model county level yields as a function of rainfall and temperature during a time period of increased regional warming and drying (1983-2011). Our goal is to determine if maize yields have become more or less sensitive to rainfall during this period and if this sensitivity varies over Kenyan growing regions. Then we analyze a panel dataset (2000 and 2004) with geo-coded measurements of individual farm plots, inputs and outputs. We construct a series of pseudo-experiments where we examine differences in yields from farmers who experience similar climate treatments but use differing inputs (seeds, fertilizer) and farmers who experience differing climate treatments but use similar inputs. This approach allows us to explore if different farming strategies can mitigate the potential negative effects that climate change may have on maize yields. We close with a discussion on the implications for food security and the potential trade-offs between expansion versus intensification of agricultural land in the region.",

            "abstract": "Turbulent entrainment in the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer and its interaction with other local processes like radiative or evaporative cooling still remains a source of uncertainty in current atmospheric models. This uncertainty is often due to a lack of understanding of those small-scale processes, and not only to the way we parameterize their effect in the different models. In this work, we investigate the interaction at the cloud top between the buoyancy reversal caused by evaporative cooling and the vertical shear of a horizontal wind. We focus on the entrainment zone, a region of the order of a few tens of meters, and, as a tool, we use direct numerical simulation to remove the uncertainty associated with turbulence models. While buoyancy reversal, when acting alone, is too weak to affect significantly the large-scale dynamics of the boundary layer, we find that the enhancement of mixing by local wind shear can render buoyancy reversal comparable to other forcing mechanisms, like long-wave radiative cooling. However, we also find that (i) the velocity increment across the capping inversion needs to be relatively large and typical values of about 1 m s-1 associated with the large-scale convective motions inside the boundary layer are generally too small, and (ii) there is no indication of a runaway instability that breaks up the cloud in a relatively short time (the so-called cloud-top entrainment instability). To obtain these results, parametrizations of the mean entrainment velocity and the relevant time scales are derived from the study of the cloud-top vertical structure, and expressed in terms of the velocity and buoyancy increments across the cloud top, and the buoyancy reversal parameters. Particularized to the first research flight of the Second Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS-II) field campaign, the analysis predicts an entrainment velocity of about 3 mm s-1 after 5-10 minutes, a velocity comparable to the measurements and thus indicative of the relevance of mean shear in that case.",

            "abstract": "The lower Paleozoic Elk Creek carbonatite is a 6-8 kilometer diameter intrusive complex buried under 200 meters of sedimentary rocks in southeastern Nebraska. It hosts the largest known niobium deposit in the U.S. and a rare earth element (REE) deposit. The carbonatite is composed of several lithologies, the relations of which are poorly understood. Niobium mineralization is most enriched within a magnetite beforsite unit, and REE oxides are concentrated in a barite beforsite unit. The carbonatite intrudes Proterozoic country rocks. A high-resolution airborne gravity gradient and magnetic survey was flown over the carbonatite in 2012. The carbonatite is associated with an annular vertical gravity gradient high with a subdued central low, and a central magnetic high surrounded by magnetic field values lower than those over the country rocks. Geophysical, borehole, and physical property data are combined for an interpretation of these signatures. The carbonatite is denser than the country rocks, explaining the gravity gradient high. Most carbonatite lithologies have weaker magnetic susceptibilities than those of the country rocks, explaining why the carbonatite produces a magnetic low at its margin. The primary source of the central magnetic high is interpreted to be mafic rocks that are strongly magnetized and are present in large volumes. Magnetite beforsite is very dense (mean density 3200 kg/m3) and strongly magnetized (median 0.073 SI magnetic susceptibility), producing a gravity gradient high and contributing to the aeromagnetic high. Barite beforsite has physical properties similar to most of the carbonatite volume, making it a poor geophysical target. Geophysical anomalies indicate the presence of dense and strongly magnetized rocks at depths below existing boreholes, either a large volume of magnetite beforsite or another unknown lithology. Studies are underway to investigate possible effects of alteration and magnetic remanence, and to better constrain the 3D distribution of magnetite beforsite.",

The rapid Arctic warming has contributed to dramatic melting of Arctic sea ice and spring snow cover, at a pace greater than simulated by the climate models. These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent events of extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes, including recent severe winters. The possible link between Arctic change and mid-latitude weather can be broadly grouped under three potential dynamical mechanisms—changes in: storm tracks, the jet stream and planetary-waves and their associated energy propagation. I will discuss how less sea ice and increase snow cover separately can force more severe winter weather across the NH continents.

            "abstract": "Hurricane Katrina destroyed more than 200,000 homes and led to massive economic and physical dislocation. Using a panel of tax return data, we provide one of the first comprehensive analyses of the hurricane’s long-term economic impact on its victims. We find small and mostly transitory impacts of the disaster on wages, employment, and total income, even among the worst affected. Remarkably, within a few years, Katrina victims have higher incomes than controls from similar cities that were unaffected by the storm. Withdrawals from retirement accounts offset some of the temporary fall in wages. Finally, there is a short-run spike in marriage and little impact on either divorce or child bearing. These findings suggest that, at least in developed countries like the United States, dislocation is unlikely to be an important component of the social or economic costs of dramatic negative events, such as natural disasters or climate change.",

            "abstract": "High ramp rates and low costs make hydropower an extremely valuable resource for meeting “peak” hourly electricity demands, but dams that employ variable, stop-start reservoir releases can have adverse impacts on downstream riverine ecosystems. In recent years, efforts to mitigate the environmental impacts of hydropower peaking have relied predominantly on the use of ramp rate restrictions, or limits on the magnitude of hour-to-hour changes in reservoir discharge. These restrictions shift some hydropower production away from peak hours towards less valuable off-peak hours and impose a financial penalty on dam owners that is a function of: 1) the “spread” (difference) between peak and off-peak electricity prices; and 2) the total amount of generation shifted from peak to off-peak hours. In this study, we show how variability in both the price spread and reservoir inflows can cause large swings in the financial cost of ramp rate restrictions on a seasonal and annual basis. Of particular interest is determining whether current low natural gas prices (largely attributable to improvements in hydraulic fracturing) have reduced the cost of implementing ramp rate restrictions at dams by narrowing the spread between peak and off-peak electricity prices. We also examine the role that large year-to-year fluctuations in the cost of ramp rate restrictions may play in precluding downstream stakeholders (e.g., conservation trusts) from “purchasing” more natural streamflow patterns from dam owners. In recent years, similar arrangements between conservation trusts and consumptive water users have been put into practice in the U.S. for the purposes of supplementing baseflows in rivers. However, significant year-to-year uncertainty in the size of payments necessary to compensate hydropower producers for lost peaking production (i.e., uncertainty in the cost of ramp rate restrictions) makes transactions that aim to mitigate the environmental impacts of hydropower peaking untenable. In order to reduce this financial uncertainty, we propose the use of “collar” agreements between a downstream stakeholder and a third party insurer that would provide a stable price for parties “buying” more natural flows.",

            "abstract": "The scale of the terrestrial reference frame has generally been determined from the satellite laser ranging (SLR) and very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) techniques. However, there has been a persistent bias of roughly 1.5 ppb in the scale realized by these techniques. While this bias, on the order of 1 cm, might have been within a reasonable uncertainty when ITRF2000 was determined, it seems unlikely that this bias would persist with no significant change for ITRF2005, ITRF2008 and now apparently for ITRF2013. Consequently, it seems worth considering whether there is not a fundamental bias in the definition of these two frames, i.e. in the models that are used to realize these frames. In the case of VLBI, the relativistic ‘consensus model’ adopted in 1991 should be re-examined to be sure some small error was not overlooked. In the case of SLR, the scale is strongly influenced by the adopted value of the Earth’s gravitational constant (GM), which was also determined about the same time. The estimate of GM and the contributions to its uncertainty are re-examined to see how much of the bias between the techniques might be attributed to GM.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) satellite mission has brought us a wealth of information about the Martian magnetic field. Besides determining that Mars currently does not possess an active core field, MGS revealed that Mars contains an unexpectedly wide crustal magnetic field intensity range. In its orbit insertion, MGS performed a series of low altitude passes down to around 100 km above surface. During this mission phase the magnetic field measurements were active. In particular the nighttime low-altitude data are of high interest because they contain minimal noise from solar wind. Since these data only cover a small portion of the planet's surface, to date all Martian crustal magnetic field models blend the highest-quality data with lower quality measurements collected either at higher satellite altitudes or during daytime. In this contribution we present a locally inverted crustal magnetic field model for the Martian South Polar region calculated from only the highest-quality MGS data using locally constructed altitude vector Slepian functions. The South Polar region of Mars contains the southern part of the strongly magnetized Terra Sirenum and the area south of the Tharsis volcanic highland. Besides parts of planetary scale features our area of data coverage also contains local features such as the presumably volcanic Australe Montes and the Prometheus impact crater. These ingredients compose a highly heterogeneous crustal magnetic field. We show that even for our dense low-altitude low-noise data set the inversion for the crustal magnetic field of a weakly magnetized region adjacent to a region containing a strong magnetic field leads to artifacts in the weak region. With our local method we can avoid these artifacts by selecting subregions of roughly homogeneous field intensity and individually invert for crustal magnetic fields from data within only these subregions. This regional and subregional modeling allows us to reveal previously obscured crustal magnetic field features in this dynamic area. Our approach to overcome artifacts due to regional intensity variations is not limited to the Martian South Pole but can help uncover new crustal magnetic field features for any satellite data set over an area of varying magnetic field intensity.",

            "abstract": "Laguna Del Maule (LdM), located on the Andes range crest in central Chile, is one of the most active rhyolite volcanic fields on Earth with 36 post glacial rhyolitic eruptions. Since 2007, LdM has accumulated over 1.8 m of uplift at rates of up to 300 mm per year. We hypothesize that this rapid uplift results from the injection of basaltic magma into the base of a rhyolite chamber. To test this hypothesis we undertook a dynamic gravity study, complimented with CO2 soil gas measurements. We established a 35 station dynamic gravity and differential GPS network around the lake in April 2013 and undertook initial CO2 measurements. We resurveyed the network in January 2014 and expanded the soil gas coverage. From these surveys we calculated 0.134 ± 0.030 mGal residual gravity change (Δg) accompanied by 281 ± 13 mm of uplift over the 10 month period. Statistical tests show that the results of the 2013 and 2014 surveys are different at p < 0.01. The Δg anomaly occupies an area of 5 km x 10 km, oriented E/W, and centred in the south eastern part of the lake, and is coincident with the area of maximum uplift. Gaussian integration of Δg yields an excess mass of ~1.2 x 1011 kg. Assuming a density of 2700 kg/m3 this results in a volume of around 0.044 km3. In the 10 month time interval between surveys the calculated volume change rate was 41 ± 1 m3/s. We examine gravity / height change (Δg/Δh) relationships to determine if changes observed relate soley to increased mass or if density changes are involved.\nIn addition to the Δg and Δh measurements, CO2 soil concentrations of up to 7 % are recorded around the entire lake basin. We will discuss modelling of the Δh and Δg data to explore the geometry and physical parameters of the mass and pressure source and discuss the relationship of CO2 anomalies to these models.",

            "abstract": "Emissions of biological volatile organic compounds (BVOC) have changed in the past millennium due to changes in land use, temperature and CO2 concentrations. A recent model reconstruction of BVOC emissions over the past millennium predicted the changes in the three dominant secondary organic aerosol (SOA) producing BVOC classes (isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes). The reconstruction predicted that in global averages isoprene emissions have decreased (land-use changes to crop/grazing land dominate the reduction), while monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions have increased (temperature increases dominate the increases); however, all three show both increases and decreases in certain regions due to competition between the various influencing factors. These BVOC changes have largely been anthropogenic in nature, and land-use change was shown to have the most dramatic effect by decreasing isoprene emissions.\n\nWe use these modeled estimates of these three dominant BVOC classes' emissions from the years 1000 to 2000 to test the effect of anthropogenic changes to BVOC emissions on SOA formation and global aerosol size distributions using the GEOS-Chem-TOMAS global aerosol microphysics model. With anthropogenic emissions (e.g. SO2, NOx, primary aerosols) held at present day values and BVOC emissions changed from year 1000 to year 2000 values, decreases in the number concentration of particles of size Dp > 80 nm (N80) of >25% in year 2000 relative to year 1000 were predicted in regions with extensive land-use changes since year 1000. This change in N80 was predominantly driven by a shift towards crop/grazing land that produces less BVOC than the natural vegetation. Similar sensitivities to year 1000 vs. year 2000 BVOC emissions exist when anthropogenic emissions are turned off. This large decrease in N80 could be a largely overlooked and important anthropogenic aerosol effect on regional climates.",

Pliocene Southern Ocean dynamics are largely ambiguous, especially at intermediate water depths. However, the intermediate water reconstructions are particularly important since intermediate waters, including Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), may be an important driver in high-low latitude teleconnections. Herein, we present the first Pliocene SST and IWT records from a sediment core in the Southwest Pacific (DSDP 593; 1068m water depth), in the core of modern AAIW.\nBenthic paleotemperature proxies have caveats, including the ‘Carbonate Ion Effect’ on the magnesium to calcium ratio (Mg/Ca) of benthic foraminifera. However, recent studies demonstrated that the infaunal species, Uvigerina peregrina, is carbonate ion independent, affording the use of Mg/CaU.peregrina as a paleotemperature proxy (Elderfield et al., 2010). Our results suggest that Southern Ocean IWT was warmer during the Pliocene than during the Mid- to Late-Pleistocene. The range of IWT values during the Pliocene is nearly as large as the glacial-interglacial-scale IWT changes during the Pleistocene, despite smaller ice volume oscillations suggested by benthic δ18O time series (Lisiecki & Raymo, 2005). Alkenone-derived UK37' data show Pliocene SSTs are also, on average, warmer than those estimated for the Mid- to Late-Pleistocene. Orbital-scale SST changes are evident through the Pliocene, although the range is smaller than during the late Pleistocene. Our data are consistent with modeled SST and IWT reconstructions by Dowsett et al. (2009), but raise questions about the stability or dynamism of Pliocene climate relative to the modern.\n",

A GIS-based logistic regression model was constructed to automatically delineate the spatial distribution of the sapping features over areas occupied by the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS): (1) an inventory was compiled of known locations of sapping features identified either in the field or from satellite datasets (e.g. Orbview-3 and Google Earth Digital Globe imagery); (2) spatial analyses were conducted in a GIS environment and seven geomorphological and geological predisposing factors (i.e. slope, stream density, cross-sectional and profile curvature, minimum and maximum curvature, and lithology) were identified; (3) a binary logistic regression model was constructed, optimized and validated to describe the relationship between the sapping locations and the set of controlling factors and (4) the generated model (prediction accuracy: 90.1%) was used to produce a regional sapping map over the NSAS. Model outputs indicate: (1) groundwater discharge and structural control played an important role in excavating the Saharan natural depressions as evidenced by the wide distribution of sapping features (areal extent: 1180 km2) along the fault-controlled escarpments of the Libyan Plateau; (2) proximity of mapped sapping features to reported paleolake and tufa deposits suggesting a causal effect. Our preliminary observations (from satellite imagery) and statistical analyses together with previous studies in the North Western Sahara Aquifer System (North Africa), Sinai Peninsula, Negev Desert, and The Plateau of Najd (Saudi Arabia) indicate extensive occurrence of sapping features along the escarpments bordering the northern margins of the Saharan-Arabian Desert; these areas share similar hydrologic settings with the NSAS domains and they too witnessed wet climatic periods in the Mid-Late Quaternary.",

The extent to which the crystal morphology in 3D space, the style of zoning (i.e. normal, reverse. Core-rim), the anisotropy of diffusion, and fluxes from the different dimensions affect timescales retrieved from 1D diffusion modeling remains largely unstudied. Here, we examine the influence of crystal shape and zoning style on calculated diffusion times via series of numerical models. Three-dimensional numerical olivines with various habits (spherical, rectangular parallelepiped, and polyhedral) were built and left to diffuse at magmatic temperatures for various durations. To cover a range of potentially magma mixing and crystallization scenarios, the simulations tested six forsterite zoning configurations. We show that even when diffusion anisotropy is corrected for in 1D models, timescales can still vary between 0.2‒10 times the true 3D diffusion time due to crystal shape and sectioning effects. Zoning style is found to only have a significant influence in the case of core-rim zoning configurations. Most of the problems associated with crystal shape and sectioning cannot be corrected empirically, but we highlight how they can be averted by using careful grain selection procedures.",

Although the direct effect of local wind forcing may be neglected in the subtidal along-inlet momentum balance, which is dominated by the pressure gradient, wave radiation stress gradient, and bottom friction, cross-inlet winds may have a significant effect on along-inlet dynamics by driving cross-inlet flows (approximately 0.1 to 0.3 m/s), which can mix lateral and vertical gradients in momentum and water properties.\nNew River Inlet is 1000 m wide at the mouth and tapers to 100 m wide about 1000 m away from the mouth after two sharp 90° bends. Five colocated pressure gages and current profilers were deployed from the shallow (2-3 m water depth) ebb shoal outside the mouth through the deep (5-10 m depth) inlet channel to 200 m beyond the first 90° bend. The inlet is well mixed, and along-inlet tidal currents ranged from +/- 1.5 m/s, offshore significant wave heights from 0.5 to 2.5 m, and wind speeds from 0 to 16 m/s.\nTime series of currents and winds were lowpass-filtered to examine subtidal wind effects. At the first 90° bend, both surface and bottom cross-inlet flows were correlated (r2 = 0.6) with cross-inlet wind velocity. On the shallow ebb shoal, the cross-inlet flows also were correlated with cross-inlet wind velocity (r2 = 0.6). Cross-inlet flows exhibited a two-layer response to the wind inside the inlet and a depth-uniform response outside the mouth. The observations will be used to examine the momentum balance governing temporal and spatial variations in cross-inlet wind effects on inlet circulation.\nFunding provided by the Office of Naval Research, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural intensification in South Asia has resulted in the expansion and intensification of surface irrigation over the 20th century. The most intensively irrigated areas are found in the northern Indian sub-continent, a region important to the onset and development of the South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM). The resulting changes to the surface energy balance could affect the temperature contrasts between the land surface and the equatorial Indian Ocean, potentially altering the SASM circulation. Prior studies note apparent declines in the SASM intensity over the 20th century and focus on how altered surface energy balances impact the rainfall distribution. Here, we use the coupled GISS ModelE-R general circulation model to investigate the impact of intensifying irrigation on the SASM circulation over the 20th century, and the effect of irrigation compared to the impact of increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. We force our simulations with time-varying, historical estimates of irrigation, both alone and with 20th century GHGs forcings. In the irrigation-only experiment, irrigation rates correlate strongly with lower and upper level temperature contrasts between the Indian sub-continent and the Indian Ocean (Pearson’s r=-0.66 and r=-0.46, respectively), important quantities indicating the SASM circulation strength. With GHG forcing, these correlations strengthen: r=-0.72 and r=-0.47 for lower and upper level temperature contrasts, respectively. Under irrigated-only conditions, the mean SASM intensity in the model decreases insignificantly. However, with irrigation and GHG forcing, inter-annual variability of the SASM circulation decreases by ~40%, consistent with trends in reanalysis products. These findings suggest that intensifying irrigation, in concert with increased GHG forcing, can reduce the variability of the simulated SASM circulation and alter the regional moisture transport by limiting the surface warming and reducing land-sea temperature gradients. Currently, irrigation is not generally included as a South Asian, or global, forcing in most climate model simulations or climate change analyses. However, including irrigation may be necessary to accurately simulate the historical trends and interannual variability of the SASM over the last 50 years.",

Studies of the interactions of gas phase organics with bulk condensed phases that are proxies for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and for \"urban grime\" on boundary layer surfaces will be presented. These use a combination of techniques, including attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR) and a flow system coupled to a mass spectrometer. The results of studies of the interactions of gas phase organics with clusters of methanesulfonic acid, amines and water using a flow system combined with measurements of the time dependence of particle size distributions and mass spectrometry will also be described. The outcome of these studies is an improved understanding of how SOA is formed and grows, as well as the heterogeneous chemistry of organics on urban surfaces.",

            "abstract": "The Indonesian archipelago produces large internal tides dissipation in the thermocline. The recent Indonesian Mixing program (INDOMIX) has been designed to quantify this mixing using direct and indirect measure of the mixing.A wide range of values is obtained for dissipation within [10-8, 10-4] W/kg with spots of higher dissipation in the ocean interior correlated with a strong internal tide signal. Deduced Kz values are found between 510-4 to 5 10-1 m2/s, much more higher than open ocean values. Surface mixing, below the base of the mixed layer is found to be very strong above all straits, with values within [10-4, 10-3 m2/s]. Introduced in a model using an adapted parameterisation to the Indonesian archipelago, models show good agreement with the observations, where strong water mass transformation has been previously diagnosed. This additional mixing produce a ~0.5°C surface cooling and reduces by 20% the overlying deep convection. This improves both the amount and structure of the rainfall and weakens the wind convergence relaxes the equatorial Pacific trade winds and strengthens the winds along Java coast. These wind changes causes the thermocline to be deeper in the eastern equatorial Pacific and shallower in the eastern Indian Ocean. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) amplitude is therefore slightly reduced while the Indian Ocean Dipole/Zonal Mode (IODZM) variability increases. IODZM precursors, related to ENSO events the preceding winter in this model, are also shown to be more efficient in promoting an IODZM thanks to an enhanced wind/thermocline coupling. The MJO is also improved in the model.Changes in the coupled system in response tidal mixing are as large as those found when closing the Indonesian Throughflow, emphasizing the key role of IA on the Indo-Pacific climate. This suggests that climate models need to take into account this intensified mixing to properly represent the mean state of the atmosphere and its climate variability.",

            "abstract": "The Wang-Sheeley-Arge(WSA)-Enlil-cone modeling system is used for making routine arrival time forecasts of the Earth-directed “halo” coronal mass ejections (CMEs), since they typically produce the most geoeffective events. A major objective of this work is to better understand the sensitivity of the WSA-Enlil modeling results to input model parameters and how these parameters contribute to the overall model uncertainty and performance. We present ensemble modeling results for a simple halo CME event that occurred on 15 February 2011 and a succession of three halo CME events that occurred on 2-4 August 2011. During this period the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) A and B spacecraft viewed the CMEs over the solar limb, thereby providing more reliable constraints on the initial CME geometries during the manual cone fitting process. To investigate the sensitivity of the modeled CME arrival times to small variations in the input cone properties, for each CME event we create an ensemble of numerical simulations based on multiple sets of cone parameters. We find that the accuracy of the modeled arrival times not only depends on the initial input CME geometry, but also on the reliable specification of the background solar wind, which is driven by the input maps of the photospheric magnetic field. As part of the modeling ensemble, we simulate the CME events using the traditional daily updated maps as well as those that are produced by the Air Force data Assimilative Photospheric flux Transport (ADAPT) model, which provide a more instantaneous snapshot of the photospheric field distribution. For the August 2011 events, in particular, we find that the accuracy in the arrival time predictions also depends on whether the cone parameters for all three CMEs are specified in a single WSA-Enlil simulation. The inclusion/exclusion of one or two of the preceding CMEs affects the solar wind conditions through which the succeeding CME propagates.",

            "abstract": "Arctic surface air temperatures have risen at approximately twice the global rate, generating a range of ecosystem responses and associated climate feedbacks. Well-documented examples include changes in vegetation productivity, fire disturbance, the expansion of woody shrubs into tundra, and associated changes in surface albedo and net surface shortwave radiative forcing. I will briefly review these and other changes across the pan-Arctic domain using a combination of field measurements and satellite remote sensing observations. I will examine the evidence for change that has already occurred and also discuss predictions of likely future ecosystem responses under different climate change scenarios. I will identify research and data needs that would help to resolve discrepancies and disparities that have been reported. In particular I will address the current potential and limitations of vegetation distribution models and the data sets that inform them. Notably, model predictions indicate rapid shifts to larger woody growth-forms, rapid colonization due to long-distance dispersal, and favorable conditions for recruitment following disturbances like tundra fire and permafrost degradation. Future albedo, evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass will change with the redistribution of Arctic vegetation, and the climate feedbacks of these ecosystem changes can be significant. Albedo and net surface shortwave radiation changes will dominate the influence on climate, largely due to the snow masking effects of taller vegetation. The carbon implications of ecosystem change will likely be dominated by processes that influence permafrost thaw vulnerability, but predictions also indicate that vegetation in the Arctic will affect climate primarily as a biophysical medium (i.e. via albedo change). As with thawing permafrost, predicted vegetation changes would exacerbate currently amplified rates of warming. New research efforts focused on the Arctic will address the research and data needs to inform our understanding of the net feedback of multiple ecosystem responses to climate, increasing confidence in our ability to understand changes that are already being observed, predict future change, and the implications for climate, ecosystems and people both within and outside the Arctic domain.",

            "abstract": "Tidal wetland ecosystems are dynamic coastal habitats that, in California, often occur at the complex nexus of aquatic environments, diked and leveed baylands, and modified upland habitat. Because of their prime location and rich peat soil, many wetlands have been reduced, degraded, and/or destroyed, and yet their important role in carbon sequestration, nutrient and sediment filtering, and as habitat requires us to further examine their sustainability in light of predicted climate change. Predictions of climate change effects for the San Francisco Bay Estuary present a future with reduced summer freshwater input and increased sea levels. We examined the applicability and accuracy of the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM), a zero-dimensional model that models organic and inorganic accretion rates under a given rate of sea-level rise. MEM was calibrated using data collected from salt and brackish marshes in the San Francisco Bay Estuary to examine wetland resiliency under a range of sea-level rise and suspended sediment concentration scenarios. At sea-level rise rates 100 cm/century and lower, wetlands remained vegetated. Once sea levels rise above 100 cm, marshes begin to lose ability to maintain elevation, and the presence of adjacent upland habitat becomes increasingly important for marsh migration. The negative effects of sea-level rise on elevations were compounded as suspended sediment concentrations decreased. Results from this study emphasize that the wetland landscape in the bay is threatened with rising sea levels, and there are a limited number of wetlands that will be able to migrate to higher ground as sea levels rise.",

            "abstract": "Observational and numerical modeling evidence demonstrates that magnetospheric substorms are a coherent set of processes within the coupled near-Earth system. This supports the view that substorms are a global configurational instability. The magnetosphere progresses through a specific sequence of energy-loading and stress-developing states until the entire system suddenly reconfigures. Related long-term studies of relativistic electron fluxes in the Earth’s magnetosphere have revealed many of their temporal occurrence characteristics and their relationships to solar wind drivers. Early work showed the obvious and powerful role played by solar wind speed in producing subsequent high-energy electron enhancements. More recent work has also pointed out the key role that the north-south component of the IMF plays: In order to observe major relativistic electron enhancements, there must typically be a significant interval of southward IMF along with a period of high (VSW≥500 km/s) solar wind speed. This has led to the view that enhancements in geomagnetic activity (i.e., magnetospheric substorms) are normally a key first step in the acceleration of radiation belt electrons to high energies. A second step is suggested to be a period of powerful low-frequency waves that is closely related to high values of VSW or higher frequency (“chorus”) waves that rapidly heat and accelerate electrons. Hence, substorms provide a “seed” population, while high-speed solar wind drives the acceleration to relativistic energies in this two-step geomagnetic activity scenario. This picture seems to apply to most storms examined whether associated with high-speed streams or with CME-related events. In this talk, we address the substorm relationships as they pertain to high-energy electron acceleration and transport. We also discuss various models of electron energization that have recently been advanced. We present remarkable new results from the Van Allen Probes (Radiation Belt Storm Probes) mission that confirm and greatly extend these key ideas.",

Here we test the hypothesis, using measurements from 41 spring-fed rivers in Florida, that tissue stoichiometry indicates autotroph nutrient limitation status. Low variation in discharge, temperature and chemical composition within springs, but large variation across springs creates an ideal setting to assess the relationship between limitation and resource supply. Molar N:P ranges from 0.4 to 90, subjecting autotrophs to dramatically different nutrient supply. Over this gradient, species-specific autotroph tissue C:N:P ratios are strictly homeostatic, and with no evidence that nutrient supply affects species composition. Expanding to include 19 metals and micronutrients revealed autotrophs are more plastic in response to micronutrient variation, particularly for iron and manganese whose supply fluxes are small compared to biotic demand. Using a Droop model modified to reflect springs conditions (benthic production, light limitation, high hydraulic turnover), we show that tissue stoichiometry transitions from homeostatic to plastic with the onset of nutrient limitation, providing a potentially powerful new tool for predicting nutrient limitation and thus eutrophication in flowing waters.",

            "abstract": "The Eastern Lau Spreading Center exhibits variations in mantle source composition, melt supply, and crustal characteristics consistent with a decreasing influence of slab volatiles on mantle melting with distance from the active Tofua arc. A series of recent geophysical and geochemical studies show that over the past 4 Myr the spreading center has formed distinct zones of oceanic crust as the ridge migrates away from the arc and its underlying mantle melting region. Recent seismic tomographic images reveal that a fundamentally distinct type of oceanic crust forms along back-arc spreading centers located near (<50 km) the active arc. This crust is anomalously thick (8–9 km) and seismically layered, and by inference chemically differentiated, in a manner not observed in crust produced at mid-ocean ridges. Lava samples from this region are enriched in subduction-related components, including water, and have compositions that extend to very low (~1 wt%) MgO contents, indicating erupted lavas have experienced considerably more crystal fractionation on average than typical mid-ocean ridge basalts. Further from the arc, crust produced at the spreading center abruptly transitions (within ~5 km) to a more normal thickness (~6 km) and seismic structure as compared to oceanic crust formed at intermediate-rate mid-ocean ridges. Here, lavas primarily consist of less evolved basalts (~6-8+ wt% MgO) with relatively low arc-like enrichments. Our work suggests a model for the formation of arc-proximal, chemically-stratified oceanic crust that is counter to other published interpretations of stratified crust detected in other back-arc systems: water from the downgoing slab is entrained in the melting zone beneath the ridges where it enhances melting and crustal production. Thereafter, water in the primary magmas suppresses plagioclase crystallization relative to olivine and clinopyroxene, creating an unusually mafic lower crust; residual low-viscosity melts buoyantly rise upward to form a more felsic, porous upper crust. Testing this model, and advancing our understanding of magmatic processes along water-rich spreading centers, is a primary focus of future research.",

            "abstract": "Biodegradation of continuously emitted plumes is known to be most pronounced at the plume fringe, where mixing of contaminated water and ambient groundwater, containing dissolved electron acceptors, stimulates microbial activity. Under steady-state conditions, physical mixing of contaminant and electron acceptor by transverse dispersion was shown to be the major bottleneck for biodegradation, with plume lengths scaling inversely with the bulk transverse dispersivity in quasi two-dimensional settings. Under these conditions, the presence of suitable microbes is essential but the biokinetic parameters do not play an important role. When the location of the plume shifts (caused, e.g., by a fluctuating groundwater table), however, the bacteria are no more situated at the plume fringe and biomass growth, decay, activation and deactivation determine the time lag until the fringe-controlled steady state is approached again. During this time lag, degradation is incomplete. The objective of the presented study was to analyze to which extent flow and transport dynamics diminish effectiveness of fringe-controlled biodegradation and which microbial processes and related biokinetic parameters determine the system response in overall degradation to hydraulic fluctuations.\nWe performed experiments in quasi-two-dimensional flow through microcosms on aerobic toluene degradation by Pseudomonas putida F1. Plume dynamics were simulated by vertical alteration of the toluene plume position and experimental results were analyzed by reactive-transport modeling. We found that, even after disappearance of the toluene plume for two weeks, the majority of microorganisms stayed attached to the sediment and regained their full biodegradation potential within two days after reappearance of the toluene plume. Our results underline that besides microbial growth and maintenance (often subsumed as \"biomass decay\") microbial dormancy (that is, change into a metabolically inactive state) and endogeneous respiration are important to understand the dynamic behavior of electron-acceptor and -donor fluxes under transient environmental conditions and therefore deserve increased consideration in future reactive-transport modeling.",

            "abstract": "ARIA is a joint JPL/Caltech project to automate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and GPS imaging capabilities for scientific understanding, hazard response, and societal benefit. We have built a prototype SAR and GPS data system that forms the foundation for hazard monitoring and response capability, as well as providing imaging capabilities important for science studies. Together, InSAR and GPS have the ability to capture surface deformation in high spatial and temporal resolution. For earthquakes, this deformation provides information that is complementary to seismic data on location, geometry and magnitude of earthquakes. Accurate location information is critical for understanding the regions affected by damaging shaking. Regular surface deformation measurements from SAR and GPS are useful for monitoring changes related to many processes that are important for hazard and resource management such as volcanic deformation, groundwater withdrawal, and landsliding.\nObservations of SAR coherence change have a demonstrated use for damage assessment for hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions. These damage assessment maps can be made from imagery taken day or night and are not affected by clouds, making them valuable complements to optical imagery. The coherence change caused by the damage from hazards (building collapse, flooding, ash fall) is also detectable with intelligent algorithms, allowing for rapid generation of damage assessment maps over large areas at fine resolution, down to the spatial scale of single family homes.\nWe will present the progress and results we have made on automating the analysis of SAR data for hazard monitoring and response using data from the Italian Space Agency’s (ASI) COSMO-SkyMed constellation of X-band SAR satellites. Since the beginning of our project with ASI, our team has imaged deformation and coherence change caused by many natural hazard events around the world. We will present progress on our data system technology that enables rapid and reliable production of imagery. Lastly, we participated in the March 2014 FEMA exercise based on a repeat of the 1964 M9.2 Alaska earthquake, providing simulated data products for use in this hazards response exercise. We will present lessons learned from this and other simulation exercises.",

Realistic simulation of UTWV and its variability is thus essential to the accuracy of climate change predictions. Deep convection has a strong influence on the UTWV, making it one of the most poorly simulated quantities in climate models. We evaluate 23 AMIP-type model simulations of UTWV submitted for the IPCC Fifth Assessment report (AR5) by “A-Train” satellite observations and reanalysis data and perform detailed error diagnosis. We find that large-scale dynamics and convection play a dominant role in controlling UTWV errors in climatological mean, seasonal cycle, and interannual variability, while thermodynamic control associated with temperature biases are important for the water vapor simulations in the lower troposphere and near the tropopause.",

            "abstract": "We present a case study of the 7 January 2014 event in order to highlight current challenges in space weather forecasting of CME arrival time and geomagnetic storm strength. On 7 January 2014 an X1.2 flare and CME with a radial speed ~2400 km/s was observed from active region 11943. The flaring region was only ten degrees southwest of disk center with extensive dimming south of the active region and preliminary analysis indicated a fairly rapid arrival at Earth (~36 hours). Of the eleven forecasting groups world-wide who participated in CCMC's Space Weather Scoreboard (http://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/SWScoreBoard), nine predicted early arrivals and six predicted dramatic geomagnetic storm impacts (Kp predictions ranged from 6 to 9). However, the CME only had a glancing blow arrival at Earth - Kp did not rise above 3 and there was no geomagnetic storm. What happened? One idea is that the large coronal hole to the northeast of the active region could have deflected the CME. This coronal hole produced a high speed stream near Earth reaching an uncommon speed of 900 km/s four days after the observed CME arrival. However, no clear CME deflection was observed in the outer coronagraph fields of view (~5-20Rs) where CME measurements are derived to initiate models, therefore deflection seems unlikely. Another idea is the effect of the CME flux rope orientation with respect to Earth orbit. We show that using elliptical major and minor axis widths obtained by GCS fitting for the initial CME parameters in ENLIL would have improved the forecast to better reflect the observed glancing blow in-situ signature. We also explore the WSA-ENLIL+Cone simulations, the background solar wind solution, and compare with the observed CME arrival at Venus (from Venus Express) and Earth.",

            "abstract": "Solutes in snow and ice are present in at least 3 different types of locations: at the air-ice interface (sometimes called the quasi-liquid layer or QLL), in other liquid-like regions (LLRs) within the ice, and in the matrix of the bulk ice. Some reports in the literature show that direct photodegradation of solutes is enhanced in the QLL relative to in solution, while other reports show that solutes in whole ice samples behave as if they were in supercooled aqueous solution. Our overall goal is to understand where solutes reside in laboratory ice samples and whether their photochemistry depends upon location. In this first portion of our work we will describe our efforts to address the first component of this goal, i.e., the location of solutes.\nUsing micro-CT (computed tomography) we can create a 3-dimensional image of a frozen sample, identifying areas of air, water ice, and concentrated solute. Slower freezing methods tend to produce samples with larger air bubbles and concentrated solute inclusions. Interestingly, areas of concentrated solute are often adjacent to internal air bubbles, providing an air-ice interface that is not at the top surface of the sample. We also see some concentrated solute in internal veins or at the ice-air interface at the top of the sample. These areas have some liquid-like behavior, often forming thin layers and moving within the frozen sample in a thermal gradient (but still below 273 K). In contrast, for samples prepared by flash-freezing solution in liquid nitrogen, the solutes are nearly invisible to the micro-CT technique, suggesting they are present in very small domains, possibly dispersed throughout the sample.",

Seismometers are installed with warpless base plates, which decrease long period noise on horizontal components by up to 15dB. In most stations, a pressure gauge and a thermometer are also installed. In 2014, we upgraded 4 stations: SSB in France, CAN in Australia, ROCAM in Rodrigues and ECH in France. 27 stations send data in real or near real time to the GEOSCOPE Data Center and to tsunami warning centers. Continuous data of all stations are collected in real time or with a delay by the IPGP Data Center in Paris where they are validated, archived and made available to the international scientific community through different interfaces including web services (see details on\nhttp://geoscope.ipgp.fr\n). In 2015, GEOSCOPE data will also be available through the French national data center RESIF. Seismic noise level of the continuous data are computed every 24 hours and accessible via the geoscope web site. GEOSCOPE data are also validated by comparing real and synthetic body wave waveforms using the SCARDEC method (Vallee et al., 2011).

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and its associated tsunami clearly showed the need for an accurate tsunami early warning system. In a short time between the occurrence of earthquakes and associating tsunamis and the tsunami arrivals to near-field coastal inhabited regions, we can use many different kinds of observations for real-time tsunami forecasting. Since individual type of the observations has its advantages and disadvantages, it is strongly required to make use of multiple kinds of data for improving estimated size and arrival timing of imminent tsunamis by reinforcing one another. For example, the rapid analysis of short-period seismic wave data, such as earthquake early warning system in Japan will provide the first information on the size and location of an earthquake, helping issuing tsunami information immediately after earthquakes. Real-time GNSS data have an advantage over the short-time seismograms because robust estimations of location and dimension of coseismic faults can be derived from spatial patterns of permanent coseismic displacement measured by real-time GNSS data. It is one of the important lessons learnt from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake that estimation of reliable finite source fault models is indispensable in tsunami forecasting after massive earthquakes. Offshore measurements of coming tsunamis must be data most relevant to the arrival times and sizes of tsunamis along shorelines. However, it takes more time to obtain credible spatial distribution of tsunami wave height from the observations due to much slower propagation of tsunamis than seismic waves and deformations. In the presentation, we will introduce the current status of the real-time crustal deformation monitoring system based on the GNSS data developed by Geospatial Information Authority of Japan and Tohoku University. We also briefly introduce the real-time tsunami forecasting based on the offshore tsunami data, developed by the Meteorological Research Institute of Japan Meteorological Agency. Finally, we will discuss how the combination use of the real-time GNSS and the offshore tsunami observations improve the capability of tsunami forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Cooling of the mantle is often assumed to result in a decrease in average global plate speeds with time. However, deformation in collisional orogens indicates the frequency of craton collisions increases from about 5/100 Myr 2.5 Ga to 10/100 Myr 200 Ma. Likewise, angular plate velocities weighted by craton area increase from an average of 25 deg/100Myr at 2 Ga to about 50 deg/100 Myr in the last 200 Myr. The number of cratons decreases rapidly from > 20 to ≤ 15 between 1.9 and 1.75 Ga as numerous Archean blocks were sutured together. Orogens and passive margins show the same two cycles of ocean basin closing: an early cycle from 2.5-1.9 Ga and a later cycle, which corresponds to the supercontinent cycle ≤ 1.9 Ga. Also recorded in the geologic record during the last 200 Myr is a decrease in the duration of passive continental margins from 400 Myr at 1.2 Ga to < 100 Myr during the last 200 Myr. And finally, assuming Gondwana and Pangea represent stages in the growth of a single supercontinent, the period of the supercontinent cycle has dropped from about 1000 Myr at 1.5 Ga to < 500 Myr in the last 500 Myr. All of these observations are consistent with an increase in average plate speeds with time, which is consistent with the geodynamic model of Korenaga (2006) suggesting that plate tectonics is speeding up with time. This could be due to a decrease in the magnitude of lithosphere dehydration stiffening as ambient mantle temperature falls with time. Alternatively or in addition, gradual hydration of the mantle by subduction may decrease mantle viscosity and increase convection rates.",

            "abstract": "Gigaton-scale calving events at large outlet glaciers in Greenland generate seismic surface waves similar in amplitude to those from M 5 tectonic earthquakes. These glacial earthquakes provide a form of ground-based remote-sensing tool for the Greenland Ice Sheet, with increasing utility as understanding of the events improves. The number of glacial earthquakes occurring in Greenland has increased steadily since the early 1990s, when our observing record begins; 2012 and 2013 saw record numbers of glacial earthquakes in Greenland. Patterns of earthquake occurrence in space and time are closely linked to changes in glacier dynamics, including variations in the grounding state of the calving front. Event occurrence is strongly seasonally modulated, following seasonal patterns of ice-front retreat at individual glaciers. Seismological observations combined with geodetic, meteorological, and glaciological information demonstrate that glacial-earthquake ice-loss events are a primary control on short-term velocity variability at marine-terminating outlet glaciers. Glacial-earthquake source parameters derived from waveform modeling using a centroid--single-force approach agree well with independent estimates of changes in glacier geometry from satellite remote-sensing data and field observations. As for tectonic earthquakes, however, the full glacial-earthquake source process is more complex than that represented by such a long-period approximation. The seismological observing capacity in Greenland has improved dramatically in recent years, beginning to allow more detailed investigation of the time history of forces active during glacial earthquakes. Improved knowledge of the glacial-earthquake force history and source process will provide greater insight into calving processes and dynamic glacier behavior.",

            "abstract": "For decades, forest and water managers have been investigating how forest management (e.g., through strategic thinning or gap cutting) can increase snow retention and help water resources. Predictions of warming temperatures and decreasing snowpacks have renewed interest in taking such actions, but model results about the combined impact of forest change and temperature change on snow are conflicting. Forest interception processes vary with winter temperatures, due to changes in branch stiffness and in the relative cohesion (stickiness) of snowflakes. Models prescribe forest interception to be some fraction of falling snow (interception efficiency, Ie, see Figure), and the total amount of snow that a canopy can hold (Imax, see Figure). However, interception models developed in colder regions (Hedstrom and Pomeroy 1998) prescribe Imax decreasing with temperature, while those developed in warmer regions (Andreadis et al. 2009) prescribe Imax increasing with temperature (see Figure). Here, we use a modular model framework (SUMMA) to isolate model choices related to interception and test the impact of these choices on modeled snow sensitivity to prescribed climate change (delta-T) and forest change (delta-tree) at study sites in both the Pacific Northwest (warm) and the Boreal forest (cold). Independently calibrating model parameters allows snow modeled with either interception formulation to match observations well in both warm and cold study sites, but these different model configurations, while producing matching snow simulations in the calibration year, lead to different predictions of the snow response to change. We discuss when these differences matter most and how carefully-controlled modeling and coordinated multi-site field observations are required to ensure that we have confidence in our modeled prediction of forest snow response under changing conditions.",

Chemical and isotopic modification of potential organic carbon with perchlorate in martian regolith during H2O(l) interactions is unknown. Here we assess the relationship between martian levels of perchlorate and organic carbon present in life harbouring geologic material from Earth. These materials represent chemical (i.e., processed serpentine soils from Sri Lanka) and temperature (i.e., hydrothermal jarosite/goethite deposit from White Island, New Zealand) extremes to where life exists on Earth. Preliminary evidence demonstrates that organic carbon decreases and δ13C values are modified for ultramafic sediment in both perchlorate kinetic and incubation experiments. In hydrothermal jarosite/goethite with microbial communities present, total and organic carbon is maintained and little modification in δ13C values is apparent. These preliminary results suggest that surface hydrothermal deposits with mineralogically ‘protected’ organic carbon are preferable sites to assess the potential of life on Mars.",

To account for these discrepancies, we developed a numerical tsunami propagation code solving the shallow water equation and including the effects of elastic loading of the sea-floor by the tsunami as well as a linear density profile in the sea water column. We show here that both effects are important to explain the commonly observed difference between observations and simulations. We conclude that the density variation in the sea water column affects the wave speed without changing the waveform, whereas the loading effect has an effect on the wave speed and the waveform showing a negative phase before the main arrival due to the depression of the sea floor surrounding the tsunami wave. The combination of both effects is needed to achieve a better match between observations and simulations.",

            "abstract": "Of the many processes contributing to long-term sea-level change, little attention has been paid to the basin-scale contributions of salinity-driven halosteric changes. We evaluate simulated against observed estimates of long-term (1950-present) halosteric patterns and compare these to corresponding thermosteric changes. Spatially coherent halosteric patterns are visible in the historical record, and are consistent with estimates of long-term water cycle amplification. Our results suggest that Pacific and Atlantic basin-scale halosteric change contributions are substantially larger than previously assumed, with observed estimates and coupled climate models suggesting magnitudes of ~25% of the corresponding thermosteric changes. In both observations and models Pacific basin-scale freshening leads to a density reduction that augments thermosteric expansion whereas in the Atlantic halosteric changes partially compensate strong thermosteric expansion through a basin-scale enhanced salinity density increase. Although regional differences are apparent, at basin-scales consistency is found between the observed and simulated partitioning of halosteric and thermosteric changes, and suggests that models are simulating the processes driving observed long-term basin-scale sea-level change. Further analysis demonstrates that the observed halosteric changes and their basin partitioning are consistent with CMIP5 simulations that include anthropogenic CO2 forcings (Historical), but are found to be inconsistent with simulations that exclude anthropogenic forcings (HistoricalNat).

These high occurrence longitudes all have a negative magnetic declination with the dip equator located in the northern hemisphere. The densities in these longitude regions are higher than that in other longitude regions indicating an ionospheric condition that is susceptible to the RT instability process similar to the conditions in the post-sunset ionosphere for the occurrences of irregularities. In addition, large variations in density and vertical drift also imply the possible existence of electrodynamic perturbations to serve as seeds for the RT instability in the post-midnight ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Lunar Maria are large, dark, plain areas on the lunar surface mostly covered by basaltic, which are formed by ancient volcanic eruptions, and 23 lunar maria have been named. There are mainly two methods used to determine the ages of the planet surface which are radiometric dating (Papike et.al., 1998) and crater counting (Hiesinger et.al. 2000, 2003). As for the lunar surface, some scientists have study the ages of the lunar mare basalts with these methods, however, since the boundaries of the lunar maria have not been defined, so that there are few study on the relative ages among the named lunar maria from a geographic area perspective. In this approach, we detected the boundaries for each named lunar mare and analysis the relative ages for them with the crater counting method.In detecting the boundaries of the lunar maria, some lunar image data and topographic data were collected from Chang’E1 program data, such as the lunar global DOM data with a resolution of 120m, and the global DEM data with a resolution of 500m. For the crater counting, some crater data were downloaded from the website (http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/SearchResults?target=Moon&featureType=Crater,%20craters). Based on the global lunar DEM and DOM data, the images were classified into lunar mare and highland with maximum likelihood classification method, after that, ArcMap 3D Analyst tool was used to extract each lunar mare, then the boundaries of 23 named lunar maria were detected.With the crater data and the lunar mare boundaries, the number of the craters in each lunar mare could be counted, and the summarize area of the craters in each mare could also be calculated with the diameter attribute in the crater data. Some attributes of each lunar mare were shown as Tab.1.After that, we calculated the value by dividing the area of each mare with the area of the craters in the mare, and then the value was visualized in a global lunar map, as shown in Fig.1. The bigger value stands for more crater frequency, which means the geologic age of the mare might be relatively older.The result shows that some maria in the farside such as the Mare Ingenii might be older than others. Since the result depends a lot on the precision of craters data, so in the future research, we should extract the craters from other lunar global images with higher resolution.",

The purpose of this paper is to study the potential of earthquakes hazard in the Taiwan area, using the seismic acceleration data collected by the Central Weather Bureau from 1993 to 2012. The source time functions for 32 events have been calculated by using the attenuation equation and the Q-structures. These source time functions can be classified into 3 groups. Type A, B, and C indicates subduction, normal and strike slip faults respectively. The source time functions of type A are almost located in the off-shore of the eastern Taiwan. Most of the type C are located in the well known faults (ex. ChelungPu fault) area. Type B are located in the volcano area of northern Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "Siletzia as named by Irving (1979) is a Paleogene large igneous province forming the oceanic basalt basement of coastal OR, WA and S. BC that was accreted to North America in the early Eocene. U-Pb (magmatic, detrital zircon) and 40Ar/39Ar ages constrained by mapping, global coccolith (CP) zones, and magnetic polarities permit correlation of basalts with the geomagnetic polarity time scale of Gradstein et al. (2012). Siletzia was rapidly erupted 56–49 Ma (Chron 25-22), and accretion was completed between 51 and 49 Ma in Oregon. Magmatism continued until ca. 46 Ma with emplacement of a basalt sill complex during or shortly after accretion. Siletzia’s great crustal thickness, rapid eruption, and timing of accretion are consistent with formation as an oceanic plateau. Eight m.y. after accretion, margin-parallel extension and regional dike swarms mark the Tillamook magmatic episode in the forearc (41.6 Ma; CP zone 14a; Chron 19r). We examined the origin of Siletzia and the possible role of a long-lived Yellowstone hotspot (YHS) in an open source plate modeling program. In most reference frames, the YHS is on or near an inferred northeast-striking Kula- Farallon and/or Resurrection-Farallon ridge 60 to 50 Ma. The YHS thus could have provided a 56–49 Ma source on the Farallon plate for Siletzia, which accreted to North America by 50 Ma. A sister plateau, the Eocene basalt basement of the Yakutat terrane, now in Alaska, formed on the adjacent Kula (or Resurrection) plate and accreted to coastal British Columbia at about the same time. Following accretion of Siletzia, the leading edge of North America overrode the YHS ca. 42 Ma. The encounter with an active YHS may explain the voluminous high-Ti tholeiitic to alkalic magmatism of the 42–34 Ma Tillamook episode and extension in the forearc. Clockwise rotation of western Oregon about a pole in the backarc has since moved the Tillamook center and underlying Siletzia northward ~250 km from the probable hotspot track on North America.",

Here we present the first stratigraphic, petrological, and geochemical data from the transect between Hidalgo del Parral and Guadalupe y Calvo, Chihuahua, Mexico. This is the first new transect across the SMO in 25 years and the only one between existing NE - SW transects at Chihuahua - Hermosillo and Durango - Mazatlan. The 245 km-long transect along Mexican Highway 24 crosses the boundary between the extended (Basin and Range) and non-extended (Sierra Madre Occidental plateau) parts of the SMO, and allows sampling of previously undescribed Oligocene (?) - early Miocene (?) rhyolitic ignimbrites and lavas, and occasional post-rhyolite, Miocene (?) SCORBA basaltic andesite lavas. 54 samples of rhyolitic ignimbrites (40) and lavas (7), and basaltic andesite lavas (7) were sampled along the transect, including 8 canyon sections with more than one unit. The ignimbrites are overwhelming rhyodacitic (plagioclase and hornblende or biotite phyric) or rhyolitic (quartz (+/- sanidine) in additon to plagioclase and hornblende or biotite phyric) and sparsely to highly phyric. Preliminary petrographic (phenocryst abundances) and geochemical (major and trace element) will be presented and compared to existing data from elsewhere in the SMO. Future work will include U-Pb zircon dating and whole rock and in-zircon radiogenic isotopes analyses.",

            "abstract": "Most previous studies on the genesis and evolution of bedforms in large rivers have focused on aggradational bedforms within alluvial sediments, with very few investigations that concern either erosive bedform evolution or bedrock channel abrasion processes. Detailed understanding of the processes within bedrock reaches of river channels is vital if an improved understanding of formation and evolution of bedrock scours and bedforms are to be elucidated. The paper presents high-resolution bathymetry and sidescan derived from multibeam sonar (MBES) and detailed flow mapping by acoustic Doppler current profiling (ADCP) to illustrate, in intricate detail, relations between morphology, flow and sediment transport processes through a bedrock reach of the Mekong River (Cambodia) during a large flood event. A 2 by 5 km reach of the Mekong river near Sambor was surveyed with a RESON 7125 MBES system revealing incredible >40 m scour features within the bedrock substrate, with sidescan imagery also revealing the routing of alluvial sediment through the scours. A series of ADCP transects were obtained, both transverse and perpendicular to the primary downstream flow, that map the flows into, around and within these scour features. The paper will conclude by looking at how advances in measurement capability have permitted the detailed processes in such channels to be investigated for the first time at this scale.",

            "abstract": "In Washington, snow and glacier melt provide an important source of water resources, however spring snowpack levels are declining and glaciers are retreating. While warming temperatures are a well-recognized factor contributing to snowpack decline and glacier retreat, another cause may be the deposition of black carbon (BC) onto snow and glacier surfaces. Since 2010 we have collected snow and ice core samples to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of BC deposited in Washington snow and glacier ice. BC concentrations in the winter snowpack are relatively low, with BC concentrations increasing in spring and summer due to melt induced enrichment and increased dry deposition. BC induced melt may accelerate the timing of spring snowmelt at lower elevations, however BC induced melt is likely largest at relatively high elevations where the snowpack persists into the summer months when BC concentrations were observed to be highest. Based on our research to date, the highest BC concentrations in Washington snow and ice are linked to forest fires. A shallow ice core retrieved from Mt. Olympus demonstrated that BC deposition was a magnitude higher during the 2011 Big Hump forest fire, resulting in a threefold increase in the rate of change of river discharge due to glacier melt. An ice core from South Cascade Glacier spanning the 20th century also suggests that the highest BC concentrations are associated with forest fires. Furthermore, burned areas can continue to provide a source of BC to the snowpack post-fire. We measured BC concentrations in snow at a study site from 2010−2013 in Washington State. The surrounding forest burned in 2012, after which BC deposited on the snowpack post-fire was at least four-fold higher than pre-fire. This research has implications for projected climate change, as forest fires are projected to increase and the seasonal snowpack is projected to decrease, both of which contribute to higher BC concentrations in the snowpack.",

            "abstract": "The idea that salinity contributes to ocean dynamics is simply common sense in physical oceanography. Along with temperature, salinity determines the ocean mass and hence, through geostrophy, influences ocean dynamics and currents. But, in the Tropics, salinity effects have generally been neglected. Nevertheless, observational studies of the western Pacific Ocean have suggested since the mid-1980s that the barrier layer resulting from the ocean salinity stratification within the mixed layer could influence significantly the ocean-atmosphere interactions. The present study aims to isolate the specific role of the salinity stratification in the layers above the main pycnocline by taking into account the respective thermal and saline dependencies in the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, N2. Results will show that the haline stabilizing effect may contribute to 40–50% in N2 as compared to the thermal stratification and, in some specific regions, exceeds it for a few months of the seasonal cycle. At the contrary, the centers of action of the subtropical gyres are characterized by the permanent absence of such effect. The relationships between the stabilizing effect and the sea surface fields such as SSS and SST are shown to be well defined and quasilinear in the Tropics, providing some indication that in the future, analyses that consider both satellite surface salinity measurements at the surface and vertical profiles at depth will result in a better determination of the role of the salinity stratification in climate prediction systems.",

            "abstract": "While the hydrological cycle is expected to intensify in response to global warming, little unequivocal evidence of such an acceleration has yet been found on a global scale. This holds in particular for terrestrial evaporation, the crucial return flow of water from continents to atmosphere. Counterintuitively, the few studies that have applied satellite and in situ observations to evaluate multi-decadal trends have uncovered prolonged declines in global average continental evaporation. A priori, these reductions contradict the expectations of an intensifying water cycle. Up to date, the question of whether these declines in evaporation reflect a more permanent feature of global warming or they result from internal climate variability, has been left unanswered.\nHere, we attempt to answer that question by analyzing global satellite-based datasets of evaporative fluxes, soil moisture and NDVI. Our findings reveal that the reported recent declines in global continental evaporation are not a consequence of a persistent reorganization of the water cycle, but a consequence of internal climate variability. During El Niño, limitations in the supply of moisture in central Australia, southern Africa and eastern South America cause vegetation water-stress and reduced terrestrial evaporation. These regional terrestrial evapo- ration declines are so pronounced that that determine the total annual volumes of water vapour from continental land surfaces into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, in northern latitudes (where the effects of ENSO are weaker) continental evaporation has raised since the ’80s at rates that are consistent with the expectations calculated from air temperature trends. Future changes in continental evaporation will be determined by the response of ENSO to changes in global radiative forcing, which still remains highly uncertain. Opportunely, the increasing timespan of satellite observation records will enable a more significant assessment of the trends in global evaporation in coming years. ",

            "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is the most abundant trace metal in the phytoplankton that dominate vertical carbon export in the ocean, the diatoms. But the strong relationship between the vertical distributions of Zn and the silicon (Si) that makes up the opal hard parts of diatoms represents a long-standing puzzle. Zn is overwhelmingly co-located with phosphate in the organic matter of diatom cells, not with Si in opal, and is regenerated with phosphate in the upper ocean, not with Si in the deep. The resolution of this apparent paradox is key both to an understanding of the global oceanic cycling of Zn, and to the rates and mechanisms by which biologically-assimilated trace metals are returned to the photic zone. Here, we show that oceanic dissolved Zn exhibits significant isotopic variation in the upper ocean that is consistent with vertical cycling. However, we suggest that the isotopically homogeneous global deep ocean Zn pool is largely sourced from the Southern Ocean. This leads to a new view of the global oceanic cycling of this important trace metal, one that is consistent with the unique physiology of Southern Ocean diatoms, the coupling of Zn and Si in the global deep ocean, and the emerging paradigm for global ocean nutrient dynamics. Our data and interpretation imply a small Zn pool that is biologically cycled in the upper ocean, but is to a great extent decoupled from the much larger Southern-Ocean-dominated deep ocean pool.",

            "abstract": "Global correlations between Al2O3 and Pt/Os in mantle peridotites suggest that Pt behaves incompatibly relative to Os during partial melting [c.f., 1]. Because 190Pt decays to 186Os (t1/2 = 468 Ga), correlations between 186Os/188Os and peridotite fertility can be used to constrain the long-term Pt/Os evolution of the depleted mantle and the initial Pt/Os ratio of the primitive upper mantle (PUM). We examined 186Os/188Os in mantle peridotites from continental (Rio Grande Rift/Colorado Plateau) and oceanic (Lena Trough, Hawaiian Islands) settings that span a wide range in fertility (Al2O3 ~0.67-4.42 %) and 187Os/188Os ratios (0.1138-0.1305). The new data define a narrow range in 186Os/188Os (0.1198338 to 0.1198393, 2 SD~24 ppm), placing constraints on long-term Pt/Os variability in the DMM. 186Os/188Os is broadly correlated with indices of melt depletion including spinel Cr#, clinopyroxene Cr#, and clinopyroxene Yb content, consistent with the inferred relative compatibility of Pt and Os during partial melting. Extrapolation of the alumina-186Os/188Os trend to PUM alumina content (~4.5 wt% Al2O3; [2]) suggests a PUM 186Os/188Os of ~0.1198380±15, similar to the 186Os/188Os of H chondrites (~0.1198398±16; [3]). This 186Os/188Os value is consistent with a PUM Pt/Os of 1.8±0.3, similar to Pt/Os values measured in several classes of chondrites (Carbonaceous ~1.9±0.2, Ordinary ~2.0±0.3 and Enstatite ~1.9±0.2; [3]). Whereas ~84% of peridotites worldwide [excluding low-[Os] samples (<1 ppb Os) that may have been compromised by melt-rock reaction and/or weathering and alteration] with measured Pt/Os ratios have Pt/Os between 0.3 and 3.1 (the range permissible from 186Os/188Os variations for melt extraction from PUM at ~1.5 Ga), only ~36% fall between 1.3 and 2.2 (a narrower range consistent with an older ~4.5 Ga melt depletion age). This suggests that much of the observed Pt/Os variability in mantle peridotites is relatively recent. Close agreement between our inferred Pt/OsPUM with previous estimates inferred from chondrites [3] is consistent with the addition of a chondritic late veneer to explain the HSE abundances in the upper mantle.

Embarking identical, high accuracy and high spatial resolution instrumentation on all satellites, the mission has ambitious goals reaching from the deep Earth interior (the core) out to the solar-terrestrial interaction in the magnetosphere and therefore addresses a wide range of user communities. Measurements of the magnetic field (magnitude and vector components), the electric field (through ion drift velocity, ion density, ion temperature, electron density, electron temperature and spacecraft potential), the gas density and horizontal winds as well as precise positioning are supported by a range of derived products for the magnetic field, geophysics, aeronomy and space physics communities. Indeed, Swarm is at the forefront of cross-cutting science issues that involve significant parts of the space and earth physics community.\nThis contribution will detail the status of the mission one year after launch, including the status of the data processing and products serving the research needs. It will furthermore detail the outcome of the calibration and validation phase of the mission as well as outline the Agency’s plans for data exploitation initiatives and research opportunities linked to the Swarm mission. The role of Swarm for space weather research will also be discussed. It aims at a role as an overview presentation for all other Swarm-related contributions to this session.",

Such expeditions hosting teachers aboard the JOIDES Resolution are most successful in training high quality formation, to keep in touch with oceanographic research and researchers who run it.\nThe active participation of these ‘teachers at sea’ has already helped to disseminate Education tools such as online hands-on, broadcasts from the ship... One of the last IODP Expedition (IODP 345 – Hess Deep Plutonic Crust) was very efficient to discover life on board the JOIDES Resolution to the schools.\nThe program 'School of Rock' is also a great opportunity to build relationships within the educational community. Hundreds of teachers, including some Europeans have been able to participate in these schools, to share their teaching practices and to improve their training in marine geosciences. IODP France organized, last year, the first ‘European School of Rock’ edition with forty teachers.\nA new way to bring geosciences into the classroom is 'ship to shore' live video broadcasts from the oceanographic vessel during the expeditions. Since 2010, thousand students in Europe were able to participate in a broadcast with the JOIDES Resolution, have a guided tour of the ship, included the labs, and ask to a scientist ... A magical moment that highlights geosciences in the classroom!.\nTeaching Geosciences in French schools represent 30% of the national standard for Life Earth Science teaching. Many practical activities have been done with support as concrete as possible. Cores replicas from some expeditions complete successfully geological collections of tools available for the classroom. A lot of students have benefited in Europe from these cores in their classroom.\nSome conclusions :\nIt is essential to maintain and provide teachers training with the multidisciplinary marine geosciences (biology, geology, physics, chemistry).\nIt remains essential as maintaining formations with the relationship between scientists and teachers through a better mutual understanding of each other's work. Participation of teachers in scientific expeditions aboard the JR is privileged moments.\nWe must also focus on the link 'science and society', especially as it involves many themes such as geosciences climate change, natural hazards...",

            "abstract": "The North China Craton (NCC), as an unusual craton with part of its thick lithosphere destructed, records the geodynamic processes associated with the convergence of Eurasia and the Pacific and Philippine plates lasting from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic. How the cratonic lithosphere deformed in response to the extensional tectonics caused by the oceanic plate subduction, however, remains debated. In order to investigate the mantle deformation of the NCC, we present new shear wave splitting measurements and updated tomographic models beneath a 900-km long profile across the north NCC. Compared to our other observations in the NCC, this profile is shorter but also crosses a region that experienced strong lithospheric destruction, therefore provides a good opportunity to improve our understanding of upper mantle deformation during the craton destruction.\nThe upper mantle deformation is studied using SKS data from 60 broadband stations with average spacing of 15 km. For the data from events occurring at distances of 85º–115º, fast polarization directions and delay times (fδt) are retrieved by a routine method, while for the events at distances < 85º, waveform modeling are applied to obtain (fδt) after separating the effects of S and SKS. The measured splitting parameters show small-scale variations from east to west: the major fast directions, trending NE-SW or NW-SE in contrast, distribute intermittently along the profile.\nWe plot the splitting parameters overlapping on the geological map and the tomography image for a depth range of 120-300 km. Comparison shows good consistency of the splitting pattern and structural features both at shallow and deep depths: NW-SE trending fast directions are observed at stations located within the basins or extensional zones like metamorphic core complexes, with the fast direction parallel to the extensional or stretching directions; the fast directions and the shear-wave velocity anomalies within the upper mantle also show changes with spatially coherency. This consistency in small-scale variations through the crust to the upper mantle implies coupled pattern of deformation at the lithospheric scale of the NCC, and possibly reflects the dominant effect of small-scale mantle flow during the cratonic reactivation in the north edge of the NCC.",

            "abstract": "Tracers have always played an essential role in the investigation of hydrologic systems, where water flow pathways cannot be directly observed. The use of tracers in catchment hydrology has been constantly increasing, with countless applications including water travel time estimation and hydrograph separation. Moreover, several high-quality datasets now exist and are publicly available, that enable the systematic use of tracers to improve the process representation of hydrologic models. However, tracer information is integrated over space and time and is best interpreted using a coherent and robust theoretical framework. Here, we propose methods derived from the time-variant theory of travel time distributions to interpret tracer measurements and model catchment functioning under different hydrologic conditions. In such a framework, the population of water particles moving within a catchment is considered as a dynamical system, where individuals move and mix inside a control volume before reaching the sampling point. The variability of flow, storage states and mixing experienced by the catchment are explicitly accounted for, providing rigorous tools for tracer investigation. We present applications to highly monitored watersheds (including Hubbard Brook (USA), Hupsel Brook (NL) and Plynlimon (UK)) that show how the transition between catchment states is mirrored by changes in the ages stored and released by the catchment, causing the chemical composition in the discharge to vary accordingly. This can be used to address a number of environmental problems, such as quantifying the interactions between shallow and deep flow systems and understanding nutrient loading persistence.",

The unfrozen water content is one of the most important parameters in the field monitoring and laboratory research of the freeze–thaw cycling of the permafrost. It has been already shown that the propagation of seismic waves inside a homogeneous porous medium induces a localized seismoelectric conversion field that moves along with the seismic waves, because of relative fluid motion in the pores. As the field is water saturation related, we initially conducted an experiment to study the seismoelectric responses varying with unfrozen water content. In the experiment, a cylinder frozen soil model which is heated gradually from bottom is set up to model a decrease temperature field, corresponding to that the unfrozen water content, from bottom to top. Then a seismic wave field is excited by a ultra acoustic transducer located on the top of the model and seismoelectric conversion responses are measured with a set of electrodes layout along the axis direction of the model with 1cm depth inside the model. At the same time, the temperature at each electrode is measured by a heat sensitive resistance near the electrode. Keeping the heating from bottom of the model, the measurement is performed at a fixed time period until the temperature of each electrode is increasing over zero degree centigrade. The experiment observations show: 1) The travel velocity of the seismoelectric signals is decreasing with increasing of temperature, or that of unfrozen water content, which also verify the flexibility of the experiment. 2) The amplitudes of the seismoelectric signals generally increase with that of temperature, corresponding to that of unfrozen water content increasing. 3) As the seimoelectric responses are measured with point-like electrodes, the experiment related to unfrozen water content have a high resolution in space and time.

            "abstract": "A wide range of geophysical observations suggest that an active partially molten region (Altiplano Puna Magmatic Body or APMB) lies in the mid-upper crust of the Altiplano Puna Plateau, in the Central Andes, with its upper contact at around 20 km depth. In particular, gravity, magnetotellurics and seismics have helped delineating the overall geometry of this intrusive body, which is approximately 200 km in diameter and could be many kilometers thick. The average melt fraction is poorly constrained, although it has been suggested that it could be rather high, around ~15% or higher. In addition to constraining the general shape of the APMB, its dynamics can in principle be partially accessed through geodetic measurements at the surface. In fact, recent InSAR-related studies have shown a ground deformation rate in the order of centimeter per year, with a central uplifting region, centered roughly around a lava-dome complex type of system, Uturuncu volcano, surrounded by an extensive peripheral zone of subsidence. This wealth of observations has leaded us to propose two different hypotheses to partially explain the inner workings of the APMB: (i) the dynamic deformation of the uplift-subsidence of the surface is explained by the impingement of a buoyant melt-rich blob on the more brittle upper levels of the crust, and; (ii) such surface deformation could be associated to the poroviscous compaction induced by lateral melt transport toward a central region of ascent. Both scenarios are modeled numerically. In principle the two hypotheses could explain the rate and geometry of subsidence under some simplifications. We discuss the consequences of both hypotheses, and entertain the possibility of both processes operating together.",

            "abstract": "Ice-sheet models show a coincidence between ice flux and basal water-flow maxima, as water at the bed of an ice sheets acts generally to lubricate the basal interface. Hydrological flow paths support this view with ice and basal-water drainage basins being well-aligned. At the scale of an individual ice stream, however, we reveal a significant offset of this alignment. Airborne geophysical data across the trunk of the Institute Ice Stream reveal how subglacial hydrology acts to subdue ice flow in two ways: first, by removing basal sediment, which decreases opportunity for the deformation of basal material and increases basal roughness; and, second, by reducing basal water pressures. The macro flow of basal water beneath the ice stream is known well from high-resolution bed elevation data and satellite imagery, which reveal well-organised water flow along the Robin Subglacial Basin, terminating at the grounding line as a channel carving upwards into the adjacent ice shelf. The highest ice flow is offset from this channelized zone, however. Maximum velocities are located where the bed is very smooth and radio-echo returns are strong; consistent with a dilated weak sedimentary material at the ice stream bed. The geophysical evidence is consistent with the removal of basal sediment from the deepest regions of the Robin Subglacial Basin by the action of water and illustrates how accumulation of sedimentary material from ice streams is not necessary a precise locator for maximum ice-flow velocities at the scale of individual ice streams.\nThe figure shows a radar section across the Institute Ice Stream, West Antarctica, revealing two modes of basal environment. One is flat and smooth, indicative of a soft wet bed. The other is rougher, as a consequence of the removal of basal material and water channelisation. This latter region is located in the deepest regions of the Robin Subglacial Basin. The former region is located beneath the highest ice flow speeds.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic conductivity is the most important and at the same time the most uncertain parameter in numerical simulations. One problem commonly faced is that the data are usually collected at scales that are different than the elements used in numerical models. The question of how to calculate the permeabilities at the numerical element scale is driven by the hydraulic conductivity values that increase with larger scales, and also by the fact that the permeability is not an additive variable. Therefore, a common challenge occurs when different hydraulic conductivity measurements (often corresponding to different spatial scales, e.g. well tests, slug tests and permeameter tests) coexist in a field study and have to be integrated simultaneously. In the context of multiGaussian models, analytical formulations are available that can estimate equivalent hydraulic conductivity. However, when multiGaussian assumptions are not adopted, such as in the case of multiple-point statistics simulations, such analytical scale relationships are not valid. We address this issue in the context of Image Quilting, one of the recently developed multiple-point geostatistics methods. Based on a training image that represents fine-scale spatial variability, we use the simplified renormalization upscaling method to obtain a series of upscaled training images that correspond to the different scales at which measurements are available. We then apply Image Quilting with such a multi-scale training image to incorporate simultaneously conditioning data at several spatial scales. The realizations obtained satisfy the conditioning data exactly across all scales, but it can come at the expense of a small approximation in the representation of the physical scale relationships. In order to mitigate this approximation, we iteratively apply a kriging-based correction to the finest scale to ensure both local conditioning at the coarsest scales and physically-driven scale relationships.",

            "abstract": "In this work we present first validation results for a hyper-resolution global flood inundation model. We use a true hydrodynamic model (LISFLOOD-FP) to simulate flood inundation at 1km resolution globally and then use downscaling algorithms to determine flood extent and depth at 90m spatial resolution. Terrain data are taken from a custom version of the SRTM data set that has been processed specifically for hydrodynamic modelling. Return periods of flood flows along the entire global river network are determined using: (1) empirical relationships between catchment characteristics and index flood magnitude in different hydroclimatic zones derived from global runoff data; and (2) an index flood growth curve, also empirically derived. Bankful return period flow is then used to set channel width and depth, and flood defence impacts are modelled using empirical relationships between GDP, urbanization and defence standard of protection. The results of these simulations are global flood hazard maps for a number of different return period events from 1 in 5 to 1 in 1000 years. We compare these predictions to flood hazard maps developed by national government agencies in the UK and Germany using similar methods but employing detailed local data, and to observed flood extent at a number of sites including St. Louis, USA and Bangkok in Thailand. Results show that global flood hazard models can have considerable skill given careful treatment to overcome errors in the publicly available data that are used as their input.",

            "abstract": "The term pre-activation in heterogeneous ice nucleation describes the observation that the ice nucleation ability of solid ice nuclei may improve after they have already been involved in ice crystal formation or have been exposed to a temperature lower than 235 K. This can be explained by the retention of small ice embryos in cavities or crevices at the particle surface or by the capillary condensation and freezing of supercooled water, respectively. In recent cloud chamber experiments with crystallized aqueous ammonium sulfate, oxalic acid, and succinic acid solution droplets, we have unraveled a further pre-activation mechanism under ice subsaturated conditions which does not require the preceding growth of ice on the seed aerosol particles (Wagner, R. et al., J. Geophys. Res. Atmos., 119, doi: 10.1002/2014JD021741). First cloud expansion experiments were performed at a high temperature (267 – 244 K) where the crystallized particles did not promote any heterogeneous ice nucleation. Ice nucleation at this temperature, however, could be triggered by temporarily cooling the crystallized particles to a lower temperature. This is because upon crystallization, residuals of the aqueous solution are trapped within the crystals. These captured liquids can freeze when cooled below their respective homogeneous or heterogeneous freezing temperature, leading to the formation of ice pockets in the crystalline particles. When warmed again to the higher temperature, ice formation by the pre-activated particles occurred via depositional and deliquescence-induced ice growth, with ice active fractions ranging from 1 to 4% and 4 to 20%, respectively. Pre-activation disappeared above the eutectic temperature, which for the organic acids are close to the melting point of ice. This mechanism could therefore contribute to the very small fraction of atmospheric aerosol particles that are still ice active well above 263 K.",

            "abstract": "There is growing concern that future flood losses and fatalities might increase significantly in many regions of the world because of rapid urbanization in deltas and floodplains, in addition to sea level rise and climate change. To better anticipate long-term trajectories of future flood risk, there is a need to treat floodplains and deltas as fully coupled human-physical systems. Here we propose a novel approach to explore the long-term behavior emerging from the mutual interactions and feedbacks between physical and social systems. The implementation of our modeling framework shows that green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of floodplains, are more resilient to increasing flood frequency than technological societies, which deal with flooding by building levees. Also, we show that when coupled dynamics are accounted for, flood-poor periods could (paradoxically) be more dangerous than flood-rich periods.",

            "abstract": "The Indo-Gangetic foreland basin suffers from one of the highest rates of groundwater extraction in the world, especially in the Indian states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. To understand the effects of this extraction on ground water levels, we must first understand the geometry and sedimentary architecture of the aquifer system, which in turn depend upon its geomorphic setting. We use satellite images and digital elevation models to map the geomorphology of the Sutlej and Yamuna river systems, while aquifer geometry is assessed using ~250 wells that extend to ~300 m depth in Punjab and Haryana. The Sutlej and Yamuna rivers have deposited large sedimentary fans at their outlets. Elongate downslope ridges on the fan surfaces form distributary networks that radiate from the Sutlej and Yamuna fan apices, and we interpret these ridges as paleochannel deposits associated with discrete fan lobes. Paleochannels picked out by soil moisture variations illustrate a complex late Quaternary history of channel avulsion and incision, probably associated with variations in monsoon intensity. Aquifer bodies on the Sutlej and Yamuna fans have a median thickness of 7 and 6 m, respectively, and follow a heavy-tailed distribution, probably because of stacked sand bodies. The percentage of aquifer material in individual lithologs decreases downstream, although the exponent on the thickness distribution remains the same, indicating that aquifer bodies decrease in number down fan but do not thin appreciably. Critically, the interfan area between the Sutlej and Yamuna fans has thinner aquifers and a lower proportion of aquifer material, despite its proximal location. Our data show that the Sutlej and Yamuna fan systems form the major aquifer systems in this area, and that their geomorphic setting therefore provides a first-order control on aquifer distribution and geometry. The large spatial heterogeneity of the system must be considered in any future aquifer management scheme.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes are dependent on permafrost. Thermokarst lakes and wetlands dominate the peat-forming lowlands of the Nadym and Pur river basins in Western Siberia. Recent warming and potential permafrost thaw has initiated fluctuations in the number and total area of lakes in these basins. We use remote sensing (Landsat images) to distinguish spatially explicit changes. Further, through coupled analysis of hydrological data, we also identify characteristic patterns of lake-area and hydroclimatic change and assess the role of permafrost in such patterns. Our results reveal spatially heterogeneous lake-change patterns with drained lakes appearing alongside stable lakes. Such heterogeneity likely indicates permafrost thaw as a main driver of change rather than shifts in precipitation and evapotranspiration, which would yield more homogenous change patterns. The total area and number of lakes fluctuated over time with both appearing and disappearing lakes and a high number of drainage events. However, the size distribution of lakes remained essentially constant over the investigated time periods. The role of permafrost degradation on thermokarst lakes appears to be localized and thereby not detectable in basin-averaged properties of the entire Nadym and Pur basins. Regardless, specific sub-basins can exhibit long-term sustained lake change with coupled hydroclimatic changes. These locations are vital as they offer clear windows to consider the possible manifestations of global climate change and its influence on biogeochemical cycles and carbon effluxes.",

            "abstract": "Agroforestry has received considerable attention from scientists and development practitioners in recent years. It is recognized as a cornerstone of many traditional agricultural systems, as well as a new option for sustainable land management in currently treeless agricultural landscapes. Agroforestry systems are diverse, but most manifestations supply substantial ecosystem services, including marketable tree products, soil fertility, water cycle regulation, wildlife habitat and carbon sequestration. While these benefits have been well documented for many existing systems, projecting the outcomes of introducing new agroforestry systems, or forecasting system performance under changing environmental or climatic conditions, remains a substantial challenge.\nDue to the various interactions between system components, the multiple benefits produced by trees and crops, and the host of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural factors that shape agroforestry systems, mechanistic models of such systems quickly become very complex. They then require a lot of data for site-specific calibration, which presents a challenge for their use in new environmental and climatic domains, especially in data-scarce environments. For supporting decisions on the scaling up of agroforestry technologies, new projection methods are needed that can capture system complexity to an adequate degree, while taking full account of the fact that data on many system variables will virtually always be highly uncertain.\nThis paper explores what projection methods are needed for supplying decision-makers with useful information on the performance of agroforestry in new places or new climates. Existing methods are discussed in light of these methodological needs. Finally, a participatory approach to performance projection is proposed that captures system dynamics in a holistic manner and makes probabilistic projections about expected system performance. This approach avoids the temptation to take spuriously precise model results at face value, and it is able to make predictions even where data is scarce. It thus provides a rapid and honest assessment option that can quickly supply decision-makers with system performance estimates, offering an opportunity to improve the targeting of agroforestry interventions.",

The absolute geostrophic currents are calculated using the P-vector method for the period of 2004 through 2011. The transport of the geostrophic currents is compared with the Sverdrup theory and found to differ significantly in several locations. Analyses have shown that errors of wind stress estimation cannot account for all of the differences. The largest differences are found in the area, where nonlinear activities are vigorous. It is, therefore, suggested that the linear dynamics of the Sverdrup theory is deficient in explaining the geostrophic transport of the tropical northwestern Pacific Ocean.\nPrevious studies suggest recharge and discharge of the tropical Pacific Ocean heat content through the interior circulation of the North Pacific Ocean, based on the Sverdrup theory, and that the WBCs play the role opposite to the interior ocean recharge and discharge anomalies. Using ocean observations from two cruises in a La Niña winter and a normal winter, it is suggested that the Kuroshio transport decreases significantly and the Mindanao Current transport increases significantly at the peak of 2010 La Niña, opposite to the prediction of existing theory. The anomalies of the western boundary current transport are found much larger than those of the meridional circulation in the entire interior of the North Pacific Ocean, the dynamics of which are suggested to be associated with the Kelvin wave propagation around the Philippine islands. The results suggest that the WBCs dominate the interannual recharge and discharge of the western Pacific warm pool during the 2010 La Niña.",

However, only few terrestrial climate records from the Asian inland were extended to the late Oligocene-early Miocene, it is still unclear the evolution of aridification before the middle Miocene and which of these driving forces plays the key role. Here, a sedimentary, mineralogy and geochemical proxies record of the early Miocene sedimentary sequence (ca. 22.1 to 16.7 Ma) from Xining Basin was present in this paper, which locates in the northeastern side of Tibetan Plateau. Mineralogical and geochemical parameters show obvious two stages climate change. During ~ 22.1-19 Ma (Unit I), the enrichment of I/S (irregular mixed-layers of illite and smectite) content, high values of a*/L* and much stronger chemical weathering degree reveal a warm and humid climate condition. During 19-16.7 Ma (Unit II), the increase of chlorite and dolomite contents, the upward decrease of a*/L* and much weaker chemical weathering than Unit I suggest evidently increased aridity since ca. 19 Ma. Comprehensive comparisons among records from the central western China demonstrate that the aridification since ca. 19 Ma is widespread in northeastern of Tibetan Plateau. The early Miocene episodic uplift of the north and northeastern Tibetan Plateau, especially, the uplift of Laji Shan at ~22 Ma, possibly have played a key role in the aridification of the Xining Basin.",

            "abstract": "Global multi-model ensemble experiments provide a valuable basis for the examination of potential future changes in runoff. However, these projections suffer from uncertainties that originate from different sources at different levels in the modelling chain. This study aims to partition the uncertainty in projections of annual maximum, median and low flows over the Central United States into four distinct sources. More specifically, we quantify the relative contribution of the uncertainties arising from internal variability, global impact models (GIMs), global climate models (GCMs), and representative concentration pathways (RCPs). We use a set of eight state-of-the-art GIMs driven by five GCMs under four RCPs from the ISI-MIP multi-model ensemble.\nResults will be presented at both annual and decadal time scales, and we will examine the temporal changes in the relative contribution of each source of uncertainty over the course of the 21st century. This work will provide basic information towards the potential reduction of uncertainties in runoff projections.",

            "abstract": "About 85% of the annual precipitation in southern Vietnam (ca. 8–12°N, 104–110°E) occurs during the southwest monsoon season (June to October). Large-scale equatorial waves like the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves (CCEWs) are known to modulate the large-scale convective activity, often indicated by variations in (filtered) satellite-observed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies. The present contribution analyses and quantifies the role of the MJO and CCEWs for rainfall not only in southern and central Vietnam as a whole, but also for smaller climatological sub-regions.\nUsing circum-equatorial NOAA OLR (15°S–15°N), prominent spectral peaks are identified in wavenumber–frequency diagrams along the dispersion curves for the solutions of the shallow water equations. They are interpreted as CCEWs. Meridionally averaged wave-filtered OLR and its time derivatives are used to define phases and amplitudes of CCEWs. This will allow determining active and inactive phases of CCEWs in the vicinity of Vietnam. Eastward propagating deep convection is also related to the 30–90-day MJO. The OLR MJO Index (OMI) is used for the definition of convectively active and inactive phases of the MJO. TRMM 3B42 V7, APHRODITE MA V1101 data, and rain gauge measurements are used to investigate the relation between tropical wave phases and amplitudes and precipitation in southern and central Vietnam and adjacent regions. Results using the OMI are compared with those using the Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) Index.\nThe major findings are: (a) Precipitation amounts in southern Vietnam are higher during convectively active phases of the MJO and CCEWs. The waves differ in terms of their relative importance for rainfall enhancement. (b) For increasing CCEW amplitudes, the difference between area-averaged precipitation during inactive and active phases increases. We provide evidence that precipitation amounts are higher when multiple wave types are in their convectively active phases over the Vietnam region.",

            "abstract": "One of the mission objectives for Swarm is to study the dynamics of the upper atmosphere, under the influence of the Sun and Earth's magnetic field. For this purpose, each of the three satellites carries a sensitive three-axis accelerometer, an accurate GPS receiver and a laser retroreflector. The GPS receiver data is used both for calibration of the acceleration data, as well as for precise orbit determination. Validation of the precise orbits with independent satellite laser ranging data confirms that the location of each of the three satellites is known to within 2 cm.\nThe data from both the accelerometer and GPS receiver can be used to derive a data set of thermospheric density along the satellite tracks, in a similar way as has been done using CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE. The acceleration data is combined with information on the satellite attitude from the star cameras, and models of the aerodynamic and radiation pressure forces. When density and drag levels are high enough in the future, possibly data on the neutral wind speed in the satellite's cross-track direction can be derived as well.\nDuring commissioning, it was found that the accelerometer observations are affected by a large number of bias jumps, as well as a much larger than expected sensitivity to variations in on-board temperature. This presentation will provide details on investigations into corrections for these effects, as well as on the quality of the density data resulting from the acceleration measurements from the three Swarm satellites.",

            "abstract": "We assess the potential of rotational ground motion recordings to reduce nonuniqueness in kinematic source inversions, with emphasis on the required measurement accuracy of currently developed rotation sensors. Our analysis is based on synthetic Bayesian finite source inversions that avoid linearizations and provide a comprehensive quantification of uncertainties and trade-offs. Using the fault and receiver geometry of the Tottori 2000 earthquake as a testbed, we perform inversions for two scenarios: In scenario I, we use translational velocity recordings only. In scenario II, we randomly replace half of the velocity recordings by rotation recordings, thus keeping the total amount of data constant. To quantify the noise-dependent impact of rotation recordings, we perform a sequence of inversions with varying noise levels of rotations relative to translations. Our results indicate that the incorporation of rotational ground motion recordings can significantly reduce nonuniqueness in finite source inversions, provided that measurement uncertainties are similar to or below the uncertainties of translational velocity recordings. When this condition is met, rupture velocity and rise time benefit most from rotation data. The trade-offs between both parameters are then strongly reduced, and the information gain nearly doubles. This suggests that rotational ground motion recordings may improve secondary inferences that rely on accurate information about rise time and rupture velocity. These include frictional properties of the fault, radiation directivity and ground motion in general.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, increasing streamflow has been observed in glacierized headwater catchments of the Tarim River, Central Asia. We investigated to what extent these streamflow increases can be attributed to increasing precipitation, or increasing air temperature and resulting glacier mass loss, using a data-driven approach based on multiple linear regression, and a simulation-driven approach with a hydrological model.\nThe hydrological model was calibrated in a multi-objective way using criteria for discharge and glacier mass balances. This is crucial in such catchments with high uncertainties in precipitation, as a deficient streamflow simulation due to inadequate precipitation input may be compensated by erroneous simulation of glacier melt, if both variables are not jointly considered for model calibration. Temporal variations in glacier changes were calibrated against an observed glacier mass balance time series, whilst geodetic glacier mass balance estimates were used for constraining the absolute mass balance loss. The model considers the effects of changes in glacier area and in the elevation of the glacier surface over the course of the 48-years study period.\nSimulations with detrended time series indicate that changes in the less glacierized Kokshaal catchment are caused by increases in precipitation and glacier melt to a comparable extent. In contrast, for the more highly glacierized Sary-Djaz catchment, increasing glacier melt plays a dominant role. Results from the data-based approach were generally comparable, but pointed to a higher influence of temperature also in the Kokshaal catchment.\nOverall, the hydrological modeling approach was considered as advantageous because it allows to (1) directly investigate cause-effect relations, (2) analyze the impact of changes in variables that are not measured (e.g., changes in the fraction of glacier melt), and (3) integrate different kinds of data (like glacier mass balances or snow cover data). In this way, (in-)consistencies between different hypotheses for the causes of changes, the model results and the various data can be revealed.",

            "abstract": "Pesticides are widely used all over the world whether in agricultural production or in non-agricultural settings. They may pose a potential human health effects and environmental risks due to their physico-chemical properties and their extensive use which is growing every year. Pesticides are found in the atmosphere removed from the target area by volatilization or wind erosion, and carried over long distances. These compounds are partitioned between the gaseous and particulate atmospheric phases. The increasingly used pesticides are semi-volatile compounds which are usually adsorbed on the surface of the atmospheric particles. These pesticides may undergo chemical and photo-chemical transformation. New compounds may then be formed that could be more hazardous than the primary pesticides. The atmospheric fate and lifetime of adsorbed pesticides on particles are controlled by the these (photo)chemical processes. However, there is a lack of kinetic data regarding the pesticides in the particle phase.\nThis current work focuses on the photolytic degradation of commonly used pesticides in particulate phase. It aims at estimating the photolytic rates and thus the lifetimes of pesticides adsorbed on silica particles as a proxy of atmospheric particles. The following eight commonly used pesticides, cyprodinil, deltamethrin, difenoconazole, fipronil, oxadiazon, pendimethalin, permethrin, tetraconazole, were chosen because of their physico-chemical properties. The photolysis rates of tetraconazole and permethrin were extremely slow ≤ 1.2 · 10-6 s-1. The photolysis rates for the other pesticides were determined in the range of: (5.9 ± 0.3) · 10-6 < k < (1.7 ± 0.1) · 10-4 s-1 from slowest to the fastest: pendimethalin < cyprodinil < deltamethrin < difenoconazole < oxadiazon < fipronil. Finally, the identification of the surface products upon light irradiation was performed, using GC-(QqQ)-MS/MS and LC-(Q-IMS-ToF)-MS/MS. The potentially formed gas-phase products during these photolysis processes were followed continuously and on-line by PTR-ToF-MS. We hope that the obtained results from this study will help in the development of future environmental strategies to better understand and control phyto-sanitary product application and human exposure.",

            "abstract": "We use new wide-angle seismic and multichannel seismic reflection data (SPIRAL cruise, 2009) and additional geophysical data to study the crustal structure of the eastern Algerian back-arc basin that was born during the Miocene Tethys subduction rollback, before the collision of the European forearc (Kabylian blocks) with the northern African continent ~16-18 Ma ago.\nIn the deep basin, the P-wave velocity model images a thin, 5.5-km-thick oceanic crust with velocity ranging between 4.8 km/s and 7.1 km/s. It is composed of two layers, with a velocity-gradient higher in the upper layer than in the lower one. S-wave modeling indicates a Poisson ratio of 0.28 in the lower crust, supporting a dominant gabbroic composition.\nBelow the continental edge, we define two segments: (1) West of 7°45’E, a typical continental crust with P-wave velocities between 5.2 km/s and 7.0 km/s depicts a gradual seaward thinning of ~15 km over an ~35-km distance characterizing a stretched margin resulting from back-arc extension; (2) East of 7°45’E, the continental crust is a few kilometers thinner, arguing for a variable crustal thickness along the forearc before collision.\nBased on the deep basin crustal structure and magnetic anomalies, we propose that the eastern Algerian basin opened during the southeastward migration of the European forearc along a NW-SE elongated spreading center that ran perpendicular to the subduction trend, which is an unusual configuration for back-arc opening. Such an atypical geometry of the accretion and the oceanic crustal structure may result from a slab tear at depth related to diverging directions of the subduction rollback (and hence the forearc blocks) during back-arc opening: eastward for the Corsica–Sardinia block, and southward for the Kabylian blocks. The variable thickness of the continental crust along the margin may result from the crustal stretching along the forearc that accommodated the opening of the oceanic domain north of it.",

Based on available data, a strong case can be made that atmospheric CO2 concentrations over millions of years are controlled by a CO2-driven weathering feedback that maintains a mass balance between the CO2 input to the atmosphere from volcanism, metamorphism and net organic matter oxidation, and its removal by silicate rock weathering and subsequent carbonate mineral burial. This presentation will discuss issues such as the fine mass balance of long-term carbon fluxes that can be derived from reconstructions of atmospheric CO2 and ocean chemistry records. In addition, I will comment on alternative stabilizing feedbacks in the carbon cycle, including the potential role of organic carbon in driving greenhouse gas changes throughout Earth's history. Finally, if time permits, I will point out a few other stunning prerequisites necessary to maintain Earth habitability over billions of years.",

All these groups face similar challenges, such as: scale-dependent process representation and parameterization; increased computational efforts, stemming from both finer grids and the fact that many processes that were previously parameterized now have to be described in a spatially explicit manner; obtaining and processing the information to feed the huge parameterization requirements of these models; model calibration, validation and uncertainty analyses. In this presentation I review the scientific and societal rationale behind recent efforts to model hydrology globally at hyper-resolution spatial scales (< 1 km).

As more than 40% of irrigation water comes from groundwater, groundwater abstraction rates are large and exceed natural recharge rates in many regions of the world, thus leading to groundwater depletion. In this paper we provide an overview of recent research on global groundwater depletion. We start with presenting various estimates of global groundwater depletion, both from flux based as well as volume based methods. We also present estimates of the contribution of non-renewable groundwater to irrigation water consumption and how this contribution developed during the last 50 years. Next, using a flux based method, we provide projections of groundwater depletion for the coming century under various socio-economic and climate scenarios. As groundwater depletion contributes to sea-level rise, we also provide estimates of this contribution from the past as well as for future scenarios. Finally, we show recent results of groundwater level changes and change in river flow as a result of global groundwater abstractions as obtained from a global groundwater flow model.",

            "abstract": "The Tethys Himalayan stratigraphic record (Sciunnach and Garzanti 2012 Earth Sci.Rev.) excludes any postulated orogenic event associated with ophiolite obduction, arc–continent, or continent–continent collision in the Late Cretaceous, when multifold increase in terrigenous supply indicates dynamic upwelling heralding the Deccan megaeruptions (Garzanti and Hu 2014 Gondwana Res.). In the Paleocene, quartzarenites deposited at subequatorial latitudes were followed by widespread carbonate-ramp deposits. Passive-margin carbonate sedimentation lasted until the earliest Ypresian in Zanskar (SBZ 7/8; 55-54 Ma; Nicora et al. 1987 Riv. It. Pal. Strat.; Jenks et al. 2009 EGU Abs.) and until the early Lutetian in south Tibet (SBZ 10 to SBZ 13a; 53-51 to 49-47 Ma). The unconformably overlying volcaniclastic to ophioliticlastic sediments document progradation of a shallow-marine to subaerial delta fed from the Asian margin in the north. These units seal Neotethyan history and testify that the India/Asia collision was well underway by the middle Ypresian in the Zanskar traverse (SBZ 9/10; 53-51 Ma; Green et al. 2008 J. Geol.; Jenks et al. 2009) and by the middle Lutetian in the Tibetan traverse (P11/early P12; 43 Ma), when even shallow seas finally withdrew from above the nascent proto-Himalaya. The India/Asia collision has long been dated at around the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (~56 Ma; Garzanti et al. 1987 Geodin. Acta) by the major unconformity identified within carbonate-platform sediments and ascribed to flexural uplift shortly following the arrival of the edge of continental India at the Transhimalayan trench (Zhang et al., 2012; DeCelles et al. 2014 Tectonics). Collision onset can be dated directly in deep-water successions of the distal Indian margin by radiolarian biostratigraphy coupled with zircon chronostratigraphy, but due to the uncertainties of both methods estimates range from ≥50 Ma (Wang et al. 2011 J. Geol.) to 60/58.5 Ma (DeCelles et al. 2014; Wu et al., 2014 Am. J. Sci.).",

            "abstract": "As surface displacements depend non linearly on sources location and shape, simplifying assumptions are generally required to reduce computation time when inverting geodetic data. We present a generic Finite Element Method designed for pressurized or sheared cracks inside a linear elastic medium. A fictitious domain method is used to take the crack into account independently of the mesh. Besides the possibility of considering heterogeneous media, the approach permits the evolution of the crack through time or more generally through iterations: The goal is to change the less things we need when the crack geometry is modified; In particular no re-meshing is required (the boundary conditions at the level of the crack are imposed by Lagrange multipliers), leading to a gain of computation time and resources with respect to classic finite element methods.\nThis method is also robust with respect to the geometry, since we expect to observe the same behavior whatever the shape and the position of the crack. We present numerical experiments which highlight the accuracy of our method (using convergence curves), the optimality of errors, and the robustness with respect to the geometry (with computation of errors on some quantities for all kind of geometric configurations). We will also provide 2D benchmark tests. The method is then applied to Piton de la Fournaise volcano, considering a pressurized crack - inside a 3-dimensional domain - and the corresponding computation time and accuracy are compared with results from a mixed Boundary element method.\nIn order to determine the crack geometrical characteristics, and pressure, inversions are performed combining fictitious domain computations with a near neighborhood algorithm. Performances are compared with those obtained combining a mixed boundary element method with the same inversion algorithm.",

In order to constrain the crustal radioactivity near SNO, we have measured the surface heat flux and heat production within and around the Sudbury structure. We report on heat flux determinations at 6 new sites, which bring the total number of heat flux data around Sudbury to 18. The structure is completely encircled by heat flow sites that are located on its rims or immediately outside. The heat flux values, varying between 42 and 61 mW m-2, are all higher than the average Superior Province. Their mean is 50.1 mW m-2 compared to 39.5 mW m-2 for the entire Superior Province. Such a difference implies that the bulk crustal heat production near the Sudbury structure is ~ 40% higher than the average Superior Province. The mean heat production of rock samples from 12 of the heat flow sites is 1.35 μWm-3, which is ~ 50% higher than the average surface heat production of the Superior Province (0.8μWm-3).\nThe highest heat flux values are found southwest of the structure at sites that are located in the Southern Province, where some sedimentary rock core samples have heat production >3μWm-3. The variations in heat flux occur over relatively short distances (<20km) implying that they are due to local enrichment in heat producing elements in the upper crust near SNO.",

The study of strain partitioning in two French mega-rockslides (La Clapière and Séchilienne, estimated volumes of 60 ± 10 × 106 m3, France) provides a unique insights into this influence. Here we show that, by hydromechanical modeling, a significant part of the observed rockslide motions and seismicity may be caused by poroelastic strain in the deep part of the slope, induced by groundwater table variations. In the unstable volume near surface, calculated strain and rupture are controlled by stress transfer and friction weakening above the phreatic zone and reproduce well the high-motion zone measured by geodesy and geophysics. The key model parameters are the friction weakening and the position of groundwater level that are constrained by field hydrogeochemical and geodetic data to support the physical validity of the model. These results highlighting deep fluids major control on the rupture of superficial rock slopes are of importance for giant collapse monitoring strategies and for the understanding of the near surface strain long term pluriannual evolution under weak forcing.",

Most of the existing works are based on measurements of flat, solid surfaces (mainly metals) that are not easily usable for the analysis of remote sensing data. We believe that a systematic study on the influence of emerging angle for emissivity and reflectance laboratory spectra of asteroids analogs is of crucial importance for the interpretation of data from future missions to asteroids (among them, NASA OSIRIS-Rex, and JAXA Hayabusa II) and for the modelling of surface properties of minor bodies in general.\nAt the Planetary Emissivity Laboratory (PEL) of DLR in Berlin we set-up an experiment to measure the emissivity of two asteroid analogs, fine powdered (<25 µm) meteorite Millbillillie and a synthetic enstatite at surface temperature of 373K, with emerging angle (e) from 0° to 60°, with 10° step intervals. Special wedges have been created to incline the samples at the right emission angles: to prevent powder to slipper from the sample cups (always happening for e>30°), the samples have been packed using ethanol. For comparisons, we measured reflectance spectra of the same samples, keeping the incidence angle to the allowed minimum (i=13°) and varying the emerging angle as we did for emissivity measurements. All the data show very small spectral variations up to e=30°, while starting from e=40° the changes in band depth and shape become significant, and increase for each 10° step of increasing emerging angle.",

            "abstract": "In the most abundant upper mantle phase, olivine, the presence of hydrogen significantly modifies the timescale of chemical diffusion, plastic deformation, electrical conductivity and the attenuation of seismic waves. Early experiments showed that hydrogen is the fastest species able to diffuse through the olivine lattice. We have found, however, experimental and natural evidence suggesting that hydrogen diffusion can also be orders of magnitude slower.\nIn olivine there are four different hydrogen substitution mechanisms, associated with Mg vacancies, Si vacancies, trivalent cations and titanium substitution, hereafter referred to as H[Mg], H[Si], H[triv] and H[Ti] respectively. We experimentally investigated the dehydroxylation of synthetic forsterite with two contrasting hydrous defect populations: (1) dominated by H[Si], and H[Ti] with subsidiary H[Mg] and H[triv]; and (2) H[Si] exclusively. The loss rates of H[Mg] and H[triv] are in agreement with previous measurements of bulk hydrogen diffusion in forsterite, but the decrease in H[Ti] and H[Si] are ~1.5 and ~ 3 orders of magnitude slower, respectively. The activation energy and pre-exponential terms derived in these experiments are in agreement with the empirical correlation recently proposed based on the Meyer-Nedel compensation law (Jones 2014, G3, 15, 2616-2631).\nNatural observations attest further to slow hydrogen diffusivity in olivine dominated by H[Ti] and H[Si]. Metamorphic olivines formed after dehydration reactions in the Alpine orogeny preserve their original water contents despite long times of exhumation (2-3 Ma). Closure temperature calculations suggest that using previous fast diffusion rates, these olivines should reequilibrate down to 400°C. Only slow hydrogen diffusion coefficients such as those corresponding to H[Si] are able to explain the observed preservation of water content at the peak metamorphic temperature (700-800°C).\nThese findings have implications for estimating the ascent rate of xenoliths, which are more consistent with other independent constrains, as recently noted (Hilchie et al. 2014, Lithos, 202-203, 429-441). They are also required to assess the time necessary to equilibrate experimental charges, since for the different hydrous defects this time would vary by orders of magnitudes.",

            "abstract": "A coupled physically based land surface hydrologic model, Flux-PIHM, has been developed by incorporating a land surface scheme into the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM). The land surface scheme is adapted from the Noah land surface model. Flux-PIHM has been implemented and manually calibrated at the Shale Hills watershed (0.08 km2) in central Pennsylvania. Model predictions of discharge, point soil moisture, point water table depth, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and soil temperature show good agreement with observations. When calibrated only using discharge, and soil moisture and water table depth at one point, Flux-PIHM is able to resolve the observed 101 m scale soil moisture pattern at the Shale Hills watershed when an appropriate map of soil hydraulic properties is provided.\nA Flux-PIHM data assimilation system has been developed by incorporating EnKF for model parameter and state estimation. Both synthetic and real data assimilation experiments have been performed at the Shale Hills watershed. Synthetic experiment results show that the data assimilation system is able to simultaneously provide accurate estimates of multiple parameters. In the real data experiment, the EnKF estimated parameters and manually calibrated parameters yield similar model performances, but the EnKF method significantly decreases the time and labor required for calibration. The data requirements for accurate Flux-PIHM parameter estimation via data assimilation using synthetic observations have been tested. Results show that by assimilating only in situ outlet discharge, soil water content at one point, and the land surface temperature averaged over the whole watershed, the data assimilation system can provide an accurate representation of watershed hydrology. Observations of these key variables are available with national and even global spatial coverage (e.g., MODIS surface temperature, SMAP soil moisture, and the USGS gauging stations). National atmospheric reanalysis products, soil databases and land cover databases (e.g., NLDAS-2, SSURGO, NLCD) can provide high resolution forcing and input data. Therefore the Flux-PIHM data assimilation system could be readily expanded to other watersheds to provide regional scale land surface and hydrologic reanalysis with high spatial temporal resolution.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone is detrimental to human health and ecosystems, is a greenhouse gas, and plays a role in removing pollutants from the atmosphere. Since the first observations of its concentration in the late 19th century, it has been measured by a range of different approaches (surface instrumental, sondes, satellites). In the last 40 years, global (WMO GAW) and regional networks (EMEP, CASTNET, ...) have been initiated to measure its surface concentration. For data analysis and model comparisons a synthesis of all of this data needs to be undertaken.\nIn this work we collate these observations into a single dataset with some initial quality control and handling of meta-data. We can then generate a range of products (means, medians, percentiles, standard deviations, AOT40, SUMO35, etc.) over a range of timescales (hourly, daily, monthly, annual) on user specified grids suitable for data analysis and model evaluation.\nWe apply objective statistical techniques developed by the paleoclimate reconstruction community to interpolate the data spatially to reconstruct a global map and time series of surface ozone. Novelly, we use global chemical transport model output to infer each measurement’s spatial representativeness to account for lifetime and meteorology. We present results of the global interpolation and global and regional averages in surface ozone over the past 40 years and compare them to models. We find that the observational coverage peaked around the year 2002 with good coverage over the northern midlatitudes and Antarctica but poor coverage over the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics due to both the lack of observations and the short lifetime of tropical ozone. Significantly more ozone observations are made globally than are reported to the international datasets reducing the usefulness of these individual observations and making understanding ozone on both regional and global scale more difficult. New observations of surface ozone through the tropical oceans, South America and Africa would significantly enhance our ability to observe this important pollutant at the surface.",

            "abstract": "Recent work in Lesotho, based on the identification and mapping of freshly-fractured, unweathered angular basalt blocks, shows that lightning, and not water-related freeze-thaw cycles, is the dominant contributor to weathering in low-latitude mountains (Knight & Grab 2014, Geomorphology). Lightning strikes generate a distinctive geomagnetic remanent field due to the strong magnetic pulse associated with lightning discharge. This effect can be identified qualitatively with a compass. Here we confirm this interpretation with the use of total magnetic intensity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The field site is located in the high Drakensberg of eastern Lesotho, southern Africa. The summit studied is ~3350 m asl, comprising a series of Jurassic basalt flows in step-like plateaus separated by steep scarps that demarcate individual flow units. Using a Geometrics Walkmag with built in GPS, we collected detailed total magnetic intensity data on a grid of ~1 m x 1 m in a region ~500 m x 500 m where geomorphologic evidence indicates a high concentration of lightning strikes. In addition we collected over 1500 magnetic susceptibility measurements using a ZH Instruments SM-30 susceptibility meter. The susceptibility data show limited variability (from ~0.001 – 0.02 SI), although the magnetic intensity data show tremendous variation from less than ~20,000 to over ~40,000 nT. The most variable data are closest to the steep scarps, with intensity and variation falling off dramatically in the slope regions. Forward modeling of the susceptibility data demonstrates that the variations in measured susceptibilities cannot be responsible for the magnetic intensity variations. This indicates that strong, lightning-induced remanent magnetization is the cause. Detailed magnetic observations indicate that the most intensely remanently magnetized region is not necessarily where the rock has fractured, indicating that the magnetization process is complicated and likely related to preferential lightning energy transfer along rock microfractures away from the strike location. This study provides conclusive evidence that lightning is a dominant process affecting low-latitude mountains, and that this can be identified using geomagnetic techniques.",

Among the various approaches to thermospheric density modeling and forecasting, the use of physics-based, fully coupled global geospace models is probably the most challenging to implement, but it also holds the most promise for possibly accurate specification. In this study, we use the coupled-magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere model to investigate the evolutions of high-latitude thermospheric mass density during magnetic storms. Various physical processes that affect the energy input from the magnetosphere to ionosphere-thermosphere system are studied using high-resolution, coupled global simulations, including localized electromagnetic energy deposition, direct-entry cusp particle precipitation, broadband electron precipitation, ring current, ion outflow. The ability of predicting polar cap thermospheric density during magnetic storms using global geospace models are estimated through event-based data-model comparisons (CHAMP/GRACE). These comparison studies are also used to investigate the relative importantce of various physical processes that relate to the coupling between the magnetosphere and high-latitude ionosphere-thermosphere.",

Global simulations play an important role in understanding the coupled MI system. A key feature of most global models is the implementation of magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) coupling, and electron precipitation is one of the most important processes to specify. However, one deficiency of most global simulation codes is the lack of accurate specifications of electron precipitation. The principle objectives of the study are to improve the existing diffuse and monoenergetic electron precipitation model and to implement broadband and cusp electron precipitation models. The diffuse electron precipitation model is improved by introducing a dynamically regulated boundary. Broadband electron precipitation is regulated by the downward AC Poynting flux, together with empirical relations derived from satellite data. Cusp electrons are specified based on a cusp identification algorithm used in the global simulation. The improved electron precipitation patterns show reasonable agreement with an empirical model, and the simulated hemispheric power shows agreement with satellite observations during event simulations.",

Soil hydrological or catchment models have been developed including the different kind of preferential flow pathways like earthworm like macropores (e.g. earthworm channels), pipes, roots, etc. and they have been successfully applied to make predictions at a range of spatial scales. One of the biggest issue using hydrological models including preferential flow routines is the parameterization. What are the landscape features influencing the occurrence and quantity of specific preferential flow features? Will certain macropres be more probable to occur under forest than under grassland soils? In this study, I will highlight several studies looking at the effect of land-use and landscape features on preferential flow properties and parameters. Several field experiments studied on the one side the properties among topographic locations or vegetation cover, but also at the hydrological functions and hence the relevance of preferential flow pathways. In the second part the soil hydrological model ROGER is introduced, which will further evaluate and predict the relevance of vertical and lateral preferential flow pathways at the plot, hillslope and catchment scale.",

            "abstract": "Turbulent flows with buoyancy effects occur in many situations, both in industry and in the atmosphere. It is challenging to correctly model such flows, especially in the case of stably stratified turbulence, where vertical motions are damped by buoyancy forces. For this purpose, we have derived a so-called explicit algebraic model for the Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux that gives accurate predictions in flows with buoyancy effects. Although inspired by turbulence models from engineering, the main aim of our work is to improve the parametrization of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).\nExplicit algebraic turbulence models are a class of parametrizations that, on the one hand, are more advanced than standard eddy-diffusivity relations. On the other hand, they are signficantly easier to handle numerically than models that require the solution of the full flux-budget equations. To derive the algebraic model, we apply the assumption that transport terms of dimensionless fluxes can be neglected. Careful considerations of the algebra lead to a consistent formulation of the Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux, which is more general and robust than previous models of a similar kind. The model is shown to give good results compared to direct numerical simulations of engineering test cases, such as turbulent channel flow.\nRecent work has been aimed at testing the model in an atmospheric context. The first of these tests makes use of the GABLS1 case, in which a stable atmospheric boundary layer develops through a constant surface cooling rate. The model is able to give good predictions of this case compared to LES (see attached figure). Interestingly, the results are very close to the outcome of the recently developed Energy-Flux-Budget (EFB) closure by Zilitinkevich et al. (2013). A detailed discussion of the similarities and differences between these models will be given, which can give insight in the more general gap between engineering and atmospheric turbulence models. Further tests will be performed in cases with a full diurnal cycle.",

Simultaneously the original proton becomes a new H-atom that has an energy much higher than the original H-atom.

This study aims to better understand the contributions from each of these vectors to ecosystem functions using a stable isotope approach. A first attempt is to evaluate the isotopic compositions of the different components. Fog has been found to be isotopically enriched compared to rain but our preliminary results show the opposite of this trend whilst our dew sample is the most depleted. The distinctness of the isotope signatures indicates that these can potentially be used to calculate the contribution of each of these water sources to the overall water balance of plants in this area.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake occurrence is both a driver of and the result of complexity in the stress field and elastic properties of the crust. If we understand how static and dynamic stresses perturb the crust, we can use these observations to better understand the current state of the crust. Here we focus on how the crust responds to dynamic stresses outside the region where static stresses are important. A tool to understand the current state of the crust has broad applications in seismic hazards, induced seismicity, and a general understanding of earthquake physics.\nAs dynamic strains outside of the near field of an earthquake are small, often no more than a micro strain, we need sensitive measures to detect any resulting perturbations to the properties of the crust. Two methods we currently use are (i) measuring temporal changes in seismic velocities applying ambient noise, and (ii) measuring the spatiotemporal change in microseismic activity. A strength of using ambient noise to detect changes in seismic velocities is the ability to stack over space and time to reveal very small changes. We use microseismicity because there are many more small earthquakes than large ones, so more robust statistics can be applied to small earthquakes—applying microseismicity improves the detection of changes within the crust.\nA striking observation applying these methods is widespread increased seismicity and a transient increase in seismic velocities in Japan after the passage of surface waves from the 2012 M8.6 Indian Ocean earthquake. The velocity observations are obtained by stacking 113 Hinet stations and using 10-day windows. The velocity change extends to at least 5 km depth based on the spatial wavelengths employed (0.1-5 Hz). Based on our field observations and those of others, as well as our laboratory studies one may expect a decrease in the crustal velocity from wave dynamics. The observed increase in velocity could be an indirect effect such that frictional contacts stiffen under changing quasi-static stress conditions in the presence of an increase in microseismicity. Alternatively, an increase in velocity may suggest that weak motions strengthen frictional contacts within the crust, whereas those contacts are slightly destabilized under ambient conditions.",

            "abstract": "Catchments can be viewed as biogeochemical reactors that moderate the transfer of reactive gases and solutes according to the movement of water through the subsurface. A simple measure of the efficiency of a reactor is the Damköhler number (Da), which compares the characteristic fluid travel time to the characteristic time scale for the reaction of interest. However, the mixture of unsaturated and saturated flow conditions combined with complex subsurface heterogeneity results in an ensemble of travel times that is variable in space and time. Because most chemical reactions of interest are kinetically controlled and thus a non-linear function of time, the interaction between the travel time distribution and the reaction progress curve dictates the efficiency of chemical conversion within the catchment. This interaction is ultimately reflected in the relationship between concentration of a solute and discharge in wells and rivers.\nTo evaluate the coupling between transport dynamics and chemical reactions, we conducted a series of reactive transport simulations of heterogeneous domains at multiple scales, ranging from soil profile to hillslope scale, and evaluated rates of chemical transformations and fluxes under both steady-state and transient flow conditions. Travel time distributions are evaluated for each realization. For both heterogeneous and homogenous kinetic reactions considered, mixing further reduces the efficiency of chemical conversion to an extent that is determined by the average Da: at moderate Da, corresponding to pronounced solute gradients, the variability in local reaction rates is most pronounced. At the soil profile scale, characterized by dominantly vertical flow, concentrations scale with mean travel time. For a hillslope geometry, the travel time distribution is more complex and the nature of mixing can shift the trajectory of the reaction progress curve towards different endpoints, obscuring the relationship between concentration, water flux and travel time. Despite the inherent challenges, coupling measures of water age to reactive geochemical tracers in models and in applied settings presents many new opportunities to evaluate the factors that control the water, solute and energy fluxes into and out of catchments.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone is an important greenhouse gas and a global air pollutant originating from photo-chemical oxidation of ozone precursors in the presence of NOX. Eastern Asia has the fastest growing anthropogenic emissions in the world, possibly affecting both the pollution in the local troposphere as well as in the trans-Pacific region. Local measurements over Asia show that tropospheric ozone has increased by 1 to 3% per year since the start of the millennium. This increase is often invoked to explain positive ozone trends observed in western United States, but to date there is no unambiguous evidence showing that enhanced Asian pollution is responsible for these trends.\nHere we interpret satellite measurements of tropospheric ozone and its precursor nitrate dioxide from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) using the TM5 global chemistry-transport model to directly show that tropospheric ozone over China has increased by ~10% from 2005-2010 in response to both a ~15% rise in Chinese emissions and an increased downward ozone transport from the stratosphere.\nWhat is more, we demonstrate that Chinese export of ozone and its precursors have offset one-third of the reduction in free tropospheric ozone over the western United States that should have occurred during 2005-2010 via emissions reductions associated with air quality policies in the United States. The issue of export and long-range transport of pollution from other countries indicates that global efforts may be required to address both the global as well as the regional air quality and climate change.",

            "abstract": "Space geodesy has demonstrated its potential in detecting ground deformation associated with exploitation of aquifers. However, because geodetic data remain rarely integrated with hydrologic data, ground deformation observations are not typically used for water management purposes. Here, we characterize ground deformation of the Santa Clara Valley in the southern San Franciso Bay Area, an aquifer undergoing water extraction and recharge with over 50 multi-decadal monitoring wells. We perform Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series analysis of ERS, Envisat, and ALOS SAR data to resolve the 1992-2011 ground deformation.\nUsing T-mode Principal Component Analysis we isolate temporally and spatially variable deformation signals embedded in multi-decadal InSAR time series. The longer-term signal reveals uplift at 0.4 cm/yr between 1992-2000 and < 0.1 cm/yr during 2000-2011, illustrating the end of the aquifer system's poroelastic rebound following recovery of hydraulic heads after the 1960s low stand. In addition, seasonal elastic deformation with amplitude of up to 3 cm, in phase with head fluctuations, is observed over the confined aquifer sharply partitioned by the Silver Creek Fault (SCF).\nWe integrate the deformation with hydraulic head data to characterize the aquifer-system properties at the scale of the basin, and show that after calibration we can accurately predict hydraulic head levels from deformation alone. Finally, by modeling the deformation partitioning across the SCF we constrain the time of the fault's last tectonic activity, hydraulic conductivity, and material composition. The SCF cuts the shallow confining clays and was last active since ~140 ka, it has a horizontal hydraulic conductivity several orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding aquifer system, and it is likely composed of clays, making it an effective barrier to across-fault fluid flow.\nOur results demonstrate that space-derived ground deformation, when combined with hydrological data, enables characterization of basin-wide aquifer-system and fault properties and could help characterize hydraulic heads in areas with sparse temporal well monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The Cretaceous period is generally considered to have been a time of warm climate, but there is an on-going dispute about the existence of cool interludes - including the short-termed installation of polar ice caps. Mid-Cretaceous shoal-water ecosystems have been proven to show characteristic response modes (e.g., microencruster-blooms) to major climatic and environmental changes related to oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), times of widespread pelagic organic matter burial. Some biotic changes predate OAE1a by few 100kyrs, an observation that is in favour of gradual and pulsed volcanic CO2-outgassing as main trigger of this event.\nWe aim at reconstructing the evolution of Barremian-Aptian sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and SST seasonalities in the prelude, during and in the aftermath of OAE1a. The outer low-Mg calcite-shell layer of rudist bivalves (e.g., Toucasia), collected at carbonate platform settings in the (sub-)tropical Tethyan realm (France, Croatia, Spain), serves both as chemostratigraphic and palaeoclimatic archive. Sclerochronological variations in isotopic (δ18O, δ13C, Mg/Ca, clumped isotopes) and geochemical composition (Sr, Fe, Mn, Ba, Ca/Mg) provide insights into seasonal and long-term palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes. The outcome of this work will be of significance both for those studying the triggering factors of oceanic anoxic events and the palaeoecology of rudist bivalves.",

Simulating the ice sheets during these times can provide insight into their sensitivity to climatic changes. Here we investigate the evolution of the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) during these two warm periods. We use the coupled climate-ice sheet model REMBO-SICOPOLIS to perform large ensembles of simulations over the last several glacial cycles. Paleo data from ice and ocean sediment cores is used to constrain the range of valid simulations.\nWe present probabilistic estimates of the contribution of the GIS to sea level for both MIS-11 and MIS-5. Furthermore our simulations provide information on the plausible range of changes regional climatic forcing that drive the changes in Greenland ice volume. In our simulations, the GIS loses significantly more volume during MIS-11 compared to MIS-5, even though insolation anomalies were stronger during the latter. Our results highlight the exceptional duration of MIS-11 as a key factor leading to higher volume losses. Importantly, the GIS does not reach equilibrium with the climatic forcing during either interglacial, which highlights the importance of the duration of enhanced climatic forcing on the survivability of the ice sheet in warm periods.",

Data acquired from several airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys in Alaska provide significant new insight into the spatial extent of permafrost over larger areas (hundreds to thousands of square kilometers) than can be mapped using ground-based geophysical methods or through drilling. We compare several AEM datasets from different areas of interior Alaska, and explore the capacity of these data to infer geologic structure, permafrost extent, and related hydrologic processes. We also assess the impact of fires on permafrost by comparing data from different burn years within similar geological environments. Ultimately, interpretations rely on understanding the relationship between electrical resistivity measured by AEM surveys and the physical properties of interest such as geology, permafrost, and unfrozen water content in the subsurface. These relationships are often ambiguous and non-unique, so additional information is useful for reducing uncertainty. Shallow (upper ~1m) permafrost and soil characteristics identified from remotely sensed imagery and field observations help to constrain and aerially extend near-surface AEM interpretations, where correlations between the AEM and remote sensing data are identified using empirical multivariate analyses. Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (sNMR) measurements quantify the contribution of unfrozen water at depth to the AEM-derived electrical resistivity models at several locations within one survey area. AEM surveys fill a critical data gap in the subsurface characterization of permafrost environments and will be valuable in future mapping and monitoring programs in cold regions.",

            "abstract": "Seismic signals near rivers are partially generated by sediment particles impacting the river bed as they are transported downstream. Predicting river channel evolution depends heavily upon understanding when and at what rate this sediment moves. We present two approaches to using these seismic signals to constrain sediment transport. First, we examine hysteresis in the relationship between 1-45 Hz seismic amplitude and flow depth over the course of individual flood events following the removal of a 13 m dam on the Chijiawan River in northern Taiwan. We compare two floods of similar magnitudes with and without bedload transport, and find that the seismic amplitude generated at a given flow depth changes over a single storm only when sediment transport is active. Along-stream variation in hysteresis for each storm appears to scale qualitatively with total sediment transport along the river, and reveals transport patterns consistent with a migrating sediment pulse that is a predicted consequence of the dam removal. Second, we examine the spectral signals of water turbulence, rain, and bedload sediment transport during flood events on the Erlenbach stream in Switzerland. We perform a general linear least squares inversion of the data and find that the signal generated by rain exhibits a roughly broadband spectrum, while discharge and sediment transport exhibit power primarily in lower frequency bands. Our results indicate that seismic signals near rivers may be used to track sediment transport.",

            "abstract": "Climate variability and projected future climate change has led to growing interest in understanding societal responses to changes in environmental conditions, and identifying societies that are particularly vulnerable or resilient to external shocks. To investigate this question it is instructive to look into the past, where we have examples of civilizational decline that have been hypothesized to be linked to climate variability or change. The Khmer Empire of the late 1st and early 2nd Millennium AD is an excellent example of a society that may have been affected by climate: After constructing the world’s largest urban area in pre-modern time at Angkor, the site was largely abandoned after ~600 years of occupation. To investigate the vulnerability and resilience of Southeast Asian societies and test hypotheses about the importance of climate impacts on societies, I developed a new process-based model of human subsistence and demography for preindustrial Southeast Asia. The model is driven by topography, soils, vegetation and climate, and accounts for the range of subsistence lifestyles that were present at the time, from semi-nomadic shifting cultivators to complex irrigation-based urban polities. I use high-resolution gridded climate reconstructions from the Southeast Asian Drought Atlas to modulate the baseline climate input data and simulate the effects of periodic drought on potential food production and overall landscape-level carrying capacity. Results show that subsistence lifestyle may have had a large influence on the vulnerability or resilience of a society to climate variability. Complex societies with a large built infrastructure were more vulnerable to excessive rainfall as opposed to drought, while drought most affected small-scale sedentary farming communities that lacked trade networks for basic foodstuffs. Shifting cultivators could generally survive periods of unfavorable climate by concentrating more on foraging to collect food as opposed to crop harvests. Initial results suggest that a combination of floods that damaged infrastructure, followed by drought that affected food production may have been at least in part responsible for the decline of the Angkor society.",

            "abstract": "the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is thought to be prone to marine instability in which prolonged grounding line retreat could occur due to inland downwards sloping bedrocks. However, this instability is difficult to model in part due to the absence of good parameterizations for melt-rates under ice-shelves, in particular near or at the grounding-line, where a complex interplay between butressing, melt-rate, water-pressure and internal stresses in the ice develops. In order to simulate such melt rates accurately, ice-sheet models need to be fully coupled to ocean models, in order to capture the feedback mechanisms between heat-flux at the ice/ocean interface and cavity shape driven by grounding-line retreat.\nHere, we show an example of such a coupling between the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) and the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm). The goal is to run sensitivity studies of the evolution of Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica. We quantify the impact of feedbacks between both systems by running short transients (20-100 years) of the coupled ice-sheet flow/ocean circulation model. We vary inputs such as far-field temperature of the Circumpolar Deep-Water, surface temperature of the Amundsen Sea Embayment, and far-field surface ice-flow velocity. Preliminary insights into the variability of the system are presented, as well as quantified impacts of variations in model inputs.\nThis work was performed at the California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under\na contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Cryosphere Science Program.",

If a non-polarimetric sensor has some polarization dependence, it can result in errors in the measured radiance. To correct the polarization-caused errors in satellite data, the polarization state of the reflected solar light must be known. In this presentation, recent studies of the polarized solar radiation from the ocean-atmosphere system with the adding-doubling radiative-transfer model (ADRTM) are reported. The modeled polarized solar radiation quantities are compared with PARASOL satellite measurements and DISORT model results. Sensitivities of reflected solar radiation’s polarization to various ocean-surface and atmospheric conditions are addressed. A novel super-thin cloud detection method based on polarization measurements is also discussed. This study demonstrates that the modeling can provide a reliable approach for making the spectral Polarization Distribution Models (PDMs) for satellite inter-calibration applications of NASA’s future Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) mission.\nKey words: Reflected solar radiation, polarization, correction of satellite data.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that during the polar springtime, halide sea salt ions, in particular Br-, are through a series of heterogeneous reactions photochemically activated into reactive halogen species, such as Br and BrO, that breakdown polar tropospheric ozone. This research investigated the role of blowing snow in transporting salts from the sea ice/snow surface into reactive bromine species in the air. For two different locations over first-year ice in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, collection baskets captured blowing snow at four different heights on October 25, following a blowing snow event the day before. In addition, sea ice cores and surface snow samples were collected throughout the month long campaign. Cl-/Br- ratios were constant in sea ice and surface snow, and only in lofted snow did bromide become depleted relative to chloride. This suggests that replenishment of bromide in the snowpack occurs faster than bromine activation in mid-strength wind conditions (approximately 10 m/s). Sulfate concentrations were stable through the bottom half of sea ice cores, but were quite variable in the upper half and in surface snow. Lofted snow was greatly depleted in sulfate, likely as a result of mirabilite precipitation in brine prior to brine uptake in the snow and subsequent lofting. Nitrate was found in greater quantities for upper level baskets and in some surface snow samples, consistent with active cycling through atmospheric chemical reactions.",

            "abstract": "Natural granular porous media found in geosciences applications are disordered at the pore scale, which contributes to the interesting behavior that they exhibit including hydrodynamic dispersion, capillary pressure and wetting behavior, and various types of fingering. Many standard equations and models that have been developed for transport in porous media are based on the assumption of uniform disorder, randomly distributed parameters, and isotropic behavior. However, factors that cause partial ordering (e.g., settling of oblong grains, alignment of elongated particles, or packing structures near a boundary) can lead to anomalous flow behavior relative to the base case, when in turn requires different ways to understand and describe transport. In this work we examine the packing structure and fluid flow patterns in packings of equilateral cylindrical particles that are packed in a tube. The detailed packing structures are obtained experimentally from microCT experiments, and the flow patterns are simulated by numerical solution of the Stokes equations using the finite element method. This research is of interest in chemical engineering because this type of packing is used in catalytic reactors. However, the structures are also interesting from both a fundamental perspective and as prototypes for partially ordered natural materials because the packings undergo a transition from fully disordered internally to highly structured at the wall, and therefore provide insight into differences caused by the ordering.",

            "abstract": "Playas are ephemeral desert wetlands situated at the bottom of closed catchments. Desert playas in the Southwestern US have not been intensively studied despite their potential importance for the functioning of desert ecosystems. We want to know which geomorphic and ecological variables control of the stock size of soil organic carbon, and soil total nitrogen in playas. We hypothesize that the magnitude of carbon and nitrogen stocks depends on: (a) catchment size, (b) catchment slope, (d) catchment vegetation cover, (e) bare-ground patch size, and (f) catchment soil texture. We chose thirty playas from across the Jornada Basin (Las Cruces, NM) ranging from 0.5-60ha in area and with varying catchment characteristics. We used the available 5m digital elevation map (DEM) to calculate the catchment size and catchment slope for these thirty playas. We measured percent cover, and patch size using the point-intercept method with three 10m transects in each catchment. We used the Bouyoucos-hydrometer soil particle analysis to determine catchment soil texture. Stocks of organic carbon and nitrogen were measured from soil samples at four depths (0-10 cm, 10-30 cm, 30-60 cm, 60-100 cm) using C/N combustion analysis. In terms of nitrogen and organic carbon storage, we found soil nitrogen values in the top 10cm ranging from 41.963-214.365 gN/m2, and soil organic carbon values in the top 10cm ranging from 594.339-2375.326 gC/m2. The results of a multiple regression analysis show a positive relationship between catchment slope and both organic carbon and nitrogen stock size (nitrogen: y= 56.801 +47.053, R2=0.621; organic carbon: y= 683.200 + 499.290x, R2= 0.536). These data support our hypothesis that catchment slope is one of factors controlling carbon and nitrogen stock in desert playas. We also applied our model to the 69 other playas of the Jornada Basin and estimated stock sizes (0-10cm) between 415.07-447.97 Mg for total soil nitrogen and 4627.99-5043.51 Mg for soil organic carbon.",

In addition to the documented increase in temperature, increases in light absorbing particulates deposited on glaciers could be contributing to the observed glacier loss. Here we present results of measurements of light absorbing particles from glaciers in Peru and Bolivia. Samples have been collected by American Climber Science Program volunteers and scientists at altitudes up to 6770 meters. Collected snow samples were melted and filtered in the field. A new inexpensive technique, the Light Absorption Heating Method (LAHM) has been developed for analysis of light absorbing particles collected on filters. Results from LAHM analysis are calibrated using filters with known amounts of fullerene soot, a common industrial surrogate for black carbon (BC). For snow samples collected at the same field location LAHM analysis and measurements from the Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) instrument are well correlated (r2 = 0.92). Co-located SP2 and LAHM filter analysis suggest that BC could be the dominant absorbing component of the light absorbing particles in some areas.",

            "abstract": "North Atlantic climate variability on decadal time scales is often characterised by basin-scale changes in sea surface temperature that are generally attributed to coherent changes in the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). However, this view is inconsistent with striking gyre contrasts in ocean heat content over the basin: the subtropics are often warm when the subpolar gyre is cool, and vice versa. Based on dynamical assimilations of historical data over the last 60 years, we explore how these gyre-scale changes in heat content are affected by the meridional overturning. The overturning anomalies often have opposing signs in each gyre and are excited by surface winds and associated air-sea heat fluxes. Stronger Trade winds warm the subtropical gyre through enhanced northward wind-driven heat transport. Simultaneous increases in mid-latitude westerly winds cool the Labrador Sea leading to denser waters spreading along the western boundary, which enhance the MOC at the subtropical/subpolar boundary and drive a warming of the subpolar gyre. Hence, the surface winds and buoyancy forcing imprint themselves on thermal and overturning anomalies in a different manner for each gyre.",

Icebergs are ubiquitous in Greenland’s outlet glacial fjords and provide a physical link between the glacier and the ocean into which they melt. The iceberg shape is influenced by glacier size and calving mechanics, while the amount of melt produced depends on ambient water properties and the residence time of the iceberg in the fjord. Here, we use hourly positions of icebergs tracked with helicopter deployed GPS sensors to calculate velocities in the Sermilik Fjord/Helheim Glacier system. Data comes from three summertime deployments in 2012-2014, where icebergs were tagged in the ice mélange and moved through the fjord and onto the continental shelf. The iceberg-derived velocities provide information on ice mélange movement, fjord variability, and coastal currents on the shelf. Using simple melt rate parameterizations, we estimate the total freshwater input due to iceberg melt in Sermilik Fjord based on the observed residence times and satellite-derived iceberg distributions. These observations complement conventional oceanographic and glaciological data, and can quickly, and relatively inexpensively, characterize circulation throughout any given glacier-ocean system.",

The island site, at 4 meters above sea level, sits close to the open ocean and is minimally impacted by terrestrial processes. Over the period of measurement, the mean δD value of near-surface water vapor (δDv) was -109.7±39.7‰, overlapping average tropospheric emissions satellite (TES) δDv values for the lower troposphere. We observed a 155‰ range in δDv values, coinciding with a transition through a Madden-Julian Oscillation event into a quiescent period. Low δDv values appear to reflect post-condensation exchange and the highest δDv values measured were in equilibrium with seawater δD. Of all surface meteorological variables, δDv was most strongly correlated with specific humidity, reflecting the importance of rainout and distillation in driving δDv values. During precipitation events, δDv dropped abruptly following maximum precipitation rates, likely due to mesoscale subsidence or rain evaporation.\nIntra-event δD values of precipitation (δDp) were most strongly correlated with δDv, and only weakly correlated with surface meteorological variables, highlighting the important role of δDv in controlling δDp values. We did not observe an amount effect through all precipitation events, as the lowest δDp values often lagged maximum precipitation rates. Precipitation deuterium excess values were significantly correlated with surface relative humidity and temperature, as well as cloud base height measurements, with higher deuterium excess values corresponding to higher cloud altitudes.",

            "abstract": "Representing the relationship between tropical cyclone intensity and the surrounding environment is key to projecting the way tropical cyclones change with the climate. However, capturing the complex relationship between tropical cyclone intensification, the surrounding environment, and storm characteristics may not be possible with simple linear regression models like SHIPS, especially for short forecast periods in risk models. Here, we move beyond simple linear modeling and apply methods that perform variable selection, determine if the data is a heterogeneous “mixture” of multiple features, and fit linear or nonlinear functions of predictors for a 6-hour forecast window. We also incorporate a new predictor, the Ventilation Index, which represents the surrounding environmental conditions in a way that is known to affect tropical cyclone intensity according to hurricane physics. The data used to construct the models comes from the IBTrACS WMO archive for TC-specific data and ERSST v3b and the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis for environmental variables from 1970-2010 in the North Atlantic. The two observed measures of intensity, the maximum sustained wind speed and minimum central pressure, are modeled jointly.\nFirst, we find that variable selection in both linear and nonlinear models does not significantly reduce the number of environmental predictors needed or improve the model R-squared. Second, mixture regression is applied to establish data groupings and their associated predictors. There is an increase in R-squared by 0.10 compared to the linear regression model that uses all possible variables as predictors. The number of environmental predictors decreases from 8 to 4 for wind intensification and to 2 for pressure intensification. When we further restrict the predictor pool to use only Ventilation Index to represent the environment, mixture modeling shows a 0.10 increase in R-squared. Then, allowing nonlinear relationships with predictors in a mixture model with Ventilation Index gives a further R-squared increase of 0.20. We show that mixture modeling is the best approach to create a climate-variant model for tropical cyclone intensity that can be used as part of a tropical cyclone risk model. The techniques may also be applied to other aspects of tropical cyclones, such as storm genesis and size.",

            "abstract": "Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration may change the isotopic signature of plant N by altering plant and microbial processes involved in the N cycle. Isotope fractionation theory and limited experimental evidence indicate that CO2 may increase leaf δ15N by increasing plant community productivity, C input to soil, and, ultimately, microbial mineralization of old, 15N-enriched organic matter. We predicted that foliar δ15N values would increase as a positive function of the CO2 effect on aboveground productivity (ANPP) of two grassland communities, a pasture dominated by a C4 exotic grass and assemblages of native tallgrass prairie species, the latter grown on each of three soils, a clay, sandy loam, and silty clay. Both grasslands are located in Texas, USA and were exposed to a pre-industrial to elevated CO2 gradient for four years. CO2 enrichment did not consistently increase both ANPP and δ15N. Increased CO2 stimulated ANPP of pasture and of prairie assemblages on each of the three soils. However, CO2 increased leaf δ15N only for prairie plants grown on a silty clay soil. CO2 enrichment led to a shift in dominance from a mid-grass (Bouteloua curtipendula) to a tallgrass prairie species (Sorghastrum nutans) that contributed to increased leaf δ15N on the silty clay soil by increasing ANPP and apparently stimulating mineralization of recalcitrant organic matter. By contrast, CO2 enrichment favored a forb species (Solanum dimidiatum) with higher δ15N values than the dominant grass (Bothriochloa ischaemum) in pasture. Results highlight the role of changes in community composition in CO2 effects on grassland δ15N values.",

            "abstract": "The Sun’s meridional flow can be measured with a variety of measurement techniques including, but not limited to: direct Doppler, magnetic feature tracking, velocity feature tracking, time-distance helioseismology, and ring-diagram analysis. Direct Doppler gives information on the flow in the photosphere while the other measurement techniques provide information about the flow at some depth or range of depths in the Sun’s convection zone. These various measurement methods now provide a converging (but not yet fully converged) picture of the meridional flow as a function of latitude, depth, and time. This converging picture has a flow which is poleward from the equator all the way to pole in the near surface layers, has an equatorward return flow beginning at a depth of about 50 Mm, and has another poleward branch deeper in the convection zone. The poleward flow in the near surface layers varies systematically in strength and latitudinal structure with the phase of the sunspot cycle and from one cycle to the next. This near surface meridional flow is observed to play a significant role in the poleward transport of the magnetic flux that emerges at the surface in the form of bipolar active regions. Variations in the strength and structure of the meridional flow introduce variations in the strength of the Sun’s polar fields, which in turn introduce variations in the size of subsequent sunspot cycles. The polar fields at the end of cycle 23 (2008-2009) were much weaker than the polar fields at the end of the previous cycles. This led to the production of the weakest sunspot cycle in 100 years – cycle 24. Surprisingly, we find that the variations we observed in the meridional flow during cycle 23 led to stronger polar fields than would have been produced otherwise. This suggests that variations in the meridional flow can be one mechanism for modulating the sizes of sunspot cycles – helping to keep them from getting too big or too small.",

            "abstract": "Contemporary methods focused on increasing urban sustainability are largely based on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. While these efforts are essential steps forward, continued characterization of urban sustainability solely within a biogeochemical framework, with neglect of the biophysical impact of the built environment, omits regional hydroclimatic forcing of the same order of magnitude as greenhouse gas emissions. Using a suite of continuous, multi-year and multi-member continental scale numerical simulations with the WRF model for the U.S., we examine hydroclimatic impacts for a variety of U.S. urban expansion scenarios (for the year 2100) and urban adaptation futures (cool roofs, green roofs, and a hypothetical hybrid approach integrating biophysical properties of both cool and green roofs), and compare those to experiments utilizing a contemporary urban extent. Widespread adoption of adaptation strategies exhibits regionally and seasonally dependent hydroclimatic impacts. For some regions and seasons, urban-induced warming in excess of 3°C can be completely offset by all adaptation approaches examined. For other regions, widespread adoption of some adaptation approaches leads to significant rainfall decline. Sustainable urban expansion therefore requires an integrated assessment that also incorporates biophysically induced urban impacts, and demands tradeoff assessment of various strategies aimed to ameliorate deleterious consequences of growth (e.g., urban heat island reduction).",

            "abstract": "There is no debate that hurricane activity in the North Atlantic has increased substantially since the relatively quiescent period of the 1970s and 1980s, but there is still uncertainty in the dominant cause of the increase. Increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases (aGHG) have contributed to the observed increase in tropical sea surface temperatures (SST) over the past century, while shorter-term decadal variability in regions where hurricanes form and track is generally dominated by 1) internal variability, 2) natural factors such as volcanic eruptions and mineral aerosol variability, and 3) changes in anthropogenic aerosols. Direct SST warming from globally well-mixed aGHG is understood to have a much smaller effect on hurricane formation and intensification compared to the effect of regional warming due to changes in the three factors noted above. While most recent papers implicate both internal and external anthropogenic causes for the presently heightened Atlantic hurricane activity, some show that internal variability dominates and others show that anthropogenic factors dominate.\nIn the Atlantic, model projection-based consensus indicates no change in storm frequency over the next century but the uncertainty is large and spans –50% to +50%. Mean storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase with continued warming, and the models tend to agree better when projecting these measures of activity. Models that are capable of producing very strong hurricanes usually project increases in the frequency of the most intense hurricanes. This measure is highly relevant to physical and societal impacts. In the Atlantic, model-based consensus indicates substantial increases in the strongest hurricanes, but the uncertainty is large and spans –100% to +200% change over the next century.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations have increased over the past decades and are linked to increasing global surface temperatures and climate change. To counteract the trend of increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, the state of California has passed the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB-32). This requires that by 2020, GHG (e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) emissions will be reduced to 1990 levels. Currently, California emits ~500 Tg yr-1 of CO2eq GHGs, with CO2 and CH4 contributing ~90% of the total. To quantify the success of AB-32, GHG emission rates must be more thoroughly quantified in California. Presently, uncertainties remain in the existing “bottom-up” emission inventories in California due to many contributing factors not being fully understood. To help alleviate these uncertainties, we have analyzed airborne GHG measurements and applied inverse modeling techniques to quantify GHG spatiotemporal concentration patterns and “top-down” emission rates.\nTo assess the magnitude/spatial variation of GHGs, and to identify local emission “hot spots”, airborne measurements of CO2 and CH4 were made by the Alpha Jet Atmospheric eXperiment (AJAX) in the boundary layer of the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA) and northern San Joaquin Valley (SJV) in Jan.-Feb. 2013 and July-Aug. 2014. To quantify/constrain GHG emissions we applied the WRF-STILT model and inverse modeling techniques, in conjunction with AJAX data, to estimate “top-down” SFBA/SJV GHG emission rates. Model simulations utilized source apportioned a priori CO2 and CH4 emission inventories from the Vulcan Project (including NASA Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (NASA-CASA) model CO2 biosphere fluxes) and the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurement (CALGEM) Project, respectively. Results from the evaluation of a priori and posterior GHG concentrations/emissions in northern California using AJAX data, along with the analysis of CO2 and CH4 concentration spatiotemporal patterns and source attribution, will be presented.",

In the presence of significant variabilities, accurate estimation of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) has gained more importance in view of the communication and navigation applications. In the present study, the ionospheric electron density as well as the profile thickness and shape parameters have been compared simultaneously for understanding the performance of the latest available IRI-2012 and NeQuick2 models over the equatorial and low latitude sectors. The ground based ionosonde data in conjunction with the ROCSAT measured in-situ electron density in the topside ionosphere have been used to derive the vertical electron density profiles over three identified locations in the Brazilian equatorial and low latitude sectors during the high solar activity year of 2002. These reconstructed profiles are used to compare with the IRI-2012 and NeQuick2 models derived vertical electron density profiles. The diurnal and seasonal variations of TEC, F-layer peak density (NmF2), F-layer peak height (hmF2), bottom side thickness parameter (B0), shape parameter (B1) and topside effective scale height (HT) have been studied to validate the IRI-2012 and NeQuick2 model simulations. It has been understand that these models underestimate the experimental TEC during day-time hours of the equinoctial and summer months of the high solar activity. The models show improved performance in the prediction of NmF2 and hmF2 compared to that of TEC during day-time hours. Further, it is observed that the IRI-2012 as well as the NeQuick2 models show considerable deviations in the estimation of the bottom side profile parameters while more discrepancies are observed in the prediction of topside effective scale height values particularly during day-time hours.",

One such\nchallenge is caused by the unknown model parameters that must be\ninferred from heterogeneous observational data, leading to an\nill-posed inverse problem and the need to quantify uncertainties in\nits solution. In this talk we discuss the problem of estimating the\nuncertainty in the solution of (large-scale) ice sheet inverse\nproblems within the framework of Bayesian inference. The ice flow is\nmodeled as a three-dimensional, creeping, viscous, incompressible,\nnon-Newtonian fluid via the nonlinear Stokes equations.\nSolving Bayesian inverse problems with expensive forward models and\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces is intractable on current and\nanticipated supercomputers. However, under the assumption of Gaussian\nnoise and prior probability densities, and after linearizing the\nparameter-to-observable map, the posterior density becomes Gaussian,\nand can therefore be characterized by its mean and covariance. The\nmean is given by the solution of a large-scale PDE-constrained\noptimization problem and the posterior covariance matrix is given by\nthe inverse of the Hessian of the regularized data misfit\nfunctional. Direct computation of the Hessian matrix is prohibitive,\nsince it would require solution of as many forward Stokes problems as\nthere are parameters. Therefore, we exploit the compact nature of the\ndata misfit component of Hessian and construct its low rank\napproximation, which can be constructed at a cost (measured in number\nof Stokes solves) that does not depend on the parameter or data\ndimensions, thus providing scalability to problem sizes of practical\ninterest.

            "abstract": "Seasonal runoff and sea-ice cover create highly dynamic estuarine conditions in the Arctic. Studies focusing on major systems such as the Mackenzie have demonstrated how these variables interact to influence nutrient supply and uptake dynamics. Far less is known about the seasonality of smaller estuarine systems in the Arctic. Data collected from lagoons along the eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast show that salinities range from near zero in the spring to as high as 50 in the winter. Runoff and sea-ice thaw in the spring create highly stratified conditions, with hyper-saline bottom waters persisting through the summer in some locations. These variations in physical conditions are accompanied by variations in nitrogen availability within the lagoons. High concentrations of ammonium, and to a lesser extent nitrate, build up under the ice during the winter months. These nutrients are rapidly depleted during the ice break-up period and remain low throughout the summer. Concentrations of organic nitrogen, on the other hand, peak during the ice break-up period. While river inputs contribute directly to this nitrogen peak through the supply of land-derived organic matter, fatty acid markers also show that locally produced organic matter (primarily diatoms) peaks during the ice break-up period. Seasonal changes in nitrogen are accompanied by distinct shifts in microbial community composition as well as changes in stable isotope values of metazoan consumers. Changes in climate that are altering both runoff and sea-ice have the potential to influence the quantity and timing of nutrient availability and associated biological production in arctic coastal waters.",

The efficacy of several current and potential landscape treatments to mitigate wildfire threats, along with the likely outcome of these treatments on mitigation of potential impacts of wildfire to drinking water treatment, are being modeled. A Monte Carlo modeling approach incorporating wildfire regime characteristics is used to simulate the ignition and growth of wildfires and generate outcome distributions for the different mitigation strategies. Cumulative changes in water quality at large river basin scales are being modeled and linked to water treatment impacts with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). A critical foundation of this approach is the close interaction of a large, trans-disciplinary team of researchers capable of integrating highly diverse issues of landscape wildfire dynamics, cross-scale water supply issues, and their linkage to downstream risks to drinking water treatment engineering.",

            "abstract": "The current tectonics across the Yukon and adjacent areas of western Northwest Territories (NWT) and northern British Columbia appear to be driven primarily by the Yakutat Terrane collision, an “indenter” in the corner of the Gulf of Alaska. GPS data show 1-10 mm/yr northward and eastward, decreasing inland. The rates from earthquake statistics are similar although there are important discrepancies. The eastern Cordillera earthquake mechanisms are mainly thrust in the Mackenzie Mountains of southwestern NWT where the Cordillera upper crust is overthrusting the craton. To the north, the mechanisms are mainly strike-slip in the Richardson Mountains that appear to lie along the edge of the craton. The deformation appears to be limited to the hot and weak Cordillera with the strong craton providing an irregular eastern boundary. For example, there is an eastward bow in the craton edge and the deformation in the Mackenzie Mountains. On the Beaufort Sea margin in the region of the Mackenzie Delta there appears to be a type of “subduction zone” with the continent very slowly overthrusting the oceanic plate, a process that has continued since at least the Cretaceous. A northward moving continental margin block is bounded by left lateral faulting in the west (Canning Displacement Zone of eastern Alaska) and right lateral faulting in the east (Richardson Mountains in eastern Yukon). There is almost no seismicity on this thrust belt but as for some other subduction zones such as Cascadia there is the potential for very infrequent great earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "A persistent layer of polluted air in the lower free troposphere over the Mojave Desert (California and Nevada) drives spring and summer surface ozone maxima as deep afternoon mixing delivers ozone and ozone precursors to surface measurement sites 200 km or more downwind of the mountains that separate the deserts from the heavily populated coastal areas of California. Pollutants in this elevated layer derive from California source regions (the Los Angeles megacity region and the intensive agricultural region of the San Joaquin Valley), and from long-range transport from Asia. Recognition of this poorly studied persistent layer explains and expands the significance of previously published reports of ozone and other pollutants observed in and over the Mojave Desert, resolves an apparent paradox in the timing of ozone peaks due to transport from the upwind basins, and provides a new perspective on the long-range downwind impacts of megacity pollution plumes.",

            "abstract": "Climate- and tectonic-driven environmental dynamics of the East African Rift System (EARS) during the Quaternary played an important role in the demographic history of early Homo sapiens, including expansions of modern humans across and out of Africa. Human forager population size, geographic range, and behaviors such as hunting strategies and residential mobility likely varied in response to changes in the local and regional environment. Throughout the Quaternary, floral and faunal change was linked at least in part to variations in moisture availability, temperature, and atmospheric CO2, which in addition to uplift and faulting, contributed to the expansion and contraction of a number of large lakes that served as biogeographic barriers to many taxa. This is particularly clear for the Lake Victoria basin, where biogeographic, geological, and paleontological evidence documents repeated expansion and contraction of the ranges of species in response to lake level and vegetation change. Across much of eastern Africa, the topography of the rift facilitated north-south dispersals, the timing of which may have depended in part on the expansion and contraction of the equatorial forest belt. Dispersal potential likely increased during the more arid periods of the late Quaternary, when the roles of lakes and forests as dispersal barriers was reduced and the extent of low net primary productivity dry grasslands increased, the latter requiring large home ranges for human foragers, conditions suitable for range expansions within H. sapiens.",

            "abstract": "There are many limitations involved with sampling microbial diversity from deep-sea subsurface environments, ranging from physical sample collection, low microbial biomass, culturing at in situ conditions, and inefficient nucleic acid extractions. As such, we are continually modifying our methods to obtain better results and expanding what we know about microbes in these environments. Here we present analysis of metagenomes sequences from samples collected from 120 m within the Louisville Seamount and from the top 5-10cm of the sediment in the center of the south Pacific gyre (SPG). Both systems are low biomass with ~102 and ~104 cells per cm3 for Louisville Seamount samples analyzed and the SPG sediment, respectively. The Louisville Seamount represents the first in situ subseafloor basalt and the SPG sediments represent the first in situ low biomass sediment microbial metagenomes. Both of these environments, subseafloor basalt and sediments underlying oligotrophic ocean gyres, represent large provinces of the seafloor environment that remain understudied.\nDespite the low biomass and DNA generated from these samples, we have generated 16 near complete genomes (5 from Louisville and 11 from the SPG) from the two metagenomic datasets. These genomes are estimated to be between 51-100% complete and span a range of phylogenetic groups, including the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and unclassified bacterial groups. With these genomes, we have assessed potential functional capabilities of these organisms and performed a comparative analysis between the environmental genomes and previously sequenced relatives to determine possible adaptations that may elucidate survival mechanisms for these low energy environments. These methods illustrate a baseline analysis that can be applied to future metagenomic deep-sea subsurface datasets and will help to further our understanding of microbiology within these environments.",

            "abstract": "Sediments recovered by the ICDP Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project provide a new perspective on the climate history of the Levant during the last interglacial period MIS5. They record the extreme impacts of an intense interglacial characterized by stronger insolation, warmer mean global temperatures, and higher sea-levels than the Holocene. Results show both extreme hyper-aridity during MIS5e, including an unprecedented drawdown of Dead Sea water levels, and the impacts of a strong precession-driven African monsoon responsible for a major sapropel event (S5) in the eastern Mediterranean.\nHyper-arid conditions at the beginning of MIS5e prior to S5 (~132-128 ka) are evidenced by halite deposition, indicating declining Dead Sea lake levels. Surprisingly, the hyper-arid phase is interrupted during the MIS5e peak (~128-120 ka), coinciding with the S5 sapropel, which is characterized by a thick (23 m) section of silty detritus (without any halite) whose provenance indicates southern-sourced wetness in the watershed. Upon weakening of the S5 monsoon (~120-115 ka), the return of extreme aridity resulted in an unprecedented lake level drawdown, reflected by massive salt deposition, and followed by a sediment hiatus (~115-100 ka) indicating prolonged low lake level. The resumption of section follows classic Levant patterns with more wetness during cooler MIS5b and hyper-aridity during warmer MIS5a.\nThe ICDP core provides the first evidence for a direct linkage between an intense precession-driven African monsoon and wetness at the high subtropical latitude (~30N) of the Dead Sea watershed. Combined with coeval deposition of Negev speleothems and travertines, and calcitification of Red Sea corals, the evidence indicates a wet climatic corridor that could facilitate homo sapiens migration out of Africa during the MIS5e peak. In addition, the MIS 5e hyper-arid intervals may provide an important cautionary analogue for the impact of future warming on regional water resources.",

            "abstract": "Approximately twice as much soil carbon is stored in the northern circumpolar permafrost zone than is currently contained in the atmosphere. Permafrost thaw, and the microbial decomposition of previously frozen organic carbon, is considered one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere in a warmer world. Yet, the rate and form of release is highly uncertain but crucial for predicting the strength and timing of this carbon cycle feedback this century and beyond. New insight brought together under a multi-year synthesis effort by the Permafrost Carbon Network helps constrain current understanding of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate, and provides a framework for newly developing research initiatives in this region. A newly enlarged soil carbon database continues to verify the widespread pattern of large quantities of carbon accumulated deep in permafrost soils. The known pool of permafrost carbon is now estimated to be 1330-1580 Pg C, with the potential for ~400 Pg C in deep permafrost sediments that remain largely unquantified. Laboratory incubations of these permafrost soils reveal that a significant fraction of this material can be mineralized by microbes and converted to CO2 and CH4 on time scales of years to decades, with decade-long average losses from aerobic incubations ranging from 6-34% of initial carbon. Variation in loss rates is depended on the carbon to nitrogen ratio, with higher values leading to more proportional loss. Model scenarios show potential C release from the permafrost zone ranging from 37-174 Pg C by 2100 under the current climate warming trajectory (RCP 8.5), with an average across models of 92±17 Pg C. Furthermore, thawing permafrost C is forecasted to impact global climate for centuries, with models, on average, estimating 59% of total C emissions after 2100. Taken together, greenhouse gas emissions from warming permafrost appear likely to occur at a magnitude similar to other historically important biospheric C sources, such as land use change, but that is only a fraction of current fossil fuel emissions. Permafrost C emissions are likely to be felt over decades to centuries as northern regions warm, making climate change happen even faster than we think based on projected emissions from human activities alone.",

Consequently, most thermospheric models could not predict the direction of the high-latitude winds at geomagnetically quiet times, nor could they predict the depth of the thermospheric density minimum at the last solar minimum in the year 2009.

            "abstract": "Studies of the stable isotopic composition of Earth’s mantle for major rock-forming elements other than oxygen are rapidly expanding to new elements but much uncertainty remains as to what those measurements have to tell about the evolution of our planet. Iron is particularly interesting because it possess three oxidation states (metallic Fe0, ferrous Fe2+, and ferric Fe3+) that were partially separated during core formation and crust extraction. We have used the synchrotron technique of NRIXS to measure the mean force constant of iron bonds in geologically relevant silicate glasses, olivine and spinels. The mean force constant directly controls equilibrium isotopic fractionation at high temperature. The Fe force constant measured in these glasses increases linearly with Fe3+/Fetot ratio measured by conventional Mössbauer spectroscopy. The NRIXS results reveal a 0.2 to 0.4 permil equilibrium fractionation on 56Fe/54Fe ratio between Fe2+ and Fe3+ end-members in basalt, andesite, dacite glasses and spinels at magmatic temperatures. For reference, iron isotopic analyses routinely achieve precisions better than ±0.03 permil. Water saturation and pressure up to 9 GPa do not affect the force constants significantly. Structural changes and potential anharmonicity effects will be evaluated in the future by measuring samples at higher temperature. Our results demonstrate for the first time that stable isotope variations of Fe, and of possibly other heterovalent elements such as Ti, V Eu, Cr, Ce, or U, record redox and structural changes in igneous rocks.",

In a theoretical context, this study assumes that optimal water and land uses in local food production to maximize food security and social welfare at the global level can be driven by global trade. It follows the context of “virtual resources trade”, i.e., utilizing international trade of agricultural commodities to reduce dependency on local resources, and achieves land and water savings in the world. An optimization model based on the partial equilibrium of agriculture is developed for the analysis, including local commodity production and land and water resources constraints, demand by country, and global food market. Through the model, the marginal values (MVs) of social welfare for water and land at the level of so-called food production units (i.e., sub-basins with similar agricultural production conditions) are derived and mapped in the world. In this personation, we will introduce the model structure, explain the meaning of MVs at the local level and their distribution around the world, and discuss the policy implications for global communities to enhance global food security. In particular, we will examine the economic values of water and land under different world targets of food security (e.g., number of malnourished population or children in a future year). In addition, we will also discuss the opportunities on data to improve such global modeling exercises.",

            "abstract": "We used high-resolution radiometrics and aeromagnetic data to investigate the Precambrian Singo Igneous Complex (SIC) in Uganda. The SIC covers an area of about 700 km² and is host to hydrothermally formed economic minerals such as Gold and Tungsten. The distribution of the ore deposits is not well known and current mine workings are limited to the western margins of the complex. Our objectives were to (1) provide a detailed geological map of the SIC and surrounding, (2) investigate relationships between preserved intrusive bodies and Precambrian tectonic structures to provide insight into emplacement of the complex, (3) examine links between magma emplacement, discontinuities and hydrothermal alteration (4) generate two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) models of the complex to understand its subsurface geometry, (5) investigate the relationship between the structure of the SIC and mineral occurrences as an aid to future exploration programs. Edge enhancement filters such as the analytical signal, vertical and tilt derivatives were applied to the magnetic data. In addition, 2-D and 3-D models were produced using Geosoft’s GM-SYS 2-D and Voxi modules. The filtered data provided unprecedented structural details of the complex and revealed the following: (1) the edge of the SIC is characterized by higher magnetic susceptibility and Thorium content than its interior, (2) the SIC is characterized by eight to nine nested ring complexes with diameters ranging from 2.5 to 14 km, (3) the 3-D inversion suggests near vertical walls for the ring complexes extending to a depth of about 7 km, (4) the SIC was emplaced within a Precambrian folded basement and was traversed by numerous NW-trending dykes and (5) present day mining activities are concentrated within the folded basement units although occurrences of Tungsten and Gold are found associated with the highly magnetized edge of the ring complexes. We interpret the highly magnetized edges of the nested ring complexes as crystallization of ascending magma and hydrothermal fluids into near vertical ring fractures resulting from the collapse of the roof of magma chambers. We suggest that although not currently explored, the highly magnetized edges of the ring complexes represent potential areas for mineral extraction similar to other ring complexes worldwide.",

            "abstract": "The titanomagnetite (TM) solid solution (Fe3-xTixO4, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1) is one of the most important natural magnetic minerals used in paleomagnetic studies. Natural TMs with Mg- and Al-substitution have recently been shown to have Curie temperatures (TC) that vary strongly with thermal history, and these variations have been indirectly linked to cation reordering in the crystal lattice (Bowles et al. 2013). Here we present the first direct evidence for cation reordering linked to these TC variations. We have synthesized TMs with varying degrees of Mg2+ and Al3+ substitution to better understand the mechanism at work in the natural samples. TC was determined by measuring magnetic susceptibility as function of temperature under Argon atmosphere. Isothermal annealing experiments between 10-1 to 103 h at temperatures between 300-500°C were conducted. Subsequent TC measurements showed that TC on warming increases for longer anneal times and higher anneal temperatures, whereas TC on cooling decreases. These resulting TC changes can be linked to cation ordering within the crystal structure. Splits of the same samples were studied via X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), which is sensitive to both Fe valence state and site occupancy. Preliminary results suggest differences in Fe2+/Fe3+ site occupancy for samples of different compositions for different annealing treatments. Using the data collected for these synthetic samples we hope to gain further insight into the complex relationship between thermal history and cation distribution leading to changes in TC. So far, our understanding of the acquisition of thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) in TMs is predicated on the assumption that TC is a constant only depending on the mineral composition. However, the distribution of the magnetic Fe2+ and Fe3+ cations within the crystal lattice has a strong influence on the value of TC and cation (dis-)/ordering processes can result in large changes in TC. In natural samples, reordering results in changes in TCof up to >150°C on timescales and at temperatures relevant to both geological and laboratory processes. Thus, the cation reordering has major implications for the acquisition, retention, and demagnetization of partial TRM and thermoviscous remanence and may have an impact on many paleomagnetic studies using natural TMs.",

A collection of mainly empirical forensic techniques has been successfully developed over many years to obtain source information on explosions from their seismic signatures (e.g. Bowers and Selby, 2009). However a lesson from the three DPRK declared nuclear explosions since 2006, is that our historic collection of data may not be representative of future nuclear test signatures (e.g. Selby et al., 2012). To have confidence in identifying future explosions amongst the background of other seismic signals, and accurately estimate their yield, we need to put our empirical methods on a firmer physical footing. Goals of current research are to improve our physical understanding of the mechanisms of explosion generation of S- and surface-waves, and to advance our ability to numerically model and predict them.\nAs part of that process we are re-examining regional seismic data from a variety of nuclear test sites including the DPRK and the former Nevada Test Site (now the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS)). Newer relative location and amplitude techniques can be employed to better quantify differences between explosions and used to understand those differences in term of depth, media and other properties. We are also making use of the Source Physics Experiments (SPE) at NNSS. The SPE chemical explosions are explicitly designed to improve our understanding of emplacement and source material effects on the generation of shear and surface waves (e.g. Snelson et al., 2013). Finally we are also exploring the value of combining seismic information with other technologies including acoustic and InSAR techniques to better understand the source characteristics. Our goal is to improve our explosion models and our ability to understand and predict where methods of identifying explosions and estimating their yield work well, and any circumstances where they may not.",

            "abstract": "We documented a strengthening relationship between boreal winter sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the western North Pacific (WNP) and the development of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the following year. The increased WNP-ENSO association emerged in the mid 20th century and has grown through the present, reaching correlation coefficients as high as ~0.70 in recent decades. Fully coupled climate experiments with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) replicate the WNP-ENSO association and indicate that greenhouse gases (GHG) are largely responsible for this observed increase. We speculate that shifts in the location of the largest positive SST trends between the subtropical and tropical western Pacific impacts the low-level circulation in a manner that reinforces the link between the WNP and the development of ENSO. A strengthened GHG-driven relationship with the WNP provides an example of how anthropogenic climate change may directly influence the ENSO cycle. One such example is the initiation of 2013-2014 California drought, which was accompanied by an anomalous high-amplitude ridge system. The anomalous ridge was found to emerge from continual sources of Rossby wave energy in the WNP starting in late summer, and subsequently intensified into winter. The ridge generated a surge of wave energy downwind and deepened further the media-called \"polar vortex\" in the northeast U.S., forming a dipole. The dipole is not linked directly with either ENSO or Pacific Decadal Oscillation; instead it is correlated with the aforementioned ENSO precursor. The connection between the dipole and ENSO precursor has become stronger since the 1970s, and this is attributed to increased GHG loading as simulated by the CESM. Therefore, there is a traceable anthropogenic warming footprint in the enormous intensity of the anomalous ridge during winter 2013-14, the associated drought and its intensity.",

            "abstract": "Diffuse auroral precipitation is the major source of ionospheric conductivity at high latitudes, and the resulting global distribution of enhanced conductivity affects the penetration of magnetospheric electric fields and plasma transport into the inner magnetosphere. Recent work has demonstrated that diffuse auroral precipitation is caused by resonant scattering of plasma sheet electrons due to a combination of both electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves and electromagnetic whistler mode chorus emissions. Each class of wave is excited, predominantly on the dawn side of the magnetosphere, following the convective injection and gradient drifting of plasma sheet electrons into the inner magnetosphere. During geomagnetically active periods, the resultant electron scattering can approach the limit of strong diffusion, and the timescale for scattering loss into the atmosphere becomes shorter than the time for transport of plasma to the dayside. This leads to a pronounced day/night asymmetry in the diffuse auroral precipitation and a localized enhancement in conductivity in the post midnight sector. Quantifying the rate of diffuse auroral scattering by each class of wave is therefore imperative for understanding the global distribution of enhanced ionospheric conductivity and its non-linear feedback on plasma transport in the inner magnetosphere. Recent attempts to model the observed global distribution of waves and the associated pattern of electron precipitation will be discussed.",

The low inclination orbit caused the perigee to advance through all local times in about 67 days allowing seasonal sampling of ionospheric temperature (Ti), density, and composition. Here we examine the variations of these quantities as a function of altitude, local time, and solar cycle. The time period immediately following launch had unusually low solar activity with F10.7 cm radio fluxes consistently around 70 sfu. This condition resulted in a cold (Ti ~600 K in the pre-dawn region) low-density ionosphere near the spacecraft’s 400 km perigee altitude and a low O+/H+ transition height. In contrast, by 2012 the average F10.7 was ~130 sfu and only in the pre-dawn region (Ti ~ 800K) did the transition height drop below the spacecraft’s 800 km apogee. Using the IRI-2012 model we observe that Ti varies between the neutral temperature at low altitudes at night and the electron temperature (Te) in the morning above 500 km. At all levels of solar activity there is a midday trough in Ti. In the 400-650 km altitude range it is observed that Ti is actually higher in the daytime during the low solar activity period of 2008-2009 than in the moderate solar activity period of 2011-2012.",

            "abstract": "Observations of ancient fault zones and results of high temperature friction experiments indicate that silica redistribution influences the rate (response to velocity increases) and state (time-dependent healing) behavior of megathrusts. The Kodiak Accretionary Complex in Alaska has four shear zones that record plate boundary deformation: the Ghost Rocks mélange, the Uganik thrust, the Uyak mélange, and the central belt of the Kodiak Formation. All these examples of underplated rocks represent top-toward-the-trench shear zones that extend along the plate margin for 100’s of kms. The first three examples were accreted within the seismogenic zone and record a progressive history from stratal disruption and particulate flow to localized shearing on pervasive web-like arrays of scaly microfaults in shales. Microfaults show evidence for silica dissolution and local reprecipitation in dilational stepovers and in intensely veined sandstone blocks. The fourth example (the central belt) was accreted further downdip, and these rocks have pervasive, regularly spaced en echelon quartz vein systems. Microstructures within veins indicate periodic cracking and sealing during progressive simple shear. Silica depletion zones adjacent to veins indicate diffusive transport of silica in response to local chemical potential gradients. A simple 1-D transport-kinetics model indicates that cracks in this case could be filled with quartz in less than a year and in as little as a week. Rock friction experiments on lithologies similar to Kodiak examples depict three distinct regimes of frictional behavior as a function of increasing temperature, with velocity weakening in a T range that can be related to the seismogenic zone. These three regimes are predicted by a model for gouge deformation that includes thermally activated pressure solution during shear of quartz grains embedded in a foliated matrix. The slip instabilities that characterize the seismogenic zone may therefore be related in part to grain scale diffusive mass transfer of silica. The observations of Kodiak Fault zones indicate that silica redistribution also plays an important role in the interseismic period through crack healing and dissolution of silica, both along the plate interface and within the adjacent rocks that store elastic strain.",

They are anti-correlated on a global scale, (2) the NO enhancement covers a wider longitude and latitude region than O/N2 depletion on a local scale. The similarity between O/N2 depletion and NO enhancement on global scale is due to storm-time equatorward meridional wind that brings both O/N2 depleted and NO enhanced air from high to low latitudes. The altitude dependence of the storm-time meridional wind, different peaks altitudes of the local O/N2 and NO variations, and long life time of NO (one day or longer) may explain the different behaviors of O/N2 and NO on a local scale.",

The NMME, with its suite of diverse models, provides a valuable opportunity for characterizing forecast confidence using probabilistic forecasts. The current experimental probabilistic forecast product presents the most likely tercile-based class for the monthly mean value, out of “above normal”, “near normal”, or “below normal”, using a non-parametric counting method to determine the probability of each class. A first-order bias correction is applied when the local model climatology is removed and replaced with the climatology from observations; the counting method also corrects for gross biases in distribution, such as the standard deviation. In preparation for the development of more precise calibration methods, the skill of the monthly-mean and three-month-mean probabilistic forecasts of 2 m surface temperature, precipitation rate, and sea-surface temperature is assessed using the 29-year (1982-2010) NMME hindcast database. Three configurations are considered: a full six-model NMME, CFSv2 alone (24 members), and a 24-member “mini-MME”, comprised of four members from each of the six models. Skill is assessed using the Brier skill score and ranked probability score; forecast reliability is also assessed. For 2 m surface temperature and SST, assessed in the hindcast study, it is found that probabilistic forecasts using the full NMME have higher skill and reliability than the “mini-MME”, which in turn have higher skill and reliability than the CFSv2 alone. Verification of the real-time probabilistic forecasts is also reviewed.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the controls on chemical erosion rates in eroding landscapes is of wide interest because chemical erosion influences nutrient supply, landscape evolution, soil production, and Earth’s long-term climate. Several field studies have suggested that chemical erosion rates increase in proportion to the rates that minerals are supplied to the regolith, a condition known as supply-limited chemical erosion. This condition, if broadly applicable, implies strong tectonic control of silicate weathering rates and hence Earth’s long-term climate. While it is plausible that chemical erosion rates should scale with supply rates, attempts to test whether chemical erosion rates are in fact supply-limited at any given site are hampered by several difficulties. For instance, the quantities that are most frequently used to test for supply limitation (i.e., rates of chemical erosion and denudation in regolith-based studies, and fluxes of sediment and solutes in river-based studies) are artifactually correlated, which complicates attempts to regress one variable against another. Here we present a statistical method for testing for supply-limited chemical erosion, and we apply this method to a number of published datasets. Our results suggest that many datasets are inadequate for determining whether chemical erosion in regolith is or is not supply-limited, largely because the uncertainties on the regression parameters are large. This in turn suggests that new measurements across a wide range of supply rates are needed to determine the strength of tectonic controls on chemical erosion, and, ultimately, to test hypotheses about feedbacks between surface processes, silicate weathering, and the long-term evolution of Earth’s climate.",

However, the other half of the eco-morphodynamic feedback—the effects that landscape formation processes have on ecosystem processes—has received focus more recently. Only by studying the couplings in both directions between biological and physical processes simultaneously can we understand the mechanisms important in shaping many landscapes. Here I will illustrate this point with representative examples from recent literature. Although the two-way coupling is essential in landscapes as large and slowly changing as mountain ranges, coastal landscapes provide clear and instructive examples, largely because of the relatively short timescales for landscape/ecosystem evolution in many coastal environments.",

            "abstract": "Precisely dating climate proxies is central to the reconstruction of past climate variations. To a degree, all climate proxies are affected by age uncertainties, which are seldom quantified. In this talk we describe a new probabilistic age model for proxies based on layer-counted chronologies, and explore its use for annually-banded corals. The model considers both missing and doubly-counted growth increments (represented as independent processes), accommodates various assumptions about error rates, and allows one to quantify the impact of chronological uncertainties on different diagnostics of variability. In the case of a single coral record, we find that time uncertainties primarily affect high-frequency signals and bias the estimate of decadal signals in ways that can be corrected.\nIn multiple dimensions, however, such uncertainties compound in unexpected ways. We illustrate this using a synthetic pseudocoral network, quantifying the effect of chronological uncertainties on the estimation of spatiotemporal patterns of variability. Even for small error rates, the amplitude of multidecadal variability is systematically overestimated at the expense of interannual variability (ENSO, in this case), artificially flattening its spectrum at periods longer than 10 years. We close with a discussion of possible extensions of this model and connections to existing strategies for modeling age uncertainties.",

The first half of the project focused on field relations in basaltic lava flows from the 1984 Krafla Fires eruption in northern Iceland. Students gained valuable experience in the collection of observations and samples in the field leading to hypotheses for the formation of selected features related to lava flow dynamics. Studies focused on a wide range of features including: morphology and heat loss in lava tubes (pyroducts), growth and collapse of lava ponds and overflow deposits, textural changes of lava falls (flow over steep steps), spaced spatter cones from flows over wet ground, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility related to flow kinematics. In the second half of the program students designed, helped execute, documented, and analyzed features similar to those they studied in the field with large-scale (50-250 kg) basaltic lava flows created in the Syracuse University Lava Project (\nhttp://lavaproject.syr.edu\n). Data collected included video from multiple perspectives, infrared thermal (FLIR) images, still images, detailed measurements of flow dimensions and rates, and samples for textural and magnetic analyses. Experimental lava flow features provided critical tests of hypotheses generated in the field and a refined understanding of the behavior and final morphology of basaltic lava flows. The linked field and experimental studies formed the basis for year-long independent research projects under the supervision of their faculty mentors, leading to senior theses at the students’ respective institutions.",

A series of autoclave experiments were conducted to react shale samples from major oil and gas shales with synthetic HF containing various additives. To better determine mineral dissolution and precipitation at the rock-fluid interface, ion-milling technique was applied to create extremely flat rock surfaces that were examined before and after the autoclave experiments using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detectors. This method is able to reveal a level of detail not observable on broken surface or mechanically polished surface. It allows direct comparison of the same mineral and organic matter particles before and after the reaction experiments. Minerals undergone dissolution and newly precipitated materials are readily determined by comparing to the exact locations before reaction. The dissolution porosity and the thickness of precipitates can be quantified by tracing and measuring the geometry of the pores and precipitates.

From the SABER radiances, we determine the radiative cooling by CO2, solar heating by O3 and O2, and chemical heating from a suite of exothermic reactions over the vertical range of 65-100 km. In addition, we derive amounts of several constituents of those chemical reactions and are able to determine bounds on a key parameter in the energy calculation, atomic oxygen. In general we find the global annual mean heating and cooling to be in balance within the measurement uncertainties. This is because the atomic oxygen concentrations derived from SABER are at the maximum, radiatively allowed limit. The results will be discussed in terms of the absolute energy balance and its variation with the solar cycle. In general the changes in radiative cooling appear consistent with changes in solar and chemical heating over the solar cycle.

It has been suggested that subsurface geologic structure is also an important factor controlling barrier island morphology and long-term island evolution, yet the precise role of antecedent geology on the response and recovery of barrier islands to hurricanes and sea-level rise remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to provide more detailed insight into the role of the antecedent geology on barrier island evolution at two sites along the Texas, USA coast: Follets Island and a portion of North Padre Island. Alongshore and across-island ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic inductance (EMI) surveys are used in this study to infer subsurface geologic structure. The accuracy of the interpreted geophysical survey data was assessed using selective vibracoring. Information about island morphology is derived from airborne and terrestrial LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). Preliminary results suggest that dune height is generally lower and washover frequency higher in areas where the antecedent geologic surface is deeper. Another important factor influencing dune breaching and washover locations is offshore bathymetry. The barrier island is generally narrower in areas where an offshore swale is present. The antecedent geologic structure is an important factor influencing barrier island morphology.

            "abstract": "The atmosphere is a primary pathway by which mercury (Hg) enters ecosystems. To adequately assess the risk to humans and wildlife the chemistry of atmospheric Hg must be understood, along with the processes controlling deposition and assimilation into ecosystems. Given current high uncertainties with the Tekran analytical system used to measure gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM) and particulate bound Hg (PBM) recent work has combined these for data analyses as Reactive Hg (RM). GOM measurements using this system are biased low due to lack of efficient collection of different compounds and interferences with water vapor and ozone. Because of this, estimation of GOM dry deposition to ecosystems using concentrations derived from this instrument in models are biased low, and dry deposition measured with surrogate surfaces are typically higher than model values. It is likely that different compounds of GOM are present in the atmosphere. These will have different chemical and physical properties that will influence atmospheric behavior. Field and laboratory results have shown that a new active Hg collection system using membranes collected higher GOM concentrations than the Tekran KCl-coated denuder. Field data from 5 locations showed that different GOM compounds were present across space and time.\nMore work is needed to calibrate existing methods and develop methods to measure GOM. New approaches include collection of GOM on a membrane to determine concentrations; couple this with a ramp heating thermo-desorption through a pyrolyzer into a Tekran 2537, or GC-MS, to understand the chemistry of GOM compounds; and passive samplers for long-term global Hg monitoring of GOM. Lastly, during the NOMADSS/SAS experiment 2 Hg analyzers were used, with one having a cation exchange membrane and the other a pyrolyzer in-line to get GOM by difference. In all cases, calibration sources must be used to understand the GOM collection and recovery efficiency.",

            "abstract": "In this study we examine the leading modes of submonthly variability of the SPCZ. A December-Feburary covariance EOF analysis of OLR is used to identify the leading modes of convective variability on submonthly time scales. An important modulator of the SPCZ is shown be related to equatorial Rossby (ER) modes, which are westward propagating features with a spectral peak in the 10-40 day period range (Wheeler and Kiladis, 1999). It is useful, therefore, to also take advantage space-time filtering techniques, so for instance, we filter for westward moving 10-96 day variability as well as westward and eastward less than 30 day variability for portions of this analysis. This procedure typically generates EOF pairs that represent propagating disturbances. Reanalysis data are projected onto the principal components of each mode at lag to investigate the evolution of large scale dynamical and thermodynamical fields associated with each mode. In all cases using less than 30 day filtering, clear evidence of ER modes are seen, with SPCZ convection occurring from the equator to around 10S associated with “cyclone pair” and associated equatorial westerly wind burst circulations. These features propagate westward at around 5 m/s phase speed. However, when higher frequency data are used instead, such as less than 10 day filtered Tb, mixed Rossby-gravity modes are evident, which propagate much faster and are characterized by antisymmetric convective signals between the SPCZ and the Northern Hemisphere ITCZ at a similar longitude. All of these cases are also shown to have strong associations with extratropical storm track activity. When looking at SPCZ variability poleward of around 15S, the primary modes are also characterized by strong extratropical signals, but in this case the interpretation is more straightforward: convection in the diagonal portion of the SPCZ can be forced by transient activity within the Southern Hemisphere storm track. This forcing is generally characterized by upward motion and cloudiness ahead of upper level troughs, which frequently leads to a northwest-southeast oriented cloud band typical of the poleward side of the SPCZ. In these cases, simple quasi-geostrophic arguments can be applied to explain the dynamical relationship between precipitation and the large scale circulation.\n ",

            "abstract": "Vertically aggrading sinuous channels constitute a basic building block of modern submarine fans and the greater continental slope. Interpretation of seismically imaged channels reveals a significant diversity in internal architecture, as well as important similarities and differences in the evolution of submarine channels relative to better studied rivers. Many submarine channel cross sections possess a ‘gull wing’ shape. Successive stacking of such channels demonstrates that systematic bank erosion is not required in order for lateral migration to occur. The lateral shift of such aggrading channels, however, is expected to be much less dynamic than in the case of terrestrial rivers. Recent high-resolution 3D seismic data from offshore Angola and an upstream segment of the Bengal Submarine Fan show intensely meandering channels that experience considerable lateral shifting during periods of active migration within submarine valleys. The cross sections of the actively migrating channels are similar to meandering river channels characterized by an outer cut-bank and inner-bank accretion.\nIn submarine channels, the orientation of the secondary flow can be river-like or river-reverse depending on the channel gradient, cross sectional shape, and the adaptation length of the channel bend. In river channels, a single circulation cell commonly occupies the entire channel relief, redistributing the bed-load sediment across the channel, and influencing the thread of high velocity and thus the plan-form evolution of the channel. In submarine environments, the height of the circulation cell will be significantly smaller than channel relief, thus leading to development of lower relief point bars from bed-load transport. Nevertheless these “underfit” bars may play an important role in plan-form evolution of submarine channels.\n In rivers and submarine channels, the inclined surface accretion can be constructed via pure bed-load, suspended-load, or a combination of both transport types. The in-channel suspended-load deposition occurs at sites of flow separation along the inner banks of bends. The relative contribution of inner-bank deposition from bed-load versus suspended load affects the plan-form evolution of both river and submarine channels.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas contribute ~75% of fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff) emissions, and city governments are often leading the way in emission reduction efforts. As emissions are regulated and assigned a price, there is an increasing need to independently evaluate the reported bottom-up emissions and to attribute them to specific source sectors (e.g. electricity production, industry, vehicles). We demonstrate how multispecies atmospheric observations can be used to achieve this.\nThe Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) aims to develop and evaluate methods for detection and attribution of urban GHG fluxes. The INFLUX observation network includes twelve towers measuring in situ CO2 and CO and flask measurements of another 50 species. 14CO2 measurements have shown that in winter, the total CO2 enhancement over Indianapolis approximates the CO2ff added. This somewhat surprising result allows us to use the wintertime in situ total CO2 and CO measurements to determine the observed CO:CO2ff ratio (RCO) at high resolution. First, we demonstrate that the USEPA CO inventory for Indianapolis overestimates CO emissions by a factor of about 2.5. Then we use the Hestia bottom-up CO2ff data product and revised characteristic RCO values for each CO2ff source sector to predict the diurnal cycle in RCO for Indianapolis. The tower observations and bottom-up RCO estimates are consistent during the daytime, but the observed RCO is significantly higher than the bottom-up estimate during the night. We show how the bottom-up and top-down methods can be used together to determine the cause of this discrepancy and improve CO2ff estimates from both methods.",

            "abstract": "The Indian Ocean tsunami (IOT) devastated several countries of North Indian Ocean. India is one of the worst affected countries after Indonesia and Sri Lanka. In India, Tamil Nadu suffered maximum with fatalities exceeding 8,000 people. Historical records show that tsunami has invaded the shores of Tamil Nadu in the past and has made people realize that the tsunami threat looms over Tamil Nadu and it is necessary to evolve strategies for tsunami threat management. The IOT has brought to light that tsunami inundation and runup varied within short distances and for the disaster management for tsunami, large scale maps showing areas that are likely to be affected by future tsunami are identified. Therefore threat assessment for six villages including Mamallapuram (also called Mahabalipuram) which is famous for its rock-cut temples, from the northern part of Tamil Nadu state of India has been carried out and threat maps categorizing the coast into areas of different degree of threat are prepared. The threat was assessed by numerical modeling using TUNAMI N2 code considering different tsunamigenic sources along the Andaman – Sumatra trench. While GEBCO and C-Map data was used for bathymetry and for land elevation data was generated by RTK – GPS survey for a distance of 1 km from shore and SRTM for the inland areas. The model results show that in addition to the Sumatra source which generated the IOT in 2004, earthquakes originating in Car Nicobar and North Andaman can inflict more damage. The North Andaman source can generate a massive tsunami and an earthquake of magnitude more than Mw 9 can not only affect Tamil Nadu but also entire south east coast of India. The runup water level is used to demarcate the tsunami threat zones in the villages using GIS.",

            "abstract": "The last two years have seen the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the third US National Climate Assessment (NCA). In addition to these high profile climate assessments, many regional, state, and municipal entities are leveraging the emerging climate science and scaling the process and the data to develop climate assessments relevant to decision making at sub-national scales. One such example is the assessment Climate Change in Colorado: A Synthesis to Support Water Resources Management and Adaptation. The report (released in August 2014) expands and updates an earlier Climate Change in Colorado assessment that was published in October 2008.\nThe 2008 Colorado assessment took a hybrid approach to assessment, marrying the IPCC Working Group I focus on physical science, with the adaptation components raditionally embedded within Working Group II. The Colorado assessment approach included the transparency and open review that underpin the credibility of the IPCC and NCA processes. A modest amount of original research was undertaken, which is a slight deviation from the IPCC and NCA processes. The state-based process also used a co-production model that engages users directly at the outset of the process. The 2008 and 2014 reports used the same process, but the newer assesment is vastly expanded in scope.\nThe efficacy of the process is demonstrated by the use of the Colorado assessments by decision makers. The science in the 2008 report supported the Colorado State Drought Plan, Climate Adaptation Plans for several Colorado Counties, and the State Water Supply Initiative. Components of the 2014 assessment have been used as the science basis for Denver's Climate Adaptation Plan.\nDecisions that involve climate adaptation tend to happen at sub-regional scales. Consequently, IPCC and NCA documents are not as informative for adaptation planning at regional and state scales as localized assessments. This does not diminish the importance of the IPCC and NCA. Without concerted effort at larger scales, the rich pool of climate science available to inform efforts at smaller scales would not exist. Ensuring that processes are implemented that connect climate assessment at multiple scales will ensure the value of climate assessments in decision making.",

Quarterly (June-August, JJA; Sept-Nov, SON; Dec-Feb, DJF; March-May, MAM) long-term means were obtained and gridded using a 1°x 1° degree-arc mesh. The ship observation includes a subjective assessment of the weather that is codified into 100 categories. The most important and relevant are deep fog at the time of observation with the visibility less than or equal to 1 km. The most frequent deep fog is during JJA, with the highest values in the grid points closest to shore. There is a general fog frequency maximum along the coast between 34°N – 44°N that decreases offshore. More frequent occurrences tend to occur at major capes. The maximum JJA occurrences are at Cape Blanco and Pt Arena. In contrast, deep fog is infrequent along Baja California. In SON, deep fog occurrences are lowest with a narrower coastal maximum. In DJF, there is a broad, uneven fog maximum along the coast between 35°N-39°N. The frequency of deep fog occurrence is intermediate in MAM, with a weak, broad area north of 35°N. The distribution of the occurrence of deep fog in JJA is determined by a three way interaction between the atmosphere, the land and the ocean. The southbound marine layer is channeled by the coastal mountains and interacts with land topography via hydraulic dynamics. The marine layer flow accelerates on the downwind side of major capes, forces greater wind driven upwelling and colder sea surface temperatures along the coast of Southern Oregon and Northern California. However, the fast southbound winds are largely free of marine fog. Marine fog tends to occur along the inner coast when the southbound winds decay or reverse direction for 1-3 days, with the densest fog downwind of a major cape where the sea surface temperatures are lowest.",

            "abstract": "Our knowledge of the long-term evolution of solar activity and of its primary modulation, the 11-year cycle, largely depends on a single direct observational record: the visual sunspot counts that retrace the last 4 centuries, since the invention of the astronomical telescope. Currently, this activity index is available in two main forms: the International Sunspot Number initiated by R. Wolf in 1849 and the Group Number constructed more recently by Hoyt and Schatten (1998a,b). Unfortunately, those two series do not match by various aspects, inducing confusions and contradictions when used in crucial contemporary studies of the solar dynamo or of the solar forcing on the Earth climate. Recently, new efforts have been undertaken to diagnose and correct flaws and biases affecting both sunspot series, in the framework of a series of dedicated Sunspot Number Workshops. Here, we present a global overview of our current understanding of the sunspot number calibration. While the early part of the sunspot record before 1800 is still characterized by large uncertainties due to poorly observed periods, the more recent sunspot numbers are mainly affected by three main inhomogeneities: in 1880-1915 for the Group Number and in 1947 and 1980-2014 for the Sunspot Number. The newly corrected series clearly indicates a progressive decline of solar activity before the onset of the Maunder Minimum, while the slowly rising trend of the activity after the Maunder Minimum is strongly reduced, suggesting that by the mid 18th century, solar activity had already returned to the level of those observed in recent solar cycles in the 20th century. We finally conclude with future prospects opened by this epochal revision of the Sunspot Number, the first one since Wolf himself, and its reconciliation with the Group Number, a long-awaited modernization that will feed solar cycle research into the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracking is a common method used to obtain natural gas as well as oil from the ground. The process begins with drilling the ground, which is then followed by thousands of gallons of fluid being pumped into the ground to break the shale rock and release natural gas. The job requires thousands of gallons of water, and chemicals are added to the water, often making it unusable for other purposes. The amount of water being used for fracking in California has been recently brought to attention because the state is currently facing a drought.\nCurrently California is experiencing the worst drought since the 1920’s. In the time frame of 2013-2014 California rainfall has been 50% below the average with 2013 being the driest year. The lack of rain is attributed to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation which occurs every 20-30 years and causes the Pacific Ocean to cool, leading to less rain because storms are diverted to the north. As a result of the drought, food prices are expected to rise and farmers are pumping 75% of their water need from reserved aquifers.",

            "abstract": "Endosymbioses have given rise to some of the most important innovations in Earth’s history. Indeed, ecological facilitation has been pivotal to the creation of higher order complexity, and in driving evolutionary transitions at every level of organization from cellular organelles to multicellularity. In this study we address a newly discovered endosymbiosis between prokaryotes and a eukaryote growing with no apparent external energy source in soils associated with acid-sulfate hydrothermal springs. Hydrothermal sites are relevant to origin of life because they provide a chemical and energetic environment that may have provided energy for pre-biotic synthesis in the absence of photosynthesis through chemoautotrophy.\nPisolithus (genus, picture 1 below) is a terrestrial fungal extremophile that can grow in thermally altered soils of acid-thermal hot springs at extreme low pH and elevated temperature, thriving in conditions that are beyond the threshold of survivability for most other organisms. Fruiting bodies of this fungus accumulate elemental sulfur into the spore producing tissues (gleba) of the fruiting body. The gleba is encased in a thick peridium, or shell. Further, Pisolithus is capable of enzymatic conversion of elemental S to sulfate. The fruiting bodies are rich in hydrocarbons, contain water through much of their development and are also likely to contain CO2 from fungal cellular respiration. Further, our data indicate the presence of anaerobic zones within. Thus, the internal environment of Pisolithus contains many conditions relevant to early Earth environments in which life is thought to have originated.\nWe used 16S rDNA sequences to test the hypothesis that Pisolithus individuals contain novel and/or ancient microbial lineages. Our data reveal lineages comprised of novel relatives of known aerobic and anaerobic chemoautrophic Bacteria (85-90% BLAST search matches), several deeply divergent and novel Bacterial lineages, and a newly discovered lineage that branches at the base of the Archaeal clade indicating the presence of, at the very least, a new Phylum/Division within this group. Thus, the data provide a model for furthering our understanding of the diversification of life, in a novel modern analog to an early Earth environment.",

            "abstract": "The intensification of tropical cyclones (TCs) may be sensitive to aspects of large-scale forcing, as well as internal mesoscale dynamics. In this presentation, the degree to which tropical cyclone intensity and structure is sensitive to small perturbations to the basic properties of the synoptic-scale environment, as well as in the immediate vicinity of the storm, is explored using both adjoint- and ensemble-based approaches. In particular, we explore the relationship between tropical cyclone intensity changes and upper-level outflow. We make use of observations from two recent field campaigns: i) the NASA Hurricane and Severe Storms Sentinel (HS3), which featured two fully instrumented Global Hawk unmanned aerial systems, and ii) the ONR Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI-14) experiment that utilized the NASA WB-57.\nWe make use of the Navy’s high-resolution tropical cyclone prediction system COAMPS-TC to provide ensemble forecasts, numerical experiments with and without the assimilation of specific observation types (e.g., satellite, dropsondes, high-frequency radiosonde), as well as mesoscale nested adjoint sensitivity and observation impact calculations, all of which provide insight into the initial state sensitivity and predictability issues. We assess the impact of observations in sensitive regions in the TC environment (including outflow regions away from the TC inner core) on predictions of TC intensity and structure. Overall the results underscore the importance of multiple scales that influence the predictability of TC intensification. During HS3, the assimilation of Global Hawk dropsondes has been shown to reduce the maximum wind error from 15 knots to less than 10 knots at 48 h for Hurricane Nadine (2012). In this particular case, the adjoint model shows strong sensitivity in the TC outflow near the entrance region of an upper-level jet. The impact of dropsondes from data denial experiments and adjoint-based observation impact calculations will be discussed for other cases from the HS3 and TCI programs, including Nadine , Leslie (2012), and Gabrielle (2013), as well as other storms such as Superstorm Sandy (2012).",

            "abstract": "The viscosity of secondary organic aerosol material (SOM) is known to depend sensitively on both temperature and relative humidity (RH). This work investigates the effect of these two important environmental variables on photochemical processes occurring inside model SOM. The experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that an increased SOM viscosity, resulting from either lower temperatures or decreased RH, should slow down the rates of photochemical processes in the organic matrix by constraining molecular motion inside the matrix. Photolysis of a probe molecule, 2,4-dinitrophenol, dispersed in SOM made produced through oxidation of alpha-pinene and limonene by ozone is investigated with absorption spectroscopy methods under controlled humidity and temperature. Viscosity of SOM is directly measured using “bead-mobility” technique and “poke-flow” techniques. Finally, the products of 2,4-dinitrophenol are analyzed by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry methods. The experiments suggest that the presence of water strongly affects photodegradation rates of organic compounds contained in the SOM matrix. Given the paramount role of photochemistry in driving the chemical reactions in the environment, these results will have significant implications for predicting lifetimes of photolabile atmospheric organic compounds trapped in organic particles.",

            "abstract": "Dating of single detrital mineral grains (typically zircon and apatite) using geochronology and low-temperature (LT) thermochronology is now an established tool in the investigation of a range of geologic processes and problems. For example, detrital zircon U-Pb (DZ) geochronology can be applied to derive maximum depositional age, reconstruct sediment provenance and routing systems, correlate isolated stratigraphic horizons, and characterize remote source terrane geology. Detrital LT thermochronology (fission track and (U-Th)/He dating) can be applied additionally to reconstruct source region cooling and exhumation history through use of lag-time – the time taken between a mineral grain cooling below its closure temperature and its time of deposition. While each of these methods in isolation are very valuable tools, they do have some limitations. For example, DZ geochronology cannot differentiate different sources with the same crystallization age, the youngest DZ age population may be older than depositional age, large orogenic or metamorphic episodes may not produce much primary zircon, and recycling of zircon grains can lead to incorrect interpretation of syn-depositional versus primary sediment source. Detrital LT thermochronology has additional problems such as syn-depositional age volcanic grains leading to erroneous lag-time interpretation. Many of these issues can be overcome by obtaining combining multiple dating techniques on single grains, with the bonus of acquiring higher resolution provenance information. While multi-dating does present analytical challenges, a number of studies have explored this approach in recent years. Here we show how detrital apatite and zircon double- and triple-dating of sediments of varying age (Cretaceous to Holocene) from offshore Antarctica provides a novel new approach to reconstructing the pre-glacial and glacial landscape evolution of this hidden continent over the last few hundred million years. In addition it provided an opportunity to test the optimum methodological approach to triple-dating, particularly for apatite, as well as evaluate potential issues such uncertainties inherent in (U-Th)/He ages acquired from part-polished grains, and whether lasing and/or fission track etching influence age reliability and reproducibility.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between climate change and crop production is of paramount importance for food security. Previous statistical analyses of historical data have revealed the important impact of temperature increases on past crop yields. However, the direct effect of the [CO2] increase, known as CO2 fertilization effect, is difficult to estimate by simple statistical analysis because the average atmospheric [CO2] does not vary widely over space and time. Moreover, it is also difficult to estimate each climatic effect on crop yields with completely removing correlation among climatic factors. Although non-statistical approaches using process-based crop models may overcome these problems, the results of simple simulation studies may be misleading because of the uncertainty of the model parameters.\nIn the present study, we applied a Bayesian statistical approach to estimate the parameters of a basic process–based model of crop growth (PRYSBI-2) and the past effect of each climatic factor on yields of major crops. The spatial variability of model parameters was considered by estimating the posterior distribution of the parameters from historical yield data by using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The datasets of maize, soybean, rice, and wheat yields during 1982–2006 with a spatial resolution of 1.125° × 1.125° were used for this purpose (Iizumi et al. 2013). The posterior distributions of model parameters were estimated for each spatial grid with 30 000 MCMC steps of 7 chains. Using this model, we produced maps of the estimated past impact of each climatic factor (including CO2 effect) on crop yields (see Figure for the effect of temperature changes on maize yield as an example). The results suggested large variations of the impact of the change in average temperature on major crop yields. The results also suggested a large impact of CO2 increase on C3 crops such as soybean, rice, and wheat. In some regions, the positive impact of CO2 increase exceeded the negative impact of temperature increase. We also analyzed the impact of extreme climatic events on crop yields, and estimated hazard maps of these extreme climatic events.\nFigure.

            "abstract": "Shear wave velocity (Vs) models of the lowermost mantle are dominated by two large-low-shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs). The LLSVPs cover about half of the core surface and extend hundreds of kilometers up into the mantle. These large features inevitably have a significant effect on the dynamics of Earth's mantle and have been interpreted as both thermal superplumes and thermochemical piles. To resolve the debate regarding the possible presence of chemical heterogeneity on these large length scales, accurate seismic characterization of the long wavelength compressional wave velocity (Vp) and density structure is required.\nEarth's normal modes provide an invaluable tool for probing the Earth's deep interior since they are global in character and affected by density variations in addition to velocity. In particular, Stoneley modes, confined to solid-liquid interfaces such as the core-mantle boundary (CMB), are primarily sensitive to structures in the D'' region. Observations of these modes increase the depth resolution and provide unique constraints on long wavelength structures in the deep mantle.\nWe combine recent normal mode splitting function measurements of 143 modes including 33 modes dominantly sensitive to Vp and 9 CMB Stoneley modes with independent constraints from body wave travel times and surface wave phase velocity maps. We invert jointly for lateral Vs and Vp variations in the Earth mantle and analyze the resulting SP12RTS model in terms of the ratio R=dlnVs/dlnVp and the correlations between seismic velocities. In addition, we study the density structure of the LLSVPs by forward modeling of possible density scenarios for the lowermost mantle. We discuss our results in the light of thermal versus thermochemical variations in the Earth's mantle.",

            "abstract": "Over recent years transdimensional inference methods have grown in popularity and found applications in fields ranging from Solid Earth Geophysics, to Geochemistry. In all applications of inversion assumptions are made about the nature of the model parametrisation, complexity and data noise characteristics, and results can be significantly dependent on those assumptions. Often these are in the form of fixed choices imposed a priori, e.g. in the grid size of the model or noise level in the data. A transdimensional approach allows these assumptions to be relaxed by incorporating relevant parameters as unknowns in the inference problem, e.g. the number of model parameters becomes a variable as does the form of basis functions and the variance of the data noise. In this way uncertainty due to parameterisation effects or data noise choices may be incorporated into the inference process. Probabilistic sampling techniques such as Birth-Death Markov chain Monte Carlo and the Reversible jump algorithm, allow sampling over complex posterior probability density functions providing information on constraint, trade-offs and uncertainty in the unknowns.\nThis talk will present a review of trans-dimensional inference and its application in geophysical inversion, and highlight some emerging trends such as Multi-scale McMC, Parallel Tempering and Sequential McMC which hold the promise of further extending the range of problems where these methods are practical.",

            "abstract": "The thermal conditions of magma storage control many aspects of the dynamics of a magma reservoir system. For example, the temperature of magma storage directly relates to the crystallinity, and magmas stored at relatively low temperatures in a crystal mush (more than 40-50% crystalline) must be remobilized (e.g., by heating) before they can be erupted. A better understanding of the duration of magma storage at largely-liquid vs. largely-solid conditions is thus critical to understanding crustal magmatic processes such as magma mixing and for quantifying the hazard potential of a given volcano. Although mineral thermometry reflects the conditions of crystal growth or equilibration, these may not correspond to the thermal conditions of crystal storage. The duration of crystal storage at high temperatures can be quantified by comparing U-series crystal ages with the time scales over which disequilibrium trace-element profiles in the same crystals would be erased by diffusion. In the case of Mount Hood, OR, such a comparison for the two most recent eruptions shows that <12% of the total lifetime of plagioclase crystals (minimum 21 kyr) was spent at temperatures high enough that the magma would be easily mobilized. Partial data sets for other systems suggest such behavior is common, although the diffusion and U-series ages in these cases are from different samples and may not be directly comparable. We will present preliminary data combining U-series dating and diffusion timescales on the same samples for other volcanic systems (e.g., Lassen Volcanic Center, Mount St. Helens, Okataina Volcanic Center, New Zealand). Combining these data with numerical models offers additional insights into the controls on the conditions of storage. In addition, extension of this approach to combining U-Th ages with time scales of Li diffusion in zircon offers a promising new method to quantify thermal histories of silicic reservoir systems.",

            "abstract": "Iron is an important element in soils, often in forms either of crystalline mineral or amorphous colloids upon redox cycling in hydromorphic soils. However, role of iron particularly via oxyhydrates in organic matter dynamics n rice soils has been not yet well assessed. Rice paddy soils of China have been recognized as a unique type of Anthrosols mostly with iron accumulation and dynamic movement in soil profile through long term hydroagric management. Soil organic matter contents of rice soils are shown significantly correlated with the contents of free or amorphous iron oxyhydrates. And organic matter accumulation in young rice soils followed iron oxyhydrate content changes as rice cultivation proceed, which could be often traced by the changes in iron oxyhydrate-bound OC fractions. The importance of association of OC with iron oxyhydrates is known by the fact that organic carbon was not related to total free iron oxyhydrates in wetland but in rice soil shifted from the wetlands, with OC contents much higher in rice soils than in the precedent wetland soil. This could be attributed to the chemical binding of OC to oxyhydrate surface, contributing to the stabilization of newly sequestered OC. This has been again confirmed by lab incubation studies, where total mineralization of OC has been found significantly lower in iron-oxyhrate rich soil than in iron-oxyhrate poor soils. This effect has been further explored in an incubation study with experimental warming that the temperature dependence of OC mineralization of rice soils from a long term fertilizer treated trial was linked to the abundance of iron oxyhydrate content, varying with the long term management practice. Initial carbon sequestration in rice soil subject to new carbon input was promoted by the iron oxyhydrates in the soil, showing a fast increase in iron hydrate-bound OC in the initial stage. The bound OC exerted further stabilization through enhanced humification to form residual OC fraction in long term, which was demonstrated with the molecular changes in iron oxyhydrate bound fraction of OC in the final stage of incubation. Therefore, iron cycling through dynamic changes with redox fluctuations could be closely linked to C cycling in rice sols, of which the processes and the associated mineral-OC-microbial interactions have been poorly understood.",

            "abstract": "Liquid water is one of the most important material not only for its large effect on planetary climate but also as a controlling factor of the habitability [e.g. Kasting et al., 1993]. Liquid water on the surface of a planet gets unstable and entirely vaporizes when the planet receives insolation above a certain critical value. In the following, the critical insolation is called the ‘runaway threshold’ [e.g. Kasting, 1988; Nakajima et al., 1992].\nRecently, it is found that the runaway threshold strongly depends on the general circulation of the planetary atmosphere [Abe et al., 2011; Leconte et al., 2013; Wolf and Toon, 2014].\nThe planetary-scale surface water distribution is determined by the balance between the atmospheric water transport, which depends on the general circulation, and the surface water transport, which depends on the amount of water and topography. In the case of the Earth, large amount of sea water controls the surface water distribution.\nGenerally, the atmospheric circulation transports water poleward, and in contrast, the surface waterflow homogenizes the distribution of surface water. When the surface waterflow is weak, surface water is localized around both poles. On the other hand, if the surface waterflow is strong, liquid water is found at any latitude. We call the former planet a ‘land planet’, and the latter planet an ‘aqua planet’.\nAbe et al. [2011] discussed the difference of the runaway threshold between Earth-sized aqua and land planets using a 3-D model for the first time. They found that the surface water on a land planet is significantly more stable than that on an aqua planet against the large insolation. However, they discussed only 2 extreme cases of land and aqua planets.\nHere, we report results of numerical experiments to clarify the effect of waterflow on the runaway threshold of Earth-sized water planets with CCSR/NIES AGCM 5.4g [Numaguchi, 1999]. We assume the present Earth atmosphere with several simplifications.\nThe strength of waterflow is expressed by the `waterflow limit` above which latitude the surface waterflow keeps a wet surface. Then, we found that the runaway threshold continuously varies with the waterflow limit from 180% of the present insolation at the Earth orbit (the case of extremely localized land planet), to 130% (aqua planet).",

            "abstract": "Heinrich events likely represent very strong feedbacks on millennial climate changes, as reviewed here. Ice shelves are debris filters, removing rocks from basal ice before iceberg formation, so ice-shelf loss is the easiest way to make an ice-rafted-debris event when marine-ending ice sheets exist. In turn, ice-shelf loss can be triggered by warmer ocean waters reaching deep grounding lines. Recent work (Marcott et al., 2011, PNAS, etc.) shows subsurface warming in response to “shutdown” of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) as part of Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) cycling, whether shutdown was caused by hosing, salt oscillations, or something else. A hybrid model may best fit the data, with a MacAyealian thermal oscillator in Hudson Strait allowing only some Nordic-Seas-triggered DO subsurface warmings to remove a Hudson Strait ice shelf and trigger a Heinrich event, which then extends the “shutdown” into the Labrador Sea to cause longer-lasting, larger far-field climate anomalies. Notable uncertainties remain, however, and the final story is likely to be more involved than this.",

The Sampling was performed at Seoul, representative urban site, in Korea. Organic carbon as well as inorganic species were measured. OC and EC in sample filters were measured using a Sunset OC/EC analyzer (Sunset Laboratory, Tigard, OR, USA) based on a thermal/optical transmittance (TOT) method.

Portions of the sample filters were extracted with 30 mL of ultrapure water in an ultrasonic bath for 45 min.

            "abstract": "The Southern Alps of New Zealand are widely thought to be a direct consequence of the small component of Late Cenozoic relative plate convergence in continental lithosphere between the Pacific and Australian plates. We show with a simple model of crustal balancing that Cenozoic crustal thickening for the southern part, extending for ~250 km south of Mt Cook, is likely to be significantly more than that expected for this convergence. The detailed lithospheric structure beneath the Southern Alps, combined with seismicity, geodetic deformation, paleomagnetism and Cenozoic plate reconstructions, suggest two additional mechanisms for crustal thickening. Firstly, the Hikurangi margin, forming the northern subducting part of the plate-boundary, has rotated ≥60° clockwise in the Neogene, requiring intense shortening behind the subduction zone. We propose that this shortening was partly accommodated by southward extrusion of crust along the length of the Hikurangi margin and beneath the Southern Alps, during the Early to Late Miocene (25 – 10 Ma), contemporaneous with marked uplift of the offshore eastern part of southern South Island. Secondly, the Alpine Fault appears to root into a subhorizontal detachment at mid-crustal levels, extending for >50 km beneath the Southern Alps. We propose that this detachment is a consequence of sideways underthrusting of a wedge of the extended Australian plate continental margin, which formed during initial asymmetrical Eocene to Oligocene rifting much farther south. This was subducted along the Fiordland margin, to the south at ~10 Ma and then dragged sideways beneath the Southern Alps, as a consequence of ~300 km of strike-slip motion along the Alpine Fault. Both these mechanisms provide an explanation for how the thickness of the lithosphere can be nearly doubled over a wide region in a predominantly strike-slip setting, creating the Southern Alps, yet little distributed shortening is observed at the surface. In either case, lithospheric deformation involves a strong component of motion along the length of the deforming zone, and cannot be interpreted simply in terms of 2-D cross-sections.",

In this study, there are different types of statistical as well as artificial intelligence techniques are used for forecasting and analysis of air pollution over Delhi urban area. These techniques are principle component analysis (PCA), multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) and the forecasting are observed in good agreement with the observed concentrations through Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at different locations in Delhi. But such methods suffers from disadvantages like they provide limited accuracy as they are unable to predict the extreme points i.e. the pollution maximum and minimum cut-offs cannot be determined using such approach. Also, such methods are inefficient approach for better output forecasting. But with the advancement in technology and research, an alternative to the above traditional methods has been proposed i.e. the coupling of statistical techniques with artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used for forecasting purposes. The coupling of PCA, ANN and fuzzy logic is used for forecasting of air pollutant over Delhi urban area. The statistical measures e.g., correlation coefficient (R), normalized mean square error (NMSE), fractional bias (FB) and index of agreement (IOA) of the proposed model are observed in better agreement with the all other models. Hence, the coupling of statistical and artificial intelligence can be use for the forecasting of air pollutant over urban area.",

            "abstract": "During the last 25 years, 3D seismic imaging has revolutionized hydrocarbon exploration by delivering an accurate 3 dimensional picture of the subsurface. The image is capable of detecting ﬂuids within the reservoir, and has signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of locating and developing hydrocarbon deposits.\nIn late 1990s, deregulation of natural gas prices allowed long recognized deposits of natural gas locked in tight rocks be economic. It sparked factory drilling (repeatable high density evenly spaced) wells and hydraulic fracturing that would help unlock the reservoirs. All that was needed was a geologist to determine depths and limits of the reservoir and engineers to drill and complete the wells. If 3D seismic data was available, it might have been used to deﬁne both the limits of the ﬁeld and drilling hazards. Generally the cost and time required to process and interpret 3D Seismic was considered too high to affect the perceived geologic risk of the Factory approach.\nCompletion costs in unconventional reservoirs account for over 50% of the well costs. It's therefore critical to understand the geometry of how the rock is fracturing and determine optimum well spacing to balance the cost of development with the value of the gas or oil being produced. By extending AVO to the pre-stack domain, it's possible to simultaneously invert for Vp, Vs and density. Armed with these three fundamental rock properties that dictate elastic and inelastic rock response, researchers were able to combine those properties to tie directly to how well a rock will respond to hydraulic fracturing, or which rocks contain a higher TOC, or other rock properties that control how a rock responds to seismic waves or hydraulic fracturing. Combining these results allows interpreters to map areas of higher productivity, and identify bypassed reserves.\nCurrently hundreds of different seismic attributes that are generated from 3D seismic data are used to identify the highest productive areas and how to develop them. MicroSeismic mapping has made completion more efﬁcient and safe. While the geophysics involved in unconventional resource development may not be the ﬁrst thought in the board room, thier data has become an accepted early development tool of successful oil and gas companies.",

Critical constraints on this practice include moisture availability, and, more importantly, growing season length. We review evidence that this last constraint has decreased in the previous quarter century, allowing for more winter wheat/soybean double cropping in previously phenologically constrained areas. We also carry this pattern forward to 2100, showing a 126% to 211% increase in the area phenologically suitable for double cropping under the RCP45 and RCP85 scenarios respectively. These results suggest that climate change will relieve phenological constraints on wheat-soy double cropping systems over much of the United States, changing production patterns and crop rotations as areas become suitable for the practice.",

            "abstract": "Space plasmas are often characterized by the presence of energetic particles in the background, e.g. due to various electron acceleration mechanisms [1]. This phenomenon is associated with a power-law dependence at high (superthermal) velocity values, modeled by a kappa-type distribution function, which reproduces observed data more efficiently that the standard Maxwellian distribution approach [2]. It has been shown from first principles that this ubiquitous superthermal feature of plasmas may alter the propagation characteristics of plasma modes, and modify the plasma screening properties [3].\nIn this presentation I will review, from first principles, the effects of a non-Maxwellian electron distribution on the characteristics of electrostatic plasma modes. A kappa distribution function [1] is employed to model the deviation of a plasma constituent (electrons, in general) from Maxwellian equlibrium. It will be shown that the excess in superthermal propulation modifies the charge screening mechanism, affecting the dispersion laws of both low- and higher frequency modes significantly. Various experimental observations may thus be interpreted as manifestations of excess superthermality [2]. Focusing on the features of nonlinear excitations (shocks, solitons), we investigate the role of superthermality in their propagation dynamics (existence laws, stability profile) and dynamical profile [3]. The relation to other nonthermal plasma theories is briefly discussed.\n[1] See V.M. Vasyliunas, J. Geophys. Res. 73, 2839 (1968), for a historical reference; also, V. Pierrard and M.

            "abstract": "Agricultural management in river catchments must combine the objectives of economic profit and environmental stewardship and, in many countries, mitigate the decline of water quality and/or maintain high water quality. Achieving these objectives is, amongst other activities, in the remit of ‘sustainable intensification’. Of concern is the efficient use of crop nutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, and minimising or offsetting the effects of transfers from land to water – corner-stone requirements of many agri-environmental regulations. This requires a robust monitoring programme that can audit the stages of nutrient inputs and outputs in river catchments and indicate where the likely points of successful policy interventions can be observed – or confounded. In this paper, a catchment, or watershed, experimental design and results are described for monitoring the nutrient transfer continuum in the Irish agricultural landscape against the backdrop of the European Union Nitrates and Water Framework Directives. This Agricultural Catchments Programme experimental design also serves to indicate water quality pressure-points that may be catchment specific as agricultural activities intensify to adapt to national efforts to build important parts of the post-recession economy.",

Both, the artifical and natural (downstream) section of the river bed were affected by the anomalous hydrochemistry and formation of prominent secondary precipitates.\nIn order to better understand the particular and rapid water-rock-interaction, a hydrochemical monitoring program was launched and several of the delicate precipitates were recovered in refrigerator boxes in their original solution. The samples were analyzed in the laboratory within a few hours after sampling and stored at 1 °C. XRD and FT-IR patterns clearly revealed the predominant occurrence of “ikaite” in the crusts next to minor amounts of other carbonates (calcite, aragonite, vaterite) and detrital minerals.\nIkaite – calcium carbonate hexahydrate – is a worldwide rarely documented carbonate mineral. This mineral is metastable and needs particular and narrow conditions in order to precipitate from solutions, i.e. a very limited water-temperature range between 0 and 4 °C (with ambient-pressure and low-salinity), highly alkaline pH conditions, high supersaturation values, and in many cases carbonate precipitation inhibitors (e.g. phosphates). Outside these conditions it disintegrates into calcite and water within minutes to hours. The few places of ikaite formation include Ikka Fjord in Greenland, Arctic- and Antarctic sea-ice and some sites of water mixing at Mono Lake, California.\nCombining detailed field monitoring results, solid-phase analyses and regional meteorological data (rainfall, water discharge, temperature) with hydrogeochemical modeling allows constraining the mechanisms of ikaite formation, as well as the temporal and spatial evolution of the waters and precipitates in the river bed.",

            "abstract": "After the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake, we have intensively explored earthquake-induced records in the deep-sea basins close to rupture zones of the 2011 and past earthquakes in Tohoku, Our study area focuses on small terminal basins near the trench for the following reason. Mass transport deposits from up-slope area down into the Japan Trench axis floor during the 2011 event were documented (e. g. Oguri et al., 2013). Similarly past earthquake-induced turbidites were expected to have been deposited in a number of small basins in the trench floor and in a lower slope terrace. Here we introduce our recent results and future prospects for paleoseismology in the Japan Trench. We collected cores from areas that are generally composed of diatomaceous fine grain sediment and fine-grained turbidites. Occasionally, wide spread tephra patches/layers are intercalated in the sediment. In the trench floor, two thick turbidite units below (older) than the 2011 event deposits were identified in up to 10m long sedimentary cores. An intercalated tephra within these turbidite units indicates that turbidites were triggered by historical earthquakes in Tohoku (Ikehara et al., in prep). On the other hand, frequent occurrence of thin-bedded turbidites was identified in the lower slope terrace. Several turbidite layers can be correlated over a wide area by tephra-correlation and matching of paleomagnetic secular variations (Usami et al., in this session). Turbidite-stratigraphy from both locations, the trench and lower slope terrace shows a similar pattern, and seems to be tied to the onland tsunami deposit stratigraphy straightforwardly. These observations suggest that deep-sea turbidite records are more reliable proxy for paleoseimic-stratigraphy of the Tohoku area. Encouraged by the results obtained so far, we plan extensive investigations in the area over the next few years to document effectively the spatiotemporal distribution of earthquake records of Tohoku.",

            "abstract": "Granitoid dykes up to several hundred metres wide and 2 km long are found in depleted harzburgites in the mantle section of the Oman ophiolite. They vary in composition from tonalite to potassic granite and are generally more potassic than the crustal plagiogranites found within the sheeted dyke complex higher up within the ophiolite stratigraphy. Some granites are strongly peraluminous and contain garnet and andalusite. They are geochemically variable, some with REE that are relatively unfractionated ((La/Yb)n= 3.5-6.0, flat middle to heavy REE, steep light REE) to those which are highly fractionated ((La/Yb)n= 28-220). On primitive-mantle normalised plots some have very high concentrations of fluid-mobile elements – Cs, Rb, Th, U and Pb. Few have significant Ta-Nb anomalies. On the Ca-Fe-Mg-Ti discrimination diagram of Patino Douce (J. Petrol., 1999) whole-rock compositions define a spectrum between felsic-pelite derived melts and amphibolite-derived melts.\nThere is a chemical similarity between the least REE fractionated plagiogranites (generally tonalites and granodiorites) and melts of an amphibolitic parent. This is supported by the occurrence of mafic xenoliths in some dykes, the presence of hornblende and highly calcic cores (up to An85) in some plagioclase grains. Trace element modelling using Oman Geotimes lavas as the starting composition indicates that melting took place in the garnet stability field, although enrichment in the melt in Cs, Rb, Ba and Pb suggests that there was another component present in addition to the mafic parent. Other plagiogranites (trondhjemites and granites) have a strongly peraluminous chemistry and mineralogy and geochemical similarities with the Himalayan leucogranites implying that they were derived from a sedimentary protolith. These mantle plagiogranites are more prevalent in the northern outcrops of the ophiolite.\nThe volume of granitoid melt and the depth of melting preclude their derivation from the sole of the ophiolite, rather they were derived during subduction by the partial melting of the slab and associated sediment and emplaced into the overlying mantle wedge. Current subduction-initiation models for supra-subduction ophiolites should integrate this process into their thinking.",

That includes: strong ground motion recorded in tunnels and stopes, tilt and strain recorded underground as well as acoustic emission events recorded close to an active fault.\nThe ground motion, generated by mining induced seismic events, recorded at the hangingwall of an active stopes has a maximum value of 3 m/s and was found to be 9 ± 3 times larger than the ground motion recorded in a solid rocks.\nA number of simulated rockbursts were conducted underground and well recorded by dense array of shock type accelerometers placed along the blasting wall. The ground motion was found to attenuate exponentially with the distance (R) following R-1.1 & R-1.7 for compact rocks and R-3.1 & R-3.4 for fractured rocks.\nThe ground motion was compared to the coseismic and aseismic deformations. During the blasting time and the subsequent seismic events the strain and tilt show a rapid increase. Similar increase was observed during a strong seismic event. These were described as ‘fast’ seismic events or coseismic deformations. However, much of deformations occurred independently of the seismic events and was described as ‘slow’ or aseismic events.\nDuring the monitoring period a seismic event of MW=2.1 occurred in the vicinity of the instrumented site. Using the distribution of the AE events the position of the fault in the source area was successfully delineated. The tilt changes associated with this event showed a well pronounced after-tilt. The distribution of the AE events following the main shock was related to after tilt in order to quantify post slip behaviour of the source. There was no evidence found for coseismic expansion of the source after the main slip. Therefore, the hypothesis of the post-seismic creep type behaviour of the source was proposed to explain the after-tilt following the main shock.",

In this presentation, we will present remote sensing imageries that are indicative of bedrock crack changes. In particular, we examined four 5x5 degree grid boxes surrounding respectively El Chichon, Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Pinatubo and Mt. Fuji. It is found that surrounding the Fuji mountains, ground water increases from 2002-2013 are out of natural sync with precipitation and other indirect indications of bedrock cracks.

            "abstract": "Compared to the northern South China Sea continental margin, the deep structures and tectonic evolution of the Palawan and Sulu Sea and ambient regions are not well understood so far. However, this part of the southern continental margin and adjacent areas embed critical information on the opening of the South China Sea (SCS). We carry out geophysical investigations using regional magnetic, gravity and reflection seismic data. Analytical signal amplitudes (ASA) of magnetic anomalies are calculated to depict the boundaries of different tectonic units. Curie-point depths are estimated from magnetic anomalies using a windowed wavenumber-domain algorithm. Application of the Parker–Oldenburg algorithm to Bouguer gravity anomalies yields a 3D Moho topography. The Palawan Continental Block (PCB) is defined by quiet magnetic anomalies, low ASA, moderate depths to the top and bottom of the magnetic layer, and its northern boundary is further constrained by reflection seismic data and Moho interpretation. However, the continent-ocean transition zone between the PCB and the SCS is characterized by hyper-extended continental crust intruded with magmatic bodies. The NW Sulu Sea is interpreted as a relict oceanic slice and the geometry and position of extinct trench of the Proto South China Sea (PSCS) is further constrained. With additional age constraints from inverted Moho and Curie-point depths, we confirm that the spreading of the SE Sulu Sea started in the Early Oligocene/Late Eocene due to the subduction of the PSCS, and terminated in the Middle Miocene by the obduction of the NW Sulu Sea onto the PCB. According to the newly constrained age of SE Sulu Sea, we also estimate the approximate extent, spreading rate and subducting rate of original SE Sulu Sea.",

The town was located within the Sibari Plain near the Crati River mouth (Ionian northern Calabria, southern Italy). Sybaris occurs in area repeatedly affected by natural damaging phenomena, as frequent flooding, high local subsidence, marine storms, and earthquakes. The 2700 year long record of history of Sybaris stores the traces of these natural events and their influence on the human ancient environment through time.\nAmong the natural disasters, we recognize two Roman age earthquakes striking the town. We isolate the damaging of these seismic events, set their time of occurrence, and map a shear zone crossing the site. These results were obtained through i) survey of coseismic features on the ruins, ii) geoarchaeological stratigraphy analysis, and TL and C14 dating, iii) analysis of high-resolution topographic data (1m pixel LiDAR DEM).\nThe Sybaris town showed a persistent resilience to the earthquakes, and following their occurrences the site was not abandoned but underwent remodeling of the urban topography.\nThe interaction of the different approaches reveals the presence of a previously unknown fault crossing the archeological site, the Sybaris fault. The high-resolution topography allows the characterization of subtle geomorphological features and hydrological anomalies, tracing the fault extension, whose Holocene activity is controlling the local morphology and the present Crati river course.",

We find both 1) a long-term behavior that might reflect processes of deep magma replenishment as well as 2) short-term variations that are controlled by both environmental (rainfall) and pre-eruptive perturbations that are or not associated with edifice deformation. We will discuss the possible origins for such pre-eruptive perturbations (effects of magma pressure buildup or fluid pore pressure increase by heat transfer).

            "abstract": "In idealized aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM) simulations with an Earth-like mean climate, the tropical Hadley circulation undergoes rapid transitions over the course of the seasonal cycle between an equinox regime, in which the divergence of angular momentum by large-scale extratropical eddies strongly influences the circulation strength, and a monsoon regime, in which the eddy momentum flux divergence is weak and the circulation approaches the angular momentum-conserving limit. The rapid transition in the idealized GCM has circulation and precipitation changes similar to those occurring at the onset and end of the South Asian monsoon and results from feedbacks between the large-scale eddies and the overturning circulation that can occur even in the absence of surface inhomogeneities, if the surface has sufficiently low thermal inertia.\nHere, we explore the dynamics of these aquaplanet monsoon transitions in a wide range of climates in an idealized GCM. The climates are simulated by perturbing the optical thickness of the atmosphere's longwave absorber, in analogy to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. We find that the strength of the monsoonal, cross-equatorial circulation changes non-monotonically, achieving its maximum at a climate slightly colder than present-day Earth's climate, which can be understood through the perturbation energy budget and changes in the moist energy stratification. We also find that as the climate is warmed, the monsoon onset is progressively delayed to later pentads in the warm season, while the monsoon end varies less strongly with climate. This results in a progressive shortening of the overall monsoon season as the climate is warmed. The energy and zonal momentum budgets are analyzed to account for the simulated changes. Comparisons with comprehensive GCM simulations in aquaplanet configuration and with trends from observed data are also presented.",

            "abstract": "During ecosystem development and soil formation, primary mineral sources of phosphorus are becoming increasingly depleted. Inorganic phosphorus forms tend to be bound strongly to or within secondary minerals, thus, are hardly available to plants and are not leached from soil. What about organic forms of phosphorus? Since rarely studied, little is known on the composition, mobility, and bioavailability of dissolved organic phosphorus. There is some evidence that plant-derived compounds, such as phytate, bind strongly to minerals as well, while microbial compounds, such as nucleotides and nucleic acids, may represent more mobile fractions of soil phosphorus. In some weakly developed, shallow soils, leaching losses of phosphorus seem to be governed by mobile organic forms. Consequently, much of the phosphorus losses observed during initial stages of ecosystem development may be due to the leaching of dissolved organic matter. However, the potentially mobile microbial compounds are enzymatically hydrolysable. Forest ecosystems on developed soils already depleted in easily available inorganic phosphorus are characterized by rapid recycling of organic phosphors. That can reduce the production of soluble forms of organic phosphorus as well as increase the enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent plant uptake of phosphorus bound within dissolved organic matter.\nThis work aims at giving an outlook to the potential role of dissolved organic matter in the cycling of phosphorus within developing forest ecosystems, based on literature evidence and first results of ongoing research.",

Observational and numerical analyses reveal that large-scale patterns of Southern Hemisphere climate variability have a pronounced signature not only in cloud incidence but also in cloud radiative forcing.

            "abstract": "Geodetic observations from techniques such as InSAR and GNSS are routinely used to invert for earthquake fault slip distributions. However, in order to regularize the inversions, extra arbitrary assumptions about the smoothness of the slip distribution are usually included. In previous work we explored a new approach for constraining the slip distribution based on a random vector model following a von Karman autocorrelation function, which has empirical support from a stochastic analysis of seismic finite-source slip inversions.\nWe implemented the random vector constraint in a Bayesian fashion and used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to derive the posterior joint probability distribution for each of the slipping patches. The von Karman function depends on two parameters: correlation length and Hurst number (related to fractal dimension). In our inversions we used the empirically derived maximum likelihood values for these two parameters, which differ in along-strike and down-dip directions, and with fault mechanism.\nHowever, the inversion results depend strongly on the chosen values for correlation length and Hurst number, and the empirically derived histograms show that there is in fact quite some variation between earthquakes with the same mechanism. In our extended approach we treat these two parameters as hyperparameters, with the prior probability distribution constrained by the empirical histograms. The values are thus also allowed to vary in our Bayesian inversion scheme. In this way, the uncertainty in the parameters that define the autocorrelation function is also included in the posterior probability distribution for the slipping patches.\nTo ensure that our MCMC algorithm converges rapidly, we have implemented a variation to the usual MCMC approach, in which the maximum step size for each of the model parameters is initially updated regularly, until optimal values are achieved.\nIn comparisons between our new approach and a more standard approach based on smoothing, we find the solutions with maximum posterior probability sometimes differ markedly. Even more significant, however, is the difference in the uncertainty of our results, with our new method leading to a solution with a much tighter constraint.",

            "abstract": "The Lake Suigetsu cores (SG06 and SG14) from Honshu Island, central Japan, provide a high-resolution paleoenvironmental record for the last ~200 kyrs. The composite record is ~85 m-long and it contains numerous tephras, more than 35 visible and numerous non-visible layers (cryptotephra).\nThe major and trace element glass chemistry of these tephras allows the layers to be correlated to specific eruptions and tephra layers in other archives [1]. The record preserves large eruptions from volcanoes from Kyushu, Honshu, South Korea, and smaller explosive events from more proximal volcanoes, Daisen and Sanbe. The Lake Suigetsu has a very detailed varve and radiocarbon chronology [2] that has been exploited to provide precise ages for the tephra layers from the last 50 kyrs [1]. These ages can constrain the tempo of volcanic activity, and the age models of other sedimentary (paleoenvironmental and archaeological) records that contain the tephra.\nThe deeper parts of the Suigetsu core are not continuosly annually laminated and are outside the radiocarbon timeframe and therefore do not have a well constrined chronology. The tephra layers can be used to provide an absolute chronology as eruption deposits from South Korea, Daisen and Sanbe often contain K-rich crystal phases, which can be dated using 40Ar/39Ar methods. Correlating these distal tephra layers in Lake Suigetsu to proximal deposits, using the glass chemistry, is essential as large crystals are required to obtain precise 40Ar/39Ar ages and these are only abundant in the coarser proximal deposits [3, 4].\nThese widespread marker layers can be also be used for relative chronology. Identifying the same tephras in disparate high-resolution archives allows them to be directly compared so that leads and lags in paleoclimate can be identified on the regional to continental scale, providing some insight into the fundamental drivers of the Earth’s climate system.\n ",

            "abstract": "Tropical mid-tropospheric temperature (TMT) time series have been constructed by several independent research teams using satellite microwave sounding unit (MSU) measurements beginning in 1978 and advanced MSU (AMSU) measurements since 1998. Despite careful efforts to homogenize the MSU/AMSU measurements, tropical TMT trends disagree by a factor of three even though each analysis uses the same basic data. Previous studies suggest that the discrepancy in tropical TMT temperature trends is largely caused by differences in both the NOAA-9 warm target factor and diurnal drift corrections used by various teams to homogenize the MSU/AMSU measurements. This work introduces a new observationally-based method for removing biases related to satellite diurnal drift. The method relies on minimizing inter-satellite and inter-node drifts by subtracting out a common diurnal cycle determined via linear regression. It is demonstrated that this method is effective at removing intersatellite biases and biases between the ascending (PM) and descending (AM) node of individual satellites in the TMT time series. After TMT bias correction, the ratio of tropical tropospheric temperature trends relative to surface temperature trends is in accord with the ratio from global climate models. It is shown that bias corrections for diurnal drift based on a climate model produce tropical trends very similar to those from the observationally-based correction, with a trend differences smaller than 0.02 K decade-1. Differences among various TMT datasets are explored further. Tropical trends from this work are comparable to those from the Remote Sensing System (RSS) and NOAA datasets despite small differences. Larger differences between this work and UAH are attributed to differences in the treatment of the NOAA-9 target factor and the UAH diurnal cycle correction.",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mandate is an example of this type of ‘gap filling,’ in which the elimination of uncertainties is presumed to enable rational decision making for individuals and rational governance for societies. Presumed knowledge deficits, though, are unsuited to controversial problems with social, cultural, and economic dimensions; likewise, communication to educate is an ineffective means of inciting behavioural change. An alternative is needed, particularly given the economic, social, and political scale that action on climate change requires. We review the 'deficit-education framing' and show how it maintains a wedge between those affected and those whose knowledge is required. We then review co-production to show how natural and social scientists, as well as the IPCC, might more effectively proceed.",

AMOC variability of magnitude ±5 Sv is excited by local wind forcing. In contrast, interannual to decadal AMOC variability of similar amplitude is excited by heat fluxes in the subpolar North Atlantic, with freshwater fluxes playing a very minor role. The magnitude of the reconstructed AMOC variability does not converge as the time window over which past forcing is accounted for is increased to 15 years. Beyond this point the assumption of linearity may break down, suggesting not all of the observed AMOC variability can be attributed in a linear manner to surface forcing. Nevertheless, the reconstructed AMOC variability is broadly consistent with RAPID observations at 26.5N, especially in periods dominated by wind forcing.",

            "abstract": "Growing alarm about negative cascading effects of reactive nitrogen in the environment has led to multifaceted efforts to address elevated nitrate-nitrogen levels in water bodies worldwide. The best way to mitigate N-related impacts, such as hypoxic zones and human health concerns, is to convert nitrate to stable, non-reactive dinitrogen gas through the natural process of denitrification. This means denitrification technologies need to be one of our major strategies for tackling the grand challenge of managing human-induced changes to our global nitrogen cycle. While denitrification technologies have historically been focused on wastewater treatment, there is great interest in new lower-tech options for treating effluent and drainage water from one of our largest reactive nitrogen emitters -- agriculture. Denitrification ‘woodchip’ bioreactors are able to enhance this natural N-conversion via addition of a solid carbon source (e.g., woodchips) and through designs that facilitate development of anoxic conditions required for denitrification. Wood-based denitrification technologies such as woodchip bioreactors and ‘sawdust’ walls for groundwater have been shown to be effective at reducing nitrate loads in agricultural settings around the world. Designing these systems to be low-maintenance and to avoid removing land from agricultural production has been a primary focus of this “farmer-friendly” technology. This presentation provides a background on woodchip bioreactors including design considerations, N-removal performance, and current research worldwide. Woodchip bioreactors for the agricultural sector are an accessible new option to address society’s interest in improving water quality while simultaneously allowing highly productive agricultural systems to continue to provide food in the face of increasing demand, changing global diets, and fluctuating weather.",

We are able to produce ever more sophisticated models but they can only inform us about the Earth in a meaningful way if we can assign uncertainties to the models. Bayesian inference is a natural choice for this task as it handles uncertainty in a natural way by explicitly modeling assumptions. Another desirable property is that Bayes' theorem contains Occam's razor implicitly. I will present our efforts over the that last 10 years to infer Earth properties using an approach we called probabilistic tomography. The word pragmatic has several meanings in this context. In more classical Bayesian inference problems, we usually prescribe subjective or informative priors. I will illustrate this by showing examples which employ the neighborhood algorithm (Sambridge, 1999) or a Metropolis rule (Mosegaard and Tarantola, 1995). Recently we started to use neural networks to parametrize the posterior. In our implementation, we do not sample the posterior directly, but make predictions on some properties of the posterior. The interpretation of the uncertainty is therefore slightly different, but the method informs us on the information gain with respect to the prior. I will show examples on source and structural inversions using so-called mixture density networks.",

            "abstract": "The Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer on the MESSENGER spacecraft has observed calcium, magnesium, and sodium emissions in Mercury's exosphere on a near-daily basis since March 2011. The dayside observations, made mainly at near-equatorial latitudes, have revealed different spatial morphologies and temperatures for each of these species. The Ca exosphere shows a persistent seasonal dependence on source rate, is concentrated in the dawn equatorial region, and is of extreme temperature (>50,000K), such that almost all of the calcium is above escape velocity. Observations of neutral Mg reveal that at least two processes are required to reconcile the distributions of Mg measured far from and near the planet: a hot ejection process at the equivalent temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees K, similar to that of Ca, and an additional source at lower temperatures (3000–5000 K). The cooler process is consistent with an impact vaporization source. The hotter source may be consistent with impact vaporization in the form of molecules that are subsequently dissociated by a process that imparts enough energy to accelerate the atoms to escape velocity. The bulk of the Na exosphere is cooler than either Ca or Mg, but still much hotter, at about 1200 K, than the surface temperature. We observe a persistent, repeatable seasonal pattern. The temperature and morphology of the Na exosphere are consistent with photon-stimulated desorption as the primary ejection process for this species. Although each atomic species has its distinct temperature and spatial morphology, the variation between species is such that the most refractory species, Ca, is the hottest, and the most volatile species, Na, is coolest. This result indicates that the processes acting to produce the exosphere act in concert with the binding energies on the surface. Other species expected to be present in the exosphere, notably O, S and Al, have emission probabilities that are extremely weak. We have not observed S or Al in the Mercury exosphere but have a global average value for oxygen that is much less than the stoichiometric value. This may indicate that oxygen is bound in molecules. Going to lower altitudes will put us deeper in the exosphere, increasing our chances of measuring weak species.",

            "abstract": "The mechanics of rip currents are complex, involving interactions between waves, currents, water levels and the bathymetry, that present particular challenges for numerical models. We study the effects of the horizontal mixing on the wave-current interactions with the 3D fully-coupled model MARS-WW3. First, very weak mixing are used at high resolution. Modifications of the vorticity and wave fields, by adding of feedback from the currents to the waves, are in agreement with previous studies. The flow is purely non-stationary and, after half an hour, several vortices appear inside both the rip neck and feeder. The decrease of the mixing accentuates the nonstationary effects and the generation of vortices. Second, we consider a grid-spacing dependent mixing. Comparisons with simulations that use a constant value for the viscosity coefficient are carried out for three different cases of spatial resolution. The mixing is stronger than previously, leading to stabilization of the flow and reduction of the rip intensity. Wave rays diverge from channels towards bar crests due to refraction by both the bathymetry and current field, showing that the wave motion depends on the rip intensity. When the mixing is based on grid spacing, a high resolution is necessary to observe significant effects of the feedback from the currents to the waves. A grid-independent solution is obtained for a constant viscosity. With a viscosity dependent on the grid spacing, the wave motion at low resolution is the same for both coupling modes because the change in wave direction due to the currents is weak. The fully-coupled simulations show similar depth-averaged rip velocities for all mixing cases and resolutions, showing the improvement in the numerical convergence of the velocity thanks to the feedback from the currents to the waves. Horizontal mixing and feedback have little impact on the vertical shear of the 3D velocity, but strongly affect the intensity of the rip velocity.",

            "abstract": "The Adirondacks of New York have high levels of mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation as demonstrated by a region-wide fish consumption advisory for children and women who may become pregnant. The source of this Hg is atmospheric deposition that originates from regional, continental, and global emissions. Soils in the region have large Hg stores equivalent to several decades of atmospheric deposition suggesting that the processes controlling Hg transport from soils to surface waters may greatly affect Hg concentrations and loads in surface waters. Furthermore, Hg can be converted to its neuro-toxic methyl form (MeHg), particularly in riparian and wetland soils where biogeochemical conditions favor net methylation. We measured MeHg concentrations during 33 months at Fishing Brook, a 65 km2 catchment in the upper Hudson River basin in the Adirondacks. Seasonal variation in stream MeHg concentrations was more than tenfold, consistent with temperature-driven variation in net methylation rates in soils and sediment. These data also indicate greater than twofold annual variation in stream MeHg concentrations among the three monitored growing seasons. The driest growing season had the lowest MeHg concentrations, and these values were greater during the two wetter growing seasons. We hypothesize that contact of the riparian water table with abundant organic matter and MeHg stored in the shallowest soil horizons is a dominant control on MeHg transport to the stream. An empirical model was developed that accounted for 81% of the variation in stream MeHg concentrations. Water temperature and the length of time the simulated riparian water table remained in the shallow soil were key predictive variables, highlighting the sensitivity of MeHg to climatic variation. Future changes in other factors such as Hg emissions and deposition and acid deposition will likely also influence stream MeHg concentrations and loads. For example, lime application to an Adirondack stream to increase pH and enhance ecosystem recovery from acidification has increased MeHg concentrations, which may be associated with parallel increases in dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Future changes in the Hg cycle of this region will likely be complex, reflecting changes in climatic drivers and emissions of Hg and other air pollutants.",

We consider a one-dimensional example of an inextensible membrane bonded to a rigid substrat. This simplified toy model allows to focus on the physics of fracture and fluid-structure interaction. The evolution problem is formulated in terms of two principles: a stability criterion which consists in minimizing the total energy of the system (potential energy + fracture surface energy) and an energy balance condition which enforces the continuity of the total energy with respect to the loading. Different cases are analyzed, whether by considering the crack propagation horizontal or vertical. In this latter case, we measure the impact of the fluid's buoyancy on the results. We also investigate how viscosity of the fluid modifies the framework and its consequences on the crack's evolution compared to a quasi-static approach. Those preliminary results are essential milestones toward a 3-D resolution of the problem.",

            "abstract": "The objective of this study is to formulate and test plant water stress parameterizations for the recently proposed maximum entropy production (MEP) model of evapotranspiration (ET) over vegetated surfaces. . The MEP model of ET is a parsimonious alternative to existing land surface parameterizations of surface energy fluxes from net radiation, temperature, humidity, and a small number of parameters. The MEP model was previously tested for vegetated surfaces under well-watered and dry, dormant conditions, when the surface energy balance is relatively insensitive to plant physiological activity. Under water stressed conditions, however, the plant water stress response strongly affects the surface energy balance. This effect occurs through plant physiological adjustments that reduce ET to maintain leaf turgor pressure as soil moisture is depleted during drought. To improve MEP model of ET predictions under water stress conditions, the model was modified to incorporate this plant-mediated feedback between soil moisture and ET. We compare MEP model predictions to observations under a range of field conditions, including bare soil, grassland, and forest. The results indicate a water stress function that combines the soil water potential in the surface soil layer with the atmospheric humidity successfully reproduces observed ET decreases during drought. In addition to its utility as a modeling tool, the calibrated water stress functions also provide a means to infer ecosystem influence on the land surface state. Challenges associated with sampling model input data (i.e., net radiation, surface temperature, and surface humidity) are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Deep mantle seismic structure is dominated by two large, low shear wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) below Africa and the Pacific. While different tomography models have come to a consensus over the general geometry of these provinces, the degree of thermal versus chemical heterogeneity that defines them is contentious. The location of plumes that rise from these large structures may provide insight into this question. Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are thought to be the surface expression of plumes that formed in the deep mantle and subsequently rose through the mantle and erupted at the surface. When restored to their original location of eruption, these LIPs appear to lie approximately above the margins of LLSVPs. This spatial correlation has been used to argue that plumes are preferentially generated at margins of LLSVPs, a notion that would tend to favor a significant chemical gradient at this margin. We assessed the robustness of this correlation by performing a series of Monte Carlo-based statistical tests (Austermann et al., Geophys. J. Int., 2014). These tests confirm that the reconstructed locations of LIPs are spatially correlated with margins of LLSVPs, but they also show that LIPs are correlated with the full areal extent of LLSVPs (parameterized as regions of slower-than-average shear wave velocity). These two correlations cannot be statistically distinguished, which means the areal extent of LLSVPs is an equally likely zone for plume generation. Therefore, based on current tomography models and reconstructed locations of LIPs, we cannot distinguish whether LIPs originated preferentially at the margins of LLSVPs or whether this correlation is merely an outcome of their origin across the full areal extent of these large scale, deep mantle structures. We will discuss the implications of our findings on the growing debate over the relative contributions of thermal and chemical effects on the net buoyancy of the LLSVPs, a factor that ultimately controls their longevity.",

            "abstract": "Event deposits, such as e.g. turbidites incorporated in marine or lacustrine sediment sequences, may be caused by a wide range of possible triggering processes: failure of underwater slopes – either spontaneous or in response to earthquake shaking, hyperpycnal flows and floods, volcanic processes, etc. Determining the exact triggering process remains, however, a major challenge. Especially when studying the event deposits on sediment cores, which typically have diameters of only a few cm, only a small spatial window is available to analyze diagnostic textural and facies characteristics. We have performed X-ray CT scans on sediment cores from Chilean, Alaskan and Swiss lakes. Even when using relatively low-resolution CT scans (0.6 mm voxel size), many sedimentary structures and fabrics that are not visible by eye, are revealed. For example, the CT scans allow to distinguish tephra layers that are deposited by fall-out, from those that reached the basin by river transport or mud flows and from tephra layers that have been reworked and re-deposited by turbidity currents. The 3D data generated by the CT scans also allow to examine relative orientations of sedimentary structures (e.g. convolute lamination) and fabrics (e.g. imbricated mud clasts), which can be used to reconstruct flow directions. Such relative flow directions allow to determine whether a deposit (e.g. a turbidite) had one or several source areas, the latter being typical for seismically triggered turbidites. When the sediment core can be oriented (e.g. using geomagnetic properties), absolute flow directions can be reconstructed. X-ray CT scanning, at different resolution, is thus becoming an increasingly important tool for discriminating the exact origin of EDs, as it can help determining whether e.g. an ash layer was deposited as fall out from an ash cloud or fluvially washed into the lake, or whether a turbidite was triggered by an earthquake or a flood.",

            "abstract": "A substantial increase in fluvial sediment supply causes complex, large-magnitude changes in river and floodplain morphology. Although sedimentary and geomorphic responses to sediment influx are a fundamental part of landscape evolution, few opportunities exist to quantify those processes over field scales. We investigated downstream effects of sediment released during the largest dam removal in history, on the Elwha River, WA, USA, by measuring changes in riverbed elevation and topography, bed-sediment grain size, and channel planform as two dams were removed in stages over two years.\nAs 10.5 million t (7.1 million m3) of sediment was released from two former reservoirs, downstream dispersion of a sediment wave caused widespread bed aggradation of ~1 m (greater where pools filled), changed the river from pool-riffle to braided morphology, and decreased the slope of the lowermost river. The newly deposited sediment, which was finer than most of the pre-dam-removal bed, formed new bars (largely pebble, granule, and sand material), prompting aggradational channel avulsion that increased the channel braiding index by almost 50%. As a result of mainstem bed aggradation, floodplain channels received flow and accumulated new sediment even during low to moderate flow conditions. The river system showed a two- to ten-fold greater geomorphic response to dam removal (bed-elevation change) than it had to a 40-year flood event four years before dam removal. Two years after dam removal began, as the river had started to incise through the new deposits, approximately 1.2 million t of new sediment (~10% of the amount released from the two reservoirs) was stored along 18 river km of the mainstem channel and 25 km of floodplain channels. The Elwha River thus was able to transport most of the released sediment to the river mouth. The geomorphic alterations and changing bed-sediment grain size along the Elwha River have important ecological implications, affecting aquatic habitat structure, benthic fauna, salmonid fish spawning and rearing potential, and riparian vegetation. Response of the Elwha River to dam removal represents a unique opportunity to observe and quantify fundamental geomorphic processes associated with a massive sediment influx, and also provides important lessons for future river restorations.",

            "abstract": "Winds over the Amundsen Sea, West Antarctica, are a key driver of variability and change in regional ocean-ice interactions and therefore an important consideration in assessing past and future ice loss from glaciers over West Antarctica, which is an important component of global sea level change. The predictability of 21stcentury climate change in this region is affected significantly by the large atmospheric internal variability, driven in part by external tropical influences.\nIn this talk an assessment of 21st century projections of westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea (UAS) will be presented, based on output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble. The focus will be on quantifying the importance of model uncertainty and internal climate variability in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario projections and identifying potential sources of model uncertainty. In general the CMIP5 ensemble-mean response exhibits increases in UAS over the 21st century, with the Amundsen Sea being positioned on the poleward flank of large-scale westerly wind increases across mid-to-low latitudes. In terms of the annual mean, increases of 0.3 and 0.7 m s-1are simulated following the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively. However, as a consequence of large internal climate variability over the Amundsen Sea, it takes until approximately 2030 (2065) for the RCP8.5 response to exceed one (two) standard deviation(s) of decadal internal variability.\nIn all scenarios and seasons the model uncertainty is large. However the present-day climatological zonal wind bias over the whole South Pacific, which is important for tropical teleconnections, is strongly related to inter-model differences in projected change in UAS (more skilful models show larger UAS increases). This relationship is significant in winter (r = -0.56) and spring (r = -0.65), when the influence of the tropics on the Amundsen Sea region is known to be important. Horizontal grid spacing and present day sea ice extent were not found to be significant sources of inter-model spread. Possible physical/dynamical explanations for the above correlations will be discussed, in particular considering the role of tropical-Antarctic teleconnections and including current work extending the analysis to the Atlantic and Indian sectors.",

These field campaigns have generated a great wealth of observations, which are characterized by a wide range of trace gases and aerosol properties. The airborne observational data have often been used in assessment and validation of models and satellite instruments. The ASDC Toolset for Airborne Data (TAD) is being designed to meet the user community needs for manipulating aircraft data for scientific research on climate change and air quality relevant issues. Given the sheer volume of data variables across field campaigns and instruments reporting data on different time scales, this data is often difficult and time-intensive for researchers to analyze. The TAD web application is designed to provide an intuitive user interface (UI) to facilitate quick and efficient discovery from a vast number of airborne variables and data. Users are given the option to search based on high-level parameter groups, individual common names, mission and platform, as well as date ranges. Experienced users can immediately filter by keyword using the global search option. Once the user has chosen their required variables, they are given the option to either request PI data files based on their search criteria or create merged data, i.e. geo-located data from one or more measurement PIs. The purpose of the merged data feature is to allow users to compare data from one flight, as not all data from each flight is taken on the same time scale. Time bases can be continuous or based on the time base from one of the measurement time scales and intervals. After an order is submitted and processed, an ASDC email is sent to the user with a link for data download. The TAD user interface design, application architecture, and proposed future enhancements will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The evacuation of large silicic magma reservoirs via catastrophic caldera forming eruptions that emplace 100s to 1000s of km3 of material is a devastating and rare natural disaster on Earth. Given the destructive nature of these eruptions, it is critical to better understand the evolution of large silicic systems and what parameters are responsible for either maintaining magma in storage conditions or triggering an eruption. The formation of large, shallow magma bodies requires thermal maturation of the upper crust through elevated magma fluxes over periods of 104-106 years. Once the crust is thermally primed, the viscoelastic response of the host rock buffers the reservoir and stifles the generation of significant overpressure, thus accommodating the accumulation of large magma volumes (103-104 km3). Given that overpressures are difficult to generate in magma reservoirs of this size, increasing attention has been focused on better understanding what mechanisms may trigger their eruption. Recent analytical models suggest that buoyancy may play a critical role in generating the necessary overpressures to trigger eruption of the largest systems. We build upon these findings and utilize numerical models to quantify overpressure generation due to buoyancy and magmatic recharge. Furthermore, the interplay between reservoir growth and fault formation is explored to determine whether eruption triggering is most likely to occur due to fault development within the overlying roof or due to rupture at the reservoir boundary. Specifically, we utilize viscoelastic finite element models with Mohr-Coulomb and von Mises failure criteria to explore foundering in the roof and failure development at the reservoir boundary during buoyant magma recharge. Presented results will compare temperature- and non-temperature dependent viscosities with elastic models to investigate end-member controls on fault formation and reservoir rupture.",

            "abstract": "Over the past century, hydrological science has evolved through distinct eras as judged by ideas, information sources, technological advances and societal influences: Empirical Era which was data based with little theory, Systems Era that focused on input-output relationships, Process Era with a focus on processes, and the Geosciences Era where hydrology was considered an Earth System science. We argue that as the human footprint on earth becomes increasingly dominant, we are moving into a Co-evolution Era. Co-evolution implies that the components of the Earth system are intimately intertwined at many time scales – fast scales of immediate feedbacks that translate into slow scale interdependencies and trends. These involve feedbacks between the atmosphere, biota, soils and landforms, mediated by water flow and transport processes. The human factor is becoming a key component of this coupled system. While there is a long tradition of considering effects of water on humans, and vice versa, the new thrust on socio-hydrology has a number of defining characteristics that sets it apart from traditional approaches:\n- Capturing feedbacks of human-natural water system in a dynamic way (slow and fast processes) to go beyond prescribing human factors as mere boundary conditions. These feedbacks will be essential to understand how the system may evolve in the future into new, perhaps previously unobserved, states.\n- Quantifying system dynamics in a generalizable way. So far, water resources assessment has been context dependent, tied to local conditions. While for immediate decision making this is undoubtedly essential, for more scientific inquiry, a more uniform knowledge base is indispensable.\n- Not necessarily predictive. The coupled human-nature system is inherently non-linear, which may prohibit predictability in the traditional sense. The socio-hydrologic approach may still be predictive in a statistical sense and, perhaps even more importantly, it may yet reveal possible futures not predicted by traditional forecasts, yet essential for long-term decision making.\nGuided by these overarching arguments, and a review of recent progress, we will present a structured overview of socio-hydrology, framing the theoretical, observational and methodological challenges that lie ahead and ways to address them.",

            "abstract": "A challenging research puzzle in the research on sustainable water management in the Anthropocene is why some societies successfully recover from “ecological destruction” to transition to “successful adaptation” over decadal timescales, while others fail. We present a conceptual modeling framework to understand and characterize these transitions. In this way, we aim to capture the potential drivers of the desired shift towards achieving sustainability of socio-hydrological systems. This is done through a synthesis of detailed socio-hydrological analyses of four river basins in three continents, carried out using different quantitative socio-hydrologic models: Murrumbidgee River Basin in eastern Australia, Lake Toolibin Catchment in Western Australia, Tarim River Basin in Western China and Kissimmee River Basin, in south-east United States. The case studies are analysed using either place-based models designed specifically to mimic observed long-term socio-hydrologic trends, or generic conceptual models with foundations in diverse strands of literature including sustainability science and resilience theory. A comparative analysis of the four case studies reveals a commonality in the building blocks employed to model these socio-hydrologic systems; including water balance, economic, environmental and human-feedback components. Each model reveals varying interpretations of a common organising principle that could explain the shift between productive (socio-economic) and restorative (environmental) forces that was evident in each of these systems observed over a long time frame. The emergent principle is related to the essential drivers of the human feedback component and rests with a general formulation of human well-being, as reflected by both their economic and environmental well-being. It is envisaged that the understanding of the system drivers gained from such a comparative study would enable more targeted water management strategies that can be administered in developing basins to achieve overall sustainability.",

            "abstract": "We present the implementation of Similarity Based Kriging (SBK). This approach extends Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods, typically restricted to Euclidean spaces, to spaces that are non-Euclidean or perhaps even non-metric. SBK was inspired by problems in aquifer modeling, where inputs of numerical simulations are typically curves and parameter fields, and predicting scalar or vector outputs by Kriging with such very high-dimensional inputs may seem not feasible at first.\nSBK combines ideas from the distance-based set-up of Scheidt and Caers (2009) with GPR and allows calculating Kriging predictions based only on similarities between inputs rather than on their high-dimensional representation. Written in open source code, this proposed approach includes automated construction of SBK models and provides diagnostics to assess model quality both in terms of covariance fitting and internal/external prediction validation.\nCovariance hyperparameters can be estimated both by maximum likelihood and leave-one-out cross validation relying in both cases on efficient formulas and a hybrid genetic optimization algorithm using derivatives. The determination of the best dimension for Classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) and non-metric MDS of the data will be investigated. Application of this software to real life data examples in Euclidean and non-Euclidean (dis)similarity settings will be covered and touch on aquifer modeling, hydrogeological forecasting, and sequential inverse problem solving.\nIn the last case, a novel approach where a variant of the expected improvement criterion is used for choosing several points at a time will be presented. This part of the method and the previous covariance hyperparameter estimation parallelize naturally and we demonstrate how to save computation time by optimally distributing function evaluations over multiple cores or processors.",

Using a newly-developed, bias-corrected meteorological forcing dataset, we apply an attribution analysis to identify the relative role of four key physical drivers (temperature, net radiation, vapor pressure, and windspeed) in reducing atmospheric demand for water. We conduct a statistical analysis to correlate changes in these four key drivers to potential causal mechanisms, including atmospheric aerosol concentration and changes in the extent of irrigated cropland, which we identify using a novel, high accuracy landcover dataset. Finally, we use the DSSAT maize model, together with counter-factual climate scenarios, to investigate the implications of the PET decline on maize yields and maize irrigation demand. This study illustrates how improved meteorological data, better landcover maps, and crop simulation can be combined to 1) improve understanding of the linkages between the land surface and atmosphere, and 2) help inform crop and irrigation management under changing climates.",

In comnplex terrain, this variability is amplified but remains poorly understood mainly due to a lack of monitoring capabilities. This contribution deals with the characterization and the quantification of the variability of snowfall at small scales (up to 10 km) in the Swiss Alps as seen by a Doppler polarimetric weather radar.\nThe focus is first on the comparison of the horizontal variability in snowfall close to the surface (as seen by a radar) and in the snow accumulation on the ground (derived from aerial laser scans). The results show that the latter is larger than the former, pointing towards small-scale topographically induced winds as the main factor controlling the variability of snow accumulation. Second, the average vertical structure of snowfall is investigated using the polarimetric radar variables collected in vertical scans in the atmosphere. The main features of the vertical structure are related to the dominant microphysical processes at work.\nThese results are a (preliminray) step forward to better understand the variability of snowfall at small scales in complex terrain, and illustrate the need for additional effort to collect snowfall observations from a variety of sensors",

Here we present the first seawater Si isotope data set from the East China Sea (ECS), a large and productive marginal sea system in the western North Pacific, to examine sources and utilization of Si(OH)4. During two cruises in summer (August 2009) and in winter (December 2009-January 2010), samples for δ30SiSi(OH)4 analyses were collected along a cross-shelf transect, extending from near the mouth of the Changjiang River estuary to the slope area open to the Kuroshio Current (KC). In summer, the lowest surface δ30SiSi(OH)4 coincided with the highest Si(OH)4 concentrations observed nearest to the shore in the Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW). During advection on the ECS inner shelf, surface δ30SiSi(OH)4 increased rapidly from ~2.1‰ to ~3.1‰ while Si(OH)4 became highly depleted, indicating significant biological utilization and fractionation of Si isotopes from the CDW. Such fractionation was also seen from the vertical profiles characterized by a general decrease of δ30SiSi(OH)4 and an increase of Si(OH)4 with depth. In winter however, values of both parameters were nearly constant throughout the water column on the ECS shelf. The enhanced intrusion of the KC and vertical mixing dominated the distribution of the seawater δ30SiSi(OH)4 signatures. Significant seasonal differences in δ30SiSi(OH)4 were detected in the surface waters beyond the CDW region on the ECS shelf, where the winter values were ~1.0‰ lower than those in summer. Given that Si(OH)4 in these surface waters were primarily sourced from the Kuroshio subsurface water during both seasons, such seasonality suggested higher biological consumption and fractionation in summer than in winter.",

These remote sensing techniques can only be fully exploited if the charging mechanisms in volcanic plumes are well understood. Although the exact details of ash charging processes will vary from one eruption to another, triboelectrification, fractoemission, and the ‘‘dirty thunderstorm’’ mechanism are all thought to play a role in the electrification of ash near the vent. In addition to near-vent charging, observations show that charging can also occur in volcanic plumes up to hundreds of kilometres from the source region. The sustained nature of this charge in the presence of electrically conducting air suggests that a self-charging mechanism through the action of ash-to-ash contact charging (triboelectrification), may also play a role in the electrification of volcanic ash. This work describes a laboratory investigation into triboelectric charging of ash from the 2010 and 2011 volcanic eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull and Grímsvötn in Iceland respectively. Consistently with previous work, we find that the particle size distribution plays an important role in the magnitude of charging generated, specifically in terms of the normalized span of the particle size distribution. As well as triboelectrificiation, natural radioactivity in some volcanic ash could also contribute to self-charging of volcanic plumes, which is also examined here.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional seismic images of slabs and other mantle structures provide a first order constraint on the forces driving plate motions. Previous attempts to invert for plate motions from seismic images have blurry slabs that do not act as stress guides. Using forward models, we describe characteristics needed to capture the coupling between mantle structures and plates. In forward models, we capitalized on advances in adaptive mesh refinement and scalable solvers to simulate global mantle flow and plate motions, with plate margins resolved down to 1 km. Cold thermal anomalies within the lower mantle are coupled into oceanic plates through narrow high-viscosity slabs, altering the velocity of oceanic plates. Back-arc extension and slab rollback are emergent consequences of slab descent in the upper mantle. The forward models require the solution of a highly ill-conditioned non-linear Stokes equation. Based on a realistic rheological model with yielding and strain rate weakening from dislocation creep, we formulate inverse problems casted as PDE-constrained optimization problems and derive adjoints of the nonlinear Stokes and incompressibility equations. An inexact-Gauss Newton method is used to infer the rheological parameters while quantifying the uncertainty using the Hessian at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point. Through 2-D numerical experiments we demonstrate that when the temperature field is known from seismic images, we can recover all of these properties to varying levels of certainty: strength of plate boundaries, yield stress and strain rate exponent in the upper mantle. When the system becomes more unconstrained (when all three mechanical properties are unknown), there can be tradeoffs depending on how well the data approximates the realistic dynamics. As plate boundaries become weaker beyond a limiting value, the uncertainty of the inferred parameters increases due to insensitivity of plate motion to plate coupling. Using the inverse of the Hessian, we show approximations to tradeoffs between inferred quantities and compare them against tradeoffs exhibited by forward solves within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We find that posterior distribution using the Hessian at the MAP point is locally a good approximation to the posterior distribution found with MCMC.",

            "abstract": "In global climate models, relative humidity is found to remain roughly constant with warming, but no rigorous argument has been given as to why. We can attempt to address this gap by developing an analytical (i.e., pencil-and-paper) model for the relative humidity of a tropical atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium. Given a few inputs (the pressure, temperature, and the convective entrainment and detrainment rates), the equations predict the RH and the temperature lapse rate analytically. RH turns out to be a simple ratio involving the fractional detrainment rate and the water-vapor lapse rate. The theory explains the magnitude of RH and the \"C\" shape of the tropospheric RH profile. It also predicts that RH is an invariant function of temperature as the atmosphere warms, and this behavior matches what has been seen in global climate models and what is demonstrated here with cloud-resolving simulations varied over a 30-K SST range. Extending the theory to include the evaporation of hydrometeors, a lower bound is derived for the precipitation efficiency (PE) at each height: PE > 1-RH. In a cloud-resolving simulation, this constraint is obeyed with the PE profile taking the shape of an inverted \"C\".",

In less developed, data sparse regions, in situ data alone are insufficient to develop a comprehensive picture of how the water cycle is changing, and strategies that merge in-situ, model and satellite observations within a framework that results in consistent water cycle records is essential.\nThis presentation will utilize newly developed, multi-decadal water and energy cycles data sets to analyze and advance our understanding of the role of the terrestrial hydrosphere in Earth’s climate system. The data sets include a 60-year global water cycle dataset developed through a NASA-sponsored multi-institutional effort under the NASA MEaSUREs program, multi-model terrestrial evapotranspiration data sets coordinated under the GEWEX Data and Assessments Panel (GDAP) as part of the LandFlux initiative, and ocean evaporation under SeaFlux. The foundations of the datasets are a variety of independent large-scale datasets of the hydrologic variables that are used to bridge the gap between sparse in-situ observations, including remote-sensing based retrievals, observation-forced hydrologic modeling, and weather model reanalyses.\nAnalyses are carried out across a range of temporal and spatial scales from monthly to annual and decadal, and from ~250 river basins to continental and global scales, and will address long-standing GEWEX science questions that include (i) quantifying the nature and extent of changes (trends and variability) to the terrestrial hydrosphere over the last 60 years, and (ii) understanding the exchanges among the terrestrial, oceanic and atmospheric branches of the hydrosphere. The multi-decadal terrestrial water and energy budgets datasets permits putting recent studies done for shorter periods, and for specific variables, into a larger consistent framework.",

Project scientists and support staff flew five month-long missions over the Pacific Basin on the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V, High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) aircraft between January 2009 and September 2011, spread throughout the annual cycle, from the surface to 14 km in altitude, and from 87°N to 67°S.\nData from the HIPPO study of greenhouse gases and aerosols are now available to the atmospheric research community and the public. This comprehensive dataset provides the first high-resolution vertically resolved measurements of over 90 unique atmospheric species from nearly pole-to-pole over the Pacific Ocean across all seasons. The suite of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols is pertinent to understanding the carbon cycle and challenging global climate models. This dataset will provide opportunities for research across a broad spectrum of Earth sciences, including those analyzing the evolution in time and space of the greenhouse gases that affect global climate.\nThe Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) provides data management support for the HIPPO experiment including long-term data storage and dissemination. CDIAC has developed a relational database to house HIPPO merged 10-second meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and aerosol data. This data set provides measurements from all Missions, 1 through 5, that took place from January of 2009 to September 2011.

            "abstract": "The geological evolution of the brine lakes that filled the Dead Sea basin has been extensively studied on the sedimentary exposures and drill cores on the Sea marginal terraces of the modern Dead Sea. These geological sections documented the history of the epilimnion (upper brine) of the hypersaline lake during its high stands periods. The cores drilled during 2011 by ICDP in the deep basin of the Dead Sea at water depth of 300 m provided the first opportunity to study the history of the deepest part of the hypolimnion (deep brine) by measuring the chemical and isotopic composition of pore-fluids. The vertical profiles of chloride (Cl-) sodium (Na+) and oxygen isotopes (δ18O) in the pore brines revealed a substantial decrease in salinity of the hypolimnion during the high stand of the last glacial Lake Lisan (the last glacial predecessor of the modern Dead Sea), particularly during MIS2 (~31-17 ka BP). Diffusion-deposition model indicated that Cl- concentration of the deep hypolimnetic brine decreased gradually to less than 2/3 of its present value. The δ18O at the same time increased to maximum of ~7‰ (3‰ higher than today). Beforehand, during the interglacial and later during the post-glacial and the Holocene the Cl- concentrations and δ18O values were similar to those of the modern Dead Sea. The slow dilution of the deep Ca-chloride brine was caused probably by continuous turbulent mixing of the hypolimnion with the less saline high δ18O epilimnetic brine, across the epilimnion/hypolimnion interface (EHI). The increase in δ18O during the salinity decrease of Lake Lisan was a result of evaporative fractionation of the less saline epilimnetic brine. The post-glacial δ18O decrease while salinity increased is attributed to the “reversed” δ18O fractionation during evaporation of very high salinity brine. Increase in the Na/Cl ratio due to dissolution of halite without reaching halite saturation was also observed during the freshening period.",

As a part of that effort, the Surface Physics Experimental Catamaran (SPEC) was outfitted with a suite of concurrently sampled atmospheric and oceanographic sensors. These included a meteorological mast capable of measuring the air-sea momentum flux, paired subsurface ADV’s, a downward looking ADCP, and a bow-mounted wave-staff array. Using a mobile platform enabled capturing the fine-scale dynamical features across this highly sheared zone, without compromising spatial or temporal resolution. The SPEC was deployed, in part, to make direct wind stress measurements and the eddy covariance method was used to calculate the 10 m neutral drag coefficients from the observed wind shear velocities. In general, for any given wind speed, measured drag coefficients were about 2.5 times greater than those derived from bulk relations (e.g. Smith, 1988). Observations of the wind stress angle show significant wind stress steering, up to about 70o off the mean wind direction, within 2 km off-shore of the inlet mouth. The causes for the departure of these observations from conventional open ocean results remains under investigation, although it is highly likely that these findings highlight processes unique to coastal waters that are not regarded in the well-established algorithms (e.g. depth-limited wave breaking and wave-current interactions). Preliminary results from the second installment in the RIVET campaign, which took place at the Mouth of the Columbia River during the spring of 2013, will also be shown.",

            "abstract": "Based on the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis dataset covering 1958–2012, this paper demonstrates a statistically\nsignificant relationship between the occurrence of major stratospheric sudden warming events (SSWs) in\nmidwinter and the seasonal timing of stratospheric final warming events (SFWs) in spring. Specifically, early\nspring SFWs that on average occur in early March tend to be preceded by non-SSW winters, while late spring\nSFWs that on average take place up until early May are mostly preceded by SSW events in midwinter. Though\nthe occurrence (absence) of SSW events in midwinter may not always be followed by late (early) SFWs in\nspring, there is a much higher (lower) probability of late SFWs than early SFWs in spring after SSW (non-\nSSW) winters, particularly when the winter SSWs occur no earlier than early January or in the period from\nlate January to early February. Diagnosis shows that, corresponding to an SSW (non-SSW) winter and the\nfollowing late (early)-SFW spring, intensity of planetary wave activity in the stratosphere tends to evolve out\nof phase from midwinter to the following spring, being anomalously stronger (weaker) in winter and\nanomalously weaker (stronger) in spring. Furthermore, the strengthening of the western Eurasian high, which\nappears during early to mid-January in late-SFW years but does not appear until late February to mid-March\nin early-SFW years, always precedes the strengthening of planetary wave activity in the stratosphere and thus\nacts as a tropospheric precursor to the seasonal timing of SFWs.",

            "abstract": "Neoproterozoic arc mantle beneath the Arabian Nubian Shield (ANS) in the Eastern Desert (ED) of Egypt exhumed due to intra-oceanic upthrusting are represented mainly by exposed ophiolitic peridotites serpentinized to different degree. Metamorphism is related to the Pan-African collision and the subduction of oceanic lithosphere. However, polarity of the Pan-African intra-oceanic subduction is still questionable. We here trace the variation of the degree of serpentinization and regional metamorphism of six serpentinite masses, widely distributed in the ED (from the east to the west: W (Wadi). Alam, W. Igla, W. Mubarak, G. El-Maiyit, W. Um El Saneyat and W. Atalla). This is based on their mineralogy, textures and mineral chemistry.\nMuch difference in the degree of serpentinization is obvious among these rocks. They are mainly partly serpentinized containing primary olivine and orthopyroxene at W. Alam and W. Igla, while they are completely serpentinized in the other localities. With the increased degree of metamorphism, textures were transformed from the pseudomorphic to the non-pseudomorphic. The most common retrograde assemblage is composed of lizardite _ chrysotile_ brucite_ magnetite. The serpentine prograde textures can be viewed as a continuum from retrograde lizardite pseudomorphic textures, to very fine-grained transitional texture of lizardite and chrysotile, to chrysotile antigorite interlocking texture and finally to antigorite interpenetrating texture. These textures appear to represent successive stages in a recrystallization event. In late subduction-related metamorphism and early collisional emplacement stage, mylonitic-antigorite serpentinites formed and antigorite became the major phase in G. El-Maiyit, Um El-Saneyat andW. Atalla.\nCompositional zoning in spinel grains in all serpentinites reflect variation in the degree of alteration. The biggest variation of spinel compositions are among serpentinites from Um El-Saneyat and W. Atalla. The alteration zones were formed in a temperature < 400 °C to 550 °C corresponding to the low green-schist to the lower amphibolite facies.\nSo, we propose that this is concordant with a westward polarity of the subducting oceanic lithosphere, associating the intra-oceanic arc ophiolite during the closure of the Mozambique ocean.",

            "abstract": "Effective fisheries management requires forecasting population changes. We find a negative relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and subsequently surveyed biomass and catch of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, off the New England coast. A 1-unit NAO increase is associated with a 17% decrease in surveyed biomass of age-1 cod the following year. This relationship persists as the cod mature, such that observed NAO can be used to forecast future adult biomass. We also document that an NAO event lowers catch for up to 15 years afterward. In contrast to forecasts by existing stock assessment models, our NAO-driven statistical model successfully hindcasts the recent collapse of New England cod fisheries following strong NAO events in 2007 and 2008 (see figure). This finding can serve as a template for forecasting other fisheries affected by climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Central Tropical Pacific Ocean may experience large, abrupt climate variations on a century to millennial time scale that greatly impact ocean ecosystem structure and function, including primary productivity, plankton community composition, and biogeochemical cycling. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of exported production are valuable proxies for past ocean plankton community composition, trophic structure, and nutrient utilization. However, very few long-term, high-resolution records exist from the tropics, which can establish how millennial climate variability is inherently linked to tropical ecosystem dynamics. Sediment cores are valuable archives of past ocean ecosystem dynamics, but have limited temporal resolution. In contrast, deep-sea proteinaceous corals act as living sediment traps due to direct incorporation of sinking organic matter into their organic skeletons. Since colonies can live for thousands of years, proteinaceous coral archives can significantly extend the length and resolution of δ13C and δ15N records in the open ocean. Here we present three δ13C and δ15N records obtained from the coral species Kulamanamana haumeaae that provide multi-decadal scale resolution δ13C and δ15N records, for the first time extending up to ~2600 years into the past. We observed large-scale oscillations in δ13C and δ15N values on century to millennial time scales that correspond to known major climate events, including the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age, and the onset of the Industrial Revolution. These records will provide new insights into the variations in plankton community structure and nutrient dynamics in the equatorial pacific linked to long-term climate oscillations.",

The notebook document format and multi-process architecture introduced in 2011 have expanded the applicable scope of IPython into teaching, presenting, and sharing computational work, in addition to interactive exploration. The new architecture also allows users to work in any language, with implementations in Python, R, Julia, Haskell, and several other languages.\nThe language agnostic parts of IPython have been renamed to Jupyter, to better capture the notion that a cross-language design can encapsulate commonalities present in computational research regardless of the programming language being used. This architecture offers components like the web-based Notebook interface, that supports rich documents that combine code and computational results with text narratives, mathematics, images, video and any media that a modern browser can display. This interface can be used not only in research, but also for publication and education, as notebooks can be converted to a variety of output formats, including HTML and PDF.\nRecent developments in the Jupyter project include a multi-user environment for hosting notebooks for a class or research group, a live collaboration notebook via Google Docs, and better support for languages other than Python.",

            "abstract": "Recent imager and radar observations in the nightside polar cap have shown evidence of localized flow channels propagating anti-sunward, and polar cap patches are often associated with such flow channels. It is crucial to understand how these polar cap flow channels and patches are created and propagate deep into the polar cap. In our study, we use all-sky imagers of the AGO network in Antarctica for dayside patch observations and DMSP for measuring density and velocity associated with the patches. We have identified 39 conjunction events in during the southern winter seasons of 2007-2011, the conjunctions being primarily in the pre-noon sector due to the MLT of the satellite orbit. We find that longitudinally narrow flow enhancements directed anti-sunward are well collocated with patches for all events. The flows over the patches are typically ~1000 m/s and are substantially larger than the weak large-scale background flows, and the widths of the flow enhancement are similar to the patch widths (~400 km). The flow channel speeds average 1070 m/sec over the observed patches, and the average width is 302 km. We also investigated the IMF Bz, IMF clock angle and oval-patch distance dependences of properties of the airglow patches and related fast flows. We found that the airglow patches propagating deeper into the polar cap have with higher density. The patches with fast peaks flow speeds >~2000 m/s are predominantly seen near the auroral oval, and those patches tend to propagate azimuthally away from noon without substantial poleward propagation. The peak flow speeds of patches propagating deep into the polar cap are smaller, but still reach ~1000 m/s for our cases which extend to about 6° away from the auroral oval. Fast flows of >~2000 m/s are predominantly seen during large IMF –By and small |Bz|, and the flow speed decreases with increasing –Bz. The –By preference is consistent with the duskside convection cell extending toward dawn and giving a higher possibility of a flow channels being seen on the dawnside. The presence of fast, anti-sunward flow channels associated with the polar cap patches suggests that the flow channels form in the dayside polar region, and can serve as the source of flow channels measured in the nightside polar cap.",

            "abstract": "Air pollutants (SLCPs) such as tropospheric ozone and aerosols are mainly affected by meteorological variables and emissions. East Asia is one of important source regions of both anthropogenic and natural air pollutants and GHGs. Therefore, significant environmental changes are expected in the future and air quality modeling is the important methodology to quantitatively evaluate them. Multiple emission inventories with various spatio-temporal resolutions are necessary in support of many different air quality modeling and future climate chage researches. Many emission inventories have been developed for Asia and for Globe, such as TRACE-P, INTEX, REAS, CREATE, MICS-Asia, HTAP, SRES, RCP. Those inventories have been successfully used for many international researches, but also have several limitations including relatively old base year, limited number of pollutants/types, and low transparency of sector/fuel information. Understanding discrepancies and similarities among those intentories would give us a better insights to understand not only present status regional emissions amounts but structures of society and policy that link to the future emissions. To understand these, we; 1) selected several base-year bottom-up anthropogenic emission inventories over East Asia, 2) inter-compare emission inventories with more comprehensive sector/fuel classification, 3) explorer emissions change with more updated acvities, emission factors, and control options. The tentative results show that more than 50% of emission amount could be differ by inventory selection and more than 30% of emissions could be changed by emissions factor and/or control options. More findings regarding to these objectives will be presented on site",

            "abstract": "The Arabian Peninsula (AP), like many places around the world, is apparently witnessing the impacts (amount, patterns, and frequency of precipitation) of global warming. Precipitation over the AP is largely controlled by two main wind regimes, the winter (October to March) northerlies or northwesterlies, hereafter referred to as westerlies, and the summer (April to September) monsoonal wind regimes. The global monthly Climate Prediction Centers (CPC) Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) data (spatial resolution: 2.5° × 2.5°; temporal resolution: monthly; operational period: January 1979 to November 2011) was used to investigate the nature and magnitude of precipitation variations over the AP throughout 1979 - 2010. Trends in CMAP-derived precipitation patterns were examined over the winter and summer seasons throughout Periods I (1979-1995) and II (1996-2010). Reversals in precipitation patterns were observed in Periods I and II, where areas witnessing an increase in precipitation in Period I showed a decrease in precipitation throughout Period II, and vice versa for the remaining areas. Our findings suggest: (1) an increase in precipitation during Period I over the southeastern and southwestern coastal areas of AP (e.g., Muscat, Sanaa, and Jeddah) that is probably related to the intensification of the monsoons at the expense of the westerlies, (2) an increase in precipitation during Period II over the northwestern and southeastern of AP (e.g., northwestern Saudi Arabia, Empty Quarter, western and southwestern Oman, and eastern Yemen) is here attributed to intensification of the westerlies, and 3) the general similarity of annual trend patterns to the summer trend (Period I) and to winter trend (Period II) suggest that the annual trends are largely controlled by monsoonal wind regimes in Period I and by the westerlies in Period II. Outputs (i.e., precipitation) of climatic models (CCSM4.0) over the AP are being extracted (for upcoming 100 years) , downscaled, and correlated with Period II precipitation trends to investigate whether the observed precipitation trends in Period II mark the onset of global warming-related climate change.",

            "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that inorganic mercury (Hg) loadings to Arctic lakes decline with latitude. However, monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations in fish and their prey do not decline in a similar fashion, suggesting that higher latitude lakes are more vulnerable to Hg inputs. Preliminary results will be presented from a three-year study (2012-2015) of climate effects on MMHg bioaccumulation in lakes of the eastern Canadian Arctic. We have investigated mercury transport and accumulation processes in lakes and ponds from three study regions along a latitudinal gradient in climate-controlled ecosystem types in the Canadian Arctic, specifically sub-Arctic taiga, Arctic tundra and polar desert. In each water body, we measured key aspects of MMHg bioaccumulation—MMHg bioavailability to benthic food webs and organism growth rates—as well as how watershed characteristics affect the transport of Hg and organic carbon to lakes. Novel approaches were incorporated including the use of passive samplers (Diffusive Gradient in Thin Film samplers or DGTs) to estimate sediment bioavailable MMHg concentrations and tissue RNA content to compare organism short-term growth rates. A comparison of Arctic tundra and sub-Arctic taiga lakes showed that surface water concentrations of MMHg were strongly and positively correlated to total Hg concentrations both within and among study regions, implying strong control of inorganic Hg supply. Sediment concentrations of bioavailable MMHg were highly variable among lakes, although average concentrations were similar between study regions. Local environmental conditions appear to have a strong influence on sediment potential for MMHg supply. Lake-dwelling Arctic char from tundra lakes had similar or higher total Hg concentrations compared with brook trout from sub-Arctic lakes that were exposed to higher water MMHg concentrations. Potential environmental drivers of these patterns will be discussed. This latitudinal study will provide new information on how climate change may affect temporal and geographic trends of Hg bioaccumulation in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The dominant products of Mn(II) oxidation are manganese(IV)-oxide phases, which act as important environmental oxidants and sorbents in soils, freshwater, and marine sediments. Mn(IV) oxides also provide favorable electron acceptors for metal-reducing microbes, but the intermediates and final products formed are highly dependent on environmental conditions, and challenging to predict thermodynamically. We engineered a flow-through reactor system to study the Mn phases during microbial Mn(IV) reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in real time, using synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to monitor redox and mineralogical changes. These 10-20 hour experiments capture Mn XAS spectra every 20 minutes and thus we can observe both transient phases and stable products under different experimental conditions. We also record the pH, collect solution and filtered solid samples throughout the experiments for later solute measurements, and confirm mineral identifications with synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements. With excess organic carbon and high (mM) phosphate (like in a soil), Mn(IV) oxides are reduced to Mn(II) and immediately form Mn(II) phosphate in a clearly binary system. This experiment demonstrates that while there may be two successive single-electron transfer reactions from outer membrane cytochromes (Lin et al, 2012), the microbial reduction of Mn(IV) oxides is effectively a two-electron process. However, with minimal phosphate, a transient Mn(III) oxyhydroxide forms before all manganese is reduced to Mn(II) in solution and precipitates a final Mn(II)-carbonate product. We propose this Mn(III) intermediate phase forms due to reaction of Mn2+ in solution with Mn(IV)-oxide surfaces to form Mn(III)OOH, similar to experimental results from this abiotic comproportionation reaction (Elzinga, 2011). Recently, we stabilized this Mn(III) intermediate by limiting the organic carbon available to S. oneidensis, producing Mn(III)OOH and Mn(II) phases—an enigmatic but common assemblage in Mn-rich sedimentary rocks deposited on Earth after the rise of oxygen. Understanding how the reductive arm of the manganese cycle functions under a variety of environmental conditions will allow us to better predict the fate of Mn phases in a range of both modern and ancient environments.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic redistribution (HR) of soil water by plants occurs in seasonally dry ecosystems worldwide. During drought, water flows from deep moist soil, through plant roots, into dry (often litter-rich) upper soil layers. Using modeling, we explored how physical transport processes driven by transpiration and hydraulic redistribution interact with root physiology (nutrient uptake and carbon exudation) and soil properties (soil texture and cation exchange) to influence nitrogen and carbon concentrations in the rhizosphere. At the single root scale, we modeled a 10-cm radial soil domain, and simulated solute transport, soil cation exchange, and root exudation and nutrient uptake under two water flow patterns: daytime transpiration without nighttime HR, and daytime transpiration with nighttime HR. During HR, water efflux flushed solutes away from the root, diluting the concentrations of key nutrients like nitrate. The transport of cations by transpiration in the day and their accumulation near the root led to competitive desorption of ammonium from soil further from the root and generation of hotspots of ammonium availability at night. HR influenced the spatial and temporal patterns of these hotspots and their intensity. They were also influenced by soil properties of texture and cation exchange capacity. This dynamic resource landscape caused by diel cycling between transpiration and hydraulic redistribution presents a stage for greater complexity of microbial interactions. We are currently embedding a microbial community and small food web into this rhizosphere model in order to explore how organisms responsible for nutrient and soil carbon cycling respond to these fluctuating resource regimes.",

            "abstract": "It remains uncertain whether the maximum extent of Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth glaciations involves total sea ice coverage or significant open ocean. Models disagree, and the geologic record is inconclusive, but a resolution to this key question has important ramifications for how climate processes function at extremes, as well as for the distribution of habitable space for nascent multicellular life.\nHere we report results of new Sturtian (ca 715 Ma) Snowball Earth simulations that explore the response to three primary climate forcings often cited as contributing to Neoproterozoic cold climates: a continent distribution in low to mid-latitudes, a reduction in solar input (-6.19%), and lowered atmospheric CO2 (40 ppm). The simulations use the latest GISS ModelE2-R, with a coupled dynamic ocean using a 2° X 2.5° atmosphere and 1° x 1.25° ocean resolution. The GCM includes dynamic sea ice, an improved ocean mixing scheme, and continental runoff directed via a river drainage scheme.\nThe GCM responds rapidly to the extreme forcings, and within 300 years the sea ice front reaches the subtropics, but after 1000 years the sea ice extent remains stable near 30° latitude, despite global average surface air temperatures dropping to -12°C. Tropical sea surface temperatures are above 5°C and nearly half the ocean surface area remains ice-free. This result differs from published results using CCSM4, but is consistent with previous NASA GCMs. Examining the tropical energy fluxes and heat transports from both atmosphere and oceans shows that for the GISS model, increases in tropical sea ice would require higher surface albedos, stronger poleward heat transports, or a reduced greenhouse effect. Atmospheric composition and cloud forcing are likely sources of this major difference in response amongst the newest versions of these IPCC models. Tropical cloud forcing must be a major suspect, since it also differs dramatically among IPCC models for future climate. We continue to stress that our “slushball” solution can readily accommodate the geological record of Neoproterozoic glacial activity, as well as the ecological space needed for the development of complex life.",

            "abstract": "Of the numerous mechanisms to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions on statewide, regional or national scales in the United States, a tax on carbon is perhaps one of the simplest. By taxing emissions directly, the costs of carbon emissions are incorporated into decision-making processes of market actors including consumers, energy suppliers and policy makers. A carbon tax also internalizes the social costs of climate impacts. In structuring carbon tax revenues to reduce corporate and personal income taxes, the negative incentives created by distortionary income taxes can be reduced or offset entirely. In 2008, the first carbon tax in North America across economic sectors was implemented in British Columbia through such a revenue-neutral program. In this work, we investigate the economic and environmental effects of a carbon tax in the state of Oregon with the goal of informing the state legislature, stakeholders and the public. The study investigates 70 different economic sectors in the Oregon economy and six geographical regions of the state. The economic model is built upon the Carbon Tax Analysis Model (C-TAM) to provide price changes in fuel with data from: the Energy Information Agency National Energy Modeling System (EIA-NEMS) Pacific Region Module which provides Oregon-specific energy forecasts; and fuel price increases imposed at different carbon fees based on fuel-specific carbon content and current and projected regional-specific electricity fuel mixes. CTAM output is incorporated into the Regional Economic Model (REMI) which is used to dynamically forecast economic impacts by region and industry sector including: economic output, employment, wages, fiscal effects and equity. Based on changes in economic output and fuel demand, we further project changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from economic activity and calculate revenue generated through a carbon fee. Here, we present results of this modeling effort under different scenarios of carbon fee and avenues for revenue repatriation.",

            "abstract": "The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) executed science observations in lunar orbit spanning 2013-Oct-16– 2014-04-18 UT. LADEE’s Ultraviolet/Visible Spectrometer (UVS) studies the composition and temporal variations of the tenuous lunar exosphere and dust environment, utilizing two sets of optics: a limb-viewing telescope, and a solar-viewer. The limb-viewing telescope observes illuminated dust and emitting gas species while the Sun is just behind the lunar limb. The solar viewer, with its diffuser, allows UVS to also stare directly at the solar disk as it approaches the limb, sampling progressively lower exosphere altitudes.\n Solar viewer “Occultation” activities occur at the lunar sunrise limb, as the LADEE spacecraft passes into the lunar night side, facing the Sun (the spacecraft orbit is near-equatorial retrograde). A loss of transmission of sunlight occurs by the occultation of dust grains along the line-of-sight [1, 2].\nSo-called “Inertial Limb” activities have the limb-viewing telescope pointed at the lit exosphere just after the Sun has set. Inertial Limb activities follow a similar progression of diminishing sampling altitudes but hold the solar elongation angle constant so the zodiacal light contribution remains constant while seeking to observe the weak lunar horizon glow [2,3,4].\nOn the dark side of the moon, “Sodium Tail” activities pointed the limb-viewing telescope in the direction of the Moon’s sodium tail (~anti-sunward), during different lunar phases. Of the UVS data sets, these show the largest excess of scattered blue light, indicative of the presence of small (~100 nm) dust grains in the tail. Correlations are sought between dust in the sodium tail and meteor streams [5] and magnetotail [3] crossings to investigate impact- versus electrostatic-lofting [6]. Once lofted, nanoparticles can become charged and picked up by the solar wind [7,8].\nThe LADEE UVS Occultation, Inertial Limb, and Sodium Tail spectral datasets provide evidence of a lunar dust exosphere.\n[1] Wooden et al. 2014, LPSC 45, 2123 [2] Wooden et al.

            "abstract": "Forest fires and wildfires can threaten ecosystems, wildlife, property, and often, large swaths of populations. Early warning of active fire hotspots plays a crucial role in planning, managing, and mitigating the damaging effects of wildfires. The NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) has been providing active fire location information to users in easy-to-use formats for the better part of last decade, with a view to improving the alerting mechanisms and response times to fight forest and wildfires. FIRMS utilizes fires flagged as hotspots by the MODIS instrument flying aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites and sends early warning of detected hotspots via email in near real-time or as daily and weekly summaries. The email alerts can also be customized to send alerts for a particular region of interest, a country, or a specific protected area or park. In addition, a web mapping component, named “Web Fire Mapper” helps query and visualize hotspots. A newer version of Web Fire Mapper is being developed to enhance the existing visualization and alerting capabilities. Plans include supporting near real-time imagery from Aqua and Terra satellites to provide a more helpful context while viewing fires. Plans are also underway to upgrade the email alerts system to provide mobile-formatted messages and short text messages (SMS). The newer version of FIRMS will also allow users to obtain geo-located image snapshots, which can be imported into local GIS software by stakeholders to help further analyses. This talk will discuss the FIRMS system, its enhancements and its role in helping map, alert, and monitor fire hotspots by providing quick data visualization, querying, and download capabilities.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics governing the upper ocean at submeso to meso scales (~1-300 km) are a topic of recent debate. Horizontal wavenumber spectra of kinetic energy (KE) estimated from satellite data and global models rolloff as k-2 which have been interpreted as evidence for surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) turbulence. Shipboard ADCP observations in the Gulf Stream, however, indicate steeper (k-3) KE spectra in the 20-200 km range and a ratio of across to along-track KE components of ~3, consistent with quasi-geostrophic (QG) turbulence. We use 13 years of shipboard ADCP measurements, altimeter data, and a new internal-tide-resolving and submesoscale-admitting Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) simulation to study the horizontal scales of variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in Drake Passage. Horizontal wavenumber spectra of KE in the 10-200 km range from Drake Passage ADCP observations rolloff as k-3, reminiscent of QG turbulence. The average ratio of the KE components, however, is <2. Analyses of the MITgcm numerical simulation and stochastically-generated vector velocity fields suggest that the presence of ageostrophic, horizontally-divergent motions significantly alters the QG spectral characteristics, in qualitative agreement with the ADCP KE spectra. Ageostrophic flows, likely dominated by internal tides, appear to project onto scales as large as 150 km but are more dramatic in the 10-40 km subrange where the KE component ratio is ~1. The simplest interpretation consistent with the available data is one of QG turbulence co-existing and interacting with unbalanced motions to generate the observed upper-ocean KE spectrum in the 10-200 km range. We find no signature of SQG turbulence.",

Using Version 22 JOINT_AS, this study analyzed characteristics of the observed AOT distributions and compared various statistical moments of aerosol optical thickness derived from JOINT_AS with the results from Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) simulation. Overall, marginal distributions of AOT show highly positive skewness at many grid points. Some of the large skewness values are related to the problems in MISR’s retrieval algorithm. For example, the positive skewness in AOT for strongly absorbing aerosols at mid- and high latitudes in winter results from few outlier values is due to cloud contamination over a wide area. Combined AOT for multiple MISR aerosol types is comparable to the AOT for carbonaceous, sulfate aerosols and dust particles from the NICAM simulation implemented with aerosol transport processes. NICAM’s carbonaceous aerosols in the Southwest Africa show good agreement with MISR’s strongly absorbing aerosols. The AOT of dust particles in MISR and NICAM exhibit similar spatial patterns over the Sahara desert. The AOT of nonabsorbing aerosols in MISR well represents spatial distributions of the sulfate aerosols originating from industrial complex over the Shandong Peninsula in China. Our results indicate that MISR’s AOT for each aerosol type may be useful for monitoring biomass burning, dust storms and air pollution and evaluating chemistry climate models.",

            "abstract": "Leaf temperature is critical to plant function, and it can be used to examine forest responses to droughts, heat waves, and storm events. The recent development of thermal infrared (TIR) imaging techniques has offered indirect measurement of forest canopy skin temperature, and it allows for extensive temporal and spatial sampling compared to direct thermocouple-based measurements. However, the accuracy of TIR indirect canopy temperature is not well understood, as few studies have evaluated how TIR-derived temperatures compare to other approaches. The objectives of this study are: (1) to monitor canopy temperatures of a coniferous forest canopy using a TIR camera and in situ sensors; (2) to evaluate the reliability of TIR canopy temperatures by comparing against leaf temperatures measured by thermocouples; (3) to develop and examine methods for improving TIR measures based on corrections of camera’s default parameters (“Recalculation”) and records of sensitivity by parameter changes (“Data-training”). This study showed the canopy temperatures varied from -5 and 30°C, and the patterns of changes between the TIR and thermocouple measures corresponded well. Overall, TIR canopy temperatures were underestimated against the direct thermocouple measurements with mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.83-1.38°C and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.11-1.53°C for the study period. The modified TIR temperatures from the “Recalculation” method exhibited MAE of 0.56-0.95°C and RMSE of 0.83-1.15°C, and those by the “Data-training” method resulted in MAE of 0.32-0.50°C and RMSE of 0.53-0.83°C. Our results demonstrate that the TIR technique includes small errors for canopy temperature measurements; however, the range of errors is smaller when correction methods are applied.",

Mutual gravitational interactions between the two planets perturb the planets' transit times, allowing the planets' masses to be measured. Despite the similarity of their masses and orbital radii, the planets show a stark contrast in their mean densities; the inner planet (Kepler-36 b) is more than eight times as dense as its outer companion planet (Kepler-36 c). We perform a photo-dynamical analysis of the Kepler-36 system based on more than three years of Kepler photometry. With N-body integrations of initial conditions sampled from the photo-dynamical fits, we further refine the properties of the system by ruling out solutions that show large scale instability within 5 Giga-days. Ultimately, we measure the planets' masses within 4.2% precision, and the planets' radii with 1.8% precision. Kepler-36 b is currently the rocky exoplanet with the most precisely measured mass and radius. Kepler-36 b’s mass and radius are consistent with a Earth-like composition, and an iron-enhanced Mercury-like composition is ruled out.",

            "abstract": "The South American Andes exhibit strong morphological differences along strike, shaped by a combination of tectonic forces and surface processes. In the central Peruvian Andes (~12°S) a major morphological transition occurs; to the north, the spines of the Western and Eastern Cordilleras come together into a relatively narrow configuration of high topography. In Southern Peru, the region of high topography widens, where the Western and Eastern Cordilleras flank the broad, Altiplano plateau. Despite this morphological change, the Mesozoic-early Cenozoic Coastal Batholith outcrops continuously from 0°-18°S along the western margin of the Peruvian Andes, emplaced along a trench-parallel marginal basin in the Mesozoic. The Coastal Batholith is an ideal geologic setting to investigate potential differences in rock exhumation and cooling histories along the western margin of Peru. While the cooling history of the southern Coastal Batholith has been previously used to estimate timing and magnitude of rock exhumation in Southern Peru, north of 12°S it is poorly constrained. We present 16 zircon and 7 apatite (U-Th)/He mean-ages from three sites, across seven degrees of latitude (5°S to 12°S). In general, ZHe and AHe ages capture two stages of cooling, Oligocene-to-mid-Miocene and mid-to-late Miocene, respectively. We model time-temperature histories of samples with paired AHe and ZHe ages using a Monte-Carlo inversion of HeFTy® (Ketcham, 2005); best fit time-temperature pathways show cooling rates ranging from ~2-24°C/my, where fastest cooling rates are generally observed in the mid-Miocene. To estimate exhumation rates, we apply a simple thermal model to account for nonuniform geothermal gradients expected in a trench-arc setting. Exhumation rates range from ~0.2mm/yr in the north, to 0.4-0.7mm/yr in the south, and rates increase orogenward, where mean elevation is highest. These results, particularly the predominance of Miocene ZHe and AHe data, and the younging eastward pattern of cooling, suggest that a mid-to-late Miocene crustal cooling event affected the entire Coastal Batholith of Peru, with higher rates of exhumation in the core of the range. This may imply a broad-scale, regional mechanism, such as enhanced rock exhumation due to a regional climate change, or a change in plate kinematics. ",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Forest Service plans to conduct forest restoration treatments through the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI) on hundreds of thousands of acres of ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona over the next 20 years with the goals of reducing wildfire hazard and improving forest health. The 4FRI’s key objective is to thin and burn the forests to create within-stand openings that “promote snowpack accumulation and retention which benefit groundwater recharge and watershed processes at the fine (1 to 10 acres) scale”. However, little is known about how these openings created by restoration treatments affect snow water equivalence (SWE) and soil moisture, which are key parts of the water balance that greatly influence water availability for healthy trees and for downstream water users in the Sonoran Desert.\nWe have examined forest canopy cover by calculating a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a key indicator of green vegetation cover, using Landsat satellite data. We have then compared NDVI between treatments at our study sites in northern Arizona and have found statistically significant differences in tree canopy cover between treatments. The control units have significantly greater forest canopy cover than the treated units. The thinned units also have significantly greater tree canopy cover than the thin-and-burn units. Winter season Landsat images have also been analyzed to calculate Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), a key indicator of snow water equivalence and snow accumulation at the treated and untreated forests. The NDSI values from these dates are examined to determine if snow accumulation and snow water equivalence vary between treatments at our study sites. NDSI is significantly greater at the treated units than the control units. In particular, the thinned forest units have significantly greater snow cover than the control units. Our results indicate that forest restoration treatments result in increased snow pack accumulation and this increase can be efficiently estimated at a landscape scale using satellite data.",

            "abstract": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP (S-NPP) has been providing daily global observations of the Earth surface since early 2012. With the decade-long observations made by MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua, one of the goals of the S-NPP mission is to provide continuity in producing land products that have been generated using heritage MODIS observations. The Land Data Operational Products Evaluation (LDOPE) team uses MODIS-derived products to evaluate land products obtained from VIIRS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) measurements generated through the Land Product Evaluation and Analysis Tool Element (LPEATE). However, due to inherent differences in their observation methods and the corresponding algorithms and post-processing techniques, the products generated from MODIS and VIIRS retain some discrepancies. Amongst all the differences between the two wide-swath radiometers, this study aims at analyzing the impact of differences in the corresponding spatial sampling. In particular, the VIIRS unique sampling scheme can introduce relative biases when comparing products (or observations) obtained from the two sensors. We use Landsat-8’s Operational Land Imager (Level-1T data) scenes acquired within a set of 10 x 10 degree, i.e., “Golden tiles” (used for evaluation purposes by LDOPE) to examine how the discrepancies in the spatial responses manifest in measured radiances on a daily basis (for 16 days). The (band-detector averaged) prelaunch Line Spread Functions (LSFs) were used to represent spatial responses for each sensor. Although the impact of differences in sensors’ spatial responses depends heavily on the spatial heterogeneity of a region-of-interest, the initial results, on average, indicate up to 0.8% and 5% difference (at the swath level) in the TOA radiances and TOA-based NDVI, respectively. The disparity (calculated for three sample scenes collected over the Golden sites) differs for different days (orbital configurations) and for different MODIS sampling sizes (500 m versus 1000 m). In other words, the plots of difference-in-scan-angle versus spatial-response show different trends for the MODIS land and ocean channels. For this ongoing study, the impact of gridding and differences in the spectral response functions will also be investigated.",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) contamination of stream salamanders in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States has received little attention. Here we report total Hg (HgT) and methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations in larval giant salamanders (Dicamptodon spp.) and surface water from forested and chaparral lotic ecosystems distributed along a latitudinal gradient throughout Northern California and Washington. To test hypotheses related to potential effects from mining land-use activities, salamander larvae were also sampled from a reference site at Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, California, and at a nearby, upstream site (Shasta county) on Bureau of Land Management land where Hg contamination from gold mining activities has been documented. HgT concentrations in whole body larvae ranged from 4.6 to 74.5 ng/g wet wt. and percent MeHg ranged from 67% to 86%. Both HgT and MeHg larval tissue concentrations were significantly higher at the mining site in comparison to measured background levels (P < 0.001). We conclude that salamander larvae in remote stream ecosystems, where Hg sources were dominated by atmospheric deposition, were generally low in HgT and MeHg and, in comparison, watersheds with a legacy of land-use practices (i.e., mining operations) had approximately 4.5 - 5.5 times the level of HgT bioaccumulation. Moreover, trophic magnification slopes were highest in the Shasta county region where mining was present. These findings suggest that mining activities increase HgT and MeHg exposure to salamander larvae in the region and may present a threat to other higher trophically positioned organisms, and their associated food webs.",

            "abstract": "Small systems regularly struggle to produce treated drinking water compliant with the health standards established by the USEPA thus prompting an obvious need for appropriate innovative treatment solutions. Of these potential solutions, point-of-use treatment devices designed to effectively reduce chemical contaminants in residences using inexpensive, replaceable sorbent materials may be best suited.\nOur current USEPA-funded project focuses on the production, performance and introduced application of a locally produced Alaskan biochar intended for use as an alternative sorbent media in point-of-use filtration technology. Conducted through the University of Alaska Anchorage, this research effort attempts to develop our value-added biochar product into a sustainable, single-media sorbent capable of removing multiple contaminants from groundwater sources. In this study, the sorptive efficiencies of White Spruce biochar for regulated organic (TOC) and inorganic (As, Cl2, F-) contaminants are experimentally evaluated using dynamic, small scale column testing.\nTo achieve optimal understanding of White Spruce biochar sorption and identify the most effective type of sorbent material, a wide array of production technologies and processing conditions were conducted. Lower conversion temperatures (450-550 oC) were achieved in the laboratory in the absence of oxygen using a manufactured pyrolysis unit while higher temperature ranges (800-1000oC) were achieved in field environments using a custom-built, low oxygen gasification system. Differences in production technologies and corresponding temperature ranges may impact biochar compositions and subsequent surface areas and possibly influence each material’s ability to effectively sorb targeted contaminants.\nSmall scale column testing was chosen for this project due to its convenience as a bench-scale technology and scalability to point-of-use devices. The results of this project will reveal the practicality of using this low-cost, sustainable sorbent in small-scale, point-of-use applications and ultimately establish any evidence for this product’s undiscovered placement in innovative treatment solutions. This poster will present our biochar production and characterization methodology and treatment efficacy results.",

            "abstract": "The framework for treating luminescence signals within quartz as leaky and saturating thermochronometers has been put on a sound theoretical footing but requires further empirical exploration of kinetic mechanisms. Expanding treatment of K-feldspar as a low-temperature OSL thermochronometer is desirable as it exhibits higher luminescence sensitivity and often saturates at higher radiation doses than does quartz. This study considers thermal charge eviction dynamics for the IRSL sensitive trap within K-feldspar for different cooling rates and various present-day temperatures. Arrhenius parameters are calculated, and a simple kinetic model is used to predict the thermal evolution of the main IRSL trap in typical geologic settings. Effective closure temperature is found to be lower than 50 ºC for samples cooling at 10 ºC/Ma. Such low temperatures make K-feldspar luminescence thermochronology a promising complement to apatite (U-Th)/He techniques, which exhibit closure temperatures of about 60-80 ºC for the same cooling rate. We examine the various luminescence signals from K-feldspar within recently-exhumed bedrock samples from an uplifted block within the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California, USA. These signals suggest a recent decrease in topographic relief for the Yucaipa Ridge Block.",

            "abstract": "At small grain sizes (<10 µm), olivine is expected to deform by diffusion creep at lithospheric conditions. Microstructural analysis by electron backscatter diffraction of 13 peridotite mylonites from St. Paul’s Rocks (SPR) indicates that olivine has a pronounced axial-[010] lattice preferred orientation (i.e. [010] clusters perpendicular to foliation, while [100] and [001] are dispersed in the foliation plane) and a mean grain size of ~7µm. Holtzman et al. (2003) has observed similar LPOs in partially molten samples experimentally deformed under simple shear at lithospheric conditions. The occurrence of a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) is typically interpreted as indicating deformation by dislocation creep. In addition, compositional maps of the samples show that amphibole (pargasite) is ubiquitous. As the presence of pargasite in peridotites is controlled in part by the activity of plagioclase and water at high temperatures (Lynkins and Jenkins, 1992), we infer this as evidence for the presence of pre- to syn-tectonic trapped melt.\nIn order to explain the observed LPO in SPR mylonites, we evaluate the hypothesis that alignment occurred during diffusion creep, such as observed in experiments by Sundberg and Cooper (2008) and Miyazaki et al., (2013). To explore this hypothesis, we conducted analyses of low angle (2-10°) rotation axis inverse pole figures (IPFs), which can often provide insight into the operative slip system(s). Analyses of low angle IPFs from SPR, however, showed no definitive correlation to any one particular slip system. On the other hand, high angle IPFs showed intense clustering of rotational axes at 75-90° about [010], indicating that [100] and [001] align nearly perpendicular to [010]. Based on the IPF analysis and evidence of pre- to syn-tectonic melt, we conclude that the presence of melt lubricated grain boundaries, which resulted in rigid rotation of grains and alignment of the [010] axes controlled by the orthorhombic crystal habit of olivine. That is, as [010] is shortest in terms of habit, this allows [010] to align perpendicular to the shear plane, while the [100] and [001] axes are dispersed in the plane parallel to shear. Thus, SPR mylonites represent a natural example of olivine LPO formation during diffusion creep.",

            "abstract": "The oceans play an important part in regulating the carbon cycle and climate system, acting as a buffer between the carbon in the atmosphere and the deep earth. Of all dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the ocean, only carbonate can exist in a solid state (mostly as calcite). As such, the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) acts as control on this buffer, governing the distribution of sedimentary carbonate\nThe CCD today is around 4.5 km depth, though previous work that looked at the composition of sediments on the ocean floor has suggested that CCD was different in the past (e.g. Pälike et al., 2012; Sclater et al., 1977). These studies mostly show the CCD decreasing to shallower depths through the Cenozoic and the Mesozoic. The deepening of the CCD through time is consistent with the decrease in atmospheric CO2 over time shown in the GEOCARB models (Berner, 1987; Berner and Kothavala, 2001; Berner, 2006); more carbon is being stored in the ocean as sediment.\nWe look at the evolution of the CCD since 100 Ma and how this has affected the distribution of sedimentary carbonate on the ocean floor. We combine recent advancements in determining palaeobathymetry into the Mesozoic from reconstructed ages of the ocean floor (Müller et al., 2008) in conjunction with a geochemical model by Boudreau et al. (2010) for the average CCD today, applying it from 0 to 100 Ma. Assuming values for ocean ion concentrations, productivity rates, and solubility constants we make a first order model. The model is sensitive to changes in the dissolved concentration of carbonate.\nIn the reconstruction where the surface saturation state of calcite was decreased going back to 100 Ma, the CCD gradually deepens with time, consistent with other independent studies. The CCD reconstructions were then used to map the theoretical extent of global sedimentary carbonate and determine proximity to subduction zones. The maps suggest that the amount of sedimentary carbon being subducted has increased with time, despite an overall decrease in volcanic activity since the Mesozoic.",

It is a P-band sensor that employs a non-conventional and innovative design. The EcoSAR system was designed as a multi-disciplinary instrument to image the 3-dimensional surface of the earth from a single pass platform with two antennas. EcoSAR’s principal mission is to penetrate the forest canopy to return vital information about the canopy structure and estimate biomass. With a maximum bandwidth of 200 MHz in H and 120 MHz in V polarizations it can provide sub-meter resolution imagery of the study area. EcoSAR’s dual antenna, 32 transmit and receive channel architecture provides a test-bed for developing new algorithms in InSAR data processing such as single pass interferometry, full polarimetry, post-processing synthesis of multiple beams, simultaneous measurement over both sides of the flight track, selectable resolution and variable incidence angle. The flexible architecture of EcoSAR will create new opportunities in radar remote sensing of forest biomass, permafrost active layer thickness, and topography mapping.\nEcoSAR’s first test flight occurred between March 27th and April 1st, 2014 over the Andros Island in Bahamas and Corcovado and La Selva National Parks in Costa Rica. The 32 channel radar system collected about 6 TB of radar data in about 12 hours of data collection. Due to the existence of radio and TV communications in the operational frequency band, acquired data contains strong radar frequency interference, which had to be removed prior to beamforming and focusing. Precise locations of the antennas are tracked using high-rate GPS and inertial navigation units, which provide necessary information for accurate processing of the imagery. In this presentation we will present preliminary imagery collected during the test campaign, show examples of simultaneous dual track imaging, as well as a single pass interferogram. The interferometric product will be compared against existing DEMs for quality assessment.",

We obtained SHRIMP-RG 206Pb/238U ages of zircons from 7 intrusions in Georgia, USA, and are conducting a detailed study of the Danburg pluton (NE GA) to better understand the mechanisms leading to granite formation in the SAO. Magmatic 206Pb/238U zircon ages indicate a bimodal distribution of ages from ~342-321 in the Inner Piedmont and ~306-300 Ma in accreted Gondwanan terranes to the east, which is consistent with a growing database of U-Pb zircon ages. Ages of zircon xenocrysts, zircon δ18O values, and rare mafic enclaves support interpretations that these plutons derived from anatexis of older continental crust, with minor contributions from less-evolved sources. The Danburg Pluton and spatially-associated Sandy Hill ‘border facies’ intrude the Carolina terrane, and contain mafic enclaves that may represent a mantle contribution. The coarsely porphyritic, undeformed Danburg pluton is an I-type, magnesian, alkalic-calcic, metaluminous granodiorite to quartz syenite with ~63-73 wt. % SiO2. The equigranular, undeformed Sandy Hill pluton is an I-type, magnesian to ferroan, alkalic-calcic, peraluminous granite with ~72-75 wt. % SiO2. Whole rock samples from both intrusions show linearly-correlated major element trends, consistent with the two being related through crystal fractionation. The Danburg and Sandy Hill plutons yield indistinguishable 206Pb/238U zircon ages at the 2σ level (305.8±4.2 Ma and 301.1±3.6 Ma, respectively) with few xenocrysts. Premagmatic zircons with ages up to 335±6 Ma are inferred on the basis of age and zircon trace element chemistry. 206Pb/238U ages of titanite from three enclaves in the Danburg yield ages of 302.6±3.7 Ma, 311.7±6.1 Ma, and 312±11 Ma. Thus, all overlap the Danburg age (zircon) within 2σ uncertainty. Crystallization T’s calculated with Ti-in-zircon and Zr-in-titanite (at P = 0.3 GPa) thermometry are 717±69°C and 738±38°C (average±2 st.dev.). The age, temperatures, and textural evidence are interpreted to reflect quenching of mafic melt (enclaves) upon mixing with the coexisting felsic melt.",

It seems that cycle 24 amplitude\nforecast may not be validated. One of the reasons is the assumption\nof a single cell meridional circulation. Recent observations and\ntheoretical models of meridional circulation do not indicate a single-celled\nflow pattern. So it is nessecary to examine the role of complex\nmulti-cellular circulation patterns in a Babcock-Leighton solar\ndynamo model in the advection and diffusion dominated regimes.\nBy simulating a Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo model with multi-cellular\nflow, we show that the presence of a weak, second, high-latitude\nreverse cell speeds up the cycle and slighty enhances the poleward branch\nin the butterfly diagram, whereas the presence of a second cell\nin depth reverses the tilt of the butterfly wing and leads to an\nanti-solar type feature. If, instead, the butterfly diagram is\nconstructed from the middle of the convection zone in that case,\na solar-like pattern can be retrieved. All the above cases behave\nqualitatively similar in advection and diffusion-dominated regimes.\nHowever, our dynamo with a meridional circulation containing four\ncells in latitude behaves distinctly different in the two regimes,\nproducing a solar-like butterfly diagram with fast cycles in\ndiffusion-dominated regime, and a complex branches in the butterfly\ndiagram in the advection-dominated regime. Another interesting\nfinding from our studies is that a four-celled flow pattern\ncontaining two in radius and two in latitude always produces\nquadrupolar parity as the relaxed solution.",

The characteristics of the seasonal cycle and the year-to-year changes of the river runoff are described. Various versions of the satellite salinity data are compared. The relative roles of river discharge, surface water flux, and horizontal advection in changing surface salinity in regions near the river mouths are examined. Satellite measurements of SSS clearly track movements of the fresh water from river discharges. Besides the river discharge, E-P plays an important role in the seasonal salinity variation near the Ganges and Irrawaddy River mouths. For the Mississippi and Amazon river mouths, central and eastern ITCZ, E-P contributes very little to the salinity seasonal change. In the central and eastern ITCZ, contribution of advection to the salinity tendency is clearly identified. Both salinity and salinity tendency are dominated by semi-annual cycle in the Atlantic ITCZ between 5ºN to 9ºN, whereas annual cycle dominates at other latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Denitrification is a key biogeochemical process that affects nitrogen (N) availability, N losses to aquatic systems, and atmospheric chemistry. In upland forests, denitrification has not been thought to be a major N pathway because it is an anaerobic microbial process that requires nitrate, labile carbon (C), and low oxygen (O2) conditions, which do not occur broadly or consistently throughout forest soils. However, there may be enough spatial and temporal heterogeneity at fine scales to support denitrification rates that are relevant at the landscape scale. To quantify the importance of spatial and temporal variability in soil denitrification in northern hardwood forests at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF; New Hampshire, USA), we developed two related projects: 1) we sought to identify hot spots of biogeochemical activity, including soil denitrification potential, based on hydropedologic settings and flowpaths in a catchment during the growing season; and 2) we investigated the influence of simulated rainfall events on soil O2 and nitrous oxide concentrations, denitrification rates, and soil respiration during different seasons at HBEF.\nIn the first study, we expected to find that sites dominated by soils with thick Bh horizons (zones of C accumulation) would have the highest denitrification rates. However, despite the variation among soil profiles found in different hydropedologic settings, we did not find significant differences in denitrification potential. Rather, when areal coverage and horizon thickness for the contrasting hydropedologic settings were accounted for, catchment-scale estimates of denitrification potential were about 1/3 higher than conventionally calculated estimates. In the second study, soil O2 in surface horizons only decreased following additions of labile C. Responses of soil respiration and denitrification to simulated rainfall were also influenced by season. While these studies highlight the complex heterogeneity in forest soils, they also contribute to our understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of denitrification, help us identify the meaningful temporal and spatial scales for observing variability in denitrification and its controls, and improve our ability to extrapolate measurements of denitrification to broader scales.",

However, its contributions to the total stratospheric water budget are not well constrained. The isotopic composition of water vapor is a useful tracer for the convective and microphysical history of air parcels. In-situ, isotopic measurements of air in the UT/LS during the monsoon could be used to constrain its contribution to stratospheric water, to provide a check on satellite measurements, and to help distinguish between in-situ and convective tropical cirrus, which are important to Earth’s radiation budget. We show how isotopologue measurements can act as a tracer for convective detrainment of water vapor, and discuss the design of a cavity-enhanced water isotopologue spectrometer that will fly aboard the M55 Geophysica as part of the 2016 Asian Summer Monsoon StratoClim campaign. The spectrometer will sample air in the 14-21 km range, and must make 2 Hz measurements of precision 20 per mil in δD to distinguish air parcels of different origin. These measurements will be analyzed in concert with those taken by other StratoClim instruments to better understand the origins of moisture in the UT/LS and the formation of tropical cold cirrus.",

By coherently combining SAR images acquired from different baseline location, MB SAR Tomography can achieve unprecedentedly full 3-D imaging of volumetric and layover scatters for each SAR cell.Its capability of 3-D reflectivity reconstruction and multiple scatters separation is enormously helpful for different scientific applications in forestry, agriculture , glaciology etc.\nHowever, in order to apply on repeat-pass space borne interferometric dataset, the Fourier Based MB SAR Tomography is generally affected by unsatisfactory imaging quality due to low number of baseline with unequal distribution, atmospheric phase disturbance and temporal decorrelation. In this paper, we propose different signal processing techniques for overcoming these limitations in oder for a better image quality. 1) we develop a robust interpolator to translate the nonuniform greed to uniform one, largely improved the image quality 2) we apply Robust Capon Spectrum Estimation method to improve the resolution and interference of uncertainty in steering matrix. 3) for atmosphere disturbance and radiometric , we select certain flat and known area from image as a estimation for atmospheric offset.\nWe first test our result in simulated SAR data. Comparing with Fourier based method, the result shows better sidelobe suppression and robustness to unknown multiplicative phase noise. Finally, we test the algorithm using real ALOS PALSAR L-band data, acquired between August 2009 to February 2011 near Harvard Forest Area, MA, USA.",

            "abstract": "Identifying ancient microbial biosignatures in the geologic record requires an assemblage of evidence, and almost never results from a single “smoking gun”. When a potential biosignature such as a microfossil, organic deposit or stromatolite is found, sources of evidence for testing the biogenic hypothesis include the inherent properties of the feature itself, the assemblage characteristics of multiple candidate features, the geologic context of the features, and the relationship between changes in the features and changes in the geologic context. Given these diverse sources of evidence, multiple analytical techniques necessarily come into play. Some of the most powerful techniques emerging for ancient biosignature investigations are those that detailed, spatially correlated observations of fine texture, microstructure and composition (mineralogy, chemistry, organics etc). MicroX-ray fluorescence is a significant new method for in situ compositional analysis at sub-millimeter scales. Micro-XRF scans a focused X-ray beam across the surface of a rock to create a map of elemental composition at mm-cm scales, comprising individual spot measurements of 100 microns diameter. A micro-XRF instrument, PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry) was selected for flight aboard the Mars 2020 rover. We have used PIXL to analyze to diverse geological samples including ancient stromatolites, reduction spots, ooids, altered basalts, concretions and shales, and found that PIXL element maps are not only a highly effective way to quickly ascertain the compositional variability of the sample, but also that unexpected features typically emerge that can be critical for interpreting sedimentary, diagenetic and biological processes. For example, in two different stromatolite cases, elemental distribution revealed sedimentary and diagenetic textures that constrained the processes of stromatolite formation and implied biological influence. These textures were invisible in reflected light and too large to be observed at microscope scales. Fine scale elemental analysis by PIXL will be an effective way of searching for, and characterizing, potential ancient biosignatures on Mars.",

            "abstract": "On sandy coastlines, foredunes provide protection from coastal storms, potentially sheltering low areas—including human habitat—from storm-induced elevated water level and wave erosion. The relationship between total water level and foredune height largely determines the response of sandy coastlines to storms and thus the shape and alongshore continuity of foredunes is critical in assessing coastal vulnerability. Previous work has shown that coastal dunes grow as a result of feedbacks between vegetative and sediment transport processes, and that resultant foredune morphology is species-specific. Two dune-building grasses dominate the foredunes of the U.S. East Coast; south of VA dunes are primarily vegetated by Uniola paniculata while north from VA Ammophila breviligulata is dominant. Qualitative observations suggest that dunes dominated by U. paniculata are hummocky whereas dunes dominated by A. breviligulata are long crested and contiguous. Recent observations suggest that the range of these dune-building grasses is changing (i.e., U. paniculata is advancing northward). Such a shift in the geographic range of species may lead to changes in foredune shape and thus changes in coastline vulnerability.\nUsing observations and numerical experiments, we explore the current and potential future role of dune grasses in determining coastal response to storms. Species-specific foredune morphology is likely a result of differences in species growth form: A. breviligulata and U. paniculata exhibit differences in their rate of lateral growth. Slower lateral growth of U. paniculata provides a potential explanation for the irregular dune crest height in the alongshore direction. We test this qualitative observation by quantitatively examining coastal foredunes morphology along several barrier islands of the U.S. East Coast dominated by A. breviligulata or U. paniculata. In addition, we expand and modify an existing numerical model of coastal dune formation (Durán and Moore, 2013) to include species-specific parameterizations for A. breviligulata and U. paniculata and compare model results to observational data. Using this new model we conduct a suite of numerical experiments to explore the change in dune morphology that may result from future changes in foredune species dominance.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the hydrological processes in soils subject to significant freeze-thaw is fraught by “experimental vagaries and theoretical imponderables” (Miller 1980, Applications of soil physics). The infiltration of snowmelt water and the subsequent transmission of unfrozen water during thawing, is governed by hydraulic conductivity values which are changing with both ice and unfrozen water content. Water held within pores is subject to capillary forces, which results in a freezing point depression (i.e. water remains in the liquid state slightly below 0°C). As the temperature drops below zero, water freezes first in the larger pores, and then in progressively smaller pores. Since the larger pores also are the first to empty by drainage, these pores may be air filled during freezing, while smaller water filled pores freeze. This explains why an unsaturated, frozen soil may still have a considerable infiltration capacity. Infiltration into frozen soil is a critical phenomena related to the risk of flooding in the Canadian prairies, controlling the partitioning of snowmelt into either infiltration or runoff. We propose a new model, based on conceptualizing the pore space as a bundle of capillary tubes (with significant differences to the capillary bundle model of Wannatabe and Flury, 2008, WRR, doi:10.1029/2008WR007102) which allows any air-filled macropores to contribute to the potential infiltration capacity of the soil. The patterns of infiltration and water movement during freeze-thaw from the model are compared to field observations from the Canadian prairies and Boreal Plains.",

            "abstract": "Accurately modeling atmospheric CO2 removal by terrestrial ecosystems requires an understanding of how atmospheric conditions change the rate of photosynthesis across major vegetation types. Diffuse light, which is created from interactions between incident solar radiation and atmospheric aerosols and clouds, has been postulated to increase carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems. To determine how cloud conditions affect carbon uptake through its influence on diffuse light, we quantify the relationship between cloud optical thickness, which indicates surface light attenuation by clouds, and surface diffuse light. We then examine the relationship between cloud optical thickness and gross primary productivity (GPP) to determine whether cloud properties could modulate GPP in temperate ecosystems. Surface diffuse light and GPP data are obtained from publically available Ameriflux data (Mead Crop sites, University of Michigan Biological Station, Morgan Monroe, and Howland Forest) and cloud optical thickness data over the Ameriflux sites are retrieved from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiometer. We compare the response of GPP to cloud optical thickness between croplands and forests, as well as within ecosystem types to determine ecosystem-specific responses and the role of plant community composition on ecosystem-level GPP under varying cloud conditions. By linking atmospheric cloud properties to surface light conditions and ecosystem carbon fluxes, we refine understanding of land-atmosphere carbon cycling and how changes in atmospheric cloud conditions may influence the future of the land carbon sink.",

            "abstract": "Precise argon ages of Pleistocene eruptive products from Cascades and Alaska–Aleutian arc volcanoes cluster in time following major deglaciations. Compilation of edifice-volume-weighted dates for over 700 lavas from 16 volcanoes are compared to marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS 2–8) of Bassinot et al. (1994, EPSL, v. 126, p. 91-108) and interpreted temperatures from the Vostok ice core (Petit et al., 1999, Nature, v. 399, p. 429-436). To assess relative time-volume relationships we weight the distribution of ages measured at each volcano by its total edifice volume. The abundance of ages scales with the number of mapped eruptive units, and may differ substantially from the true eruptive output. The distribution is also weighted inversely by the number of dates to account for centers with more or fewer dates. Stacked probability density functions yield significant peaks after MIS 6 and MIS 8. Veniaminof, Emmons Lake, Westdahl, Redoubt (Alaska–Aleutian arc), and Adams and Crater Lake (Cascades arc) have apparent eruptive episodes 135-110 ka (early MIS 5), coinciding with rapid warming of the oceans following the MIS 6 glacial. Veniaminof began growing at 250 ka (end MIS 8) and erupted more than 200 km3 of lava in MIS 7. Emmons Lake, Adams, Rainier, and Glacier Peak also have apparent growth peaks (abundant dated units) following MIS 8. Apparent correlation of eruptive episodes with deglaciations may result from depressurization of magmatic systems due to ice retreat resulting in enhanced decompression melting and/or diminished compressive stress on crustal magma reservoirs, poor preservation of lava sequences during glacial maxima, or coincidence. Next steps in this study include (1) more rigorous assessment of eruptive volumes of dated map units, (2) refining ice volume estimates during MIS 2, 6, and 8 at various centers by dating ice marginal lava flows and tuyas and by mapping moraines at selected volcanoes, (3) re-analyzing sequences previously dated by K/Ar to improve precision, and (4) extending the compilation to deglaciation following MIS 2.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies in land use sustainability have shown the conservation value of even small forest fragments in tropical smallholder agricultural regions. Forest patches provide important ecosystem services, wildlife habitat, and support human livelihoods. Our study incorporates multiple dates of high-resolution Quickbird imagery to map forest disturbance and regrowth in a smallholder agricultural landscape in western Uganda. This work is in support of a payments for ecosystem services (PES) project which uses a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of PES for enhancing forest conservation. The research presented here details the remote sensing phase of this project. We developed an object-based methodology for detecting forest change from high-resolution imagery that calculates per class image reflectance and change statistics to determine persistent forest, non-forest, forest gain, and forest loss classes. The large study area (~ 2,400 km2) necessitated using a combination of 10 different image pairs of varying seasonality, sun angle, and viewing angle. We discuss the impact of these factors on mapping results. Reflectance data was used in conjunction with texture measures and knowledge-driven modeling to derive forest change maps. First, baseline Quickbird images were mapped into tree cover and non-tree categories based on segmented image objects and field inventory data, applied through a classification and regression tree (CART) classifier. Then a bi-temporal segmentation layer was generated and a series of object metrics from both image dates were extracted. A sample set of persistent forest objects that remained undisturbed was derived from the tree cover map and the red band (B3) change values. We calculated a variety of statistical indices for these persistent tree cover objects from the post- survey imagery to create maps of both forest cover loss and forest cover gain. These results are compared to visually assessed image objects in addition to a Landsat-time series based global forest change map (Hansen et al. 2013) to evaluate the change detection approach. We present the forest change rates and assess the impact of the PES project at both the village and individual forest plot levels.",

A westward energy flux is carried by long Rossby modes with real zonal wavenumbers, and an infinite sum of modes with complex wavenumbers combine to carry energy flux poleward from the turning latitudes in coastal Kelvin waves. The meridional distribution of period-averaged westward energy flux carried by the real Rossby modes does not match the meridional distribution of eastward energy flux carried by the Kelvin wave, however. Additionally, the coastal Kelvin waves are only defined poleward of the turning latitudes, whereas the incident equatorial Kelvin wave energy flux is tightly trapped to the equator. We examine the interaction of modes required to resolve the apparent contradictions and to transfer energy flux smoothly from the incoming to outgoing waves.",

The Palm Islands Reserve located 5km offshore northern Lebanon in the Eastern Mediterranean, on the hanging wall of a submarine, active thrust fault – the Rankine-Abdeh fault – hold abundant vermetid bio-constructions that are still relatively well preserved. It is an exceptional site for testing and investigating hypothesis on the use of the vermetid benches. We surveyed the surface and shorelines of the Palm Island, the largest of the Islands. The fossil vermetid bio-constructions are present as uplifted benches on its northern side. Also, many of the large boulders mostly found on the south-western shore of the islands still hold vermetid bio-constructions originally from the intertidal position before the boulders were uplifted and thrown over the surface of the island away from the shoreline by powerful waves. Two continuous vertical sections of these bio-constructions, 7 and 13cm thick were sampled for radiocarbon dating. Of the 21 large boulders we surveyed 10 had their vermetid crusts sampled for 14C dating. Their measured radiocarbon ages are spread over many centuries and do not cluster around any single date that could correspond with that of a tsunami or storm event responsible for their transport. On another hand the radiocarbon ages from the uplifted benches show that the last co-seismic rupture of the underlying and offshore Rankine-Abdeh thrust took place after the 9th century AD and resulted in the tectonic uplift of the Palm Islands shoreline, by around 80cm. Interpretation of the morphology and ages of the vermetid bio-constructions found on the overthrown boulders suggest that another such co-seismic event happened towards the end of the 4th millennium BC. Finally two vertical growth rates of the vermetid bio-constructions were estimated for the Palm Island location around 0.049 cm/yr during the 6-9th century AD and 0.033 cm/yr during the late 4th millennium BC.",

NOx loss processes under these conditions are not well understood and have a large impact on ozone formation and the products of VOC oxidation. We use measurements collected during summer 2013 at a rural forest in Alabama as part of the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) to calculate NOx loss rates. In this low-NOx, high-BVOC region, nitric acid formation is a minor loss process during the day and is nearly negligible during the night. Formation of alkyl nitrates, especially isoprene nitrates during the day and monoterpene nitrates during the night, accounts for the large majority(over 80 percent) of NOx loss in this region. This stands out compared to other regions, which have generally either found the alkyl nitrate and nitric acid formation to be roughly equal in importance or nitric acid formation to be the dominant channel for NOx loss. The rapid formation of alkyl nitrates leads to an average afternoon NOx lifetimes of under three hours, and makes the fate of alkyl nitrates crucial for understanding the NOy budget.",

Blueschists from Cedros have been dated using 40Ar/39Ar step-heating of white mica and sodic amphiboles that yield ages from 103 ± 4 Ma to 94.9 ± 1.1 Ma, respectively, that represent cooling during exhumation. Apatite fission-track dating gives ages from 32 ± 4 Ma to 22 ± 3 Ma that record exhumation through the upper crust. Related Mesozoic subduction zone rocks of the Franciscan Complex crop out in a serpentinite-matrix mélange along coastal northern California. The Franciscan rocks are older, yielding 40Ar/39Ar step-heating ages of hornblende from amphibolite ranging from 159 to 156 Ma and represent an older part of the subduction history of the oceanic Farallon plate along western North America. I will determine the prograde and peak metamorphic P-T conditions for these high-grade rocks using petrography, mineral chemistries, and isochemical phase diagram modeling with Perple_X to generate complete P-T paths. I will then supplement these data with Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf geochronology for these high-grade Cedros rocks to evaluate their subduction/exhumation history, and develop a tectonic model for these southernmost Franciscan-type rocks. Ultimately, I will compare my results to Franciscan rocks in northern California to better understand the Mesozoic subduction margin of western North America.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of the present study is to clarify the optical characteristics of lightning and to assess the effectiveness of multi-color imaging and photometric measurements in advancing our understanding of the discharge physics, meteorological aspects, and climatological properties of lightning. The instrument used here is JEM-GLIMS on board the international space station. GLIMS observes lightning and TLEs in the nadir direction with optical and radio sensors: dual-color imagers, six-color photometers, a VLF monopole antenna and a set of VHF interferometer. Since the initial operation in November 2012, GLIMS detected 1035 lightning events by imagers and photometers. The estimated peak irradiance of lightning at a wavelength range of 600-900 nm was in the range of 3.3x10-5–6.1x10-3 W/m2 with a median value of 2.4x10-3 W/m2, which is roughly equivalent to the top 10 % bright lightning events observed by FORTE in the past. The obtained photometric data showed various lightning waveforms. In some cases, one or several distinctive impulsive emissions occur and sometimes continuous emissions follow, which are suggestive of return strokes and continuing current. While in other cases, the waveform data consist of numerous intermittent optical pulses suggesting the occurrence of intra-cloud discharges. Interestingly, spectral data show the red-shift of the color of lightning at the time of possible return stroke, which could also be used as an indicator of ground discharge. Concurrent image data show complicated spatial structures which are variable from event to event in terms of pattern complexity, horizontal size, and optical intensity. These results suggest that GLIMS efficiently obtains spatiotemporal and spectral properties of lightning. In the paper, we will thoroughly examine the data obtained by the GLIMS dual-color imager and spectrophotometer.",

            "abstract": "The current study focuses on studying how iron (Fe) solubility is affected by particle size, relative humidity, and exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO2). Fe, the most abundant transition metal in atmospheric particulate matter, plays a critical role in the atmospheric sulfur cycle and is a micronutrient for phytoplankton in remote regions of the ocean. To mimic oceanic particles, iron-containing minerals (hematite, magnetite, goethite, and illite) were resuspended with sodium chloride and size-segregated on Teflon filters into five different size fractions: 10-2.5 µm, 2.5-1.0 µm, 1.0-0.5 µm, 0.5-0.25 µm, and <0.25 µm. Mineral phases were then exposed to 5 ppm SO2 in air at marine environment humidity (>80%) and arid environment humidity (24%). Trials with no SO2 ­were also performed as comparisons. Total Fe was determined by using microwave-assisted acid digestion and soluble Fe was determined by extracting the samples in a simulated cloud water buffer (pH 4.25, 0.5 mM acetate, 0.5 mM formate, and 0.2 mM ammonium nitrate). Both total and soluble Fe concentrations were determined via inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We found that, as particle size decreased, Fe percent solubility increased for hematite, magnetite, and goethite. The percent solubility of Fe in these mineral phases steadily increased from 0.5-10% as particle size decreased. In contrast, the Fe percent solubility in illite was relatively constant for the largest four size fractions but increased dramatically in the smallest size fraction. The percent solubility of Fe in illite ranged from 5-20% as the particle size decreased. Additionally, increased Fe solubility was linked to increased relative humidity with higher percent solubility generally observed in all mineral phases for the samples exposed at the higher humidity. No correlation was observed for the effects of the SO2 on Fe percent solubility. The likely lack of Fe-SO2 interactions were also supported by synchrotron-based x-ray spectroscopy. These results help further the knowledge of how the solubilization of particulate Fe is affected by atmospheric transport.",

            "abstract": "The global warming is one of the hottest topics for both scientists and the public at present. Strong evidences have shown that the global warming is related to the man-made increasing greenhouse gas levels. Besides the artificial factors, natural forces also contribute to the Earth's climate change. Among them, solar activity is an important ingredient of the natural driving forces of the Earth's climate. In this study, two data sets are adopted to investigate the periodicities of both solar activity and the variation of the Earth temperature as well as their correlations based on the wavelet analysis and cross correlation method. The first one is a directly measured data set covering centuries, while the second one is the reconstructed data during the past 11,000 years. The obtained results demonstrate that solar activity and the Earth’s temperature have significant resonance cycles, and the Earth’s temperature has periodic variations similar to those of solar activity. For centuries, these common periodicities include the 22-year cycle and the 50-year cycle. While for 11,000 years, they are the 200-year, 500-year, 1000-year, and 2000-year cycles. Correlation analysis reveals that the correlations between solar variability and the Earth's temperature are statistically significant. The correlation coefficient (C.C.) between the 11-year running averaged Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and the ocean temperature is 0.88 during the past 133 years of global warming. While for 11,000 years, the C.C. between the 500-year running averages of sunspot number (SSN) and the Earth temperature (r=0.51, p=1%) is stronger than that between the temperature and the atmospheric CO2 concentration (r=0.35, p=10%). All these support that solar activity should have non-ignorable effects on the Earth’s climate change, especially before the modern industrial time.",

            "abstract": "Indium is integral to modern electronic devices, and is an essential component in indium-tin oxide (ITO), an electrically conductive, and optically transparent material that forms the basis for touch screens and high-end LCDs. World-wide production of indium has increased almost seven-fold from 1990 to 2012. Continued increases in production can be aided by better models for the formation of indium-bearing ores, yet little is known about the behavior of indium in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. As a first step toward solving this problem, we performed experiments to evaluate the partitioning of indium between pyrrhotite (po) and silicate melt (m). Experiments were performed at 800 °C, 100 MPa, and fO2 ≈ NNO in a po-saturated, vapor-brine-rhyolite melt system for durations of 5 to15 days. Three separate series of experiments were conducted in which each series differed by the aqueous solution added. The first series of experiments were prepared with pure water, the second series of experiments with a 1.01 M chloride solution and the third series with a 0.35 M CuCl2-bearing starting aqueous solution. These changes in starting material produced changes in the composition of the run product po and glass. The partition coefficient D(po/m) for the pure-water series experiments is on the order of ≈ 10. The addition of chloride-bearing aqueous solution leads to a decrease in the partition coefficient to ≈ 1.5. The copper-bearing experiments yield a D ≈ 3. The lower values for D in the chloride-bearing experiments may be explained by indium-chloride interactions in the melt phase. Although the D does vary depending upon the composition of the starting aqueous solution, an order of magnitude estimate for D, for general modeling purposes, can be made by assuming a value of 4. By using reasonable estimates of the mass fraction of po that crystallizes in crustal magmatic systems, the proportion of indium sequestered by po, during fractional crystallization, can be evaluated. The results indicate that po sequesters less than 0.5% indium from a crystallizing silicate melt because of the small magnitude of the D, and low modal abundances of po. Experimental and modeling results indicate that crystallization of po alone cannot limit the capacity of a magmatic-hydrothermal system to yield an indium-rich ore fluid.",

            "abstract": "Seismic data, rock deformation experiments, and geochemical studies indicate variability in the thickness, buoyancy, and strength of the lithosphere at plate boundaries. However, geodynamic models of subduction commonly either omit an overriding plate or do not investigate role of the variation in overriding plate properties on the subduction evolution. We present time-dependent numerical models of subduction that vary the overriding plate thickness, strength, and density and allow for a plate interface that evolves with time via an anisotropic brittle failure rheology. We examine the emergence of (a) asymmetric versus symmetric subduction, (b) trench retreat versus advance, (c) subduction zone geometry, (d) slab stagnation versus penetration into the lower mantle, and (e) flat slab subduction. The majority of the models result in sustained asymmetric subduction. The models demonstrate that trench retreat is correlated with a thin overriding plate, whereas, trench advance is correlated with a thick and/or strong overriding plate. Slab dip, measured at a depth below the plate boundary interface, has a negative correlation with an increase in overriding plate thickness. Overriding plate thickness exerts a first order control over slab penetration into the lower mantle, with penetration most commonly occurring in models with a thick overriding plate. Periods of flat slab subduction occur with thick, strong overriding plates producing strong plate boundary interface coupling. The results provide insight into how the overriding plate plays a role in establishing advancing and retreating subduction, as well as providing an explanation for the variation of slab geometry observed in subduction zones on Earth.",

The leading mode of CLC variability represents coherent variation, accounting for nearly 40% of the total CLC variance spanning 1950–2012. This leading mode and the majority of individual airports exhibit decreased low cloudiness from the earlier to the later part of the record. Exploring climatic controls on CLC, we identify North Pacific Sea Surface Temperature anomalies, largely in the form of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) as well correlated with, and evidently helping to organize, the coherent patterns of summer coastal cloud variability. Links from the PDO to summer CLC appear a few months in advance of the summer. These associations hold up consistently in interannual and interdecadal frequencies.",

The USGS-USAID Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) was initiated in 1986 after disastrous lahars during the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz dramatizedthe need to advance international capabilities in volcanic monitoring, eruption forecasting and hazard communication. For the past 28 years, VDAP has worked with our partners to improve observatories, strengthen monitoring networks, and train observatory personnel.\nWe highlight a few of the many accomplishments by Latin American volcano observatories. Advances in monitoring, assessment and communication, and lessons learned from the lahars of the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz eruption and the 1994 Paez earthquake enabled the Servicio Geológico Colombiano to issue timely, life-saving warnings for 3 large syn-eruptive lahars at Nevado del Huila in 2007 and 2008. In Chile, the 2008 eruption of Chaitén prompted SERNAGEOMIN to complete a national volcanic vulnerability assessment that led to a major increase in volcano monitoring. Throughout Latin America improved seismic networks now telemeter data to observatories where the decades-long background rates and types of seismicity have been characterized at over 50 volcanoes. Standardization of the Earthworm data acquisition system has enabled data sharing across international boundaries, of paramount importance during both regional tectonic earthquakes and during volcanic crises when vulnerabilities cross international borders. Sharing of seismic forecasting methods led to the formation of the international organization of Latin American Volcano Seismologists (LAVAS). LAVAS courses and other VDAP training sessions have led to international sharing of methods to forecast eruptions through recognition of precursors and to reduce vulnerabilities from all volcano hazards (flows, falls, surges, gas) through hazard assessment, mapping and modeling. Satellite remote sensing data-sharing facilitatescross-border identification and warnings of ash plumes for aviation.\nOverall, long-term strategies of data collection and experience-sharing have helped Latin American observatories improve their monitoring and create informed communities cognizant of vulnerabilities inherent in living near volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Recent investigations of the Laguna del Maule (LdM) volcanic field, central Chile, suggest the presence of a large, shallow, and active rhyolitic magma reservoir. Modest (up to ~1.2 km3) rhyolitic eruptions over the last 20 kyr encircle an area inflating at an average rate of 25 cm/yr since 2007. 40Ar/39Ar, 14C, and tephra stratigraphy indicate that the majority of rhyolitic volcanism was concentrated in two phases (phase 1 and 2) separated by 9 kyr of repose. Here we report new petrological and geochemical results in order to determine if LdM rhyolites were issued from the same reservoir, identify the nature and timescales of processes leading to their eruption, and begin to relate the spectacular signs of unrest to magmatic processes.\nAll LdM rhyolites are crystal-poor and contain phenocrysts of plagioclase, biotite and rare quartz. Major and trace element contents indicate most plagioclase crystallized in equilibrium with the erupted rhyolitic magma. Incompatible trace element contents (e.g. Ce) delineate distinct crystal populations erupted during phases 1 and 2. Thus, the two magma reservoirs experienced limited physical interaction. A subset of crystal domains from both eruptive phases record melts inconsistent with the whole rock and glass, crystallization-dominated differentiation trend. Plagioclase erupted in the Early Espejos Tephra (phase 1), the largest recent explosive eruption, display the highest An and Mg contents and depletion of Ba and Sr. In contrast, early phase 2 plagioclase contain zones of Ba enrichment. This Mg and Ba enrichment records contrasting responses to the intrusion of mafic magma. The high Mg zones are consistent with an intermediate magma resulting from rhyolite and basalt mixing whereas the Ba enrichment results from melting of Ba-rich phases such as biotite and K-feldspar.\nModeling of Mg, Sr, and Ba diffusion indicates that mixing between these Mg and Ba rich melts and the erupted magma body occurred within a year of eruption. The duration of unrest at LdM has already exceeded the diffusion timescales and thus likely reflects more protracted processes of magma migration and volatile exsolution, potentially associated with the arrival of new magma to the system. However, it probably does not reflect the final stages of mixing prior to eruption recorded by plagioclase crystals.",

Before the fire, sediment sorting within the heterogeneous bed material present in Big Sycamore Creek was controlled by organized step-pool bedforms. Boulders formed steps with relatively finer cobbles, gravel, and sand filling the pools. Before the fire, the grain size distribution present in the substrate between boulder steps was relatively coarse (D84 = 250 mm), in contrast to that in the influx of sediment contributed by post-fire dry-ravel processes deposited at channel margins (D84 = 8 mm). Flow shear stress during one small flood in 2014 (post-fire) was adequate to mobilize fine dry ravel- related sediment. Transport capacity was sufficient to mobilize and transport this sediment within a study reach; however, it was not adequate to flush the fine material downstream. Shear stress required to mobilize sediment contributed by dry ravel was substantially less than that required to transport the substrate material present before the wildfire. The small flood deposited fine sediment (D84 = 16 mm) as flow lost capacity. Resulting deposition buried bedforms, changing the step-pool profile to a plane bed. The relatively poorly sorted, coarse, rough bed changed to a well sorted, fine, smooth, bed. These changes have implications for sediment transport dynamics and aquatic ecology. In steep, semi-arid, chaparral fluvial systems, sediment derived from dry-ravel processes influences the spatial distribution of grain sizes and associated channel morphology at basin to bedform spatial scales over various periods. The longevity of such well-sorted sediment depends on climate-driven-storm sequences and the transport capacity of associated flows to mobilize and transport the material and/or reestablish former morphologies.",

            "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) is an urban pollutant generated by internal combustion engines which contributes to the formation of ground level ozone (smog). CO is also an excellent tracer for emissions from mobile combustion sources. In this work we present an optimized spectroscopic sampling scheme that enables enhanced precision CO measurements. The scheme was implemented on the Picarro G2401 Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer which measures CO2, CO, CH4 and H2O at 0.2 Hz. The optimized scheme improved the raw precision of CO measurements by 40% from 5 ppb to 3 ppb. Correlations of measured CO2, CO, CH4 and H2O from an urban tower were partitioned by wind direction and combined with a concentration footprint model for source attribution. The application of a concentration footprint for source attribution has several advantages. The upwind extent of the concentration footprint for a given sensor is much larger than the flux footprint. Measurements of mean concentration at the sensor location can be used to estimate source strength from a concentration footprint, while measurements of the vertical concentration flux are necessary to determine source strength from the flux footprint. Direct measurement of vertical concentration flux requires high frequency temporal sampling and increases the cost and complexity of the measurement system.",

            "abstract": "The Wyoming Province is an Archean craton that played an early role in the construction and growth of the North American continent. This region, which encompasses the majority of modern day Wyoming and southern Montana, initially collided with other Archean blocks in the Paleoproterozoic (2.0-1.8 Ga), creating the Canadian Shield. From 1.8-1.68 Ga, the Yavapai Province crashed into the Wyoming Province, suturing the two together. The accretion of the Yavapai Province gave way to the Cheyenne Belt, a deformational zone that exists along the southern border of the Wyoming Province where earlier studies have found evidence for crustal imbrication and double a Moho. Current deformation within the Wyoming province is due to its interaction with the Yellowstone Hotspot, which is currently located in the northwest portion of the region. This study images the LAB along the western and southern borders of the Wyoming Province in order to understand how the region’s Archean lithosphere has responded to deformation over time. These results shed light on the inherent strength of Archean cratonic lithosphere in general.\nWe employ two methods for this study: common conversion point (CCP) stacking of S to P receiver functions and teleseismic and ambient Rayleigh wave dispersion. The former is used to image the LAB structure while the latter is used to create a velocity gradient for the region. Results from both of the methods reveal a notably shallower LAB depth to the west of the boundary. The shallower LAB west of the Wyoming Province is interpreted to be a result of lithospheric thinning due to the region's interaction with the Yellowstone Hotspot and post-Laramide deformation and extension of the western United States. We interpret the deeper LAB east of the boundary to be evidence for the Wyoming Province's resistance to lithospheric deformation from the hotspot and tectonic processes. CCP images across the Cheyenne Belt also reveal a shallower LAB under the western perimeter of the belt. We believe that this is a result of the LAB jumping up to a mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD) as the less stable lower lithosphere was thinned or removed. This same MLD appears above the intact LAB in the eastern portion of the Cheyenne Belt. This suggests that the western end of the Cheyenne Belt has undergone more deformation over time than the eastern end.",

            "abstract": "Glacier fjord bathymetry and conditions indicate that they play fundamental roles for outlet glacier dynamics and thus knowledge of these parameters is extremely beneficial to upcoming models that predict changes. In particular, the bathymetry of a fjord gives important information about the exchange between fjord waters close to marine-terminating glaciers and the shelf and ocean. Currently, only sparse bathymetric data near the ice fronts are available for the majority of fjords in Greenland. The challenge in obtaining these measurements is that the fjord melange environment is a terrible one for mechanical gear, or ship or any other kind of access. There is hope however, and this work focuses on novel ways of obtaining this data using a multitude of upcoming technologies and techniques that are now being tested and planned. The span of the techniques described include but are not limited to: 1) manned helicopter-based live-reading instruments and deployable/retriavable sensor packages \nhttp://www.motionterra.com/fjord/\n 2) remote or autonomous unmanned miniature boats (Depth/CTD), and 3) UAV’s that either read live data or deploy small sensors that can telemeter their data (ice-flow trackers, image acquisition, etc.). A review of current results obtained at Jakobshavn and Upernavik Glaciers will be given as well as a description of the techniques and hardware used. ",

During these periods of oval expansion dayside transients are observed to move away from the poleward edge of the auroral oval and drift poleward. These poleward-moving auroral forms are believed to be ionospheric signatures of dayside merging. The dayside auroral oval usually begins to contract when the interplanetary magnetic field turns sharply northward, Bz>0.\nEighteen years of meridian scanning photometer (MSP) data from the Kjell Henriksen Observatory in Longyearbyen, Norway are analyzed. During the boreal winter the Sun is several degrees below the horizon. This permits optical observations throughout the daytime period. The MSP Data is selected two hours before and after local noon in Longyearbeyn. Solar wind data (solar wind pressure and speed, along with the IMF Bx, By, Bz components) are collected for each interval and combined with the MSP observations. This data is then separated using solar maximum and minimum periods. Auroral activity (oval expansions and contractions along with the frequency and number of poleward-moving auroral forms) is documented for both solar maximum and minimum periods.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols exert a major control on the physical and radiative properties of clouds, which are a crucial component of radiative heating and cooling in the atmosphere. Aerosol-cloud radiative effects are a major uncertainty in climate models and the representation of aerosol processes varies greatly between models due to limitations in observational records, gaps in theoretical knowledge and difficulties in parameterising sub-grid scale processes in numerical models.\nLarge variations in natural and anthropogenic aerosols over the industrial era have made constraining aerosol-cloud climate forcing difficult. Paleoclimates represent pristine atmospheres where only natural aerosols are present and can be used to understand and constrain background, natural aerosol climate forcing.\nMineral dust is an ubiquitous natural aerosol which has varied considerably during the past. Whilst many studies have considered the direct effects of dust on the climate, the indirect effect of dust on the climate is often overlooked. Mineral dust is the most important ice nuclei in the atmosphere and the availability of dust in the atmosphere therefore is a strong control on the physical and radiative properties of ice-containing clouds i.e. cirrus and mixed phase clouds.\nPrevious work has highlighted the potential importance of aerosol-cloud forcing in other periods of amplified high-latitude warmth: i.e. the Eocene and Cretaceous. However, these approaches have only speculated possible mechanisms for these changes. Our model setup uses the CESM including CAM5 and DEAD (Dust Entrainment & Deposition Model) along with recent cloud micro-physics parameterisations in order to simulate aerosol dependent ice-nucleation in the atmosphere in response to low atmospheric dust load. Proxy data show evidence of very low dust deposition rates during the Pliocene, suggesting much lower atmospheric dust loading than the present. We quantify the changes in cloud physical properties and cloud radiative forcing, and examine how these contribute to global warmth and high-latitude amplification in the Pliocene.",

The mission of the CEUSN is to produce data that enables researchers and Federal agencies alike to better understand the basic geologic questions, background earthquake rates and distribution, seismic hazard potential, and associated societal risks of this region. The selected long-term sub-array from Transportable Array (TA) stations includes nearly 200 sites, complemented by 100 broadband stations from the existing regional seismic networks to form the Central and Eastern United States Network (CEUSN). Multiple criteria for site selection were weighed by an inter-agency TA Station Selection (TASS) Working Group: seismic noise characteristics, data availability in real time, proximity to nuclear power plants, and homogeneous distribution throughout the region. The Array Network Facility (ANF) started collecting data for CEUSN network stations since late 2013, with all stations collected since May 2014. Regional seismic data streams are collected in real-time from the IRIS Data Management Center (DMC). TA stations selected to be part of CEUSN, retain the broadband sensor to which a 100 sps channel is added, the infrasound and environmental channels, and, at some stations, accelerometers are deployed. The upgraded sites become part of the N4 network for which ANF provides metadata and can issue remote commands to the station equipment. Stations still operated by TA, but planned for CEUSN, are included in the virtual network so all stations are currently available now. By the end of 2015, the remaining TA stations will be upgraded. Data quality control procedures developed for TA stations at ANF and at the DMC are currently performed on N4 data. However, teleseismic and regional events are only picked a few times a month to fulfill data quality checks on the data. The assembled CEUSN data sets can be requested from the DMC with the _CEUSN virtual network code.\nAcknowledgments to Seismic Regional Network Operators: C. Ammon, J. Ebel, D. Doser, R. Hermann, A.

            "abstract": "Systematic tsunami traveltime delays of up to 15 min relative to the numerically simulated long waves from the 2010 Chilean and 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquakes were widely observed at deep ocean tsunamimeters. Enigmatic small negative phases appearing before the main peak were commonly found only at the trans-oceanic locations. The frequency dependence of the measured tsunami phase velocities shows reverse dispersions at long periods, i.e., the tsunami speed becomes slower at periods beyond 1000 s. This is consistent with the phase velocities of a tsunami mode coupled with a self-gravitating elastic Earth, suggesting that the effects of compression and dilatation of seawater, elastic tsunami loadings on a solid Earth, and the geopotential variations associated with the motion of mass during tsunami propagation are responsible for the traveltime delays and the initial negative phases. Simple 1-D tsunami propagation tests confirm that the reverse dispersion creates a small negative phase that precedes the main peak at large distances. A new method to simulate tsunami waveforms on real ocean bathymetry that takes into account seawater compressibility, the elasticity of the Earth, and geopotential perturbations has been developed by applying a phase correction to the simulated long waves. The simulated waveforms, in which phase corrections are applied for the dispersion effects, accurately reproduce the observed waveforms, including a small initial negative phase that appears at distant locations. The traveltime difference between the observed and simulated waveforms has been decreased to less than 5 min and the waveform difference between them remarkably diminishes.\nFigure\nLeft) Trans-Pacific 2010 Chilean and 2011 Tohoku tsunamis to the off-shore DART buoys.\nRight) Comparison of tsunami waveforms between observed (black lines), conventional long-wave simulation (blue lines), and phase-corrected long-wave simulation (red lines).",

These data are used to investigate the microseism source directions and to determine the surface wave tomography of the Cascadia region. Spatial asymmetry in the amplitude of cross-correlations between receiver pairs is observed in both primary microseism and double-frequency (DF) microseism bands. This asymmetry indicates that there are preferential microseism propagation directions, either because of source location and/or upper oceanic crustal structure. Ambient noise group velocity tomography was determined from cross-correlation of DF microseisms between receiver pairs. A low-velocity region oriented roughly north-south was identified, apparently associated with a thick sediment zone off the continental shelf, reflecting the strong influence of ocean bottom sediment layer thickness on DF microseism propagation. The coherence of DF microseism signals between different stations was lowest in the low-velocity thick-sediment region, consistent with the thick sediment layer strongly affecting microseism signal propagation.",

Airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IfSAR) data has been collected for about half of the state of Alaska and completion of the rest of the state is anticipated within a few years. A 5-meter post spacing, 20-foot contour interval accuracy equivalent (3-meter vertical LE90) DEM and radar backscatter intensity image is being delivered. Historic projects to be described include the 1950’s USGS Alaska topographic mapping program, one of the largest and most pioneering, challenging, and successful ever undertaken in North America. These historic and current mapping programs have served as both a baselayer framework and as feedstock for science for virtually every geologic, geophysical, and terrestrial natural science project in the state.",

            "abstract": "In order to accurately predict how ecosystems will respond to climate change, it is necessary to separate the response of respiration and photosynthetic uptake individually to environmental conditions. Currently, the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 is measured continuously at various ecosystems around the world. Net CO­2 flux can be partitioned into the primary components using either models or measurements of 13C/12C in the CO2 flux. We introduce recent technological developments toward in situ, rapid, continuous measurements of fluxes of 13CO2 and 12CO2.\nWe describe a unique approach to achieving 10Hz measurements of CO2 using tunable diode laser gas absorption spectroscopy in a multi-pass White cell capable of being deployed directly to a canopy. We will first discuss proof-of-concept characterization of the technique using wave modulation spectroscopy with a laser tuned to detect 12CO2 fluxes. We show the sensitivity of the 2w component of a wave-modulated signal to CO2 concentration, the precision, and the accuracy of the sensor as well as the stability of the sensor under normal ranges of ambient temperature and humidity in an environmental chamber. We then show preliminary results of sensor performance with a laser tuned to measure 13CO2 and 12CO2 fluxes. We discuss our approach to reliably measuring multiple peaks of gas absorption while maintaining the rapid sampling rates necessary for flux calculations. We will also discuss considerations for extending the sensor from the lab to being directly deployed into a canopy for in situ measurements.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "Ice discharge from calving glaciers has increased in the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), and this increase plays important roles in the volume change of GrIS and its contribution to sea level rise. Thinning of GrIS calving glaciers has been studied by the differentiation of digital elevation models (DEMs) derived by satellite remote-sensing (RS). Such studies rely on the accuracy of DEMs, but calibration of RS data with ground based data is difficult. This is because field data on GrIS calving glaciers are few. In this study, we combined field and RS data to measure surface elevation change of Bowdoin Glacier, a marine terminating outlet glacier in northwestern Greenland (77°41′18″N, 68°29′47″W). The fast flowing part of the glacier is approximately 3 km wide and 10 km long. Ice surface elevation within 6 km from the glacier terminus was surveyed in the field in July 2013 and 2014, by using the global positioning system. We also measured the surface elevation over the glacier on August 20, 2007 and September 4, 2010, by analyzing Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), Panchromatic remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) images. We calibrated the satellite derived elevation data with our field measurements, and generated DEM for each year with a 25 m grid mesh. The field data and DEMs were compared to calculate recent glacier elevation change. Mean surface elevation change along the field survey profiles were −16.3±0.2 m (−5.3±0.1 m yr−1) in 2007–2010 and −10.8±0.2 m (−3.8±0.1 m yr−1) in 2010–2013. These rates are much greater than those observed on non-calving ice caps in the region, and similar to those reported for other calving glaciers in northwestern Greenland. Loss of ice was greater near the glacier terminus, suggesting the importance of ice dynamics and/or interaction with the ocean.",

            "abstract": "The estimation of evaporation has important implications in modeling climate at the regional and global scale, the hydrological cycle and estimating environmental stress on agricultural systems. In field and laboratory studies, remote sensing and in-situ techniques are used to collect thermal and soil moisture data of the soil surface and subsurface which is then used to estimate evaporative fluxes, oftentimes using the sensible heat balance method. Nonetheless, few studies exist that compare the methods due to limited data availability and the complexity of many of the techniques, making it difficult to understand flux estimates. This work compares different methods used to quantify evaporative flux based on remotely sensed and in-situ temperature and soil moisture data. A series of four laboratory experiments were performed under ambient and elevated air temperature conditions with homogeneous and heterogeneous soil configurations in a small two-dimensional soil tank interfaced with a small wind tunnel apparatus. The soil tank and wind tunnel were outfitted with a suite of sensors that measured soil temperature (surface and subsurface), air temperature, soil moisture, and tank weight. Air and soil temperature measurements were obtained using infrared thermography, heat pulse sensors and thermistors. Spatial and temporal thermal data were numerically inverted to obtain the evaporative flux. These values were then compared with rates of mass loss from direct weighing of the samples. Results demonstrate the applicability of different methods under different surface boundary conditions; no one method was deemed most applicable under every condition. Infrared thermography combined with the sensible heat balance method was best able to determine evaporative fluxes under stage 1 conditions while distributed temperature sensing combined with the sensible heat balance method best determined stage 2 evaporation. The approaches that appear most promising for determining the surface energy balance incorporates soil moisture rate of change over time and atmospheric conditions immediately above the soil surface. An understanding of the fidelity regarding predicted evaporation rates based upon stages of evaporation enables a more deliberate selection of the suite of sensors required for data collection.",

            "abstract": "Natural processes and anthropogenic activities can cause short-term flow increases in rivers. These changes in flow, such as those caused by extreme rainfall events or seasonal variation in precipitation patterns, can result in substantial, and sometimes quite rapid, adjustments in sediment regime and alluvial stream morphology. Such morphological adjustments can pose short-term erosion hazards, increased risk of flooding, degradation to aquatic habitat, damage to in-stream engineering infrastructure, and re-mobilization of pollutants. Alterations in river hydraulics, sediment transport and stream morphology from specific unsteady events prove challenging to accurately predict and assess. This research quantifies the morphodynamic response of stream beds to unsteady flow events of varying magnitude and duration. For this purpose, a series of experimental runs is conducted in a 0.31 m-wide, 5.0 m-long laboratory sediment transport flume comprised of a well-sorted medium sand. All runs start from flat-bed initial conditions with a given longitudinal slope. The bed is allowed to develop under constant base-flow (antecedent) conditions until equilibrium conditions are reached. For each run a prescribed increase in flow rate for a pre-determined duration is applied to simulate the unsteady flow event. The magnitude of the increase in flow rate and the duration of the event are systematically varied from run to run. In each run measurements of bed morphology are conducted prior to the event (during antecedent flow conditions), at the conclusion of the event, and following a return base-flow (antecedent) conditions. Sediment transport rates are monitored throughout each run. The morphological response and the time-scale of the bed adjustments to unsteady events is quantified. The effect of the magnitude and duration of the flow increase on this increase is evaluated. This study contributes to the development of predictive tools for engineers and hydrologists to better understand the magnitude and time-scale of the morphodynamic response of streams to unsteady flow events, leading to the implementation of more resilient river restoration efforts, better protection of hydraulic structures, and development of comprehensive river management strategies.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes induced by human activity have become a matter of heightened public concern during recent years. Of particular concern is seismicity associated with wastewater injection, which has included events having magnitudes greater than 5. The causes of the induced events are primarily changes in pore-pressure, fluid volume and perhaps temperature due to injection. Recent research in the US has focused on mid-continental regions having low rates of naturally-occurring seismicity, where induced events can be identified by relatively straightforward spatial and temporal correlation of seismicity with high-volume injection activities. Recent examples include events correlated with injection of wastewater in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and Ohio, and long-term brine injection in the Paradox Valley in Colorado. Even in some of the cases where there appears at first sight to be a clear spatial correlation between seismicity and injection, it has been difficult to establish causality definitively.\nHere, we discuss methods to identify induced seismicity in active tectonic regions. We concentrate our study on Southern California, where large numbers of wastewater injection wells are located in oil-producing basins that experience moderate to high rates of naturally-occurring seismicity. Using the catalog of high-precision CISN relocations produced by Hauksson et al. (BSSA, 2012), we aim to discriminate induced from natural events based on spatio-temporal patterns of seismicity occurrence characteristics and their relationships to injection activities, known active faults and other faults favorably oriented for slip under the tectonic stress field. Since the vast majority of induced earthquakes are very small, it is crucial to include all events above the detection threshold of the CISN in each area studied. In addition to exploring the correlation of seismicity to injection activities in time and space, we analyze variations in frequency-magnitude distributions, which can be related to differences between the physical conditions at the sources of fluid-induced and natural earthquakes. While induced seismicity often does not show different mechanisms than tectonic earthquakes, an abundance of induced microseismicity causes the slope of the frequency-magnitude distribution to increase locally.",

            "abstract": "As the largest ocean basin, the Pacific helps to set the global climate state, since its circulation affects mean ocean properties, air-sea partitioning of carbon dioxide, and the distribution of global oceanic poleward heat transport. There is evidence that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the subarctic Pacific contained a better-ventilated, relatively fresh intermediate water mass above ~2000 m that may have formed locally. The source and spatial extent of this water mass is not known, nor do we know how formation of this water mass varied during Pleistocene glaciations with different orbital and ice sheet boundary conditions. Here we present a 0.5 My multi-species benthic stable isotope record from Site U1345 (1008 m) on the northern Bering slope and a 1.0 My record from U1339 (1868 m) from the Umnak Plateau in the southeastern basin. We find that the relatively well-ventilated low-δ18O intermediate water reaches 1000 m in the Bering Sea during MIS2 and 6, but that the hydrographic divide between this water mass and poorly-ventilated deep water was shallower than 1000 m for the previous three glaciations. We also compare Bering Sea piston core and IODP Expedition 323 Uvigerina data from the Holocene and LGM with the modern hydrography, and to previously published profiles from the Okhotsk Sea and Emperor Seamounts. We find that the carbon and oxygen stable isotope signatures of well-ventilated water in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas are distinct, suggesting that there may have been intermediate water formation in both basins during the LGM. However, interpretation of the δ13C data is complicated by offsets between Uvigerina species and bottom water δ13C of DIC, so this hypothesis will require confirmation by other proxies.",

It is anticipated that at some intermediate scale, there is a transition from geostrophically dominated flow to wave-dominated flow. Observing the flow at such intermediate scales, the submesoscales, is currently restricted to ship-based measurements. Information is often obtained in one spatial dimension only, with no temporal information available to distinguish between geostrophic flow and internal waves.\nWe present a simple two-step method by which one-dimensional energy spectra can be decomposed into an internal-wave component and a geostrophic component if measurements of velocity along and across the ship track and buoyancy are available. In the first step a Helmholtz decomposition of the horizontal velocity spectra into rotational and divergent components is performed and in the second step an energy equipartition property of hydrostatic internal waves is exploited that allows diagnosing the wave energy spectrum solely from the observed horizontal velocities. The observed buoyancy spectrum can then be used to compute the residual geostrophic energy spectrum. We illustrate the method on two data sets from the eastern North Pacific and the Gulf Stream region. The method is also applicable to atmospheric data obtained by commercial aircraft.",

            "abstract": "One method for mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic CO2-related climate change is the sequestration of CO2 in depleted gas and oil reservoirs, including shale. The accurate characterization of the heterogeneous material properties of shale, including pore volume, surface area, pore size distributions (PSDs) and composition is needed to understand the interaction of CO2 with shale. Idealized powdered shale sorption isotherms were created by varying incremental amounts of four essential components by weight. The first two components, organic carbon and clay, have been shown to be the most important components for CO2 uptake in shales. Organic carbon was represented by kerogen isolated from a Silurian shale, and clay groups were represented by illite from the Green River shale formation. The rest of the idealized shale was composed of equal parts by weight of SiO2 to represent quartz and CaCO3 to represent carbonate components. Baltic, Eagle Ford, and Barnett shale sorption measurements were used to validate the idealized samples. The idealized and validation shale sorption isotherms were measured volumetrically using low pressure N2 (77K) and CO2 (273K) adsorbates on a Quantachrome Autosorb IQ2. Gravimetric isotherms were also produced for a subset of these samples using CO2 and CH4adsorbates under subsurface temperature and pressure conditions using a Rubotherm magnetic suspension balance. Preliminary analyses were inconclusive in validating the idealized samples. This could be a result of conflicting reports of total organic carbon (TOC) content in each sample, a problem stemming from the heterogeneity of the samples and different techniques used for measuring TOC content. The TOC content of the validation samples (Eagle Ford and Barnett) was measured by Rock-Eval pyrolysis at Weatherford Laboratories, while the TOC content in the Baltic validation samples was determined by LECO TOC. Development of a uniform process for measuring TOC in the validation samples is underway. The validity of the idealized samples can be reevaluated upon obtaining reliable and consistent TOC measurements. Validated idealized sample data will lend itself toward the development of predictive models weighted and scaled by the percentages of these essential components in the shales’ corresponding compositional breakdown.",

We show, in particular, that the magnitude-dependent seismic quiescence is observed for the Wenchuan earthquake and that it adds to other similar observations. Such studies on seismic quiescence prior to major earthquakes include 1982 Urakawa-Oki earthquake (M 7.1) (Taylor et al., 1992), 1994 Hokkaido-Toho-Oki earthquake (Mw=8.2) (Takanami et al., 1996), 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Mw=9.0) (Katsumata, 2011). Smith and Sacks (2013) proposed a magnitude-dependent quiescence based on a physical earthquake model (Rydelek and Sacks, 1995) and demonstrated the quiescence can be reproduced by the introduction of “asperities” (dilantacy hardened zones). Actual observations indicate the change occurs in a broader area than the eventual earthquake fault zone. In order to accept the explanation, we need to verify the model as the model predicts somewhat controversial features of earthquakes such as the magnitude dependent stress drop at lower magnitude range or the dynamically appearing asperities and repeating slips in some parts of the rupture zone. We show supportive observations. We will also need to verify the dilatancy diffusion to be taking place. So far, we only seem to have indirect evidences, which need to be more quantitatively substantiated.",

            "abstract": "Chicken is the most consumed meat in the US, and production continues to intensify rapidly around the world. Chicken manure from confined feeding operations is typically applied in its raw form to nearby croplands, resulting in hotspots of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Pasture-raised chicken is an alternative to industrial production and is growing in popularity with rising consumer demand for more humanely raised protein sources. In this agricultural model, manure is deposited directly onto grassland soils where it is thought to increase pools of soil carbon and nitrogen. The fate of manure nitrogen from pasture-raised chicken production remains poorly understood.\nWe conducted a controlled, replicated experiment on a permaculture farm in Charlottesville, Virginia (Timbercreek Organics) in which small chicken coops (10 ft x 12 ft) were moved daily in a pasture. We measured manure deposition rates, soil inorganic nitrogen pools, soil moisture, and soil N2O and CO2 emissions. Measurements were made for the 28-day pasture life of three separate flocks of chickens in the spring, summer, and fall. Each flock consisted of approximately 200-300 chickens occupying three to five coops (~65 chickens/coop). Measurements were also made in paired ungrazed control plots.\nManure deposition rates were similar across flocks and averaged 1.5 kgdrywt ha-1 during the spring grazing event and 4.0 kgdrywt ha-1 during the summer and fall grazing events. Manure deposition was relatively constant over the four weeks pasture-lifetime of the chickens. Compared to control plots, grazed areas exhibited higher soil N2O and CO2 fluxes. The magnitude of these fluxes diminished significantly over the four-week span. Soil gas fluxes significantly increased following rainfall events. For a given rainfall event, higher fluxes were observed from transects that were grazed more recently. Soil gaseous reactive nitrogen losses were less in this pasture system compared to cultivated field amended with raw chicken manure. These results suggest that pasture manure management may have a smaller impact on gaseous reactive nitrogen pollution.",

These features may the subducted structure of prior seafloor bathymetry, or created during subduction due to heterogeneous stress, variances in material behavior, interactions with the overriding plate, or changes in megathrust orientation relative to convergence. Such geometric complexities along the seismogenic component of the subduction interface play the role of mechanical regulators during the interseismic, coseismic and postseismic phase producing a combined geometry-lithology effect. Here we examine the Nicoya peninsula of Costa Rica which has a rich dataset of GPS observation that includes 15 years of late interseismic coupling, strain release for the 2012 Nicoya moment magnitude 7.6 event, and 2 years of afterslip and postseismic recovery. Based on a newly developed 3D regional interface Finite Element (FE) model, generated from hypocenters of microseismicity recorded from regional seismic networks we : 1) identify the role of interface topography in modulating long-term interseismic locking; 2) quantify the effect of topographic obstacles; 3) define the extent that mechanical regulators determine the degree of interface coupling; 4) develop meaningful comparisons between interseismic locking and coseismic slip models for the 2012 Nicoya earthquake; and 5) we discuss what role these geometric features may have as the interface returns reenters the interseismic phase of the seismic cycle.",

            "abstract": "During the hydraulic fracturing, the pressurized fluid creates new fractures and reactivates existing natural fractures forming a highly conductive Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) around the borehole. We extend the previous work on Lyons sandstone and pyrophyllite to anisotropic shale from the Wolfcamp formation. We divide the rock anisotropy into two groups: a) conventional and b) unconventional (shaly) anisotropy. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), compressional velocity anisotropy, and SEM analysis are used to identify three causes of anisotropy: bedding planes, clay lamination, and calcite veins. Calcite vein is a subsequently filled with calcite bonded weakly to the matrix. Velocity anisotropy and visual observations demonstrate the calcite filled veins to be mostly subparallel to the fabric direction. Brazilian tests are carried out to observe the fracture initiation and propagation under tension. High speed photography (frame rate 300,000 frame/sec) was used to capture the failure. Strain gauges and Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors recorded the deformation leading up to and during failure. SEM imaging and surface profilometry were employed to study the post-failure fracture system and failed surface topology. Fracture permeability was measured as a function of effective stress. Brazilian tests on small disks containing a centered single vein revealed the shear strength of the veins.\nWe interpret the strain data and number, frequency, and amplitude of AE events which are correlated well with the observed fracture process zone, surface roughness, and permeability. The unpropped fracture has enhanced permeability by two orders of magnitude. The observed anisotropic tensile failure seems to have a universal trend with a minimum strength occurring at 15o orientation with respect to the loading axis. The veins at 15o orientation with respect to the loading axis were easily activated at 30% of the original failure load. The measured strength of the vein is as low as 6% of the matrix. Surface roughness measurements show the vein to be as rough as the main tensile fracture in the matrix. The observations suggest that fracking through a deviated well reduces the breakdown pressure significantly and can activate a large number of veins with enhanced conductivity without the need for excessive proppant injection.",

            "abstract": "We address the fundamental questions surrounding the nature of water and chemical transport processes deep within sedimentary basin and accretionary-wedge environments.\nConsolidation and permeability studies conducted to 165 MPa (~10km depth) indicate that ultra-tight clay formations (10-18 m2 to10-21 m2) can substantially modify the fluids migrating through then. Pore-water extractions conducted on smectite/illite rich core samples obtained from 1-3 km depths at IODP (NanTroSEIZE, Chikyu) deep-riser drilling Site C0002, at the elevated loads required to squeeze waters from such deeply buried sediment (stresses up to 100 MPa),resulted in anomalous patterns of sequential freshening with progressive loading. More accurate laboratory investigations (both incremental loading and Constant Rate of Strain test) revealed that such freshening initiates above 20 MPa and progresses with consolidation to become greater than 20% by effective normal load of 165 MPa. Log-log plots of stress vs. hydraulic conductivity reveal that trends remain linear to elevated stresses and total porosities as low at 14%. The implications are that stress induced smectite dehydration and/or membrane filtration effects cause remarkable changes in pore water chemistry with fluid migration through deep, tight, clay-rich formations. These changes should occur in addition to any thermally induced diagenetic and clay-dehydration effects on pore water chemistry. Work is progressing to evaluate the impact of clay composition and temperature to ascertain if purely illitic compositions show similar trends and if the mass fractionation of water and other isotopes also occurs. Such studies will ascertain if the presence of smectite is a prerequisite for freshening or if membrane filtration is a major process in earth systems containing common clay minerals. The results have major implications for interpretations of mass chemical balances, pore water profiles, and the hydrologic, geochemical, and stress state controls on deep system behavior in all deep accretionary wedge and basin environments where clays are abundant.

            "abstract": "Downstream rounding of grains is consistently observed in natural sediment transport settings. A recent theory put forth by Domokos et al. (2014) attributes particle rounding and size reduction to a geometric curvature-driven abrasion process. This process occurs in two phases, in which irregularly shaped or angular particles round to convex shapes with negligible change in axis dimension, then slowly reduce in particle diameter. Miller et al (in review) establish the existence of two-phase abrasion in the natural setting of a fluvial gravel stream. This study examines field samples from White Sands, NM to investigate the presence of two-phase abrasion in a different, non-idealized natural environment – a high-energy, eolian gypsum dunefield.\nAnalysis of grain shapes from White Sands confirms the two-phase abrasion process, dependent upon mode of sediment transport. We find that large sand grains carried in saltation bed load transport exhibit shape change indicative of two-phase abrasion, while smaller particles carried in suspension do not. We observe rapid shape change in bed load particles approaching a convex shape, followed by slower reduction in grain axis dimensions. Confirmation of this process in a natural, non-idealized setting establishes two-phase abrasion as a general application for bed load transport.",

            "abstract": "Tree ring widths have been used as a proxy for climate variables for several decades. Temperature, precipitation, and less commonly, snow water equivalent have been modeled in numerous locations throughout the world. Typical studies use carefully selected trees to maximize length of record and sensitivity to the variable of interest, and result in a reconstruction for a specific location. Here we use tree ring data collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, conducted by the U.S. Forest Service to reconstruct snow water equivalent for the state of Utah. This program collects increment cores on a geographically unbiased grid at horizontal resolution of 5-km across the U.S., resulting in an unprecedented sample density of tree ring data, and therefore enabling a reconstruction that covers a large geographic area at a resolution not possible using traditional dendroclimatology methods. Prior work (DeRose et al. 2013) has shown FIA to have coherence with previously published chronologies and with water-year precipitation. Snowpack is a major source of water in the Intermountain West, and yet few tree ring studies have reconstructed SWE and the instrumental record is limited in length, so this reconstruction represents a novel and useful dataset for water users and resource managers alike. Here we present initial results and a preliminary analysis of this unique dataset.",

            "abstract": "The current California drought is in its third dry years, with this year being the third driest years in a 106-year record. This drought occurs at a time when urban, agricultural, and environmental water demands have never been greater.\nThis drought has revealed the importance of more quantitative evaluation and methods for water assessment and management. All areas of water and environmental management are likely to become increasingly stressed, and have essentially drought-like conditions, in the future, as California's urban, agricultural, and environmental demands continue to expand and as the climate changes. In the historical past, droughts have pre-viewed stresses developing in the future and helped focus policy-makers, the public, and stakeholders on preparing for these developing future conditions. Multi-decade water management strategies are often galvinized by drought. Irrigation was galvanized by California droughts in the 1800s, reservoir systems by the 1928-32 drought, urban water conservation by the 1976-77 drought, and water markets by the 1988-92 drought. With each drought, demands for tighter accounting, rights, and management have increased.\nThis talk reviews the prospects and challenges for increased development and use of water data and systems analysis in the service of human and environmental water demands in California's highly decentralized water management system, and the prospects if these challenges are not more successfully addressed.",

            "abstract": "One of the major concerns with climate change is the potential feedback from the emission of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), from high latitude thawing organic soils. With increasing temperatures in Arctic regions, thawing permafrost palsas transition to wetter sedge-dominated wetlands, which account for 20-39% of global atmospheric CH4 burden. This rapid change in habitat raises the following question: how do CO2 exchange rates and CH4 emissions change along a gradient of permafrost thaw and what is the interannual variability in these fluxes? To address this question, we measured CO2 exchange, CH4 flux, vegetative type and vascular green area (VGA) along a thaw gradient during July of 2013 and 2014 in Stordalen Mire, Sweden. Environmental variables showed that 2013 and 2014 were climatically different; higher photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and measurements of water table level and temperature showed that 2014 was warmer and drier than 2013. Warmer conditions led to higher rates of respiration and gross primary productivity (GPP), with the largest increases observed in the palsa sites, likely due to an increase in mean temperature. Methane fluxes showed a less consistent response to climate differences between years, fluxes were higher in 2014 in the mostly inundated Eriophorum angustifolium dominated site and lower in the drier Sphagnum and Eriophorum vaginatum dominated sites. Results of this study highlight the need for accounting for interannual variability when predicting greenhouse gas emissions during permafrost thaw.",

Ninety percent of Burkina Faso active population is engaged in agriculture and livestock, which accounts for 39% of gross domestic product. Located between the coordinates 1o15’-1o55’ West and 12o17’- 12o50’North, Massili basin includes Ouagadougou the capital and has four dams, of which the most important dam, Loumbila is used for the capital water supply and irrigation. A change of climate may affect the water resources most likely limit the access to safe water. In order to characterize Massili basin climate variability, daily temperature and precipitation over 1960 to 2012 was analyzed using long-term records from the Ouagadougou synoptic station. By applying R-climdex and instat tools, indices were calculated by a consistent approach recommended by the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices. The precipitation parameters computed were: the maximum 5-day precipitationamount; the number of days with precipitation amount ≥50 mm ; the maximum precipitation amount in consecutive wet days with RR≥ 1mm; the consecutives dry days;the extremely wet days ; the extreme precipitation in one day, the total precipitation in wet days; the temperature indices computed were : the maximum of the maximum daily temperature, the minimum of daily maximum temperature,the minimum of daily minimum temperature,the cold spell duration indices and the warm spell duration indicator. Results show a slight increase of the maximum 5-day precipitation, maximum precipitation amount in consecutive wet days with RR≥1mm, the onset delayed and the cessation is earlier meaning that the rainfall period is shortening. The total precipitationwas decreased in the basin but there is a slight increase in the occurrence of extremely wet days. CSDI is decreasing while warm spell duration indices are increasing. In parallel of the data analysis, a survey of 200 peasant spread within 20 villages was done to assess their perception on climate change. Farmers perception corroborate with the above results as their majority describes climate change as decrease of rainfall (79%) and increase of temperature (99%). In addition, all farmers agreed that more floods are occurring.",

A new approach without using plaster-of-Paris or real bedrock developed provides a feasible method to simulate the genesis and evolution of the erosional bedforms in cohesive sediment beds and sculpted forms in bedrock channels on relatively short time-scales in the laboratory by using a realistic substrate substitute.\nA series of flume experiments are presented herein where the undrained shear strength of two different kinds of substrate material is systematically varied under constant flow conditions. Experiments using plain water flow indicated that erosive bedforms in cohesive sediment substrate cannot be produced only under the effect of sediment-free flow. Particulate-laden flows do form erosional bedforms in both kinds of clay beds and the shear strength of the bed material plays a key role in determining the diversity of erosional features forming on such substrates. Optimisation of modelling clay beds has enabled us to successfully replicate a suite of bedrock bedforms, including potholes, flutes, longitudinal furrows, etc., that have clear equivalents to those observed in bedrock rivers and contributed to investigate the genesis and evolution process of them and explore the flow structures within and above them in experimental analogue bedrock substrate for the first time.",

            "abstract": "Operational earthquake forecasting (OEF) is the dissemination of authoritative information about time-dependent earthquake probabilities to help communities prepare for potentially destructive earthquakes. The goal of OEF is to inform the decisions that people and organizations must continually make to mitigate seismic risk and prepare for potentially destructive earthquakes on time scales from days to decades. To attain this goal, OEF must provide a complete description of the seismic hazard—ground motion exceedance probabilities as well as short-term rupture probabilities—in concert with the long-term forecasts of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. We have combined the Third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3) of the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (Field et al., 2014) with the CyberShake ground-motion model of the Southern California Earthquake Center (Graves et al., 2011; Callaghan et al., this meeting) into a prototype OEF system for generating time-dependent hazard maps. UCERF3 represents future earthquake activity in terms of fault-rupture probabilities, incorporating both Reid-type renewal models and Omori-type clustering models. The current CyberShake model comprises approximately 415,000 earthquake rupture variations to represent the conditional probability of future shaking at 285 geographic sites in the Los Angeles region (~236 million horizontal-component seismograms). This combination provides significant probability gains relative to OEF models based on empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs), primarily because the physics-based CyberShake simulations account for the rupture directivity, basin effects, and directivity-basin coupling that are not represented by the GMPEs.",

            "abstract": "We present a full year of continuous in-situ measurements of isoprene and its oxidation products methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein (MVK+MACR) by PTR-MS from a 244 m tall tower in the US Upper Midwest (KCMP tall tower). The tower is located at an ecological transition between isoprene-emitting deciduous forest to the north and east, and predominantly non-isoprene-emitting agricultural landscapes to the west and south. Based on independent cartridge measurements and a source-tracer analysis, we estimate that anthropogenic interferences (or anthropogenic isoprene) contribute on average 20% of the observed PTR-MS m/z 69 signal during daytime in summer at the KCMP tall tower (and up to 80% at night). Interferences for MVK+MACR at m/z 71 are small (7%). After removing these interferences, the observed isoprene and MVK+MACR mixing ratios show pronounced seasonal cycles, reaching maxima of 2540 pptv (isoprene) and 2790 pptv (MVK+MACR) during summer. The KCMP tall tower is impacted both by nearby isoprene sources (with transport time within an isoprene lifetime) and more distant regional isoprene sources (with transport time exceeding an isoprene lifetime), as indicated by daytime enhancements of isoprene (but little MVK+MACR) under southwest winds, and enhancements of MVK+MACR (but little isoprene) under transport from other directions. We find that the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model driven with the MEGANv2.1 biogenic inventory can reproduce the observed isoprene mixing ratios to within model uncertainty once improved land cover and temperature estimates are implemented in the model. However, a model low bias in MVK+MACR of (25% - 66%) cannot be resolved, even across diverse model assumptions for chemistry, atmospheric mixing, and land cover. This suggests that, while isoprene emissions in the immediate vicinity of the KCMP tall tower are adequately captured, the model is still underestimating emissions across the broader region. Using the loss of HOx radicals relative to the loss of NOx radicals (LHOx/LNOx) in the model as an indicator, we find that this region experiences a strong seasonal shift between VOC-limited chemistry in the spring and fall and NOx-limited or transitional chemistry in the summer, and that this transition is driven by the temporal and spatial distribution of isoprene emissions.",

            "abstract": "The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) at ~40 Ma is a warming event characterized in the deep Southern, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans by a distinct negative δ18O excursion over 500 kyr. In this work we report results of high-resolution paleontological, geochemical, and environmental magnetic investigations of the Monte Cagnero (MCA) section (Central Italy), which can be correlated on the basis of magneto- and biostratigraphic results to the MECO event. In the MCA section, an interval with a relative increase in eutrophic nannofossil taxa spans the culmination of the MECO warming and its aftermath and coincides with a positive carbon isotope excursion, and a peak in magnetite and hematite/goethite concentration. Our results suggest that magnetite peak reflects the appearance of putative magnetofossils, while the hematite/goethite apex is attributed to an enhanced detrital mineral contribution, likely as aeolian dust transported from the continent adjacent to the Neo-Tethys Ocean during a drier, more seasonal climate during the peak MECO warming. Based on our new data record, the MECO warming peak and its immediate aftermath are interpreted as a period of high primary productivity. Sea-surface iron fertilization is inferred to have stimulated high phytoplankton productivity, increasing organic carbon export to the seafloor and promoting enhanced biomineralization of magnetotactic bacteria, which are preserved as putative magnetofossils during the warmest periods of the MECO event in the MCA section.",

Additional sensors have been added to measure local ice melt rates acoustically, and finescale thermal structure from the eddy correlation flux sensor up into the ice to resolve summer near-surface heating. The AOFB buoys have typically been co-located with Ice Tethered Profilers, that measure the upper ocean T/S structure and ice mass balance instruments. Comparisons of near-surface heat fluxes, heat content and vertical structure over the last decade will be made for buoys in the Beaufort Sea and Transpolar Drift between the North Pole and Spitzbergen. The effects of enhanced basal melting from ice/albedo feedbacks can be clearly seen in the low ice concentration summer conditions found more recently in the Beaufort Sea, while there are less pronounced effects of enhanced summer surface heating in the higher ice concentrations still found in the transpolar drift.

This new paradigm allows the integration of real-time, high-rate GNSS displacement information with acceleration and velocity data to create very high-rate displacement records. The mating of these two instruments allows the creation of a new, very high-rate (200 sps) displacement observable that has the full-scale displacement characteristics of GNSS and high-precision dynamic motions of seismic technologies. It is envisioned that these new observables can be used for earthquake early warning studies, volcano monitoring, and critical infrastructure monitoring applications.\nOur presentation will focus on the characteristics of GNSS, seismic, and strong motion sensors in high dynamic environments, including historic earthquakes in Southern California and the Pacific Rim, replicated on a shake table, over a range of displacements and frequencies. We will explore the optimum integration of these sensors from a filtering perspective including simple harmonic impulses over varying frequencies and amplitudes and under the dynamic conditions of various earthquake scenarios. In addition we will discuss implementation of a Rapid Seismic Event Notification System that provides quick delivery of digital data from seismic stations to the acquisition and processing center and a full data integrity model for real-time earthquake notification that provides warning prior to significant ground shaking.",

For the development, we derived a relationship between source distribution of ambient noise and cross spectra of vertical and horizontal components at a single station by representing ambient noise wavefiled as a superposition of uncorrelated plane waves. The cross spectra of vertical and horizontal components correspond to the first order terms of a Fourier series expressing noise source distribution. Using the relationship, we estimated the directionality of ambient noise wavefield in whole Japan. In a period band of 4-8 s, the back azimuths showing spatially and temporally coherent pattern well point to the track of low pressure migrating through the sea around Japan. In contrast, in a shorter period band of 1-2 s, back azimuth of each station is oriented to the direction to the nearest sea. In a middle period band of 2-4 s, the spatial variation of back azimuth shows clear difference between southeast and northeast Japan separated by a major tectonic boundary, suggesting that ambient noise wavefield is also controlled by structural boundary.",

GRACE has a unique ability to observe the mass flux of water movement at monthly time scales. The hydrology applications of the GRACE mission include measurements of seasonal storage of surface and subsurface water and evapotranspiration at the land-ocean-atmosphere boundary. These variables are invaluable for improved modeling and prediction of Earth system processes. Other mission-critical science objectives include measurements that are a key component of NASA’s ongoing climate measuring capabilities.\nSuccessful strategies to enhance science and practical applications of the proposed GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) mission, scheduled to launch in 2017, will require engaging with and facilitating between representatives in the science, societal applications, and mission planning communities. NASA’s Applied Sciences Program is supporting collaboration on an applied approach to identifying communities of potential and of practice in order to identify and promote the societal benefits of these and future gravity missions. The objective is to engage applications-oriented users and organizations and enable them to envision possible applications and end-user needs as a way to increase the benefits of these missions to the nations.\nThe focus of activities for this applications program include; engaging the science community in order to identify applications and current and potential data users, developing a written Applications Plan, conducting workshops and user tutorials, providing ready access to information via web pages, developing databases of key and interested users/scientists, creating printed materials (posters, brochures) that identify key capabilities and applications of the missions and data, and participation in key science meetings and decision support processes.",

            "abstract": "Seasonality and phase equilibrium in Titan’s lakes and seas will result in predictable sedimentary processes, deposits, and landforms. Calculated using CRYOCHEM, liquids on Titan should exhibit a counter-intuitive behavior where density increases with temperature but decreases with pressure, unless the temperature falls below 89.6 K. For warmer temperatures, the surface liquid of seas should flow toward the hottest spot; return flow may occur beneath the surface. Methane-rich liquid flowing southward from one interconnected northern sea to another will evaporate methane and concentrate ethane and other heavy hydrocarbons. In the north polar and circumpolar regions, a south-flowing river entering a sea from cold northerly uplands will inject a buoyant plume of low-density methane-rich liquid into the sea, unless the liquid at the inlet is heavily charged with dense solid phases or unless the lake is colder than 89.6 K. Generally north of (colder than) the seasonally shifting 89.6K transition (possible during the winter precisely when river discharges are high), a different behavior exists, whereby cold and methane-rich liquid forms denser liquids and flows across the bottom of the sea—possibly forming sub-sea channels as observed at Ligeia Mare. If the river carries clastic sediment denser than the methane liquid, the solids will undergo Stokes settling of the coarser fractions during periods of high river discharge, leaving the finest clastic fraction to undergo slow pelagic sedimentation throughout the year. From late spring to late summer, methane undergoes net evaporation from the sea, and solid organics that were saturated during the winter are likely to precipitate once warm weather starts. Hence, varves in Titan’s seas are apt to consist of annual cycles of (1) winter: coarse clastics, (2) all dry season: fine-grained clastics, and (3) summer: evaporites. As Titan undergoes ‘Milankovic’ type variations in rotational obliquity and Saturn’s orbital eccentricity, the circumpolar climate and annual range of the seasonal cycle will change, forcing responses in rainfall rates, erosion rates, and the composition of lakes and seas. Thus, sediment deposit sequences—layered organic rock strata—in the circumpolar regions will record past climate changes due to long-term cycles as well as annual periodicity.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical surveys are powerful tools for obtaining information about the subsurface. Inverse modelling provides a mathematical framework for constructing a model of physical property distributions that are consistent with the data collected by these surveys. The geosciences are increasingly moving towards the integration of geological, geophysical, and hydrological information to better characterize the subsurface. This integration must span disciplines and is not only challenging scientifically, but the inconsistencies between conventions often makes implementations complicated, non-reproducible, or inefficient. We have developed an open source software package for Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics (SimPEG), which provides a generalized framework for solving geophysical forward and inverse problems. SimPEG is written entirely in Python with minimal dependencies in the hopes that it can be used both as a research tool and for education.\nSimPEG includes finite volume discretizations on structured and unstructured meshes, interfaces to standard numerical solver packages, convex optimization algorithms, model parameterizations, and tailored visualization routines. The framework is modular and object-oriented, which promotes real time experimentation and combination of geophysical problems and inversion methodologies. In this presentation, we will highlight a few geophysical examples, including direct-current resistivity and electromagnetics, and discuss some of the challenges and successes we encountered in developing a flexible and extensible framework. Throughout development of SimPEG we have focused on simplicity, usability, documentation, and extensive testing. By embracing a fully open source development paradigm, we hope to encourage reproducible research, cooperation, and communication to help tackle some of the inherently multidisciplinary problems that face integrated geophysical methods.",

Until recently, the atomic H component of this loss was thought to be relatively constant in time, based on arguments from Mariner data that the source of the escaping H was molecular hydrogen, with an atmospheric lifetime of decades. New data gathered by the SPectroscopy for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Mars (SPICAM) instrument on the European Space Agency's Mars Express mission has shown that H escape varies by more than an order of magnitude in Fall 2007 alone, requiring a different parent molecule for the escaping atomic H.\nUsing a completely new 1D time-dependent photochemical model of the Martian atmosphere, we investigate the effect of transient upper atmospheric water vapor on H and O escape to space and the abundance of minor species throughout the atmosphere. We demonstrate that detached water layers between 40-100 km, recently discovered by the infrared channel of SPICAM, produce an order of magnitude increase in the escape rate of H from the Martian atmosphere to space on a timescale of months. This provides an explanation for the observed H escape variation, adding to evidence that the upper, middle, and lower atmosphere of Mars are more tightly coupled in time than was previously expected. Implications for MAVEN measurements and for reconstructing the history of Martian water loss and the oxidation state of the crust will be discussed.\nSupport for this work was provided by the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship Program, Award Number NNX11AP49H.",

            "abstract": "Assessment of climate change resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation options require downscaling of GCM outputs to local scales, and conversion of temperature and precipitation forcings into hydrologic and ecological responses. Recent work in the San Francisco Bay Area, and California demonstrate a practical approach to this process. First, climate futures (GCM x Emissions Scenario) are screened using cluster analysis for seasonal precipitation and temperature, to select a tractable subset of projections that still represent the range of climate projections. Second, monthly climate projections are downscaled to 270m and the Basin Characterization Model (BCM) applied, to generate fine-scale recharge, runoff, actual evapotranspiration (AET), and climatic water deficit (CWD) accounting for soils, bedrock geology, topography, and local climate. Third, annual time-series are used to derive 30-year climatologies and recurrence intervals of extreme events (including multi-year droughts) at the scale of small watersheds and conservation parcels/networks. We take a “scenario-neutral” approach where thresholds are defined for system “failure,” such as water supply shortfalls or drought mortality/vegetation transitions, and the time-window for hitting those thresholds is evaluated across all selected climate projections. San Francisco Bay Area examples include drought thresholds (CWD) for specific vegetation-types that identify leading/trailing edges and local refugia, evaluation of hydrologic resources (recharge and runoff) provided by conservation lands, and productivity of rangelands (AET). BCM outputs for multiple futures are becoming available to resource managers through on-line data extraction tools. This approach has wide applicability to numerous resource management issues.",

            "abstract": "The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission will provide soil moisture at 3, 9, and 36 km scales through the use of radar and radiometer data. To validate SMAP products, in-situ sensors are required. Typically, validation plans consist of several sensors installed nearly uniformly in the scene. To upscale the soil moisture estimates to the scales of SMAP products requires a large number of sensors, distributed throughout the instrument footprint. Even for the higher resolution SMAP products (3 km) there are often insufficient sensors available within a resolution cell.\nThe Soil moisture Sensing Controller and oPtimal Estimator (SoilSCAPE) project provides a new adaptive validation strategy, including upscaled estimates of soil moisture. By utilizing smarter network technology and optimized sensor placement, more representative measurements of soil moisture are obtained, at a range of spatial scales with lower costs than traditional networks. A large network was established around the Tonzi Ranch site in central California. The network design comprises multiple sites, each with a 10-30 node cluster taking measurements from up to 4 sensors installed at different depths. The nodes wirelessly communicate to a Local Coordinator, which collects data and transmits to a server (http://soilscape.usc.edu). Each node can communicate with the Coordinator up to a distance of 400m. Each station supports up to 60 nodes. Currently 111 nodes have been installed over 6 sites.\nThe SoilSCAPE nonuniform placement of sensors requires novel upscaling methods. Previous studies have used regression, which works well when the measurement is well correlated with other variables. However, soil moisture dependence on various variables could be complex and nonlinear. To account for such complexities, we use the Random Forests algorithm, which is capable of modeling complex non-linear system and can handle continuous and categorical data. The algorithm has not previously been applied to upscale estimates of soil moisture. Using AirMOSS P-band radar data and other data layers we describe a technique for upscaling in-situ soil moisture data from the SoilSCAPE network to a range of resolutions for the SMAP mission. The method and results will be presented, including the latest advances and enabling data products from SoilSCAPE.",

            "abstract": "In June 2012, the High Park Fire west of Fort Collins, CO burned 350 km2 of steep forested terrain, leading to elevated runoff and erosion in watersheds draining the burned area. Under the auspices of a NSF RAPID grant we began monitoring precipitation, hillslope-scale sediment production, stream stage, and channel geomorphic change in Skin Gulch and Hill Gulch, two 15 km2 watersheds within the High Park Fire. Short-duration summer thunderstorms are typically the dominant cause of post-fire runoff and erosion in the central and southern Rocky Mountains, but in September 2013 an extreme, long duration storm dropped more than 200 mm of rain in 48 hours. This storm provided a unique opportunity to compare the hydrologic and geomorphic effects of smaller summer thunderstorms to those of the long duration, high magnitude September event. Mean June-August 2013 precipitation in these watersheds was 125 mm, less than half the total for the September 2013 event, but this summer precipitation led to a mean sediment yield of 8 Mg ha-1, about double the mean sediment yield of the much larger September storm. Hillslope sediment production was highest during summer storms that were shorter duration but had higher 5-15 minute precipitation intensities than the September storm. These localized summer 2013 storms led to flashy pulses of flow in the channel network that caused relatively small amounts of channel aggradation or incision. In contrast, the September 2013 event produced sustained high flows that led to substantial geomorphic change throughout the channel network, with more than 2 m of aggradation at the outlet of Skin Gulch. These results indicate that the high intensity summer thunderstorms were most effective at mobilizing sediment from hillslopes, but the more spatially uniform rainfall during the September event produced much more dramatic downstream channel geomorphic change.",

            "abstract": "Colombia has strict economic divisions, which may be represented by six strata assigned by the National Planning Department. These are assigned by housing conditions and are arranged such that the divisions with subpar living conditions (strata levels one through three) may receive support from those with better than acceptable living conditions (strata levels five and six). Notably, division three no longer receives aid, and division four neither contributes to this system nor receives support. About ten percent of the population is in the upper three strata, while the remaining populace experiences subpar living conditions.\nBogotá, DC has poor air quality that sometimes puts sensitive populations at risk due to particulate matter (PM). The local environmental agency has developed seven strategies to reduce air pollution, predominantly by regulating fixed and mobile sources, for the promotion of public health. Preliminary mapping of results indicates there may be higher concentrations of pollutants in areas whose residents are of a lower socioeconomic status (SES). Because it’s more difficult for impoverished people to miss work or afford healthcare, higher exposure could have more significance for the city’s overall health burden.\nThe aim of this project is to determine the effective impactful regulatory strategy for the benefit of public health as a result of emission reductions. This will be done by using CMAQ results and BenMAP with information for long-term relative risk estimates for PM to find premature mortality rates per source type and location, segregated by strata division. A statistical regression will define the correspondence between health impact and SES. The benefit per reduction will be given in premature mortalities avoided per ton of PM emissions reduced per source type.\nFor each of seven proposed regulatory strategies, this project provides results in mortalities avoided per ton of emissions of PM reduced per source type. It also compares these results against the strata divisions to analyze the correspondence between SES and exposure to air pollution. Because there are many industrial facilities close to residential areas of the lower three strata, it’s predicted that fixed sources are the main contributor to health impacts for citizens of a lower SES.",

In order to constrain the core compositions of those bodies from observed and future-planned seismic data, sound velocity and density of the core material, i.e., liquid Fe-alloy, are necessary. In this study, we have performed simultaneous measurements on these physical properties of liquid Fe-Ni–Si alloys, which is one of the major candidates for the core constituent. The effects of pressure and Si content on these properties were studied.\nHigh pressure experiments were performed using 80-ton uniaxial press designed for CT measurement or 180-ton cubic type multi-anvil press installed at BL20XU and BL22XU beamlines of SPring-8 synchrotron facility, respectively. Used samples were Fe-Ni-Si with Si content of 10-30 at%. The sample pellet was sandwiched by the single crystal sapphire buffer rod for sound velocity measurement. P-wave sound velocity was measured using pulse-echo overlapping ultrasonic method. LiNbO3 transducer was attached to the backside of the anvil to generate and receive elastic wave signals. Density was determined based on 3D volume data obtained from CT measurement or X-ray absorption profile.\nThe P-wave velocity (VP) and density of liquid Fe-Ni-Si were successfully measured up to 2.5 GPa and 1773 K. Obtained VP of the Fe-Ni-Si is found to increase rapidly with pressure below 1 GPa and increase gradually above 1 GPa. It is also found that VP increases slightly with Si content on the density-VP plot. These trends provide a constraint on the core composition of the planets and moon by comparing with observed data.",

            "abstract": "As the limiting nutrient in warming high latitude ecosystems, nitrogen (N) is expected to play a key role in determining the future balance between permafrost carbon (C) losses and increased C sequestration by plants. During decomposition, nitrogen previously locked in soil organic matter is released into the soil solution in the form of dissolved organic molecules following depolymerization by extracellular enzymes. These dissolved organic forms of N can be consumed by the soil microbial community and incorporated in their biomass or mineralized if they are in excess of microbial demand. Once mineralized and released into the soil solutions, N can be lost from the soil system via denitrification. In well drained, low N tussock tundra, however, this pathway is unlikely. Dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and dissolved organic N (DON) are both biologically available to arctic plants. Understanding how the size of these pools changes with depth and continuing decomposition is therefore crucial to projecting the C balance of high latitude systems in a warmer future. N transformations associated with decomposition may differ greatly in surface soils, where a large labile C pool is present and soil has a high C:N ratio, versus deep soils that have a relatively small labile C pool and a lower C:N ratio. In this experiment, the relationship between N availability and C release from permafrost soils was addressed with a 225 day soil incubation performed at 15°C. Seven soil cores were collected from undisturbed, well drained tussock tundra and were partitioned into ten centimeter depth intervals to a depth of 80 cm. Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured throughout the incubation period and were used to assess cumulative carbon losses and determine the size of the labile C pool. Destructive harvests at days 16,34,55,83, 143 and 225 were performed and pools of plant available DON and DIN were measured using 2M KCl extractions. At day 225 the microbial biomass N pool was also measured. Permafrost soils at 55-85cm depths exhibited higher initial (4.4 mg N/gN) and late stage DIN pools (6.9 mg/gN at day 143) than active layer soils at 0-55cm depths (0.4 mgN/gN initial DIN, 2.4 mgN/gN at day 143). The size of the labile C pool decreased with depth, and larger labile N pools delayed the release of plant available N forms from the SOM.",

            "abstract": "Expected climate impacts of future warming in the Arctic include thawing of permafrost landscapes in northern latitudes. Thawing permafrost is expected to have major consequences on hydrological dynamics, which will affect the limnological conditions of Arctic lakes and ponds. In this study we obtained a sediment core from a small lake (informally named “FM1”) near Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories, Canada, with a large retrogressive thaw slump (nearly 1 kilometre in diameter) within its catchment. A radiocarbon date from the base of the FM1 sediment core suggests the lake formed between 990-1160 Cal AD. The analysis of aerial photographs indicate the thaw slump initiated between 1970-1990, and sediment geochemistry analysis indicated major changes in sediment content at 54-cm sediment core depth. Analyses of subfossil midge (Chironomidae) fossils inferred that, pre-slump, lake FM1 was shallow with a large bog or wetland environment, with midge assemblages dominated by taxa such as Limnophyes and Parametriocnemus. Post-thaw midge assemblages were dominated by subfamily Chironominae (Tribe Tanytarsini and Tribe Chironomini) taxa, and the appearance of deepwater-associated taxa such as Sergentia suggests that lake FM1 deepened, possibly as a result of alluvial damming from slump materials washing into the lake near its outlet. Most recent stratigraphic intervals infer a reversion back to shallower conditions, with a slight recovery of bog or wetland-associated midge taxa, possibly due to rapid basin infilling from increased deposition rates of catchment-derived materials. Results emphasize that there may be a variety of different outcomes to Arctic lake and pond ecosystems as a result of permafrost thawing, contingent on system-specific characteristics such as slump location relative to the lake basin, and relative inflow and outflow locations within the lake basin.",

            "abstract": "Among all remote sensing environment monitoring techniques, time series analysis of biophysical index is drawing increasing attention. Although many of them studied forest disturbance and land cover change detection, few focused on urban growth mapping at medium spatial resolution. As Landsat archive becomes open accessible, methods using Landsat time-series imagery to detect urban growth is possible.\nIt is found that a time trajectory from a newly developed urban area shows a dramatic drop of vegetation index. This enable the utilization of time trajectory analysis to distinguish impervious surface and crop land that has a different temporal biophysical pattern. Also, the time of change can be estimated, yet many challenges remain. Landsat data has lower temporal resolution, which may be worse when cloud-contaminated pixels and SLC-off effect exist. It is difficult to tease apart intra-annual, inter-annual, and land cover difference in a time series.\nHere, several methods of time trajectory analysis are utilized and compared to find a computationally efficient and accurate way on urban growth detection. A case study city, Ankara, Turkey is chosen for its arid climate and various landscape distributions. For preliminary research, Landsat TM and ETM+ scenes from 1998 to 2002 are chosen. NDVI, EVI, and SAVI are selected as research biophysical indices. The procedure starts with a seasonality filtering. Only areas with seasonality need to be filtered so as to decompose seasonality and extract overall trend. Harmonic transform, wavelet transform, and a pre-defined bell shape filter are used to estimate the overall trend in the time trajectory for each pixel. The point with significant drop in the trajectory is tagged as change point. After an urban change is detected, forward and backward checking is undertaken to make sure it is really new urban expansion other than short time crop fallow or forest disturbance.\nThe method proposed here can capture most of the urban growth during research time period, although the accuracy of time point determination is a bit lower than this. Results from several biophysical indices and filtering methods are similar. Some fallows and bare lands in arid area are easily confused with urban impervious surface.",

            "abstract": "Total alkalinity (AT) is an important component of the marine inorganic carbon system that, together with one of the other measurable parameters (i.e., pH, dissolved inorganic carbon-CT , pCO2) allows us to calculate the entire CO2-carbonic acid system. By measuring AT continuously at several coastal locations on coral reefs of Oahu, we can calculate a current rate of change in surface water conditions with respect to biogeochemical processes as well as the globally important issue of ocean acidification (OA). Previous work by Drupp et al (2011, 2013) has shown that parameters of the CO2-carbonic acid system display seasonal fluctuations as well as respond to short term rainfall events. This work expands the period of study through July 2014. The three sampling locations are vastly different in geographic and geochemical conditions. Kaneohe Bay is a protected embayment, with large freshwater inputs and long water residence time compared to the nearshore exposed waters at Kilo Nalu and Ala Wai. Variation in coral reef environments affect AT, thus making it crucial to sample multiple environments over an extended period of time to reveal changes in biogeochemistry. A typical sample from Kaneohe Bay (CRIMP-2) can be expected to have a AT value between 2134 umol/kg and 2279 umol/kg, Kilo Nalu: between 2263 umol/kg and 2350 umol/kg, Ala Wai: between 2263 umol/kg and 2335 umol/kg. In general, total alkalinity values from CRIMP-2 are lower than at Kilo Nalu or Ala Wai due to differences in coral reef environments. Our long-term record allows us to compare the behavior of Hawaiian reef waters to those of other tropical marine ecosystems. Furthermore, monitoring of AT over extended multiple years and multiple locations is essential to develop the time-series data necessary for continued evaluation of the impact of OA on coral reefs of the Hawaiian Islands.",

            "abstract": "Crop production is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climatic variability and change. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and other greenhouse gases are causing increases in global temperature. In western North America, water supply is largely derived from mountain snowmelt. Climate change will have a significant impact on mountain snowpack and subsequently, the snow-derived water supply. This will strain water supplies and increase water demand in areas with substantial irrigation agriculture. Increasing temperatures may create heat stress for some crops regardless of soil water supply, and increasing surface O3 and other pollutants may damage crops and ecosystems. CO2 fertilization may or may not be an advantage in future.\nThis work is part of a larger study that will address a series of questions based on a range of future climate scenarios for several watersheds in western North America. The key questions are: (1) how will snowmelt and rainfall runoff vary in future; (2) how will seasonal and inter-annual soil water supply vary, and how might that impacts food supplies; (3) how might heat stress impact (some) crops even with adequate soil water; (4) will CO2 fertilization alter crop yields; and (5) will pollution loads, particularly O3, cause meaningful changes to crop yields?\nThe Generate Earth Systems Science (GENESYS) Spatial Hydrometeorological Model is an innovative, efficient, high-resolution model designed to assess climate driven changes in mountain snowpack derived water supplies. We will link GENESYS to the CROPWAT crop model system to assess climate driven changes in water requirement and associated crop productivity for a range of future climate scenarios. Literature bases studies will be utilised to develop approximate crop response functions for heat stress, CO2 fertilization and for O3 damages. The overall objective is to create modeling systems that allows meaningful assessment of agricultural productivity at a watershed scale under a range of climate scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The deep geological disposal system is regarded as the most secure and practical disposal method of high-level radioactive waste in the world. In this disposal system, preservation of reducing condition is one of the key requirements, because most of radionuclides have low solubilities in such condition. However, the host rocks near the shafts and galleries would be affected by oxidization during the construction and operation period of a repository (for about 50 years). Therefore, the recovery of reducing condition after closing the repository should be verified. During the recovery processes, it is considered that microbial activities play important roles, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we monitored the changes in microbial communities by molecular method to evaluate microbial response toward the oxygen stress. The groundwater samples were collected from a borehole of 250 m depth at the Horonobe Underground Research Laboratory, for two years immediately after drilling of a borehole without any contamination as much as possible. Immediately after drilling of the borehole, the phylotype related to Arcobacter spp. was dominated about 65 % of the total clone library. Arcobacter spp. is known as sulfide oxidizer and which can growth chemoautotrophically. Half a year later, the phylotype related to Azoarcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. known as nitrate reducing bacteria increased, instead of the phylotype related to Arcobacter spp. One year later, in addition to nitrate reducing bacteria, phylotype related to Dethiobacterspp. known as thiosulfate reducing bacteria was dominantly detected. Two years later, most of detected clones were related to uncultured species such as candidate division WS6 and JS1 which are detected frequently in deep-sea sediments. Our results indicate that these redox sequential reactions could contribute to the recovery and maintenance of reducing conditions and provide a conceptual model for evaluating the capacity to recover reducing conditions in subsurface environments after final geological disposal and the post-closure.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from surface litter has been thought to make a major contribution to mineral soil C stores; however, several recent studies have argued that little of the DOC solubilized from surface litter reaches the subsoil directly. We investigated the potential for surface-litter C to contribute to deep-soil C stores in coarse-textured forest soils in northern Michigan, USA. We instrumented six soil profiles, three under coniferous vegetation and three under deciduous vegetation, and measured the quantity and composition of DOC percolating through soil for two years. We used spectroscopic (specific UV absorbance), stable-isotope (natural abundance 13C) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pyGCMS) analysis of DOC and solid soil samples to assess the degree to which surface-litter C was transported directly through soil vs. the degree to which it exchanged with DOC derived from in situ soil organic C (SOC). All three approaches indicated that surface organic horizons were the source of the majority of DOC entering the B horizon, with little contribution from desorbed SOC en route. Over two years of measurement, we estimate the direct transfer of surface-litter C to the B horizon ranged from 25 g m-2 to 48 g m-2. Interestingly, we observed a strong relationship between the degree of soil development and the composition of DOC entering the B horizon: surface-litter derived C contributed approximately 80% of the DOC entering the B horizon in the most weakly developed profile compared to >95% in the most well-developed profile. This occurred despite the increasing pathlength (i.e. thicker E horizons) associated with increasing spodic development. These findings indicate that the loss of reactive minerals and organic C in the upper profile of well-developed Spodosols promotes the direct transfer of surface C to depth, with little potential for dynamic exchange with in situ SOC.",

Aquarius data recorded at northern and southern latitudes higher than 50 degrees were averaged and gridded into weekly products of: a) Brightness Temperature (TB); b) Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS); and c) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Additionally, each grid cell contains sea ice fraction and the standard deviation of TB, NRCS, and SSS along with the number of footprint observations/retrievals obtained during the seven-day cycle. These products are distributed on the version 2.0 of the Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE2.0) grid, with a grid cell resolution of 36 km. Since July 2014, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center archives and distributes the products, starting in August 2011 with the first Aquarius observations. The data sets are updated on a monthly basis following the release schedule of the Level 2 data sets.

However, the evolution of the physicochemical properties of the aerosol during transport and the potential impact of this evolution on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity has rarely been studied for these events. During the DOE-sponsored Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) conducted in the summer and fall of 2013, over 30 research flights sampled biomass burning plumes from wildfires in the Northwestern United States and agricultural burns in the Mid-South region of the United States.\nA large suite of instruments aboard the DOE G-1 (Gulfstream-1) measured the chemical, physical, and optical properties of biomass burning aerosol with an emphasis on black carbon. A Fast Integrated Mobility Spectrometer (FIMS), Ultra High Sensitivity Aerosol Spectrometer - Airborne (UHSAS-A), and Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer (PCASP) were used to measure the aerosol size distribution from 15 – 3,000 nm at 1-Hz. A dual column CCN counter measured the CCN number concentration at supersaturations of 0.25% and 0.50% at a time resolution of 1-Hz and the aerosol chemical composition was measured using a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS, Aerodyne, Inc). The SP-AMS was operated in two modes: (i) as a traditional high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS, Aerodyne Inc.), which measured chemical composition of non-refractory aerosols and (ii) as the SP-AMS which measured chemical composition of the refractory black carbon-containing (rBC) particle coating and rBC aerosol mass. Utilizing the aforementioned measurements, a CCN closure study is used to investigate the emitted aerosol hygroscopicity, the evolution of the physicochemical properties of the aerosol, and the potential impacts on cloud microphysics from the different fuel sources.",

            "abstract": "The Great Lakes are a highly valued freshwater resource of the United States and Canada. The Lakes are the focus of a science-based restoration program, known as the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). Physical and chemical factors, such as inflows and nutrient loads to the Great Lakes can affect ecosystem function, contribute to the spread of invasive species and increase the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Since about 1999, water levels in Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron have been at or below the long-term average (1918 to present). Analyses of streamflow trends for the period 1960 to 2012 in watersheds draining into Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron showed a long-term decline in average inflows, which helps to explain the persistently below-average lake levels. Recent climatic conditions of October 2013 to August 2014 have contributed to a rapid rise in lake levels, most notably in Lake Superior. Lake Superior recently reached an elevation of 602.56 feet above sea level in August 2014, which is the highest level in 17 years. Coincident with this recovery was the development of a large algal bloom in Lake Erie in August of 2014 that shut down the Toledo, Ohio municipal water supply. These anomalous, extreme deviations from long-term average lake levels will be examined to better understand the forcing factors that contributed to changes in inflow volumes and lake-levels. Particular focus will be given to the climatology of years when changes in lake levels are most pronounced, such as; the measured lake-level declines during 1964-1965 and 1998-2000; and lake-level rises during 1973-1974, 1987-1989, and 2013-2014. The climatology of years with periods of algal blooms will also be examined such as, 2003, 2008, 2011 and 2014.",

One such concept is the novel radar architecture compatible with the 6U CubeSat class that is being developed at JPL by exploiting simplification and miniaturization of the radar subsystems. The RaInCube architecture would significantly reduce the number of components, power consumption and mass with respect to existing spaceborne radars. The baseline RaInCube instrument configuration would be a fixed nadir-pointing profiler at Ka-band with a minimum detectable reflectivity better than +10 dBZ at 250m range resolution and 5 km horizontal resolution.\nThe low cost nature of the RaInCube platform would enable deployment of a constellation of identical copies of the same instrument in various relative positions in LEO to address specific observational gaps left open by the current missions that require high-resolution vertical profiling capability. A constellation of only four RaInCubes would populate the precipitation statistics in a distributed fashion across the globe and across the times of day, and therefore, would enable substantially better sampling of the diurnal cycle statistics.\nOne could extend this scheme by adding more RaInCubes in each of the orbital planes, and phase them once in orbit so that they would be separated by an arbitrary amount of time among them. Wide separations (say 20-30 min) would further extend the sampling of the diurnal cycle to sub-hourly scales. Narrower time separations between RaInCubes would allow studying the evolution of convective systems at the convective time scale in each region of interest and would reveal the dominant modes of evolution of each corresponding climatological regime.\nA constellation of RaInCubes would also be a natural complement to other resources aiming at monitoring the evolution of weather systems, for example the Geostationary IR/VIS imagers, the NEXRAD network, and the GPM constellation.",

            "abstract": "Most organic aerosol is secondary, formed by oxidation of primary gas-phase chemicals whose products condense into particles. While gas-particle partitioning is known to depend in part on the volatility of a compound, the process is poorly understood and largely unconstrained by compound-specific measurements. We directly measured gas-to-particle partitioning of over 250 semi-volatile organic compounds during the SOAS campaign in rural Alabama in the summer of 2013, and compare to a partitioning model based on their calculated vapor pressures and chemical properties. All data were collected using an SVTAG (Semi-Volatile Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph) which uses two parallel cells to collect gas- and particle-phase organic compounds with volatilities lower than tridecane. By using an activated carbon denuder to remove all gas-phase compounds from one channel, gas-particle partitioning is directly measured on an hourly timescale. Derivatization with MSTFA, a silylating agent, allows analysis of highly oxygenated compounds that have not previously been analyzed by in-situ GC methods. Internal standards are used to correct all compounds for instrument variability in order to remove instrument biases between sampling channels, and compounds lacking temporal variability are not reported so as to exclude any internal contaminant compounds. Chemical characteristics of each compound (i.e. number of derivatized hydroxyl groups) were inferred from their mass spectra using a model we built from data in an available NIST mass spectral database. Based on chromatographic retention time and chemical characteristics we model the vapor pressures of measured compounds to within the error of current structure-activity models (i.e. SIMPOL). Measured partitioning for all observed compounds is compared to partitioning predicted from their estimated vapor pressures. While current models adequately describe the partitioning of some compounds, a large fraction of observed species are found to deviate from expectation based on environmental factors and chemical characteristics. Chemical dependence is expected in part due to the possible formation of low-volatility particle phase oligomers and organosulfates, which may decompose into smaller, more volatile fragments in the desorption process.",

            "abstract": "Dry wells are gravity-fed, excavated pits with perforated casings used to facilitate stormwater infiltration and groundwater recharge in areas comprised primarily of impermeable surfaces or low permeability soils. Stormwater runoff that would otherwise be routed to streams or drains in urban areas is used as a source of aquifer recharge. However, the potential for groundwater contamination caused by urban runoff bypassing surface soil filtration has prevented more widespread use of dry wells as a recharge mechanism. We present the results of a literature survey to assess the potential of dry wells for safe stormwater recharge. Dry wells have been inculpated in groundwater contamination events, although accusations were typically not backed by scientific data. In 1989 groundwater in Modesto, CA, was contaminated with tetrachloroethylene from a dry cleaning facility. The city had been using dry wells to manage stormwater for more than 50 years without detrimental impacts before the contamination. A USGS monitoring study proved that the contamination was from sewer system leakage, and did not involve the dry wells. Some areas of the country have used dry wells with positive results. The Underground Injection Control system (UICs) study in Portland, OR, has been active for ten years, and currently operates over 9,000 UICs. Initially, a ten foot separation distance was enforced between the seasonal high water table and the bottom perforation of the UIC; however, due to monitoring and modeling results that indicate the protectiveness of groundwater, this distance has been reduced to zero feet. Future work will include a comparative pilot study involving a residential and an industrial site in Elk Grove, CA. The study will use modeling tools to assess the recharge potential and groundwater protectiveness of dry wells. Both sites are outfitted with four monitoring wells each: an upgradient monitoring well, two downgradient monitoring wells, and a vadose zone monitoring well. The results of water quality sampling will determine the contaminants of interest, and a model of the fate and transport of these contaminants in the vadose zone will be coupled with hydraulic models to estimate the response of the hydrogeologic system to dry well recharge, with the goal of creating a tool that can be used to evaluate future dry well locations.",

            "abstract": "We report progress on a project to create a detailed map of in situ stress orientations and relative magnitudes throughout the state of Oklahoma. It is well known that the past 5 years has seen a remarkable increase in seismicity in much of the state, potentially related to waste water injection. The purpose of this project is to attempt to utilize detailed knowledge of the stress field to identify which pre-existing faults could be potentially active in response to injection-related pore pressure increases. Over 50 new stress orientations have been obtained, principally utilizing wellbore image data provided by the oil and gas industry. These data reveal a very uniform ENE direction of maximum compressive stress through much of the state. As earthquake focal plane mechanisms indicate strike-slip faulting, the stress orientation data indicate which pre-existing faults are potentially active. The data are consistent with slip on the near-vertical, NE-trending fault associated with at least one of the M 5+ earthquakes in the Prague, OK sequence in 2011. If successful, it would demonstrate that combining detailed information about pre-existing faults and the current stress field could be used to guide the siting of injection wells so as to decrease the potential for injection-related seismicity.",

However, unintended leakage of CO2 leakage from storage sites could occur through highly permeable conduits such as fractures in low-K formations during the injection and storage of SCCO2 (supercritical phase CO2). Therefore, prediction and detection of CO2 leakage and relevant analysis of carbon isotope are crucial to assure environmental and public safety.\nUntil recently, Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) has been utilized to measure the stable isotope ratio of water. However, IRMS is time-consuming operation due to complicated pretreatment, and thus not a practical methodology under field conditions.\nCarbon Isotope Analyzer (CCIA), which is a kind of Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) and has a wide measurement range from 300 to 25000 ppmv, can facilitate the rate of measurements up to 1 Hz by using continuous flow method so that it can be readily applied to field. In this study, carbon stable isotope ratio of groundwater will be analyzed using CCIA. Then, the CCIA results will be compared with IRMS to validate its accuracy and stability. This research will provide an appropriate method for analyzing carbon stable isotope in groundwater, using a continuous flow mode.",

            "abstract": "The El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a variation in the sea surface temperature (SST) in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, and corresponding air surface pressure in the tropical western Pacific. During El Niño events (high SST), some global regions are wetter than normal, and others are dryer than normal. The inverse is true of La Niña events. El-Niño events are strongly correlated with drought extent and severity, especially in the Tropics. La Niña events are correlated with drought in other areas, though the global effect is less significant than that of El-Niños. GCM-based studies exploring changes in atmospheric mechanisms suggest that El Niño events may become more frequent in the next century, while those exploring changes in oceanic mechanisms suggest that La-Niñas may become more frequent. Overall, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report concludes that there is “low confidence” in our ability to project future ENSO patterns. In order to test the effect of changing ENSO patterns on global food production, we have developed a Markov Chain to generate multiple scenarios of ENSO frequency and strength, and explore each generated timeseries using the IMPACT Model, which is designed to examine alternative futures for global food supply, demand, trade, prices, and food security. Results identify the potential consequences of changes in ENSO patterns on global food production and markets.",

            "abstract": "Biochar is composed of any carbonaceous matter pyrolyzed under low oxygen exposure. Its use as a soil amendment to address soil infertility has been accelerated by studies reporting positive effects of enhanced nutrient retention, cation exchange capacity, microbial activity, and vegetative growth over time. Biochar has also been considered as a carbon sequestration method because of its reported environmental persistence. While the aforementioned effects are positive benefits of biochar’s use, its impact on soil physical properties and water flow are equally important in maintaining soil fertility. This study aims to show how soil physical and hydraulic properties change over time with biochar addition. To address these aims, we conducted a 9 week microcosm incubation experiment with local arable loamy sand soils amended with biochar. Biochar was created from locally collected almond shells and differs by pyrolysis temperatures (350°C, 700°C) and size (<250 μm, 1-2mm). Additionally, biochar was applied to soil at a low (10 t/ha) or high (60 t/ha) rates. Changes in soil water flow properties were analyzed by infiltration or pressure cell experiments immediately after creating our soil-biochar mixtures. These experiments were repeated during and after the incubation period to observe if and how flow is altered over time. Following incubation and hydraulic experiments, a water drop penetration time (WDPT) test was conducted to observe any alterations in surface hydrophobicity. Changes in soil physical properties were analyzed by determining content of water stable aggregates remaining after wet sieving. This series of experiments is expected to provide a greater understanding on the impact biochar addition on soil physical and hydraulic properties. Furthermore, it provides insight into whether or not converting local agricultural waste into biochar for soil use will be beneficial, especially in agricultural systems undergoing climate stress.",

The epicenters were 110 km apart in the west margin of Bayan Har block and the western Altyn Tagh fault where the fault strike changes. These two earthquakes have different kinematics characteristics, the former one showed normal with sinistral slip components, while the latter one shows sinistral with normal slip components. The two earthquakes show their own special seismogenic structures which reflect the different dynamic mechanisms.\nThe surface ruptures of the 2008 Yutian earthquake is ~32 km long along the NS-trending western Pingdingshan fault where the altitude is above 5400 m. The surface rupture zone is charactered by normal slip with local sinistral strike-slip. The maximum vertical offset is ~5 m and the left-lateral slip is ~1.5 m, the maximum width of cracking is ~10 m. The northern part of the surface rupture zone extended to NNE and linked with NEE-trending Ashikule fault (a branch fault of western Altyn Tagh fault), which not only controls the latest volcanic activity in western Tibet, and also is one of the west margin faults which control the Tibet eastward extrusion.\nThe 2014 Yutian earthquake shows that it produced ~25 km long surface rupture along two NEE-trending parallel faults, the Ashikule fault and the south Xor Kol fault. The surface rupture zone consists of a series of en-echelon tensional, shear-tensional to shear cracks, mole-tracks, and sag ponds at an altitude of 4600~5100 m. The maximum left-lateral slip and vertical offset are ~1 m and ~0.4m, respectively. The seismogenic fault of the earthquake is splay at the southwestern end of the Altyn Tagh fault. This fault combined with the Guozha Co and the Longmu Co faults constitutes a “new Altyn Tagh fault”.\nThese two Yutian earthquakes were caused by the India-Eurasia collision which fits the eastward escape of the Bayan Har block, which are the response of the different dynamics and deformation process in western Altyn Tagh. These surface rupture pattern supports the eastward block-like motion model whose deformation takes place mainly along the block boundaries delineated by mega-strike slip faults in the north Tibet.",

            "abstract": "The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) has exceeded a decade in length. It is, thus, desirable to evaluate how well the time series captures inter-annual variability of vegetation phenology. Previous studies calculated a two-band version of the EVI (EVI2) from tower radiation flux data and used it to validate satellite VI time series. Differences in view angle, bandpass, and spatial representativeness between flux and satellite data, however, may lead to landcover-dependent biases when they are compared directly. The objective of this study was to validate long-term consistency of MODIS EVI time series with radiation flux-derived EVI2 time series by comparing phenological metrics derived from these datasets.\nTen years of MODIS EVI and ground-based EVI2 (Tower EVI2) were obtained for 10 AmeriFlux sites. Asymmetric double logistic functions were fitted to each of VIs, from which SOSs were derived. After the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the derived SOSs, the standard deviation (SD) in horizontal direction (inter-annual variability) was compared with SD in perpendicular direction (differences) to assess consistency of MODIS EVI in tracking vegetation dynamics.\nTemporal profiles of MODIS EVI showed analogous patterns with those of tower EVI2 across five biomes although site specific differences were seen in the VI amplitude. Cross plots of SOS from MODIS and Tower VIs closely aligned to the 1:1 line (slope > 0.865, R2>0.896). The SD in inter-annual variability (≈ 20 days) was more than twice larger than the SD of SOS difference averaged for five biomes (≈ 9 days). MODIS consistently captured SOSs with 2.7-4.9-day differences at deciduous broad leaf forest and clopland sites, and also agreed well at a wooded savanna site (< 6 days). Grassland sites showed more than a week difference due to a failure in model fitting of the year with subtle VI amplitude and the year with multiple growing seasons.\nThese results indicate that MODIS EVI time series was capable to capture long-term variability in surface vegetation dynamics at four biomes other than arid grassland in North America. Further efforts on data screening and fitting on multiple growing seasons could improve results on arid grassland sites.",

Soil protozoa are relatively understudied, especially given the strong control they exert on bacterial communities through predation. Here, ciliate communities in soils of contrasting textures were investigated. Two ciliate-specific primer sets targeting the 18S rRNA gene were used to amplify DNA extracted from eight soil samples collected from Sumter National Forest in western South Carolina. Primer sets 121F-384F-1147R (semi-nested) and 315F-959R were used to amplify soil ciliate DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the resulting PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis to obtain quantity and band size. Approximately two hundred ciliate 18S rRNA sequences were obtained were obtained from each of two contrasting soils. Sequences were aligned against the NCBI GenBank database for identification, and the taxonomic classification of best-matched sequences was determined. The ultimate goal of the work is to quantify changes in the ciliate community under short-timescale changes in hydrologic conditions for varying soil textures, elucidating dynamic responses to desiccation stress in major soil ciliate taxa.",

            "abstract": "Recent trends and projections for future change for the U.S. northern forests suggest that the region’s climate is becoming warmer, wetter, and, ironically, drier, with more precipitation occurring as large events, separated by longer periods with no precipitation. However, to date, precipitation manipulation experiments conducted in forest ecosystems represent only ~5% of all such experiments worldwide, and our understanding of how the mesic-adapted northern forest will respond to greater frequency and intensity of drought in the future is especially poor. Several important challenges have hampered previous research efforts to conduct forest drought experiments and draw robust conclusions, including difficulties in reducing water uptake by deep and lateral tree roots, logistical and financial constraints to establishing and maintaining large-scale field experiments, and the lack of standardized approaches for determining the appropriate precipitation manipulation treatment (e.g., amount and timing of throughfall displacement), designing and constructing the throughfall displacement infrastructure, identifying key response variables, and collecting and analyzing the field data. The overarching goal of this project is to establish a regional research coordination network – Northern Forest DroughtNet – to investigate the impacts of changes in the amount and distribution of precipitation on the hydrology, biogeochemistry, and carbon (C) cycling dynamics of northern temperate forests. Specific objectives include the development of a standard prototype for conducting precipitation manipulation studies in forest ecosystems (in collaboration with the international DroughtNet-RCN) and the implementation of this prototype drought experiment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Here, we present the advances made thus far towards achieving the objectives of Northern Forest DroughtNet, plans for future work, and an invitation to the larger scientific community interested in precipitation manipulation experiments in forest ecosystems to participate in the network.",

            "abstract": "We have observed electrical signals excited by and moving along with an acoustic pulse propagating in a sandstone sample. Using resonance we are now studying the characteristics of this acousto-electric signal and determining its origin and the controlling physical parameters. Four rock samples with a range of porosities, permeabilities, and mineralogies were chosen: Berea, Boise, and Colton sandstones and Austin Chalk. Pore water salinity was varied from deionized water to sea water. Ag-AgCl electrodes were attached to the sample and were interfaced to a 4-wire electrical resistivity system. Under computer control, the acoustic signals were excited and the electrical response was recorded. We see strong acoustically-induced electrical signals in all samples, with the magnitude of the effect for each rock getting stronger as we move from the 1st to the 3rd harmonics in resonance. Given a particular fluid salinity, each rock has its own distinct sensitivity in the induced electrical effect. For example at the 2nd harmonic, Berea Sandstone produces the largest electrical signal per acoustic power input even though Austin Chalk and Boise Sandstone tend to resonate with much larger amplitudes at the same harmonic. Two effects are potentially responsible for this acoustically-induced electrical response: one the co-seismic seismo-electric effect and the other a strain-induced resistivity change known as the acousto-electric effect. We have designed experimental tests to separate these mechanisms. The tests show that the seismo-electric effect is dominant in our studies. We note that these experiments are in a fluid viscosity dominated seismo-electric regime, leading to a simple interpretation of the signals where the electric potential developed is proportional to the local acceleration of the rock. Toward a test of this theory we have measured the local time-varying acoustic strain in our samples using a laser vibrometer.",

            "abstract": "In California, the majority of wildfires are started by humans, rather than by natural ignitions (i.e. lightning). Given this importance of human activity, it is logical that patterns of ignition should be related to social, as well as ecological factors. In this paper, we explore the relationship of ignition to human behavior at a fine temporal scale: days of the week. Because more people typically enter both wildlands and the wildland-urban interface on weekends, we hypothesized that more wildfires would start on Saturdays and Sundays than on other days of the week.\nWe used data from California’s Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) database for human-caused fires occurring from 1950 through 2009, and omitted those that would not reasonably relate to day of the week (e.g. “Power Line”). These criteria yielded a dataset of 8644 fires over the 60-year period.\nOverall, 15.5% of the fires began on Saturdays, and 16.4% began on Sundays. This compares to the 14.3% that would be expected if ignitions were evenly distributed through the week. However, different patterns of weekend ignition emerge depending on time period, specific fire cause, and the type of administrative unit in which the fires occurred.\nThe proportion of fires beginning on the weekend declined from a high in the 1950s (17.3% Saturdays, 18.5% Sundays) to a low in the 1990s (13.5% Saturdays, 14.4% Sundays), before rebounding in the 2000s to close to the long-term average (15.3% Saturdays, 16.8% Sundays). “Campfire” was the ignition source most concentrated on weekends, with 20.6% of the fires attributed to this cause starting on Saturdays, and 20.2% on Sundays. By contrast, “Equipment” was under-represented on the weekend (13.5% Saturdays, 13.9% Sundays). Fires in California State Parks clearly show a weekend bias, with 19.4% initiated on Saturdays, and 16.7% on Sundays. On National Forests, 15.5% of fires began on Saturdays, and 18.4% on Sundays. Many fires were on private land, much of which is inaccessible to weekend recreationists; here weekend ignitions were still overrepresented, but by smaller margins (15.0% Saturdays, 15.8% Sundays).\nOf note, the proportion of weekend ignitions was much higher among fires that eventually became quite large. 142 human-caused fires exceeded 10,000 ha in size; of these 26.1% began on Saturdays, and 19.7 began on Sundays.",

            "abstract": "The ring current responds differently to the different solar and interplanetary storm drivers such as coronal mass injections, (CME’s), corotating interaction regions (CIR’s), high-speed streamers and other structures. The resulting changes in the ring current particle pressure, in turn, change the global magnetic field, controlling the transport of the radiation belts. To quantitatively determine the field changes during a storm throughout the magnetosphere, it is necessary to understand the transport, sources and losses of the particles that contribute to the ring current. Because the measured ring current energy spectra depend not only on local processes, but also on the history of the ions along their entire drift path, measurements of ring current energy spectra at two or more locations can be used to strongly constrain the time dependent magnetic and electric fields. In this study we use data predominantly from the Cluster and the Van Allen Probes, covering more than a full solar cycle (from 2001 to 2014). For the period 2001-2012, the Cluster CODIF and RAPID measurements of the inner magnetosphere are the primary data set used to monitor the storm time ring current variability. After 2012, the Cluster data set complements the data from the Van Allen Probes HOPE and RBSPICE instruments, providing additional measurements from different MLT and L shells. Selected storms from this periods, allow us to study the ring current dynamics and pressure changes, as a function of L shell, magnetic local time, and the type of interplanetary disturbances.",

            "abstract": "While it is known that under some circumstances amending soil with biochar improves soil hydrologic properties, the mechanisms driving these improvements are not well-understood. This is a serious gap: without mechanism understanding, it is much harder to predict when biochar will improve soil properties. Grain size likely plays a key role in controlling biochar effects on water movement and storage, because grain size (of both biochar and soils) plays a major role in soil porosity. Here we report water potential of soil-biochar mixtures in the context of grain size and porosity measurements to better understand the mechanisms controlling how pores in biochar and soil store water. Our soil-biochar mixtures are sand (0.251-0.853 mm) with 2 wt% biochar; we used two separate biochar grain size ranges. Comparison of pure sand with biochar+sand mixtures shows a field capacity (θfc, water content at soil water potential = 33 kPa) increase from 0.014 to 0.027 kgwater/kgsoil+water (increase of 93%) when biochar is 0.251-0.853 mm (same size as sand) and a field capacity increase from 0.014 to 0.032 kgwater/kgsoil+water (increase of 129%) when biochar is 0.853-2.00 mm (larger than sand). Thus when biochar is larger than sand, θfc of biochar+sand mixtures (0.032 kgwater/kgsoil+water) is higher than θfc of biochar+sand mixtures (0.027 kgwater/kgsoil+water) when biochar is the same size as sand. Biochar+sand mixtures have interporosity (porosity between grains) and intraporosity (pores inside biochar particles). The average intraporosity of our biochars is 0.61±0.01 (61±1% of the biochar volume is pore space). Based our results we interpret that this intraporosity can store water and drives the increase of θfc for biochar-amended sand. Field capacity also increases with pore size decreases because smaller pores tend to hold water tightly due to higher capillary forces. The increase of θfc with increased biochar grain size may be caused by the bimodal particle size distribution in the mixture of large biochar particles and sand, which results in reduced pore sizes. Extensions of this research will include measuring the permanent wilting point (water content at soil water potential = 1500 kPa) of biochar+sand mixtures to investigate how increased water storage in biochar+sand mixtures may increase plant available water",

            "abstract": "Several studies have shown that Limited Area Models exhibit a substantial difference between the model’s horizontal grid and effective resolution. At the same time the effect of increased model resolution is small in comparison to the increased computing costs (approx. one order of magnitude for half grid size). In the recent years the computing power increased faster than the storage space, and higher order spatial discretisation schemes have the potential to increase the effective model resolution while the storage space needs remain constant and increasing the computational costs slightly.\nWe have implemented fully fourth order horizontal discretisation of the Euler equations in the NWP and RCM COSMO model with two variants of the advection term discretisations. The first is an extension of the model’s higher order discretisation by introducing fourth order interpolations of the advecting velocity in a staggered grid system denoted by N4. The second is a symmetric type discretisation of the advection term which can be shown to conserve the 1st and 2nd moments of the advected quantity if the continuity equation is satisfied, here referred to as S4. Both convective schemes can be combined with fourth order discretisation of the pressure gradient term, referred to as p4. The new fourth order discretisations are referred to as N4p4 and S4p4 and complement the already existing schemes A3p2, A4p2, A5p2 and A6p2. Here AXdenotes the central difference (2,4,6) and upwind (3,5) discretisation of the gradient of the advected velocity.\nUsing a 5-years long climate simulations over a European domain covering the complex terrain in the Alps region, we show that the new scheme S4p4 is more stable than the existing third order upwind scheme, and that the explicit numerical diffusion can be entirely avoided when using the new S4p4 scheme. By comparing the model's predicted with observed kinetic energy spectra, we show that the new fourth order schemes increases the model's effective resolution by at least a factor of two, and that by applying S4p4 scheme we achieve an effective resolution of 2Δx (where Δx is the model horizontal grid spacing). It is further shown that both implicit diffusion in upwind schemes and explicit numerical diffusion have diffusion effects of equal magnitude on kinetic energy at small scales.",

However, reconciling ambient observations with bottom-up emission inventories has proved challenging. In this study, we perform WRF-Chem modeling in the Los Angeles basin for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ozone (O3) over a long time period (1987-2010). To improve reconciliation of emission inventories with atmospheric observations, we incorporate new high-resolution emissions maps of a major to dominant source of urban air pollution, motor vehicles. A fuel-based approach is used to estimate motor vehicle emissions utilizing annual fuel sales reports, traffic count data that capture spatial and temporal patterns of vehicle activity, and pollutant emission factors measured from roadway studies performed over the last twenty years. We also update emissions from stationary sources using Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) data when available, and use emission inventories developed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and California Air Resources Board (ARB) for other important emission source categories. WRF-Chem modeling is performed in three years where field-intensive measurements were made: 1987 (SCAQS: Southern California Air Quality Study), 2002 (ITCT: Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation Study), and 2010 (CALNEX). We assess the ability of the improved bottom-up emissions inventory to predict long-term changes in ambient levels of CO, NOx, and O3, which are known to have occurred over this time period. We also assess changing spatial and temporal patterns of primary (CO and NOx) and secondary (O3) pollutant concentrations across the Los Angeles basin, which has important implications on human health.",

            "abstract": "Long-term permanent vegetation plots provide opportunities for in-depth examinations of forest dynamics and climate. We used Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) methodology to establish 4-ha forest dynamics plots in two contrasting climates on Hawaii Island. We established a montane wet forest dynamics plot in a site with 1150 m elevation, mean annual temperature (MAT) of 16.0 C, and mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 3440 mm. A second plot was established in a lowland dry forest site at 240 m elevation, 20.0 C MAT, and 835 mm MAP. The lowland wet forest site averaged only one month per year with < 100 mm rainfall (considered a dry season month), while the lowland dry forest had 12 dry season months. All trees greater or equal to 1 cm diameter were tagged, mapped, and followed from 2008/2009 to 2013/2014 as part of a 5-year census, and a subset of trees were measured annually. Climate variables measured were shortwave and longwave radiation, air temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, relative humidity, windspeed, soil moisture, and rainfall. At both sites, rainfall was the best predictor of annual growth rates. Rainfall and soil moisture were the two variables that demonstrated the greatest interannual variation; coefficients of variation were 36.7% and 61.6% for rainfall at the montane wet forest and lowland dry forest sites, respectively, and 13.4% and 66.1% for soil moisture at the two sites. Preliminary results from the five-year resurvey demonstrate that Hawaiian trees grow slowly, averaging 0.05 cm/y among 19 species in the montane wet forest, at much slower rates for the 15 species in the lowland dry forest plot. Preliminary mortality rates are 11.8% in the montane wet forest and 14.5% in the lowland dry forest. Forest dynamics appear highly related to water availability, even in wet forests, and are likely to be sensitive to climate change, under which reduced rainfall is predicted for much of the Hawaiian Islands.",

            "abstract": "Accurate attenuation corrections to the measurements of the Ku- and Ka-band dual-wavelength precipitation radar (DPR) aboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite is crucial for estimates of precipitation rate and microphysical properties of hydrometeors. Surface reference technique (SRT) provides a means to infer path-integrated attenuation (PIA) by comparing differences of normalized surface cross sections (σ0) between rain and rain-free areas. Although single-wavelength SRT has been widely used in attenuation correction for airborne/spaceborne radar applications, its accuracy relies on the variance of σ0 in rain-free region. Dual-wavelength surface reference technique (DSRT) has shown promising ways to improve accuracy in PIA estimates over single-wavelength as a result of that the variance of the difference of PIA between two wavelengths (δPIA) is much smaller than the variance of σ0 at single wavelength arising from high correlation of σ0 between Ku- and Ka-bands. However, derivation of PIA at either wavelength from DSRT requires an assumption of the ratio of Ka- and Ku-band PIAs (p). Inappropriate assumption of this ratio will lead to the bias of PIA estimates.\nIn this study the ratio p will be investigated through measured DSD data. The attenuation coefficients at Ku and Ka bands are first computed directly from measured DSD spectra, and then regression analysis is performed to the data points (Ku- and Ka-band attenuation coefficients) in obtaining p values for rain. Taking an advantage of large collection of the DSD measurements from various GPM Ground Validation (GPM GV) programs, the results of the ratio p will be examined from different climatological regimes. Because PIA is affected by all types of hydrometeors contained in the columns of radar measurements, the synthetic profiles composed of different types of hydrometeors are constructed using measured DSD to look into impacts of different phase hydrometeors on the p values. To generate these profiles fully-, partially- and un-correlated DSD data are employed in an attempt to describe wide dynamic range of microphysical structures of hydrometeors. Bright-band model is employed to take into account of mixed-phase region, and additional attenuations due to cloud water are also included in the profiles.",

            "abstract": "Major challenges in tropical meteorology include the short-term forecast of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, which is defined as the maximum tangential wind. Several efforts have been made in order to reach this goal over the last decade: Among these efforts, the study of lightning in the TC inner core (the region inside a disc of 100 km radius from the center) as a proxy to deep convection, has the potential to be used as a predictor to forecast intensity (DeMaria et al, 2012, Mon. Wea. Rev., 140, 1828-1842).\nWhile most studies focus their objectives in studying the lightning flash density in the inner core, we study the probability of flash occurrence for intensifying and weakening cyclones. We have analyzed the trajectories of the observed 62 tropical cyclones that developed in the basin from 2006 to 2009, and classified them into separate clusters according to their trajectories. These clusters can broadly be described as having trajectories mostly oriented: East-West, towards the central Pacific, NW far from the Mexican coast, parallel to the Mexican coast and recurving towards the Mexican coast.\nWe estimate that probability of inner core lightning occurrence increases as cyclones intensify but the probability rapidly decrease as the systems weaken. This is valid for cyclones in most of the clusters. However, the cyclones that exhibit trajectories that recurve towards the Mexican coast, do not present the same relationship between intensity and inner-core lightning probability, these cyclones show little or no decrease in the lightning occurrence probability as they weaken.\nWe hypothesize that one of the reasons for this anomalous behavior is likely the fact that these cyclones interact with mid-latitude systems. Mid-latitude systems are important in determining the recurving trajectory but they may also influence the TC by advecting mid-level moisture towards the TC inner core. This additional supply of moisture as the system is approaching land may enhance deep convection in the inner core and result in increases of lightning probability even though the cyclones are weakening.\nWe use a Lagrangian approach similar to the used by Rutherford and Montgomery (2012, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 12, 11355–11381, 2012), to study moisture fluxes between intensifying and weakening in recurving tropical cyclones.",

            "abstract": "Tropical cyclones are regions of very strong rain and very high winds, both of which present major challenges to surface wind vector retrieval from Ku-band scatterometers. Wind speed and wind direction retrievals can incur severe errors in regions of high rain rates. One particular signature of rain contamination is wind directions in the across-swath direction, which often leads to displaced circulation centers. Recently, Stiles et al. (2014) developed a method for retrieving QuikSCAT tropical cyclone wind speeds using a neural network approach that was tuned using H*WIND surface wind analyses and passive microwave-estimated rain rates from satellites. We are developing a scene-wide methodology by which a set of dynamically-consistent wind directions can be estimated from these wind speeds. The method is based on an iterative use of a tropical cyclone-specific sea-level pressure retrieval technique that we developed. The sea-level pressure analysis uses a boundary layer model that includes the dynamical shallowing of the tropical cyclone boundary layer toward the storm center, a roll-off in surface drag at high wind speeds, and, storm motion-corrected nonlinear mean flow advection effects. Scene-wide consistency is enforced by the integral nature (with respect to the surface wind vector field) of the derived surface pressure pattern and a constraint that the geostrophic contribution to the total flow is non-divergent. We are currently developing methods to evaluate the retrieved wind directions based on HRD aircraft observations and a limited-domain wind vector partitioning of the retrieved wind vectors into irrotational, non-divergent, and, background flow deformation contributions.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation intensity, amounts and timing regimes in the tropics can vary greatly over time – the classic “wet season-dry season” distinction is only one important example of rainfall variability. Vegetation response to these changes in hydrologic input can have significant impacts on ecosystem cycling rates and storage pools. We present here results on CO2 storage and fluxes from a mature tropical rainforest site in Costa Rica, taken during the transition from an abnormally dry season to an abnormally wet season.\nDuring 2014, the site underwent an atypical drought over the course of 4 months, followed by a rapid transition to an abnormally wet period. In 2014, precipitation during the dry season (Days 24-98) was 85% lower than in 2013, while it nearly doubled for the first part of the wet season (Days 99-192). This atypical set of precipitation regimes allowed a clear distinction of the effects of the hydrologic forcing on ecosystem behavior with respect to CO2 and H2O land-atmosphere fluxes. Notable differences in ecophysiological drivers were detected between the dry and the wet season. Average photosynthetically active radiation decreased by 35%; however, seasonal differences were only apparent in the top 10 m of the canopy. Average leaf wetness increased by 55%, a trend that was consistent throughout the canopy profile.\nWhile variations in these drivers resulted in detectable differences in average subcanopy water vapor concentrations (+7%), carbon dioxide concentrations remained nearly identical (-0.4%). This finding implies that in this system assimilation and evapotranspiration may be decoupled.",

            "abstract": "Over the twentieth century, the tropical Indian Ocean has exhibited a distinct boreal autumn warming that resembles a positive phase of the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD). The warming pattern is well captured by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models forced with long-lived greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. While greenhouse gases and aerosols generate offsetting warming and cooling patterns in the Indian Ocean, much less is known about their influence on IOD properties, particularly the negative sea surface temperature (SST) skewness in the eastern IOD (IODE) region. Using single forcing runs from nine CMIP5 models, we show that the SST negative skewness is more enhanced under aerosols than for greenhouse gases and is controlled by the SST response to thermocline variations. This coupling shows substantial asymmetry between warm and cool IODE conditions in simulations that only include anthropogenic aerosols, and is fed by strong thermocline coupling to equatorial winds. Vast intermodel differences in mean-state conditions exist such that the SST skewness is only moderately controlled by the climatological zonal gradients in SST, thermocline and precipitation across the tropical Indian Ocean. However, for the model that exhibits the strongest negative IODE SST skewness among the nine CMIP5 models, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, the aerosol-induced mean-state conditions do control the strength of the Bjerknes feedback asymmetry and skewness. In future decades, the combination of a reduction in anthropogenic aerosol emissions and increasing greenhouse gases will most likely contribute to a weakening of the IODE SST skewness.",

            "abstract": "Satellite studies of the terrestrial Arctic report increased summer greening and longer green seasons over the past several decades, which may increase productivity and lengthen the period of carbon uptake. These trends have been attributed largely to increasing air temperatures and reduced snow cover duration. However, deciduous shrubs are concurrently becoming increasingly abundant in tundra landscapes, which may also impact canopy phenology and productivity. Our aim in this research was to determine the influence of greater deciduous shrub abundance on tundra canopy phenology and subsequent impacts on net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) over the growing season in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaska (68º38’ N, 149º34’ W). We compared deciduous shrub-dominated and evergreen/graminoid-dominated community-level canopy phenology using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and piecewise linear regression modeling. We used a tundra plant-community specific leaf area index (LAI) model to estimate LAI throughout the season. We then used a tundra specific NEE model to estimate the impact of greater deciduous shrub abundance and associated shifts in leaf area and canopy phenology on tundra carbon flux. We found that deciduous shrub canopies reached the onset of maximum greenness significantly earlier than evergreen/graminoid canopies, but both communities reached the onset of senescence at similar times, resulting in a net extension of the peak green season in deciduous shrub communities compared to evergreen/graminoid communities. The combined effect of a longer peak green season and greater leaf area of deciduous shrub canopies increased the net carbon uptake in deciduous shrub communities compared to evergreen/graminoid communities. However, the longer peak season alone significantly increased carbon uptake in deciduous shrub communities, suggesting that greater deciduous shrub abundance increases carbon uptake not only due to greater leaf area, but also due to an extension of the period of maximum greenness and thus the period of peak carbon uptake.",

Several modeling efforts have been made to describe the interaction between electrons and waves associated with these natural processes, most notably by Abel and Thorne [1998] and Meredith et al [2007,2009]. We present an additional lightning-generated whistler diffusion model based on the recent VLF spectral density climatology of Colman and Starks [2013]. Monthly averages of the wave power distribution used to develop this model are provided. A polynomial fit to the spectral intensity profiles is used to describe the power distribution instead of the normal Gaussian formalization. Comparisons between these models are facilitated via a program based on quasi-linear theory, using input parameters that are representative of each model. Diffusion coefficients are presented as a function of equatorial pitch angle and L-shell for L-shells in the range 2.5-4.0 at electron energies of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 MeV. The diffusion coefficients are applied to the CRRESELE radiation belt model to determine electron loss timescales. The diffused electron flux pitch angle distributions are presented for CRRESELE energies of 0.65, 2.0, 3.15, and 5.75 MeV and at elapsed times of 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and 4 years after the start of diffusion. Our results are found to be consistent with prior modeling determinations for small wave normal angle propagation, but less diffusive for large wave normal angles.",

These volcanic fields are formed from distributed-style, possibly monogenetic, volcanism and are composed of low sloped edifices with diameters of tens of kilometers and heights of tens to hundreds of meters. We report a new catalog of these small volcanic vents, now available through the USGS Astrogeology Science Center. This catalog was created with the use of gridded topographic data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) and images from the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC).\nWe are now investigating isolated clusters of distributed volcanism in Tharsis with this dataset. We hypothesize that these clusters are formed from significant magmatic events that played a large role in the development of Tharsis. Currently, the catalog contains 1075 unique volcanic vents in the Tharsis Province. With the catalog, potentially isolated volcano clusters are identified with vent density estimation. Vent intensity for clusters is found to be 1 vent per 1000 sq km or less. Crater retention rates for one such cluster, Syria Planum, indicates that these distributed volcanic systems might continue as long as 700 Ma, or that monogenetic volcanic systems overprint older systems. Using a modified basal outlining algorithm with MOLA gridded data, shield volumes are found to be between 1-20 cubic km.\nCurrent results show distributed-style volcanism occuring in Tharsis orders of magnitude more dispersed than analogous volcano clusers on Earth, while individual edifices are found to be an order of magnitude larger than volcanoes in Earth clusters.

During this episode of transient warming, Southern Ocean temperatures slowly rose 4°C over ~500 ka, and then warmed ~1.5°C over a brief period at the peak of the MECO. After the peak warming, rapid cooling occurred over ~200 ka returning the Southern Ocean waters to pre-MECO temperatures.\nSuch prominent and transient warming may have affected (or been influenced) by a change in deep-water formation and circulation, particularly in the Southern Ocean. Here we investigate the potential relationship between the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and climate change during the MECO using high-resolution records of water mass Neodymium (Nd) and Lead (Pb) isotopes. Neodymium and Pb seawater isotope signatures are widely used water mass and weathering input tracers. They are useful as water mass tracers due to their short residence times relative to oceanic mixing (Nd ~1000 years; Pb ~50-200 years; ocean mixing ~1500 years). Dissolved Nd and Pb compositions in seawater are influenced by weathering inputs from local continental rocks. The use of the two tracers together can provide changes in ocean circulation rates because of their different residence times.\nHigh resolution seawater Nd and Pb isotope records from Pacific Ocean sediment cores at Sites 464, 596, 865B and 883B across the MECO indicate seawater Nd isotope values increase by ~.5 epsilon units from 42.6Ma to 41Ma, and then decrease back to -4.8 by 40.3 Ma at North Pacific Site 464. Corresponding seawater Pb isotope values indicate a 206Pb/204Pb decrease from 18.96 to 18.67 from 41.8 to 41 Ma but no change in 207,208Pb/204Pb values. At North Pacific Site 883B, εNd seawater values also increase by ~.5 epsilon units from 41.8 to 40.9 Ma, then decrease by .5 epsilon units by 39.7 Ma. The Nd and 206Pb isotope changes that coincided with the MECO are consistent with either 1) a transient increase in the influence of radiogenic deep waters from the north (North Pacific Deep Water; NPDW), or 2) a transient change in the weathering inputs to the NPDW source region. Both are consistent with warming documented during the MECO.",

            "abstract": "Prairie pothole wetlands are ubiquitous features of the Great Plains of North America, and important habitat for amphibians and migratory birds. The salinity of proximal wetlands varies highly due to groundwater-glacial till interactions, which influence wetland biota and associated ecosystem functions. Here we use halogens and stable isotopes of water to fingerprint hydrological and biogeochemical controls on salt cycling in a prairie wetland complex. We surveyed surface, well, and pore waters from a groundwater recharge wetland (T8) and more saline closed (P1) and open (P8) basin discharge wetlands in the Cottonwood Lake Study Area (ND) in August/October 2013 and May 2014.\nHalogen concentrations varied over a broad range throughout the study area (Cl = 2.2 to 170 mg/L, Br = 13 to 2000 µg/L, F = < 30 (MDL) to 740 µg/L, I = 1 to 538 µg/L). The Cl/Br molar ratios were higher (171 to 574) at the recharge wetland, indicating meteoric sources, and had a tighter and lower range (33 to 320) at the down-gradient sites. The Cl/I molar ratios of waters throughout the site had a wide range (32 to 26,000). Lowest values occurred at the upgradient shore of P1 (32 to 43) due to low Cl concentrations and the center of P1 (196 to 213) where pore water of weathered till underlying 1.2 m of organic-rich sediment and silty clay soil is enriched in I to ~500 µg/L. Stable isotopes of water showed that evaporation-enriched pond water (δ18O = -9.5 to -2.71 ‰) mixes with shallow groundwater in the top 0.6 m of fringing wetland soils and 1.2 m of the substrate in the center of P1. Our results suggest endogenous sources for Br and I within the prairie landscape that may be controlled by biological mechanisms or weathering of shale from glacial till.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric Rivers (AR) can be described as a long narrow feature within a warm conveyor belt where anomalous precipitable water (PW) is transported from low to high latitudes. Close monitoring of ARs is heavily reliant on satellites, which are limited both in space and time, to capture the fluctuations PW particularly over the ocean. Ship-based Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers have been successful in obtaining millimeter PW accuracy within 100 km from the nearest ground-based reference receiver at a 30 second sampling rate. We extended this capability with a field experiment using ship-based GPS PW on board a cargo ship to traverse over the Eastern Pacific Ocean. In one 14-day cruise cycle, between the periods of February 3-16, 2014, the ship-based GPS captured PW spikes >50 mm during the early development of two ARs, which lead to moderate to heavy rainfall events for Hawaii and flood conditions along the West Coast of the United States. Comparisons between PW solutions processed using different GPS reference sites at distances 100-2000 km provided an internal validation for the ship-based GPS PW with errors typically less than 5 mm. Land-based observations provided an external validation and are in good agreement with ship-based GPS PW at distances <100 km from the coast, a zone heavily trafficked by cargo containers and a challenge area for satellite retrievals. From these preliminary results, commercial ship-based GPS receivers offer an extremely cost-effective approach for acquiring continuous meteorological observations over the oceans, which can provide important calibration/validation data for satellite retrieval algorithms. Ship-based systems could be particularly useful for augmenting our meteorological observing networks to improve weather prediction and nowcasting, which in turn provide critical support for hazard response and mitigation efforts in coastal regions.",

            "abstract": "Vapor-phase multi-stage contaminant mass discharge (CMD) tests were conducted at two field sites to measure mass discharge associated with contaminant sources located in the vadose zone. A CMD of 32 g/d was obtained for a site at which soil vapor extraction (SVE) has been in operation for approximately 6 years. The behavior exhibited for the vapor extractions conducted at this site suggests that there is unlikely to be a significant mass of non-vapor-phase contaminant (e.g., DNAPL, sorbed phase) present in the advective domains, and that most remaining mass is likely located in poorly accessible domains. Given the conditions for this site, this remaining mass is hypothesized to be associated with the low-permeability (and higher water saturation) region in the vicinity of the saturated zone and capillary fringe. This is supported by the results of a sediment-coring effort conducted prior to the CMD test. A CMD of 270 g/d was obtained for a site for which there were no prior SVE operations. The behavior exhibited for the vapor extractions conducted at this site suggest that non-vapor-phase contaminant mass (e.g., DNAPL) may be present in the advective domains. This is consistent with the results of prior characterization activities conducted at the site. Hence, the asymptotic conditions observed for this site most likely derive from a combination of rate-limited mass transfer from DNAPL (and sorbed) phases present in the advective domain as well as mass residing in lower-permeability (“non-advective”) regions. The CMD values obtained from the tests were used in conjunction with a recently developed vapor-discharge tool to evaluate the impact of the measured CMDs on groundwater quality.",

The correlation length of tritium concentration is 120 km.\nNearly 50% of the wells show a significant component of terrigenic helium. Over 50% of these samples show a terrigenic helium isotope ratio (Rter) that is significantly higher than the radiogenic helium isotope ratio (Rrad = 2×10-8). Rter values of more than three times the atmospheric isotope ratio (Ra = 1.384×10-6) are associated with known faults and volcanic provinces in Northern California. In the Central Valley, Rter varies from radiogenic to 2.25 Ra, complicating 3H/3He dating. The Rter was mapped by kriging, showing a correlation length of less than 50 km. The local predicted Rter was used to separate tritiogenic from atmospheric and terrigenic 3He.\nRegional groundwater recharge areas, indicated by young groundwater ages, are located in the southern Santa Clara Basin and in the upper LA basin and in the eastern San Joaquin Valley and along unlined canals carrying Colorado River water. Recharge in California is dominated by agricultural return flows, river recharge and managed aquifer recharge rather than precipitation excess. Combined application of noble gases and other groundwater tracers reveal the impact of engineered groundwater recharge and prove invaluable for the study of complex groundwater systems.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. DOE by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

            "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase the chances of drought, and shift precipitation patterns in seasonally dry places. In some places, the heuristics or “rules of thumb” that stakeholders use may no longer be reliable for the effective management of water resources. This can have dire consequences for social and ecological systems, especially in developing countries. Scientists and policymakers view climate forecasts as one way for improving informed decision-making about freshwater resources. However, successful communication requires that stakeholders understand and are able to use such information. To develop effective communications, it is critical to characterize stakeholders’ understanding of social-ecological systems as related to water, the type of information used to inform management decisions, and the perceived value of forecast information. To achieve our objective, we conducted 40 semi-structured interviews with farmers, water managers, hydroelectric utilities, local climate experts, tourism industry representatives, and members of the general public in the semi-arid region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. People believe that they have enough water at this time however they believe that the region will become much drier in the future, which they attribute to climate change, El Nino/La Nina, and deforestation. With respect to the value of forecast information, we found that the scale of decision-making (e.g., irrigation district versus small farmer) was associated with a stakeholders’ level of “technical sophistication” and trust in government. In future work, we will evaluate the prevalence of these beliefs and practices in the larger population in order to identify effective ways to tailor the presentation of forecast information for different audiences. This work provides insight into the development of forecast communications to improve the management of resources in development countries in the face of a changing climate.",

The Landsat images were then segmented into homogeneous objects, with represent areas on the ground with similar spatial and spectral characteristics. These objects are related to the distinct land cover types that occur in each municipality. The segmentation procedure resulted in polygons over the three time periods along twenty years (1990-2010). The land cover for each object was visually identified, based on its shape, texture and spectral characteristics. Land cover types considered were: sugarcane plantations, pasture lands, natural cover, forest plantation, permanent crop, short cycle crop, water bodies and urban areas.\nSOM technique was used to estimate the values for the future land cover scenarios for the selected municipalities, using the information of land change provided by the remote sensing and data from official sources.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of crop Gross Primary Production (GPP) is important for food securityand terrestrial carbon cycle. Numerous publications have reported the potential of the satellite-based Production Efficiency Models (PEMs) to estimate GPP driven by in-situ climate data. Simulations of the PEMs often require surface reanalysis climate data as inputs, for example, the North America Regional Reanalysis datasets (NARR). These reanalysis datasets showed certain biases from the in-situ climate datasets. Thus, sensitivity analysis of the PEMs to the climate inputs is needed before their application at the regional scale. This study used the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by solar radiation (R), air temperature (T), and the satellite-based vegetation indices, to quantify the causes and degree of uncertainties in crop GPP estimates due to different meteorological inputs at the 8-day interval (in-situ AmeriFlux data and NARR surface reanalysis data). The NARR radiation (RNARR) explained over 95% of the variability in in-situ RAF and TAF measured from AmeriFlux. The bais of TNARR was relatively small. However, RNARR had a systematical positive bias of ~3.5 MJ m-2day-1 from RAF. A simple adjustment based on the spatial statistic between RNARR and RAF produced relatively accurate radiation data for all crop site-years by reducing RMSE from 4 to 1.7 MJ m-2day-1. The VPM-based GPP estimates with three climate datasets (i.e., in-situ, and NARR before and after adjustment, GPPVPM,AF, GPPVPM,NARR, and GPPVPM,adjNARR) showed good agreements with the seasonal dynamics of crop GPP derived from the flux towers (GPPAF). The GPPVPM,AF differed from GPPAF by 2% for maize, and -8% to -12% for soybean on the 8-day interval. The positive bias of RNARR resulted in an overestimation of GPPVPM,NARR at both maize and soybean systems. However, GPPVPM,adjNARR significantly reduced the uncertainties of the maize GPP from 25% to 2%. The results from this study revealed that the errors of the NARR surface reanalysis data introduced significant uncertainties of the PEMs-based GPP estimates. Therefore, it is important to develop more accurate radiation datasets at the regional and global scales to estimate gross and net primary production of terrestrial ecosystems at the regional and global scales.",

Numerous studies have described fundamental relationships between environmental variables, the carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of recently assimilated sugars in plants, litter, soil carbon, or recently respired CO2. However, studies that examine the spatial variability of the 13C content of forest soils at the landscape scale are lacking. We report on measurements of the carbon isotopic composition of soil CO2 concentrations (δ13CC), soil CO2 production (δ13CP), and soil-atmosphere CO2 exchange (δ13CD) across a subalpine forest of the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana over two growing seasons. We evaluate the variability of these measurements across different landscape positions. Our analysis demonstrates that soil moisture and the lateral redistribution of soil water are strong predictors of the spatial variability of δ13CC, δ13CP, and δ13CD at the watershed scale. We suggest that there are concomitant yet independent effects of soil water on physical (i.e., soil gas diffusivity) and biological (i.e., photosynthetic activity) processes that mediate the 13C composition of forest soils. We show systematic spatial variability in the δ13C of forest soils at the landscape scale that can be useful to accurately predict and model land-atmosphere CO2 exchange over complex terrain.",

            "abstract": "Super-Earths which have a few times of the Earth’s mass have been found in the extra solar system one after another. MgSiO3 post-perovskite (PPv) is an abundant silicate phase in such huge terrestrial planet’s mantle (Tsuchiya and Tsuchiya, 2011). For preliminary internal structure estimation, the mass-radius relation was used (Zeng et al. 2013). Above 120 GPa, the mass-radius relation for MgSiO3 end-member is calculated from the equations of state (EoS) of PPv. Although the pressure condition of super-Earth’s mantle reaches several hundreds GPa, the previously reported EoSs of PPv by the diamond anvil cell (DAC) experiment were limited up to around 150 GPa. These EoSs were extrapolated to multi-megabar condition for the calculation of the mass-radius relation. The large extrapolation yields uncertainty. The direct determination of the compression behavior of PPv at multi-megabar pressure is, therefore, important to understand the super-Earth’s interior.\n Here we report PPv EoS up to 275 GPa based on DAC experiment and up to 1 TPa and 6000 K by ab initio calculation based on the density-functional theory in the same manner as Tsuchiya et al. (2004).　Volume data were obtained up to 275 GPa by the DAC experiment and fitted to the third order Birch-Murnaghan EoS and the Vinet EoS. The experimental EoS agrees excellently with the calculated ab initio volume data within 0.5 % up to 500 GPa and 3000 K. The volume differences between the present result and those calculated by Caracas and Cohen (2008) were about 2.0-2.6 % in pressure range of 100-500 GPa at room temperature, while the volume differences were only 1 % with respect to the EoS based on shock experiment data (Mosenfelder et al. 2009) in the same pressure range. The present EoS shows internal consistency among DAC, shock and ab initio data up to 500 GPa within 1% in volume. Our new EoS provides more precise mass-radius relation for MgSiO3 end-member.",

We present correlations between the optical properties and chemical composition of aerosols at ~1 km altitude over Maryland. Data were collected during the peak smog day and a dissipation day during an air quality episode studied in DISCOVER-AQ, July 2011. Post flight filter sample analysis shows a positive trend between measurable carboxylate concentrations and particle size with a recirculating, aged, urban air mass influenced with southeasterly marine winds (peak day). A westerly influx of air from the Ohio River Valley on the dissipation day was depleted in carboxylates compared with samples collected over the same location two days prior. These samples contained quantifiable concentrations of cis-pinonic acid, a reaction product of pinene after ozonation and photochemical oxidation.\nNew techniques were developed to improve airborne data collection and analysis of water soluble organic acids (WSOA), a frequently dominant fraction of particulate matter (PM). An ion chromatographic mass spectrometric method was developed using NIST Standard Referencing Material 1649b, Urban Dust, as a surrogate material to achieve separation and resolution of at least 34 organic acids. Analysis of aircraft filter samples resulted in detection of 16 organic acids of which 12 were quantified. Eight inorganic species were also quantified. Aged, re-circulated metropolitan air showed a greater number of dicarboxylic acids than new transport air from the west and may provide a useful test of SOA formation theory.",

            "abstract": "Bedload and suspended load transport and deposition within the fluvio-tidal zone is governed by the dynamic interplay between fluvially-derived unidirectional currents  with bi-directional tidal flows of varying magnitudes that display significant spatio-temporal variation across a range of scales. These fluctuations in the governing hydraulics are represented directly in the differing characteristics of bar forms, bedforms, and silt/clay interbeds within this region that ultimately control the sedimentary facies observed within the fluvio-tidal transitional zone. In this study, we examined seven water surface elevation gages from both NOAA and the USGS located throughout the full expanse (~ 60 km) of the fluvio-tidal zone on the Chehalis River from the river mouth through the “backwater” reach to the fully-fluvial environment where normal flow prevails. Wavelet analysis coupled with computed water surface energy gradients was conducted for both the tidal (i.e. semi-diurnal and diurnal) and fluvial signals at low and high (i.e. flood wave) fluvial discharge conditions that captured all seasonal fluctuations in both the tidal range and fluvial hydrograph. Spatio-temporal analysis of the fluvio-tidal signal along the “backwater” reach shows that for  particular hydrodynamic conditions the tidal flows are significantly altered, if not completely dampened, by upstream originating fluvial flood waves, and also displays where fluvial flood wave signals are absorbed by the tidal flow signal (i.e. tidal prism). Furthermore, the results of the above analysis coupled with: (i) salinity measurements, and (ii) suspended sediment concentrations, illuminates in a spatio-temporal context where/when along the “backwater” reach flocculation of fine-grained sediment is expected. Thus, here we will demonstrate how the large-scale hydrodynamics varies throughout the fluvio-tidal zone and will discuss the implications of these results for the preservation potential of sedimentary facies in this region.",

Due to its diverse volcanic and tectonic frameworks, the Azores archipelago represents an excellent case study for geophysical and geological proposes. Main results of a paleomagnetic study, conducted on oriented samples from approximately 60 accessible lava piles of three islands of Azores archipelago central group (Faial, Pico and Terceira islands) and covering as much as possible spatially and temporally these islands are: i) The paleomagnetic polarity is in close agreement with the radiometric results known for these islands; ii) Onshore volcanic activity began during the Matuyama geochron for Faial and during Brunhes for Terceira and Pico; iii) The mean ChRMs from Terceira and Pico islands result in a paleomagnetic pole similar to the ones retrieved from the studies of Johnson et al (1998) and Silva et al (2012), from S. Miguel and S. Jorge islands (other islands of Azores archipelago), respectively; iv) ChRMs from Faial show an elliptical distribution perpendicular to the WNW-ESE grabben that is the major structure of the island, suggesting tilting towards SSW of the southern wall and towards NNE of the northern one. The presence of listric faults plunging towards the middle of the grabben and aligned along the N110º azimuth could explain the elliptical distribution of paleomagnetic directions. This study is a contribution for the research project REGENA (PTDC/GEO-FIQ/3648/2012).\n",

These synoptic flows are driven by large-scale pressure gradients that are superimposed on along-valley pressure gradients produced locally by intra-valley thermal gradients. When synoptic flows encounter thermally driven valley/slope flows, the slope flows are modified or even completely erased when certain conditions are satisfied.

The model performance was investigated using data taken using Doppler LiDARs and towers located in the vicinity of Granite Mountain. The model captures modification of the flow in the lee of the mountain.

            "abstract": "Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (SNMR) is a geophysical method used to image water content with depth. Recently SNMR has been used to monitor infiltration events in the vadose zone; however, this application can be complicated by the presence of large signals associated with the ponded surface water. In this study, we develop algorithms to reduce this surface water signal for improved sensitivity to the infiltrated groundwater. Using synthetic models, we examine the accuracy of these algorithms. We then assess our approach using a field dataset collected from a five-week SNMR survey conducted during an infiltration event at the South Aura Valley Storage and Recovery Project (SAVSARP) site in Tucson, AZ.\nThree different algorithms were developed to remove the surface water from the SNMR data: (1) late time mono-exponential subtraction, in which signal from late in the measurement is used to model surface water signal; (2) model subtraction, in which the Earth’s magnetic field subsurface conductive structure, and water layer thickness are used to model the surface water signal; and (3) late time inversion correction, in which model parameters in the relaxation time distributions corresponding to slower relaxation times are zeroed. We used two readily available SNMR inversion codes to verify the three approaches: the GMR Inversion software and the MRS Matlab toolkit. Synthetic models were recovered using both inversion codes by applying the late time mono-exponential subtraction and the model subtraction algorithms, while the late time inversion correction algorithm produced poorly resolved relaxation time distribution models. The corrected dataset from the start of the SAVSARP survey contained features in the relaxation time distribution and water content versus depth models that were consistent with observed features present in other datasets from the survey. We conclude that either the late time mono-exponential subtraction or the model subtraction algorithm are sufficient for removing the surface water signal and improving data sensitivity to infiltrated water.",

In the source areas, we have deployed seafloor seismic network, DONET (Dense Ocean-floor Network System for Earthquake and Tsunamis), in 2010 in order to monitor seismicity, crustal deformations, and tsunamis.\nDONET system consists of totally 20 stations, which is composed of six kinds of sensors, including strong-motion seismometers　and quartz pressure gauges. Those stations are densely distributed with an average spatial interval of 15-20 km and cover near the trench axis to coastal areas. Observed data are transferred to a land station through a fiber-optical cable and then to JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology) data management center through a private network in real time.\nAfter 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake, each local government close to Nankai Trough try to plan disaster prevention scheme. JAMSTEC will disseminate DONET data combined with research accomplishment so that they will be widely recognized as important earthquake information.\nIn order to open DONET data observed for research to local government, we have developed a web application system, REIS　(Real-time Earthquake Information System). REIS is providing seismic waveform data to some local governments close to Nankai Trough as a pilot study. As soon as operation of DONET is ready, REIS will start full-scale operation.\nREIS can display seismic waveform data of DONET in real-time, users can select strong motion and pressure data, and configure the options of trace view arrangement, time scale, and amplitude. In addition to real-time monitoring, REIS can display past seismic waveform data and show earthquake epicenters on the map.\nIn this presentation, we briefly introduce DONET system and then show our web　application system. We also discuss our future plans for further developments of REIS.",

Over the years this popular ontologies collection has expanded to cover over 200 ontologies and 6000 concepts to enable scalable classification of Earth system science concepts and Space science. This presentation discusses the semantic web technologies as the enabling technology for data-intensive science. We will discuss the application of the SWEET ontologies as a critical component in knowledge-driven research infrastructure for some of the recent projects, which include the DARPA Ontological System for Context Artifact and Resources (OSCAR), 2013 NASA ACCESS Virtual Quality Screening Service (VQSS), and the 2013 NASA Sea Level Change Portal (SLCP) projects. The presentation will also discuss the benefits in using semantic web technologies in developing research infrastructure for Big Earth Science Data in an attempt to “accommodate all domains and provide the necessary glue for information to be cross-linked, correlated, and discovered in a semantically rich manner.“ [1]\n[1] Savas Parastatidis: A platform for all that we know: creating a knowledge-driven research infrastructure.

However, the sponsoring agency programs, university investigators, and local federal officials govern each differently. The three models of program and center governance are 1) exclusively university (RISAs), 2) a hybrid of Federal government and (host) university (CSCs,), and 3) exclusively Federal (Hubs). Each model has it’s advantages and disadvantages in terms of legal definition and authority, scientific mission requirements and strategies, flexibility and legitimacy to conduct research and to collaborate regionally with constituencies, leadership and governance approach and “friction points,”, staff capacity and ability to engage stakeholders, necessity to deliver products and services, bureaucratic oversight, performance evaluation, and political support at Congressional, state, and local levels. Using available sources of information and data, this paper will compare and contrast the strengths and weakness of these three regional applied climate science center governance models.",

            "abstract": "The behavior of granular flows is strongly dependent on shear rate. At relatively slow shear velocities, a granular flow will support stresses elastically through force chains in the quasi-static regime. At relatively high shear velocities, it will support stresses by transferring momentum in higher velocity grain collisions in the grain-inertial regime, which results in dilation of the flow. Experiments conducted using a commercial torsional rheometer (TA AR-2000ex) found that at intermediate shear velocities, force chain collapse in angular sand samples produces sound waves capable of vibrating the shear zone enough to cause compaction. Sound produced by spherical glass beads during shearing was of lower amplitude and no compaction effect was observed. In order to characterize both the source of acoustic energy produced during shearing of angular grains and its associated compaction effect, we used the same experimental set up to observe how volumetric and acoustic response to shear stress changes with mineralogy, specifically varying grain hardness and shear modulus. A comparison of angular quartz beach sand (Mohs hardness of 7 and shear modulus of 31.14 GPa) with angular aluminum oxide grit of the same size (Mohs hardness of 9 and shear modulus of 124 GPa) shows markedly different behavior, with the aluminum oxide mixture producing lower noise amplitudes during shearing and showing no compaction at intermediate shear rates. Combined with grain size and shape analysis, the implication is that shear-induced noise is the result of grain fracture rather than shear interactions and is dependent on the relative strength of individual grains. Combined with recent and ongoing work characterizing the effect of mean grain size and polydispersity on shear-induced volumetric and acoustic response, we are moving towards a more complete incorporation of field-observable variables into predictions of natural granular mixtures.",

            "abstract": "Stress is a first-order control on the deformation state of the earth. However, stress is notoriously hard to measure, and researchers typically only estimate the directions and relative magnitudes of principal stresses, with little quantification of the uncertainties or absolute magnitude. To improve upon this, we have developed methods to constrain the full stress tensor field in a region surrounding a fault, including tectonic, topographic, and lithostatic components, as well as static friction and pore fluid pressure on the fault. Our methods are based on elastic halfspace techniques for estimating topographic stresses from a DEM, and we use a Bayesian approach to estimate accumulated tectonic stress, fluid pressure, and friction from fault geometry and slip rake, assuming Mohr-Coulomb fault mechanics. The nature of the tectonic stress inversion is such that either the stress maximum or minimum is better constrained, depending on the topography and fault deformation style. Our results from the 2008 Wenchuan event yield shear stresses from topography up to 20 MPa (normal-sinistral shear sense) and topographic normal stresses up to 80 MPa on the faults; tectonic stress had to be large enough to overcome topography to produce the observed reverse-dextral slip. Maximum tectonic stress is constrained to be >0.3 * lithostatic stress (depth-increasing), with a most likely value around 0.8, trending 90-110°E. Minimum tectonic stress is about half of maximum. Static fault friction is constrained at 0.1-0.4, and fluid pressure at 0-0.6 * total pressure on the fault. Additionally, the patterns of topographic stress and slip suggest that topographic normal stress may limit fault slip once failure has occurred. Preliminary results from the 2013 Balochistan earthquake are similar, but yield stronger constraints on the upper limits of maximum tectonic stress, as well as tight constraints on the magnitude of minimum tectonic stress and stress orientation. Work in progress on the Wasatch fault suggests that maximum tectonic stress may also be able to be constrained, and that some of the shallow rupture segmentation may be due in part to localized topographic loading. Future directions of this work include regions where high relief influences fault kinematics (such as Tibet).",

            "abstract": " Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed seismicity during some solar flares. One theory associates high-energy electrons and white-light emission with sunquakes. This relationship is based on the back-warming model, where high-energy electrons and their subsequent heating of the photosphere induce acoustic waves in the solar interior. \nWe carried out a correlative study of solar flares with emission in hard-X rays (HXRs) above 50 keV, enhanced white light emission at 6573Å, and acoustic sources. We selected those flares observed by RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) with a considerable flux in the 50-100 and 100-300 keV bands between January 1, 2010 and June 26, 2014. Additionally, we restricted the sample to flares close to disk center where it is observationally easiest to detect a sunquake. We then used data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO/HMI) to search for white-light emission and helioseismic signatures. \nFinally, we calculated a coefficient of correlation  for this set of dichotomic observables. We discuss the phenomenological connectivity between these physical quantities and the observational difficulties of detecting seismic signals and white-light radiation with terrestrial and space-borne observations.",

            "abstract": "Wave gradiometry is a new technique utilizing the shape of seismic wave fields captured by USArray transportable stations to determine fundamental wave propagation characteristics. It is designed to take advantage of the wavefield variations and resolve structure that cannot be derived strictly from averaging methods. The spatial gradients, ground displacements and ground velocities are linearly linked by two unknown coefficients, which can be used to infer wave phase velocity, back azimuth, radiation pattern and geometrical spreading [Langston, 2007]. Spatial gradients are estimated from shifted displacement fields using bi-cubic spline interpretation [Beavan and Haines, 2001]. With singular value decomposition, the coefficients are solved iteratively at each seismic station, which are then inverted for wave parameters described above. However, the phase velocity, depends not only on the medium but also on the local geometry of the wavefield, which is referred as dynamical phase velocity [Wielandt, 1992]. In order to find the structural phase velocity determined only by the properties of the medium, an amplitude correction, involving the first and second derivatives of logarithmic amplitude, is required [Wielandt, 1992]. We show that the two coefficients that we are solving for actually correspond to the gradient of logarithmic amplitude and the gradient of phase, respectively. Treating this vector field in the same way that we treat displacement fields, the Laplacian of logarithmic amplitude and Laplacian of phase can be determined. This enables us to estimate pseudo-structural phase velocities through solutions to the Helmholtz equation, assuming that the structure is smoothly inhomogeneous compared to the heterogeneity of the wave field [Wielandt, 1992]. Furthermore, the density can be estimated by integrating in the direction of wave propagation, using also the first and second derivatives of the phase. Numerical experiments with synthetic data sets provided by Princeton University’s Neal Real Time Global Seismicity Portal are being conducted to test the algorithm stability and evaluate errors. Our modification of the wave gradiometry method is also being employed across the USArray to obtain structural parameters from mid-west to the eastern coast of the U.S.",

Authigenic carbonates and different pools of primary carbonate (e.g. calcite vs. aragonite) may also bias the C isotopic composition of bulk carbonates if they are both abundant and isotopically distinct. New approaches to quantifying contributions from diagenesis, authigenesis, and mixing of primary carbonates to the C isotopic composition of bulk sedimentary carbonates are needed.\nHere we present preliminary Mg and Ca isotope data sets of primary, diagenetic, and authigenic carbonates, both modern and ancient.

            "abstract": "On Earth, highlighted in Japan, North America, Europe, and Greenland, accretionary complexes comprehensively record information compiled while the oceanic crust is en route from the mid-oceanic ridge to the subduction zone, spanning hundreds of millions of years. At the zone, oceanic crustal materials are stacked along thrust faults and/or subducted to be eventually recycled into the mantle. The surviving accretionary-complex materials include Ocean Plate Stratigraphy (OPS). The ideal succession of the OPS (from oldest to youngest) is mid-ocean ridge basalt, pelagic sediment including radiolarian chert, hemipelagic sediment including siliceous shale, and trench turbidite deposits. Therefore, accretionary complexes often record diverse environmental conditions from deep- to shallow-marine environments, including those perturbed by magmatic, impact, and possibly extrasolar events. Stratigraphic, impact-crater, paleotectonic, and magnetic-anomaly information point to Early Noachian (Hadean-equivalent) Martian geologic terrains; they are extremely ancient environmental records compared to those destroyed on Earth due to differences in planetary mass and evolutional states. Such record a dynamic phase of the evolution of Mars, including interacting ocean, landmass, and atmosphere, as well as possible plate tectonism during an operating dynamo. A candidate accretionary complex and nearby outcrops of steeply dipping beds comprising olistostrome-like blocks, nearby and in the Claritas rise, respectively, may be key evidence of major crustal shortening related to plate tectonism, in addition to being extremely ancient environmental records. Claritas rise is a rugged promontory about 250 km across, which forms the northwest part of an extremely ancient and large mountain range, Thaumasia highlands, with a length nearing 2,400 km, or approximating that of the Himalayas. Future investigation of the ancient Martian basement, which includes geochemical analyses for possible OPS sequences (an important test for the accretionary-complex hypothesis), as well as reconnaissance for other parts of Pacific-type orogenic complexes, which includes metamorphic belts, ophiolite sequences, and belts of felsic materials, will be an important next phase in the geologic investigation of Mars.",

            "abstract": "The data of pollen analysis can show the changes of the past depositional environment in the sediments. Coseismic subsidence and subsequent geomorphic changes affect local vegetation so there is a possibility that pollen records show associated environmental changes. We examined the relationship between Late Quaternary pollen assemblage changes and local geomorphic development on three active fault zones in Japan. We analyzed two areas of the Itoigawa-Shizuoka tectonic line (ISTL) active fault system in central Japan to accumulate the pollen analytical data that have close relationships to paleoseismic events. The ISTL that extends for about 150 km is one of the most active and important fault systems in Japan. The Kamishiro fault is a west-dipping reverse fault on the northern part of the ISTL with an average sliprate of 1.5 mm/yr. The Chino fault is a left-lateral strike slip fault on the central ISTL that characterized by a high average slip reaching 10 mm/yr. The Kamishiro pollen samples were collected from trench walls, and the Chino samples were from a drill core. We can correlate pollen changes and paleoseismic events exactly. The pollen assemblage variations from these two sites show some oscillations that were caused by hydrologic change on surface. The taxa were classified into three groups: F, W, and D. F is the index of flow from the mountains around the plain, W is the index of moistening of the surface. D is the index of relative drying. F is composed of riparian forest taxa. W and D are taxa affected by hydrologic change, and differ within the areas. This is caused by the difference of climate and regional vegetation. We directed our attention to the oscillations of W and D. They have some contrary and synchronous oscillations which may indicate that they show change from the same events. It is concluded that these changes observed in the W and D pollen assemblages reflect the coseismic subsidence. Using these pollen data, we tried to estimate the intervals of faulting events of the Sekidosan fault. It is a reverse fault in the southern part of Noto peninsula and it has 0.63-0.89 mm/yr average slip rate. We analyzed the horizon of the drilling core that has too low resolution for geomorphological method to estimate coseismic event. The result suggests the potential of pollen analysis as a useful method for paleoseismology.",

            "abstract": "This study seeks to derive the sea surface temperature (SST) response to anthropogenic forcing from observations (1900-2005), using a simple method inspired from pattern scaling. As in pattern scaling, the spatial response of SST to anthropogenic forcing is assumed to scale with global-mean and annual-mean surface temperature. The long term aim of this work is to generate anthropogenically-forced SST and sea-ice patterns of change for recent past and near-term future, and use them to force atmosphere-land climate models for attribution and prediction purposes.\nThe present work uses a Monte Carlo framework based on two large initial condition ensembles of climate model simulations to quantify the method's ability to correctly isolate the anthropogenically-forced SST spatial response pattern from internal variability when derived from a single observation. We use our method to estimate the SST spatial pattern response to anthropogenic forcing in each member of the large ensemble, and base our quantification on their spatial correlations: If the method successfully removes all of the internal variability, the estimated spatial pattern response of each member should be identical across the ensemble.\nWe first treat each member of the large ensemble as a pseudo-observation and compare the different estimated spatial response pattern pairwise. We find that on average 16-36% of the spatial pattern response estimated in each member is common to the other ensemble members. We then treat one member as a pseudo-observation and the ensemble mean as the true anthropogenically-forced signal. Here, we find that on average 36-56% of the spatial pattern response estimated in each member is common to the true response pattern. We conclude that about 16-56% of the spatial pattern response derived from a single observation with our method results from anthropogenic forcing. These numbers increase with the length of the time period chosen to apply the method.\nFinally, we show a first application of the ensemble of experiments obtained by forcing the atmosphere-land climate model CAM5 with our estimate of anthropogenically-forced SST derived from observations, and show that we are able to attribute the increase in winter snow cover observed during 1980-2010 in northwestern North America to SST internal variability.",

The reservoir, confined within impervious rock units, is composed by a porous rock mass laterally bounded by a fault. The fault is hydraulically connected to the fluid hosting unit.\nThe numerical analysis is based on fully explicit sequential coupling between a multiphase fluid flow and a hydromechanical finite element calculation code. When the system conditions approaches failure, the simulation is performed in a fully dynamic mode.\nThe coupling allows simulating change in permeability due to stress/strain change, as well as the slip on the fault due to overpressure and associated stress changes.\nInterface elements have been used to include the constitutive law characterizing the frictional behaviour of the fault. \nThe change in friction with different slip velocities has been derived from laboratory results.\nVelocity- and strain-dependent frictional behavior of different patches of the fault influence the system evolution, resulting in larger or smaller slip length for the same injected volume.",

            "abstract": "In spite of its mid-latitude location, Japan has a markedly high amount of snowfall, which owes much to the presence of cold air-break from Siberia and thus depends on the strength of the Siberian high and the Aleutian low. With this background this study examines the relationship between interannual variability and spatial patterns of snowfall in Japan with large-scale atmospheric and sea ice variations.\nThe lag regression map of the winter snowfall in Japan on the time series of the Arctic SIE from the preceding summer shows a seesaw pattern in the snowfall, suggesting an Arctic teleconnection to regional weather. From the EOF analyses conducted on the snowfall distribution in Japan, we identify two modes with physical significance. The NH SIC and SLP regressed on PC1 show a sea ice reduction in the Barents and Kara Seas and anomalous strength of the Siberia high as discussed in Honda et al. (2009) and other studies, which support the above notion that the snowfall variability of Japan is influenced by Arctic sea ice conditions. Another mode is related to the AO/NAO and the hemispheric scale double sea-ice seesaw centered over the sub-Arctic region: one between the Labrador and Nordic Seas in the Atlantic and the other between the Okhotsk and Bering Seas from the Pacific as discussed in Ukita et al. (2007). Together, observations point to a significant role of the sea-ice in determining mid-latitude regional climate and weather patterns.",

            "abstract": "In the Great Basin, paleoshoreline reconstructions indicate that lacustrine highstands correspond with Pleistocene glacial maxima. However, uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude of temperature change between glacial and interglacial episodes, and it is difficult to estimate precipitation and evaporation trends from geomorphic records alone. Hence, geochemical and biologic proxies have been applied to better constrain temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity during both lacustrine highstands and lowstands. Carbonate clumped isotope analyses of lacustrine materials provide new constraints on summertime water and air temperatures. The work presented here is an update of ongoing investigations at Lake Bonneville, Lake Manix, and Surprise Valley. These systems were actively transgressing during, and slightly after, the Last Glacial Maximum. Multiple phases of carbonate have been evaluated, including aragonitic shells of lacustrine gastropods and bivalves, as well as marls, and calcite cements. Given what is known about the season of growth for these materials in mid-latitude lakes, clumped isotope measurements should record warm season hydrographic conditions. Biogenic aragonite in mollusk shells is largely precipitated during the April through October interval, when food is abundant and water temperatures are most conducive to organismal development. Accumulation of carbonate muds (i.e. marl) and cements is also typically restricted to warm months, when lake waters reach carbonate saturation. Clumped isotope results are also used to identify the 18O/16O composition of water at the time of mineral precipitation, a proxy which tracks evaporative enrichment and/or moisture source. Results in this work are being calibrated by comparison to clumped isotope measurements of modern lacustrine samples, from sites where water and air temperatures are known. Water paleotemperatures are applied to estimate summertime and mean annual air temperatures using lake-atmospheric transfer functions. These results are also being compared to climate model simulations for the Last Glacial Maximum interval.",

            "abstract": "Sub-arctic regions are currently undergoing climate induced changes, with projections of widespread degradation or loss of permafrost in these regions. While many studies have focussed on the controls of DOC exports in sub-arctic systems and many large scale models were applied, very few studies have investigated these processes in sub-arctic alpine, headwater catchments. With increasing air-temperatures it is predicted that the permafrost will be reduced and the depth of the thawing active layer may increase. The effect of these changes on the quantity and timing of DOC exports under these changes is still unclear. Therefore, it is important to understand the controls of DOC in these systems. These regions are characterised with high DOC concentrations during early spring melt when the thaw depth is shallow and the highly labile organic layer is the dominant flow pathway. As the season progresses and the active layer deepens, maximum soil water storage increases and DOC comes into contact with and is sorbed by less permeable mineral soils. Using a parsimonious coupled conceptual model to simulate stream discharge and DOC production and export for a small (c.a. 8 km2) sub-arctic alpine headwater catchment, this study aims to improve the understanding of stream discharge and DOC dynamics and the main underlying processes of DOC exports. Using a coupled process-based model to simulate DOC production and hydrological processes allows to integrate additional information gained concerning the controls of these processes. Model complexity is balanced with the complexity of the system to allow for the identification of the main controlling processes of DOC exports. Based on the HBV model, the model includes additional components to reflect the effect of slope aspect and the permafrost active layer dynamics and the production and loss of DOC. The results of the model provide valuable information on the dominant controlling processes of DOC in the catchment.",

            "abstract": "Empirical mechanistic models have been applied to the description of the stress and strain rate upon failure for heterogeneous materials. The behaviour of porous rocks and their analogous two-phase viscoelastic suspensions are particularly well-described by such models. Nevertheless, failure cannot yet be predicted forcing a reliance on other empirical prediction tools such as the Failure Forecast Method (FFM). Measurable, accelerating rates of physical signals (e.g., seismicity and deformation) preceding failure are often used as proxies for damage accumulation in the FFM. Previous studies have already statistically assessed the applicability and performance of the FFM, but none (to the best of our knowledge) has done so in terms of intrinsic material properties. Here we use a rheological standard glass, which has been powdered and then sintered for different times (up to 32 hours) at high temperature (675°C) in order to achieve a sample suite with porosities in the range of 0.10-0.45 gas volume fraction. This sample suite was then subjected to mechanical tests in a uniaxial press at a constant strain rate of 10-3 s-1 and a temperature in the region of the glass transition. A dual acoustic emission (AE) rig has been employed to test the success of the FFM in these materials of systematically varying porosity. The pore-emanating crack model describes well the peak stress at failure in the elastic regime for these materials. We show that the FFM predicts failure within 0-15% error at porosities >0.2. However, when porosities are <0.2, the forecast error associated with predicting the failure time increases to >100%. We interpret these results as a function of the low efficiency with which strain energy can be released in the scenario where there are few or no heterogeneities from which cracks can propagate. These observations shed light on questions surrounding the variable efficacy of the FFM applied to active volcanoes. In particular, they provide a systematic demonstration of the fact that a good understanding of the material properties is required. Thus, we wish to emphasize the need for a better coupling of empirical failure forecasting models with mechanical parameters, such as failure criteria for heterogeneous materials, and point to the implications of this for a broad range of material-based disciplines.",

            "abstract": "In noncohesive sediments, hydraulic roughness of the seafloor is strongly dependent on bedform morphology, so prediction of bedform morphology is a critical component of sediment transport models. Ripple dimensions are usually predicted from a parameterization of wave energy and bed-sediment grain size. In some coastal environments currents are strong enough to mobilize sediment, but few data are available from either laboratory or field studies to determine the influence of combinations of waves and currents on bedform morphology and evolution. We are investigating the influence of varying combinations of waves and currents on bedform orientation and evolution on the south side of the Strait of Juan de Fuca near the mouth of the Elwha River (water depth 8 m). Median bed-sediment grain size is 130 microns. We measured hydrodynamic forcing and ripple morphology frequently (every 10 to 15 min) to investigate ripple evolution in response to changes in forcing. An imaging sonar captured bedform wavelength (λ) and orientation over 40 m2 of the seafloor, and an optical system measured λ, bedform orientation, and height over approximately 0.7 m2. Ripples were mostly suborbital (based on the ratio of wave orbital diameter do to median grain size), with λ between 10 and 20 cm, and λ decreased with increasing do. Ripple heights ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 cm. Bed shear stress was usually dominated by waves, but at times the current shear stress was as great as that of waves. During the two week study period two major shifts in ripple orientation occurred. In the first, the wave direction shifted from 310° to 360° (clockwise from N) over one hour, and ripple orientation shifted from 310° to 350° over 3.25 hours. Following a day of calm conditions northwesterly waves resumed, and the ripple direction shifted back to 310° in 3.25 hours. During periods of relatively low bed shear stress (less than 0.5 N/m2, or 3 times the critical shear stress) λ increased gradually, in one case over two days. In contrast, λ decreased rapidly when bed shear stress exceeded 1 N/m2 (do about 1 m): there were four instances in which λ decreased by 30% over one to two hours. Predictions of bedform morphology can be improved by taking into account the response time of ripples to hydrodynamic forcing, which can be characterized using high frequency data such as these.",

            "abstract": "In today’s North Atlantic, warm tropical surface waters flow northwards into the Nordic Seas where they cool and sink to form deep south-flowing currents. This deepwater formation process is a major contributor to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and is of great importance to the climate system as it distributes nutrients, heat and gasses throughout the world’s oceans. The Nordic Overflows are the deep waters that flow southwards over the submarine Greenland-Scotland Ridge and are the densest waters of the deep limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Changes in the vigour of these overflows may have had important climatic effects in the past and possibly in the future. Yet, evidence for multidecadal to millennial changes in the deep limb of the AMOC and their potential relationship to North Atlantic climate variability during our current interglacial is still scarce.\n Here we present grain size data (a current speed proxy) from sub to decadally resolved sediment cores located in the direct pathway of the two Nordic Overflows east and west of Iceland, the Iceland Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) and the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW), respectively. The results do not show a clear relationship between changes in the vigour of the Nordic Overflows and the well-known periods of centennial-scale climate variability recorded in the North Atlantic region. However, clear millennial-scale trends are found in both of the overflow strength records over the last 3000 years, possibly related to hydrographic reorganisations in the Nordic Seas driven by Northern Hemisphere insolation changes over the Neoglacial. A comparison between the near-bottom flow speed reconstructions from ISOW and DSOW suggest an antiphased relationship between the Nordic Overflows east and west of Iceland over the last 3000 years, a feature that has been observed in climate models as a result of shifts in atmospheric patterns over the Nordic Seas.",

On January 22, 2014, the Alaska Earthquake Center recorded a Deep Long Period earthquake (DLP), magnitude 1.7, at 40 km depth north of the Denali Fault. The epicenter for this event was <5 km of broadband station TRF, so the depth is well constrained. The DLP event is almost devoid of energy above 5 Hz. Receiver functions for stations TRF and SBL, both <10 km of the epicenter, show Moho depths of 36-40 km.\nWe used waveforms of this DLP as a template event for network matched filtering, which identifies similar signals in continuous time series. We processed this template event from June 1999 to July 2014. We use several matches produced by this template as additional templates, iterating the process. Using this methodology, we identify over 300 DLP’s. Events typically come in swarms lasting hours to days with no events exceeding magnitude 2. Swarms are separated by months to years of little detectable activity. A swarm of events on June 30, 2001 coincides with the Broadband Experiment Across the Alaska Range (BEAAR) seismic deployment, and was recorded by 15 broadband seismometers within 100 km of the epicenter. A preliminary waveform inversion for the focal mechanism of this event results in isotropic (implosive) and double couple components.\nWe argue that these DLP’s are evidence of magmatic or volatile movement through the sub-arc mantle wedge, even though there is no active volcanism at the surface. Relative relocations, utilizing cross correlated p- and s- waveforms, highlight a nest of seismicity with no structures such as planes or conduits. Lack of planar features, as well as the isotopic component and lack of strike slip to the focal mechanism, may argue against a deep extension of the Hines Creek or Denali faults (both strike-slip) as a source for the DLP’s (as is the case for low frequency earthquakes along the deep extension of the San Andreas). High Poisson’s ratios have been inferred for the sub-arc mantle wedge by McNamera and Pasyanos (2002), and in the crust north of Denali (Rossi et al., 2006), suggesting the presence of volatiles or magma migrating through to the crust.",

A previous compositional study of the kimberlite considered classifying the kimberlite, either Group I or Group II, to be problematic. Major and trace element (including REE) analysis using X-ray Fluoresence and ICP-MS was performed on a sample collected from the dike by the Washington State University GeoAnalytical lab in order to better classify the kimberlite as Group I or II. Comparison of major elements to South African kimberlite suggests that the Gates-Adah kimberlite most closely resembles a Group I kimberlite. Comparable major element concentrations between South African Group I kimberlite and Gates-Adah kimberlite include TiO2, Al2O3, FeO, MgO, and CaO. Assessment of calculated clay mineral and tectosilicate content relative to unaltered phlogopite and olivine was performed using a contamination equation in order to understand the extent of emplacement conditions and weathering of the kimberlite using weight percent of normalized major elements (contamination index C.I.). Uncontaminated Group I kimberlite has a C.I. near 1.0 and some apparently fresh and contamination-free micaceous Group II kimberlite has a C.I. up to 1.5 . The Gates-Adah kimberlite has a C.I. level of 1.14 suggesting greater similarity to a Group I kimberlite. Similarly an Ilmenite index (Ilm.I.) was calculated using the weight percents of normalized major elements to further classify the Gates-Adah kimberlite. Group I kimberlite and Group II kimberlite should not exceed 0.52 and 0.47, respectively and the Gates-Adah kimberlite has an Ilm.I. of 0.42. Two thin sections were produced from the Gates-Adah kimberlite dike. Minerals present in Group I kimberlite include: Olivine, phlogopite, serpentine, ilmenite, and diopside. Phenocrysts of anhedral serpentinized olivine were found along with ilmenite, diopside, enstatie, and phlogopite in thin section. Large phenocrysts of olivine were more heavily weathered then smaller grains within the groundmass. Hand samples show macrocrysts and phenocrysts of olivine and phlogopites.

            "abstract": "Both air temperature and incoming solar radiation influence the seasonal pattern of snow- and ice-melt in glacierised Alpine basins, so that glacier-fed rivers have distinctive regimes with more than 90% of flow occurring in the months April through October. Snow melt increases discharge slowly in April and May, before the transient snow line starts to rise, exposing glacier ice to melt and leading to flow maxima in late July/early August. Meltwater temperature is inversely related to discharge as well as being positively influenced by energy and heat availability. Close to glacier termini, water temperatures reach maxima in spring, before decreasing as the volume of water being heated increases with rising discharge. Records of meltwater temperature and discharge for rivers draining basins with between 17 and 80% glacierisation in Kantons Bern and Wallis, Switzerland, have been examined, together with measurements of radiation and 2 m air temperatures at stations close to or in the catchment areas, at hourly resolution, within the period 2003-2013. The aims were to characterise seasonal and diurnal patterns of variation of meltwater temperature and to assess impacts of energy availability, discharge, distance downstream to measurement site, and percentage cover of basin with snow and ice on temperature. On a diurnal basis, water temperature increases before discharge rises, reducing as runoff reaches daily peak. Diurnal temperature ranges are greatest during times of relatively low flows in spring. On a seasonal scale, water temperature peaks in spring before the main discharge period. Temperatures remain in relatively limited ranges, and are suppressed during high flows in the main ablation season. Summer reduction in temperature is larger the more highly glacierised the basin and the closer to the glacier terminus. A simple radiation-forced model has been used to assess relationships between discharge, water surface area, flow velocity and length of time of water exposure to energy input",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of potential large-scale (about 400,000 km2) and medium-scale (about 60,000 km2) irrigation on the climate of West Africa using the MIT Regional Climate Model. A new irrigation module is implemented to assess the impact of location and scheduling of irrigation on rainfall distribution over West Africa. A control simulation (without irrigation) and various sensitivity experiments (with irrigation) are performed and compared to discern the effects of irrigation location, size and scheduling. In general, the irrigation-induced surface cooling due to anomalously wet soil tends to suppress moist convection and rainfall, which in turn induces local subsidence and low level anti-cyclonic circulation. These local effects are dominated by a consistent reduction of local rainfall over the irrigated land, irrespective of its location. However, the remote response of rainfall distribution to irrigation exhibits a significant sensitivity to the latitudinal position of irrigation. The low-level northeasterly flow associated with anti-cyclonic circulation centered over the irrigation area can enhance the extent of low level convergence through interaction with the prevailing monsoon flow, leading to significant increase in rainfall. Despite much reduced forcing of irrigation water, the medium-scale irrigation seems to draw the same response as large-scale irrigation, which supports the robustness of the response to irrigation in our modeling system. Both large-scale and medium-scale irrigation experiments show that an optimal irrigation location and scheduling exists that would lead to a more efficient use of irrigation water. The approach of using a regional climate model to investigate the impact of location and size of irrigation schemes may be the first step in incorporating land-atmosphere interactions in the design of location and size of irrigation projects. However, this theoretical approach is still in early stages of development and further research is needed before any practical application in water resources planning.\nAcknowledgements.\nThis research was supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore through the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's Center for Environmental Sensing and Modeling interdisciplinary research program.",

Simulation domains are constructed from highly resolved microtomographic images of sediment and rock samples using implicit functions to represent the mineral surface locally on a grid. A Cartesian grid embedded boundary method, whereby interfacial surfaces are described by a cut-cell approach, is used to directly account for the surface area available for reaction—rather than treating the reactive surface area as a continuum-scale parameter. Adaptive mesh refinement is used effectively as a multiscale approach with high resolution used to resolve small pore spaces while a coarser mesh is employed in large pore spaces. Simulations of dissolution experiments on limestone and on fractured dolomite are used to demonstrate the simulation capability, which is used to investigate the effect of transport processes on effective reaction rates, including mixing processes and transport limitations to reactive surfaces.",

            "abstract": "The United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) W-9 gage at the headwaters of Sleepers River, Vermont has been monitored for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration for more than 20 years. However, the sources of this DOC during base flow and hydrologic events remain unclear. The major objectives of this research were to identify sources of DOC during storm events and to explain the observed DOC-streamflow counterclockwise hysteresis during hydrologic events. Two main hypotheses to explain hysteresis during hydrologic events were tested: (1) distant headwater wetlands are the major DOC source, which lags behind peak flow due to travel time; and (2) the entire watershed contributes to the DOC at the gage, but the response of DOC lags behind the period when groundwater contributes most to streamflow. Sources of DOC were tracked using fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) sensors in surface water and groundwater wells. Wells were installed at four depths, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 m, at four sites: a peaty low-gradient riparian area near the headwaters; a mid-hillslope area on a long hillslope mid-watershed; a near-stream area on a long hillslope mid-watershed; and a low-gradient tributary confluence area just above the gage. During storm events, FDOM and hydraulic head were measured at the nested groundwater wells. Samples for DOC analysis were also taken to determine the relationship between FDOM and DOC. Results suggest that both distant sources and the greater watershed played a role in the transport of DOC to the W-9 gage. Distant peaty sources dominated during large storms and contributed the highest surface water FDOM measurements. The peak FDOM at the gage was therefore best described as a result of transport. However, export from these distant sources terminated rapidly and did not explain continued elevated FDOM at the gage. Groundwater across the watershed exhibited hysteresis analogous to that in the stream itself, with FDOM peaking as head receded. As groundwater is recharged, the water table intersects more carbon rich soil layers. Pre-event water is flushed out first before event water mobilizes DOC, causing the groundwater hysteresis. High FDOM groundwater discharging to the stream likely sustained elevated FDOM at the gage. The gage hysteresis, therefore, seems to be a result of both hypotheses tested.",

            "abstract": "Development of satellite based precipitation retrieval algorithms and using them in hydroclimatic studies have been of great interest to hydrologists. It is important to understand the uncertainty associated with precipitation products and how they further contribute to the variability in stream flow simulation. In this study a mixture model of Generalized Normal Distribution and Gamma distribution (GND-G) is used to model the joint probability distribution of satellite-based (PERSIANN) and stage IV radar rainfall. The study area for constructing the uncertainty model covers a 15°×15°box of 0.25°×0.25° cells over the eastern United States for summer 2004 to 2009. Cells are aggregated in space and time to obtain data with different resolutions for the construction of the model’s parameter space.\nThis uncertainty model is evaluated using data from National Weather Service (NWS) Distributed Hydrologic Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 2 (DMIP 2) basin over Illinois River basin south of Siloam, OK. This data covers the time period of 2006 to 2008.The uncertainty range of precipitation is estimated. The impact of precipitation uncertainty to the stream flow estimation is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulation of precipitation forcing in the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model. The results show that using precipitation along with its uncertainty distribution as forcing to SAC-SMA make it possible to have an estimation of the uncertainty associated with the stream flow simulation ( in this case study %90 confidence interval is used). The mean of this stream flow confidence interval is compared to the reference stream flow for evaluation of the model and the results show that this method helps to better estimate the variability of the stream flow simulation along with its statistics e.g. percent bias and root mean squared error.",

            "abstract": "Over the past half century, epochs of enhanced and suppressed ENSO activity have coincided with changes in mean trade wind strength (tropical Pacific mean state) and westerly wind burst variability. Previous research has considered this westerly wind burst variability as state-dependent noise forcing for ENSO. In agreement with the observations, we find that in the current generation of coupled climate models, the westerly wind burst variability is highly correlated with decadal and multi-decadal scale Pacific mean state variability as well as ENSO variability. However, precisely how concurrent changes to ENSO, the tropical Pacific mean state, and westerly wind burst variability is still an open question. Our previous research has shown that there is a relationship between the magnitude of the state-dependence of the noise forcing and ENSO amplitude asymmetry (i.e. that the El Nino events have a larger temperature anomaly than the La Nina events) . In turn, ENSO amplitude asymmetry can produce a signal on the tropical Pacific mean state on multi-decadal timescales. Here, we develop a systematic method to investigate the hypothesis that the inherent randomness of the state-dependent noise forcing of ENSO can explain the coincident changes in ENSO variability and the tropical Pacific mean state, using a hierarchy of coupled models, from conceptual to intermediate to coupled GCMs.",

            "abstract": "Based on GPS and seismic data, we examine the spatiotemporal evolution of a slow slip event (SSE) and associated seismic activity that occurred off the Boso peninsula, central Japan, from December 2013 to January 2014. We use GPS data from 71 stations of the GEONET and 6 stations operated by Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo and Tohoku University around the Boso peninsula. We apply a modified version of the Network Inversion Filter to the GPS time series at the 77 stations to estimate the spatiotemporal evolution of daily cumulative slip and slip rate on the subducting Philippine Sea plate. In addition, we create an improved earthquake catalog by applying a matched filter technique to continuous seismograms and examine the spatiotemporal relations between slow slip and seismicity. We find that the SSE started in early December 2013. The spatiotemporal evolution of slow slip and seismicity is divided into two distinct phases, an earlier slow phase from early to 30 December 2013 (Phase I) and a subsequent faster phase from 30 December 2013 to 9 January 2014 (Phase II). During Phase I, slip accelerated slowly up to a maximum rate of 1.6 m/yr with potentially accelerating　along-strike propagation at speeds on the order of 1 km/day or less and no accompanying seismicity. On the other hand, during Phase II, slip accelerated rapidly up to a maximum rate of 4.5 m/yr and then rapidly decelerated. The slip front propagated along strike at a constant speed of ~10 km/day. During the Phase II, slow slip was accompanied by seismic swarm activity that was highly correlated in space and time with slip rate, suggesting that the swarm activity was triggered by stress loading due to slow slip. Early slow acceleration of slip has not been identified in the past Boso SSEs in 1996, 2002, 2007, and 2011. It is not clear at this point whether the past Boso SSEs started with slow acceleration similarly to the 2013-2014 SSE. The transition from the slow to the faster phase shares some similarities with the nucleation of megathrust earthquakes inferred from foreshock activities, suggesting that SSEs may provide insights into the nucleation of large earthquakes.",

The Normalized Input-Output Minimization Method (NIOM) has been employed to correlate the ground motion waveforms recorded at various depths of the geotechnical arrays, and to calculate the P- and S- wave travel times and velocities between the depths at which the seismic sensors have been installed. As of August 2014, the California Geological Survey’s Strong-Motion Instrumentation Program (CGS CSMIP) operates 35 geotechnical arrays, a large number of them with cooperation of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). As of this date, 140 records from 68 earthquakes with magnitude 3.5 and larger have been recorded at 28 geotechnical arrays. The records are available for download through the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (CESMD), the joint center of the U.S. Geological Survey and the California Geological Survey. The velocities obtained in this study for the cases of weak and strong shaking are compared with the measured velocities at the geotechnical array sites obtained using geophysical methods such as SASW, PS suspension logging and downhole methods. The average shear wave velocities in the upper 30 m of the geotechnical arrays from this study are compared with the Vs30 values from geophysical investigations. Application of wave propagation analysis is especially important in studying the dynamic characteristics of ground layers during high stress ground shaking and yields average values for a larger area under a site as opposed to the area in the very close vicinity of the geotechnical array.",

Its genesis involves tight interactions between biota and mineral surfaces that mobilize structural elements into biogeochemical cycles. Of all chemical elements rare earth elements (REE) are a group of 16 non-nutrient elements of unusual geochemical similarity and present in all components of the surface environment. While much is known about the role of major nutrients in soil development we lack vital understanding of how early biotic colonization affects more conservative elements such as REE.\nA highly controlled experiment was set up at University of Arizona’s Biosphere-2 that tested the effect of 4 biological treatments, incorporating a combination of microbe, grass, mycorrhiza and uninoculated control on REE leaching and uptake in 4 bedrock substrates: basalt, rhyolite, granite and schist. Generally the response of REE to biota presence was synergistic. Variation in total bedrock chemistry could explain major trends in pore water REE. There was a fast transition from chemistry-dominated to a biota dominated environment in the first 3-4 months of inoculation/seeding which translated into increase in REE signal over time. Relative REE abundances in water were generally reflected in plant concentrations, particularly in root, implying that below ground biomass is the main sync of REE in the ecosystem. Mycorrhiza effect on REE uptake in plant organs was significant and increased with infection rates. Presence of different biota translated into subtle differences in REE release, reveling potential biosignatures of biolota-rock colonization. The results thus bring fundamental insight into early stages non-nutrient cycle and soil genesis.",

            "abstract": "With use of modern computing power and advanced sensor networks, a project is underway to establish a new system of real-time tsunami inundation forecasting, damage estimation and mapping to enhance society’s resilience in the aftermath of major tsunami disaster. The system consists of fusion of real-time crustal deformation monitoring/fault model estimation by Ohta et al. (2012), high-performance real-time tsunami propagation/inundation modeling with NEC’s vector supercomputer SX-ACE, damage/loss estimation models (Koshimura et al., 2013), and geo-informatics.\nAfter a major (near field) earthquake is triggered, the first response of the system is to identify the tsunami source model by applying RAPiD Algorithm (Ohta et al., 2012) to observed RTK-GPS time series at GEONET sites in Japan. As performed in the data obtained during the 2011 Tohoku event, we assume less than 10 minutes as the acquisition time of the source model. Given the tsunami source, the system moves on to running tsunami propagation and inundation model which was optimized on the vector supercomputer SX-ACE to acquire the estimation of time series of tsunami at offshore/coastal tide gauges to determine tsunami travel and arrival time, extent of inundation zone, maximum flow depth distribution. The implemented tsunami numerical model is based on the non-linear shallow-water equations discretized by finite difference method. The merged bathymetry and topography grids are prepared with 10 m resolution to better estimate the tsunami inland penetration. Given the maximum flow depth distribution, the system performs GIS analysis to determine the numbers of exposed population and structures using census data, then estimates the numbers of potential death and damaged structures by applying tsunami fragility curve (Koshimura et al., 2013). Since the tsunami source model is determined, the model is supposed to complete the estimation within 10 minutes. The results are disseminated as mapping products to responders and stakeholders, e.g. national and regional municipalities, to be utilized for their emergency/response activities. In 2014, the system is verified through the case studies of 2011 Tohoku event and potential earthquake scenarios along Nankai Trough with regard to its capability and robustness.",

            "abstract": "Although the emission performance of gas-turbine engines burning renewable aviation fuels have been thoroughly documented in recent ground-based studies, there is still great uncertainty regarding how the fuels effect aircraft exhaust composition and contrail formation at cruise altitudes. To fill this information gap, the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate sponsored the ACCESS flight series to make detailed measurements of trace gases, aerosols and ice particles in the near-field behind the NASA DC-8 aircraft as it burned either standard petroleum-based fuel of varying sulfur content or a 50:50 blend of standard fuel and a hydro-treated esters and fatty acid (HEFA) jet fuel produced from camelina plant oil. ACCESS 1, conducted in spring 2013 near Palmdale CA, focused on refining flight plans and sampling techniques and used the instrumented NASA Langley HU-25 aircraft to document DC-8 emissions and contrails on five separate flights of ~2 hour duration. ACCESS 2, conducted from Palmdale in May 2014, engaged partners from the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) and National Research Council-Canada to provide additional scientific expertise and sampling aircraft (Falcon 20 and CT-133, respectively) with more extensive trace gas, particle, or air motion measurement capability. Eight, muliti-aircraft research flights of 2 to 4 hour duration were conducted to document the emissions and contrail properties of the DC-8 as it 1) burned low sulfur Jet A, high sulfur Jet A or low sulfur Jet A/HEFA blend, 2) flew at altitudes between 6 and 11 km, and 3) operated its engines at three different fuel flow rates. This presentation further describes the ACCESS flight experiments, examines fuel type and thrust setting impacts on engine emissions, and compares cruise-altitude observations with similar data acquired in ground-test venues.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic ash is often deposited in a hot state. Volcanic ash containing glass, deposited above the glass transition interval, has the potential to sinter viscously both to itself (particle-particle) and to exposed surfaces. Here, we constrain the kinetics of this process experimentally under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions using standard glasses and volcanic ash. In the absence of external load, this process is dominantly driven by surface relaxation. In such cases the sintering process is rate-limited by the melt viscosity, the size of the particles and the melt-vapour interfacial tension. We propose a polydisperse continuum model that describes the transition from a packing of particles to a dense pore-free melt and evaluate its efficacy in describing the kinetics of volcanic viscous sintering. We apply our model to viscous sintering scenarios for cooling crystal-poor rhyolitic ash using the 2008 eruption of Chaitén volcano as a case example. We predict that moderate cooling rates result in the common observation of incomplete sintering and the preservation of pore networks. Finally we discuss the effect of crystallisation, external loading and volatile degassing or regassing during viscous sintering and assert that such complexities must be considered in the volcanic scenario.",

            "abstract": "The parameters influencing species diversity in natural ecosystems are difficult to assess due to the long and experimentally prohibitive timescales needed to develop causative relationships among measurements. Ecological diversity-disturbance models suggest that disturbance is a mechanism for increased species diversity, allowing for coexistence of species at an intermediate level of disturbance. Observing this mechanism often requires long timescales, such as the succession of a forest after a fire. In this study we evaluated the effect of mixing of two end member hydrothermal fluids on the diversity and structure of a microbial community where disturbance occurs on small temporal and spatial scales. Outflow channels from two hot springs of differing geochemical composition in Yellowstone National Park, one pH 3.3 and 36 °C and the other pH 7.6 and 61 °C flow together to create a mixing zone on the order of a few meters. Geochemical measurements were made at both in-coming streams and at a site of complete mixing downstream of the mixing zone, at pH 6.5 and 46 °C. Compositions were estimated across the mixing zone at 1 cm intervals using microsensor temperature and conductivity measurements and a mixing model. Qualitatively, there are four distinct ecotones existing over ranges in temperature and pH across the mixing zone. Community analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of these ecotones show a peak in diversity at maximal mixing. Principle component analysis of community 16S rRNA genes reflects coexistence of species with communities at maximal mixing plotting intermediate to communities at distal ends of the mixing zone. These spatial biological and geochemical observations suggest that the mixing zone is a dynamic ecosystem where geochemistry and biological diversity are governed by changes in the flow rate and geochemical composition of the two hot spring sources. In ecology, understanding how environmental disruption increases species diversity is a foundation for ecosystem conservation. By studying a hot spring environment where detailed measurements of geochemical variation and community diversity can be made at small spatial scales, the mechanisms by which maximal diversity is achieved can be tested and may assist in applications of diversity-disturbance models for larger ecosystems.

            "abstract": "Hard X-ray observation of partly occulted flares has proven useful for studying flare-accelerated electrons in the solar corona. These nonthermal electrons emit bremsstrahlung hard X-rays (HXRs), but are difficult to observe for on-disk flares because the much brighter chromospheric footpoints tend to dominate HXR images. Previous research using the RHESSI spacecraft has performed individual and statistical study of HXR sources in partly occulted flares to investigate, for example, spectral characteristics and the relationship between nonthermal coronal sources and thermal loops.\nSource heights are not usually measured in these cases because of the difficulty in determining heliographic locations of flares beyond the limb. Occasionally, multi-spacecraft observation will identify a source location and thus calculate an absolute HXR source height. Microflare source heights have also been studied statistically by fitting distribution functions to the observed projected locations. But so far, a statistical study of coronal HXR sources in which source heights are determined individually for each flare has not been performed.\nIn this work, we study flares jointly observed by RHESSI and STEREO/EUVI over a 2+ year time range. From RHESSI data, we obtain coronal HXR source positions and fluxes. The alternate viewing angle offered by STEREO provides flare locations, enabling RHESSI source positions to be translated into absolute heights above the photosphere. We will present the distribution of coronal HXR source heights and will discuss their possible corresponding features in the standard flare model, i.e. thermal loops, nonthermal looptop sources, above-the-looptop sources, and ejecta.",

Two USDA agencies, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and Risk Management Agency (RMA), make decisions on flood statistics, crop insurance policy, and recovery management by collecting, analyzing, reporting, and utilizing flooded crop acreage and crop loss information. NASS has the mandate to report crop loss after all flood events. RMA manages crop insurance policy and uses crop loss information to guide the creation of the crop insurance policy and the aftermath compensation.\nMany studies have been conducted in the recent years on monitoring floods and assessing the crop loss due to floods with remote sensing and geographic information technologies. The Remote-sensing-based Flood Crop Loss Assessment Service System (RF-CLASS), being developed with NASA and USDA support, aims to significantly improve the post-flood agricultural decision-making supports in USDA by integrating and advancing the recently developed technologies. RF-CLASS will operationally provide information to support USDA decision making activities on collecting and archiving flood acreage and duration, recording annual crop loss due to flood, assessing the crop insurance rating areas, investigating crop policy compliance, and spot checking of crop loss claims. This presentation will discuss the remote sensing and GIS based methods for deriving the needed information to support the decision making, the RF-CLASS cybersystem architecture, the standards and interoperability arrangements in the system, and the current and planned capabilities of the system.",

            "abstract": "The impact of seasonal water stress on Africa’s tropical regions has yet to be characterized despite drought’s potential to cause famine and a reduction of biodiversity across the continent. Through the analysis of a new data set of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2, we demonstrate that fluorescence varies with water availability, particularly over regions with distinctive wet and dry seasons. Water availability was determined via both precipitation (from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project) and daytime canopy water content measurements (from the SeaWinds Scatterometer onboard the QuickSCAT satellite). Variance in SIF values was largely explained by both canopy water content and precipitation, which paralleled one-another. When viewed in the context of the previously defined relationship between fluorescence and gross primary production (GPP) – SIF scales linearly with GPP – our results suggest that photosynthetic activity in tropical Africa is limited by water availability. The characterization of this trend is critical in defining the response of tropical ecosystems to water stress and corroborating similar relationships in other tropical regions (e.g. Amazonia). Ultimately, the viability of Africa’s tropical regions amidst a changing climate is rooted in its ecosystem-wide response to water stress; the future of the African tropics is limited by how well plants cope with water stress.",

In our previous work, we used citation analysis to investigate the use of data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and identify the extent of interdisciplinary use, based on the subject classifications of citing journals. We also proposed and tested a taxonomy of data integration and use on a selection of peer-reviewed scientific articles that cited both remote sensing data and socioeconomic data from SEDAC. We extend both of these analyses here. We analyze the interdisciplinary use of SEDAC data over a seven-year period including the types and topical areas of application observed. We also explore the degree to which different types of data integration and use are leading to further “downstream” research and applications, and if objective measures can be developed using bibliometric methods to quantify downstream use and impact in meaningful ways. These methods include both traditional citation analysis and searches of the informal literature and online resources. Better understanding of how disparate data and information has been utilized to address new interdisciplinary problems will help the data user and provider communities improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their efforts. It should also provide justification for further investments in linking different data resources and networks across scientific fields, in methods of interdisciplinary data integration, and in application of integrated data to societal problems.",

            "abstract": "Aftershocks of the 2013 Balochistan earthquake are mainly concentrated along the northeastern end of the mainshock rupture despite of much larger coseismic slip to the southwest. The largest event among them is an Mw6.8 earthquake which occurred three days after the mainshock. A kinematic slip model of the mainshock was obtained by joint inversion of the teleseismic body-waves and horizontal static deformation field derived from remote sensing optical and SAR data, which is composed of seven fault segments with gradually changing strikes and dips [Avouac et al., 2014]. The remote sensing data provide well constraints on the fault geometry and spatial distribution of slip but no timing information. Meanwhile, the initiation of the teleseismic waveform is very sensitive to fault geometry of the epicenter segment (strike and dip) and spatial slip distribution but much less sensitive to the absolute location of the epicenter. The combination of the two data sets allows a much better determination of the absolute epicenter location, which is about 25km to the southwest of the NEIC epicenter location. The well located mainshock epicenter is used to establish path calibrations for teleseismic P-waves, which are essential for relocating the Mw6.8 aftershock. Our grid search shows that the refined epicenter is located right at the northeastern end of the mainshock rupture. This is confirmed by the SAR offsets calculated from images acquired after the mainshock. The azimuth and range offsets display a discontinuity across the rupture trace of the mainshock. Teleseismic only and static only, as well as joint inversions all indicate that the aftershock ruptured an asperity with 25km along strike and range from 8km to 20km in depth. The earthquake was originated in a positive Coulomb stress change regime due to the mainshock and has complementary slip distribution to the mainshock rupture at the northeastern end, suggesting that the entire seismic generic zone in the crust was ruptured during the earthquake sequence.",

            "abstract": "The ability of spaceborne radars to detect and measure clouds and precipitation globally is affected by their inherent sensitivity limits, by attenuation of the microwave radiation in the atmosphere, and by variability of the precipitation over scales smaller than the radar footprint. Effective design of radars and the interpretation of their measurements require that the influence of these phenomena on their performance be quantified. Such quantification is hindered by the incompleteness of the existing reference measurements.\nSimulation of radar observations from atmospheric models can be used as an alternative to direct measurements, but most models either operate on a local scale and are thus not globally representative, or else are too coarse in their resolution to simulate sub-footprint scale phenomena. This gap is currently being bridged by global cloud resolving models, which simulate the entire atmosphere at scales approaching that of individual clouds. We have simulated spaceborne radar measurements globally from a run of the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) at a resolution of 800 m.\nA radar single scattering model was developed for each of the five NICAM cloud and precipitation particle classes: cloud ice, cloud water, rain, snow and graupel, retaining consistency with the model microphysics assumptions. Additionally, regions with melting snowflakes were considered separately, as they have a pronounced effect on radar observations. The results of the single scattering calculations were then used in a time-dependent radiative transfer model in order to simulate attenuation and multiple scattering effects. Finally, the simulated observations were spatially averaged to reproduce the effect of a radar footprint larger than a single grid point. Using this approach, we can estimate the performance of various radar configurations in current and future Earth observing satellite missions.",

            "abstract": "Bogotá, Colombia, is rapidly growing and is about to implement regulation to reduce air pollution. This presentation details how the emissions were prepared for air quality simulations using the Sparse Matrix Operating Kernel for Emissions (SMOKE). The motivation to use SMOKE is to provide an emissions scenario to the WRF-CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality) modeling system to make air quality predictions that quantify the outcome of potential emission reduction strategies.\nData was taken from the emission inventories created for service stations and for industrial, commercial and mobile sources, all of which had information provided by the local environmental agency. These inventories were formatted as inputs, which required a matching of Colombian source and industrial codes and speciation profiles with those from the United States. This pairing was imperfect, but the potential error is reduced by SMOKE’s preference for more specific information.\nTo allocate the emissions, SMOKE requires temporal distributions as fractional values of the total annual, weekly or daily sum. This was calculated from the emission inventories for service stations and industrial and commercial sources, while traffic counts were used for mobile sources. For the grid, all point and area sources were connected to a specific latitude and longitude pair, while mobile sources used links to identify their location on a given road segment. Any required but unavailable local data was either estimated or supplanted with the default values from the EPA. Once SMOKE was successfully run, the inputs were changed to reflect the proposed reduction strategies. The outcomes were evaluated to determine the optimal solution.\nThis presentation aims to show the methods used to implement SMOKE with Bogotá's emission inventories from 2012 for the purpose of quantifying air quality outcomes. Challenges inherent to this project include a lack of available information for the city, which may be common to other developing countries. The result of this project is the use of CMAQ's modeling results for the evaluation and optimization of the proposed regulatory strategies.",

            "abstract": "Models used for simulation of photosynthesis and transpiration by canopies of terrestrial plants typically have subroutines such as STOMATA.F90, PHOSIB.F90 or BIOCHEM.m that solve for photosynthesis and associated processes. Key parameters such as the Vmax for Rubisco and temperature response parameters are required by these subroutines. These are often taken from the literature or determined by separate analysis of gas exchange experiments. It is useful to note however that subroutines can be extracted and run as standalone models to simulate leaf responses collected in gas exchange experiments. Furthermore, there are excellent non-linear fitting tools that can be used to optimize the parameter values in these models to fit the observations. Ideally the Vmax fit in this way should be the same as that determined by a separate analysis, but it may not because of interactions with other kinetic constants and the temperature dependence of these in the full subroutine. We submit that it is more useful to fit the complete model to the calibration experiments rather as disaggregated constants. We designed a graphical user interface (GUI) based tool that uses gas exchange photosynthesis data to directly estimate model parameters in the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) model and, at the same time, allow researchers to change parameters interactively to visualize how variation in model parameters affect predicted outcomes such as photosynthetic rates, electron transport, and chlorophyll fluorescence. We have also ported some of this functionality to an Excel spreadsheet, which could be used as a teaching tool to help integrate process-oriented and model-oriented studies.",

The objectives of this study are (1) Identification of regional spatial patterns of each LULC conversion, (2) Estimation of the area coverage of each LULC conversion, and (3) Estimation of the net gain and losses of each LULC classes. To achieve these objectives, ArcGIS Spatial analysis functions and data management tools were employed in python environment.

Through visual analysis and comparisons with aerial imagery, we established that NLCD 1992 and 2001 datasets contained more classification inaccuracies than the NOAA 2011 dataset. The misclassified cells in the 1992 and 2001 NLCD datasets were corrected to be consistent with the 2011 C-CAP dataset. The NLCD 2001 dataset was first corrected using a logical evaluation with 2011 classes in each pixel. Then the NLCD 1992 dataset was corrected using the correct 2001 dataset. After correcting 1992 dataset, a cell by cell comparison was conducted with the NOAA 2011 dataset, and individual changes were recorded.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) typically employ only a small set of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) to represent the vast diversity of observed vegetation forms and functioning. There is growing evidence, however, that this abstraction may not adequately represent the observed variation in plant functional traits, which is thought to play an important role for many ecosystem functions and for ecosystem resilience to environmental change. The geographic distribution of PFTs in these models is also often based on empirical relationships between present-day climate and vegetation patterns. Projections of future climate change, however, point toward the possibility of novel regional climates, which could lead to no-analog vegetation compositions incompatible with the PFT paradigm.\nHere, we present results from the Jena Diversity-DGVM (JeDi-DGVM), a novel traits-based vegetation model, which simulates a large number of hypothetical plant growth strategies constrained by functional tradeoffs, thereby allowing for a more flexible temporal and spatial representation of the terrestrial biosphere.\nFirst, we compare simulated present-day geographical patterns of functional traits with empirical trait observations (in-situ and from airborne imaging spectroscopy). The observed trait patterns are then used to improve the tradeoff parameterizations of JeDi-DGVM. Finally, focusing primarily on the simulated leaf traits, we run the model with various amounts of trait diversity. We quantify the effects of these modeled biodiversity manipulations on simulated ecosystem fluxes and stocks for both present-day conditions and transient climate change scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the coarse treatment of plant functional traits by current PFT-based vegetation models may contribute substantial uncertainty regarding carbon-climate feedbacks. Further development of trait-based models and further investment in global in-situ and spectroscopic plant trait observations are needed.",

To quantify GHG emissions from lakes and reservoirs we coupled a lake carbon model (HLCM), a newly developed 1-dimension (1-D) thermal stratification model, and a terrestrial biogeochemistry model (DNDC) that is able to represent soil carbon dynamics under flooded conditions. We present here the first results of the newly coupled model, FAQ-DNDC. We evaluated the model for what mechanisms governs the CO2 emissions from a newly created shallow boreal reservoir, Eastmain-1, in northern Quebec, Canada. We compared simulated CO2 fluxes against eddy covariance tower measurements during the period of 2007-2012. The observed peak emissions in spring were simulated because water column might lose the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) accumulated through the ice-cover period in winter. The observed and simulated annual CO2 emissions from the reservoir surface gradually decline with reservoir age. The sensitivity analysis showed that CO2 emissions in high-latitude shallow reservoirs response strongly to warming owning to shorter ice cover period and higher decomposition rate under a warming scenario. We also found that terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) input would stimulate CO2 emissions from the reservoir. We conclude that models of aquatic carbon cycle should link terrestrial carbon cycle to better predicting GHG emissions from aquatic ecosystems and to better understanding the carbon balance of lake-rich regions.",

            "abstract": "Variability of the volume of oceanic oxygen-deficient waters is critical for aerobic organisms. Several climate models consistently predict the decreasing oceanic oxygen inventory from the second half of the 20th to the 21st centuries. However, the projections about how the volume of oxygen-deficient waters in the future are not consistent with each other. In this study, we investigated the factors controlling the variability of volumes of oxygen-deficient waters in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) where the largest oxygen-deficient zone exists in the ocean. Hindcast (from years 1850 to 2005) and forecast (from years 2006 to 2100) experiments with an offline global ocean biogeochemical model were performed by using outputs of physical field by the Earth System Model, MIROC-ESM, under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The model results illustrated that the volume of oxygen-deficient waters in EEP remains relatively constant from years 1850 to 1950, rapidly increases from years 1950 to 2000, and gradually declines from years 2000 to 2100. Available observations are consistent with the change of oxygen concentration from years 1950 to 2000. The budget analysis in EEP shows the following: (1) During 1850 to 1950, the horizontal advection via the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) is the major source of dissolved oxygen to the oxygen-deficient waters in EEP and that is almost consumed by the regeneration of organic matter. (2) During 1950 to 2000, the horizontal advection decreases and the declilne is not compensated by the reduction of regeneration of organic matter, which results in the expanding volume of oxygen-deficient waters. (3) In the 21st century, the horizontal advection declines further but the decrease in the regeneration of organic matter and increase in vertical advective supply are in excess of the decrease, leading to the shrink of oxygen-deficient water volume. Our model suggests that the key mechanisms controlling the oxygen-deficient water volume in EEP in the future are the changes in EUC transport and primary production in EEP related to the change of EUC transport. Multi-model analysis focusing on these processes probably leads to estimating uncertainties of the oxygen-deficient water volume change to the future by the present climate models.",

            "abstract": "The B/Ca, U/Ca ratio values of calcitic foraminifer shells are all influenced by seawater carbonate chemistry (seawater [B(OH)4-/HCO3-], [CO32-], and pH respectively), and as such are increasingly being used as proxies to reconstruct past changes in ocean inorganic carbon content, saturation state and pH. However, the behavior of these proxies is subject to modification by foraminifers’ efforts to regulate the conditions under which they grow their shells. We have undertaken experiments on Orbulina universa that manipulate synthetic culture water DIC, pH and [Ca] in an effort to disentangle the biological versus environmental influences of seawater carbonate system and saturation state on B/Ca, U/Ca and Mg/Ca ratio into foraminiferal calcite. Experiments were designed to be able determine the extent to which foraminifers are able to modify the chemical composition of their (vacuolized?) internal calcification fluid, in particular by using B/Ca and U/Ca as sensors for calcification chemistry (i.e. internal [B(OH)4-/HCO3-] and [CO32-]) . We have used a high resolution LA-ICPMS depth profiling techniques to characterize the amplitude of B/Ca, U/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca ratio values across and the thickness (calcification rate) of diurnal bands that are developed in individual shells grown under different synthetic seawater compositions. Results indicate Orbulina universa modify the chemistry of their calcification fluid far from that of external seawater, but are not able to mitigate changes in external seawater. This most likely achieved through the interactive effects of internal pH manipulation and a carbon concentration mechanism. Our results are likely to have important implications for the interpretation of Mg/Ca, B/Ca and U/Ca as proxies seawater temperatures and carbonate system parameters.",

Low signal:noise ratios, limited vertical coverage, and sampler-sampler offsets have historically hampered characterization of vertical and inter-hemispheric gradients. We present data from the HIPPO Global campaign (2009-11) showing that Ar/N2 and interannually-detrended N2O correlate well in the lower stratosphere, suggesting that, as stratospheric air ages and loses N2O to photolysis and photo-oxidation, it also gradually loses argon to gravity as the heavier atom preferentially “rains out” of the air parcel. The HIPPO Ar/N2 data from the lower troposphere also resolve seasonal cycles in each hemisphere, as well as a gradient in the annual mean between hemispheres, with higher values in the southern hemisphere. The HIPPO cycles and inter-hemispheric gradient are in good agreement with data from surface stations.",

            "abstract": "The spatial variability of tides and the tidally-averaged water-level is often poorly resolved in shallow waters, despite its importance in validating models and interpreting dynamics. In this contribution we explore using airborne LIDAR to remotely observe tides and along-river slope in the Columbia River estuary (CRE). Using an airplane equipped with LIDAR, differential GPS, and an infra-red camera, we flew 8 longitudinal transects over a 50km stretch of the CRE over a 14 hour period in June 2013. After correcting for airplane elevation, pitch and roll and median filtering over 1km blocks, a spatially-resolved data set of relative water level was generated. Results show the tide (amplitude 2m) propagating upstream at the expected phase velocity. A sinusoid with 2 periods (12.4 and 24 hours) was next fit to data to produce a smooth tide and extract the mean slope. Comparison with 4 tide gauges indicates first order agreement with measured tides (rms error 0.1m), and confirms that a substantial sub-tidal gradient exists in the CRE. This proof-of-concept experiment indicates that remote sensing of tides in coastal areas is feasible, with possible applications such as improving bathymetric surveys or inferring water depths.",

            "abstract": "For thirty years, the “injection boundary” model of substorm injections has provided a framework for studies of the impulsive transport of energetic electrons and ions into the inner magnetosphere. New, multi-satellite observations of substorm injections show signatures that require revision and rethinking of the classical picture. Recent observations by the LANL-GEO and GOES energetic particle instruments provide unprecedented coverage at geosynchronous orbit while the Van Allen Probes satellites provide simultaneous multi-point measurements inside geosynchronous orbit. With these satellites we can observe injections at three different radial distances and up to ten different local times - simultaneously. These observations reveal a complex and varied set of dynamics that have important implications for the development of the radiation belts and ring current.\nIn this study we look specifically at the radial penetration of energetic particle injections in storms and substorms. Radial alignments of satellites confirm and extend the CRRES/LANL-GEO observations of relatively slow inward propagation of the injection region inside geosynchronous orbit [1]. At the same time, synoptic Van Allen Probes observations show frequent storm-time “injection” of energetic (~50-500 keV) electrons to very low L-shells (L < 3) that have not previously been reported. The radial distribution of electrons and ions injected during storms and substorms have profound implications for the generation of waves, for the availability of a radiation belt “seed population”, and for the radial distribution of ring current ions. In this paper we will use multi-point satellite observations to understand the processes that inject energetic particles into the inner magnetosphere, the Earthward propagation of these injections, the conditions that control variation in Earthward extent of energetic particle injections, and how particles can be injected deep inside the plasmasphere and even through the slot region.\n[1] Reeves, G.

            "abstract": "Various enhancements have been added to the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Validation Network (VN) to evaluate the GPM satellite’s instrument and data product performance. The GPM VN acquires data from the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) on GPM, the Precipitation Radar (PR) on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, from microwave imagers on GPM, TRMM, and GPM constellation satellites, and from ground radar (GR) networks in the continental U.S. and participating international sites. The VN characterizes the variability and bias of precipitation retrievals between the satellite products and the GR in various precipitation regimes, with the goal of improving precipitation retrieval algorithms for the GPM instruments.\nThe core VN dataset consists of WSR-88D GR data and matching satellite orbit subset data, primarily covering the eastern US. TRMM data range from August, 2006 to the present, and GPM and constellation data range from March, 2014 to the present. New features of the VN include the extension of the observation network from 21 weather service ground radars in the southeast US to 66 radars covering most of the eastern half of the US, and a radar in Alaska was also added to the network. Additional comparison parameters have also been added to the VN. These include ground radar polarimetric variables (Zdr, Kdp, RHOhv), microphysical variables (Dzero, Nw), and hydrometeor type classifications. New visualization tools and statistical methods are now also available to help compare ground radar and GPM DPR measurements for validation purposes. The VN also now includes an experimental GPM Microwave Imager (GMI)-to-ground radar geometry matching technique. For this product, the GMI near-surface rain rate field from the GPM GPROF algorithm is matched to the GR reflectivity and dual-polarization fields a) along the GMI line- of-sight, and b) as a vertical column above the GMI surface.\nThe full VN software suite to produce the geometric match-up, and analyze and display these data is available to the scientific community as open source code.

            "abstract": "The surface-atmosphere exchange of mercury (Hg) is temporally and spatially dynamic and soils can serve as large reservoirs for atmospheric deposition of Hg. However, due to semi-volatile behavior of elemental Hg (Hg0) and reduction processes, Hg0 can re-emit to the atmosphere, undergoing a bi-directional flux. These processes, particularly re-emissions of previously deposited Hg, are estimated to globally account for up to 60% of current atmospheric Hg loads. Due to the variation in Hg0 fluxes among areas, the purpose of this study was to build a global database of surface-atmosphere Hg0 flux measurements and use that database to evaluate our current level of understanding.\nHg0 fluxes have been measured over a wide range of areas from typical background sites to locations naturally and anthropogenically enhanced in Hg. Our database analysis showed that most flux measurements of Hg0 have been focused in the United States, Europe, and East Asia. Large areas of the globe have poorly documented surface-atmosphere Hg0 exchange. Measured fluxes span a very large range from -5,500 ng m-2 hr-1 to +110,000 ng m-2 hr-1, with fluxes measured before the year 2005 being 3 times higher than fluxes measured after 2005. This corresponds to a shift from measuring over enriched sites towards measurement over background areas and improvements in measurement methods.\nMeasurements to date have experienced a strong bias; for instance, daytime measurements (85%) prevail over nighttime ones, as summer and spring measurements (65%) dominate over those taken in winter and fall. Bare soils account for over 40% of all terrestrial data, and 57% of studies were conducted over substrate concentrations that are considered “background”. At the same time, only 40% of measurements were performed under air Hg concentrations typical of background air (<2 ng m-3). 85% of all flux studies were conducted with chamber methods using a variety of different designs, materials, and measurement protocols, with the rest based on micrometeorological flux techniques. Our findings indicate that to effectively estimate global and regional budgets of surface-atmosphere Hg0 exchange and their dependence on environmental variables, careful consideration should be given to the potential biases introduced by selectively sampling areas and methods used.",

            "abstract": "Large amplitude long-period ground motions (1-10s) with long duration were observed in the Osaka sedimentary basin during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Mw9.0) and its aftershock (Ibaraki-Oki, Mw7.7), which is about 600 km away from the source regions. Sato et al. (2013) analyzed strong ground motion records from the source region to the Osaka basin and showed the following characteristics. (1) In the period range of 1 to 10s, the amplitude of horizontal components of the ground motion at the site-specific period is amplified in the Osaka basin sites. The predominant period is about 7s in the bay area where the largest pSv were observed. (2) The velocity Fourier amplitude spectra with their predominant period of around 7s are observed at the bedrock sites surrounding the Osaka basin. Those characteristics were observed during both of the mainshock and the largest aftershock. Therefore, large long-period ground motions in the Osaka basin are generated by the combination of propagation-path and basin effects. They simulated ground motions due to the largest aftershock as a simple point source model using three-dimensional FDM (GMS; Aoi and Fujiwara, 1999). They used a three-dimensional velocity structure based on the Japan Integrated Velocity Structure Model (JIVSM, Koketsu et al., 2012), with the minimum effective period of the computation of 3s. Their simulation result reproduced the observation characteristics well and it validates the applicability of the JIVSM for the long period ground motion simulation. In this study, we try to simulate long-period ground motions during the mainshock. The source model we used for the simulation is based on the SMGA model obtained by Asano and Iwata (2012). We succeed to simulate long-period ground motion propagation from Kanto area to the Osaka basin fairly well. The long-period ground motion simulations with the several Osaka basin velocity structure models are done for improving the model applicability.\nWe used strong motion data recorded by K-NET, KiK-net and F-net of NIED, CEORKA, BRI, JMA, Osaka city waterworks bureau, and Osaka prefecture.

            "abstract": "Many paleotemperature reconstructions rely heavily on the Mg/Ca ratio of planktic foraminifers. The incorporation of Mg is highly dependent on temperature and is also subtly affected by other water column parameters (e.g. pH and salinity), but the nature of the biological control over Mg uptake into foraminiferal calcite has not been fully determined. The distribution of Mg within a single foraminifer test is often organized in intercalated bands of high and low-Mg/Ca ratio calcite. Initial studies showed that low Mg/Ca calcite is added during the day light hours and high Mg/Ca calcite during the night (Spero et al., in press). Banding has been attributed to 1) modification of pH in the microenvironment around the shell via symbiont photosynthesis/respiration, 2) an unknown circadian mechanism, and/or 3) differential mitochondrial pumping of Mg away from the calcifying shell surface during day and night phases.\nWe conducted several culture-based experiments to assess the affect of light on Mg/Ca variability in the planktic symbiont-bearing foraminifer Orbulina universa by culturing the foraminifers in different photoperiods including: 1) reversing the day/night cycle, 2) 24-hour constant light, and 3) 24-hour constant dark. With a reversed light/dark photoperiod, there is no 'lag' in the timing or amplitude of the Mg/Ca bands. In 24-hour constant light, the high Mg ‘night’ bands are reduced in amplitude and are no longer paced by a 24-hour cycle. This produces a mean shell Mg/Ca ratio that is lower than in shells growing on a normal light:dark cycle. Under 24-hour constant dark conditions, high Mg/Ca bands dominate the shell calcite. This produces a mean shell Mg/Ca ratio that is higher than shells grown on a normal light:dark cycle. These results suggest that a light cue, independent of photosymbiont activity, is responsible for controlling the presence/absence of high Mg/Ca banding and that ambient irradiance changes in the water column could influence overall Mg/Ca in O. universa shells. Additional experiments to investigate the light cue are underway and results will be presented at the fall meeting.",

            "abstract": "The study of the structure of solid CO2 at elevated pressures is important in condensed matter physics and material science, as well as geophysics—especially in understanding the structure of the interiors of planetary bodies. The high-pressure phases, including CO2-IV, and their stability between CO2-I (dry ice, the CO2 phase stable at ambient P,T) and polyhedrally bonded CO2–V are poorly characterized. Yoo et al. (2001, PRL, 86, 3) and Park et al. (2003, Phys Rev B, 68,1) concluded that the CO2 molecule is bent in phase IV, with C=O bond lengths of up to 1.3-1.5 Å, longer than the 1.168 Å in CO2-I. In contrast, Gorelli et al. (2004, PRL, 93, 20) and Datchi et al. (2009, PRL, 103, 18) inferred that the CO2 molecule in phase IV is linear, and the double-bond length is nearly identical to that of CO2-I. The studies also disagree on the structure of CO2-IV: tetragonal P41212, orthorhombic Pbcn and rhombohedral R-3c have all been reported.\nWe performed neutron diffraction experiments at SNAP, Spallation Neutron Source, ORNL. The powder sample was pressurized to 18.0(2) GPa at ambient temperature in a panoramic DAC. The resistive heating system was then heated to 625 K. Temperature was adjusted to 525 K, 450 K, 375 K and 300 K to study the thermal expansion of CO2-IV and provide data for a P,T equation of state. At 18 GPa and 625 K the structure of CO2-IV is well indexed by the R-3c structure found by Datchi et al. (2009, PRL, 103, 18). The rhombohedral symmetry was retained as temperature was lowered through the proposed stability fields of both CO2-II and CO2-III to 300 K. Structure determination yielded aH = 8.532(6) Å, cH = 10.48(2) Å, V = 660.9(3) Å3, and ρ = 2.653 g cm-3 at 300 K and 18 GPa. Preliminary linear thermal expansion parameters using the Holland-Powell (1998, J Metamorph Geol, 16, 3) model range from 5.7(6) x 10-6 K-1 to 1.39(1) x 10-5 K-1 for the lattice planes indexed. A fit to the volume yields a thermal expansion of 3.530(2) x 10-5 K-1. These results indicate that CO2-IV is comprised of linear molecules, supporting the structure determined by Datchi et al. (2009). Furthermore, phases II and III were not observed, suggesting that these phases are metastable at these conditions. These insights help us to more fully understand the behavior of CO2 at high P,T in Earth and planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation is a key forcing variable in hydrological modeling of floods and being able to accurately observe precipitation is extremely important in mitigating flood impacts. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission, launched in Feb 2014 also presents an opportunity for high-quality real-time precipitation data and improved flood warnings. The PERSIANN-CCS developed by the scientists at the Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (CHRS) at the University of California, Irvine is one algorithm integrated in the IMERG of PMM/GPM.\nIn this research, the high resolution coupled hydrologic/hydraulic model named HiResFlood-UCI was applied to simulate the historical 2008 Iowa flood in the Cedar River basin. HiResFlood-UCI is a coupling of the NWS’s distributed hydrologic model HL-RDHM and the hydraulic model BreZo developed by the Computational Hydraulics Group at the University of California, Irvine. The model was forced with the real-time PERSIANN-CCS and NEXRAD Stage 2 precipitation data. Simulations were evaluated based on 2 criteria: hydrographs within the basin and the areal extent of the flooding. Streamflow hydrographs were compared at 7 USGS gages, and simulated inundation maps were evaluated using USDA AWiFS 56m resolution areal flood imagery.\nThe results show reasonable simulated hydrographs compared to USGS streamflow observations when simulating with PERSIANN-CCS and NEXRAD Stage 2 as forcing inputs. The simulation driven by NEXRAD Stage 2 slightly outperforms the PERSIANN-CCS simulation as the latter marginally underestimated the observed hydrographs. The simulation in both cases shows a good agreement (0.672 and 0.727 CSI for Stage 2 and PERSIANN-CCS simulations respectively) with the AWiFS image over the most impacted area in the Cedar Rapids region. Since the PERSIANN-CCS simulation slightly underestimated the discharge, the probability of detection (0.925) is lower than that of the Stage 2 simulation (0.965). As a trade-off, the false alarm rate for the PERSIANN-CCS simulation (0.227) is better than that of the Stage 2 simulation (0.311).",

            "abstract": "Numerical modeling of the long term evolution of river meanders consistently show a tendency towards a statistical equilibrium when averaged over repeated episodes of channel extension by migration and channel shortening by cutoff. This statistical steady state is typically defined using reach averaged channel wavelength and sinuosity, which oscillate about a stable mean value for channels of constant width. Meander geometry has long been shown to correlate closely with channel width and this paper builds on previous modeling work by using a meander simulation model that allows channel width to vary. Independent submodels are specified for bank erosion and deposition and channel width is free to vary locally as a result of differential bank migration. In addition to variable channel width, the numerical model captures mean bed elevation changes in response to sediment exchange with both banks. This new modeling framework presents an opportunity to look at long-term statistical behavior of evolving meanders not only in terms of wavelength and sinuosity, but also in terms of channel width. In this paper, we evaluate whether the stable equilibrium sinuosity/wavelength observed in constant-width models also occurs when channel narrowing and widening also occur during cycles of channel elongation and shortening. In addition to evaluating the interaction between width, sinuosity, and wavelength over many meander cycles, the paper explores how the long term evolution statistics are controlled by other important drivers, especially the rate and grain size of upstream sediment feed.",

            "abstract": "Projecting evapotranspiration for estimating future agricultural irrigation demand is uncertain because estimates of future precipitation and evapotranspiration vary significantly depending on the Global Climate Model (GCM), future RCP emission scenario and reference evapotranspiration (RET) estimation method selected. Understanding the relative contributions of these various sources of uncertainty is important for effective long-term water resource planning. In this study variance-based sensitivity analysis (Saltelli et al., 2010) was used to assess the sensitivity of estimated future changes in precipitation, RET and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index drought index (SPEI) to 9 GCMs, 3 RCP scenarios, and 11 ET estimation methods over 9 regions of the United States for two future periods: 2030-2060 and 2070-2100. Future changes in precipitation were found to be most sensitive to GCM selection for all U.S. regions and both future periods. For projecting changes in future RET and SPEI, the selection of ET method and GCM were more sensitive than the selection of RCP scenario. In general, changes in ET and SPEI were most sensitive to ET estimation methods in the cold season and to GCM selection in the warm season; however sensitivities differed by region, season and future period. This study underscores the importance of evaluating projections of future agricultural irrigation demand for an ensemble of GCMs and ET estimation methods rather than relying on few GCMs and a single ET estimation method.",

The GREECE payload successfully launched from Poker Flat, Alaska on 03 March 2014 and reached an apogee of approximately 335 km. The narrow field-of-view auroral imaging was taken from Venetie, AK, which is directly under apogee. This enabled the small-scale auroral features at the magnetic footpoint of the rocket payload to be imaged in detail. The electron precipitation was measured with the Acute Precipitating Electron Spectrometer (APES) onboard the payload. Features in the electron data are matched up with their corresponding auroral structures and boundaries, enabling measurement of the exact electron distributions responsible for the specific small-scale auroral features. These electron distributions will then be used to infer what the potential electron acceleration processes were.",

When plural earthquakes occur in a region, I attempt to statistically discriminate foreshocks from a swarm or the mainshock-aftershock sequence. The forecast needs identification of an earthquake cluster using the single-link algorithm; and then the probability is calculated based on the clustering strength and magnitude correlations. The probability forecast model were estimated from the JMA hypocenter data of earthquakes of M≧4 in the period 1926-1993 (Ogata et al., 1996). Then we presented the performance and validation of the forecasts during 1994 - 2010 by using the same model (Ogata and Katsura, 2012). The forecasts perform significantly better than the unconditional (average) foreshock probability throughout Japan region. The frequency of the actual foreshocks is consistent with the forecasted probabilities. In my poster, I would like to discuss details of the outcomes in the forecasting and evaluations. Furthermore, I would like to apply the forecasting in California and global catalogs to show some universality in the forecasting procedure.\n",

            "abstract": "We examined interactions among aquatic vegetation, flow hydraulics, sediment (organic and inorganic) deposition, organic matter decomposition, and the channel form of tidal freshwater marsh inlet channels. Inlets chosen for study were partially covered by a dominate vegetation species (N.luteum, Z.aquatica, or H.verticullata). Vegetation cover, height, stem diameter, and stem density were measured monthly along each channel cross section. Water surface elevation was measured with multiple gauges in each tidal inlet and accompanied by measurements of velocity. These data were used to calculate total and effective channel shear stresses. Channel cross section elevations were surveyed bimonthly to determine elevation change in inlets occupied by each of the three dominate vegetation species. Sediment cores were obtained along each inlet cross section and analyzed for bulk density, grain size, and percentage of organic matter. Leaf litter experiments were conducted to determine plant decomposition rates. The three aquatic plants grew in significantly different water depths (Z. aquatica the shallowest and H. verticullata the deepest). Z. aquatica and N. luteum had similar stem diameters and densities and grew over well-defined platforms associated with low shear stresses during vegetation maxima. The central channel core, however, had higher summer shear stresses than predicted from depth and slope data. The zones of low shear stress persisted after vegetation die-back, but shear stresses in the central core decreased during non-vegetated periods. The deep central cores of these seasonally-vegetated inlets experienced erosion during the warm season and deposition during cool (unvegetated) periods. The H. verticullata channels had a parabolic channel form rather than the platform-central form observed in the other channels. Decomposition experiments indicated significantly higher decomposition rates for H. verticullata and N. luteum than for Z. aquatica. Comparison among tidal inlets indicated an inverse relationship between maximum inlet depth and average channel accretion rate. These results suggest that initial vegetation colonization modifies channel inlet morphology and that both vegetation and morphology generate the shear stress distributions that maintain channel form.",

River systems with high fluvial wetland abundance and organic matter, may result in high metabolism that in conjunction with low re-aeration rates, lead to low oxygen conditions. Increasing abundance of beaver ponds in many areas may exacerbate this phenomenon. This research aims to understand the impact of fluvial wetlands, including beaver ponds, on dissolved oxygen (D.O.) and metabolism throughout the headwaters of the Ipswich R. watershed, MA, USA. In several fluvial wetland dominated systems, we measured diel D.O. and metabolism in the upstream inflow, the surface water transient storage zones of fluvial wetland sidepools, and at the outflow to understand how the wetlands modify dissolved oxygen. D.O. was also measured longitudinally along entire surface water flow paths (x-y km long) to determine how low levels of D.O. propagate downstream. Nutrient samples were also collected to understand how their behavior was related to D.O. behavior. Results show that D.O. in fluvial wetlands has large swings with periods of very low D.O. at night. D.O. swings were also seen in downstream outflow, though lagged and somewhat attenuated. Flow conditions affect the level of inundation and the subsequent effects of fluvial wetlands on main channel D.O.. Understanding the D.O. behavior throughout river systems has important implications for the ability of river systems to remove anthropogenic nitrogen.",

To keep pace with those needs of public, Korean government made the law on safety standards and managements of cosmic radiation for the flight attendants and the pilots in 2013. And we have begun to develop our own Korean Radiation Exposure Assessment Model (KREAM) for aviation route dose since last year funded by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). GEANT4 model and NRLMSIS 00 model are used for calculation of the energetic particles’ transport in the atmosphere and for obtaining the background atmospheric neutral densities depending on altitude. For prediction the radiation exposure in many routes depending on the various space weather effects, we constructed a database from pre-arranged simulations using all possible combinations of R, S, and G, which are the space weather effect scales provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). To get the solar energetic particles’ spectrum at the 100 km altitude which we set as a top of the atmospheric layers in the KREAM, we use ACE and GOES satellites’ proton flux observations. We compare the results between KREAM and the other cosmic radiation estimation programs such as CARI-6M which is provided by the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA). We also validate KREAM’s results by comparison with the measurement from Liulin-6K LET spectrometer onboard Korean commercial flights and Korean Air Force reconnaissance flights.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade and a half, we have gained a better understanding of the role of clouds and precipitation on Earth's water cycle, energy budget and climate, from focused Earth science observational satellite missions. However, these missions provide only a snapshot at one point in time of the cloud’s development. Processes that govern cloud system development occur primarily on time scales of the order of 5-30 minutes that are generally not observable from low Earth orbiting satellites. Geostationary satellites, in contrast, have higher temporal resolution but at present are limited to visible and infrared wavelengths that observe only the tops of clouds. This observing gap was noted by the National Research Council’s Earth Science Decadal Survey in 2007.\nUncertainties in global climate models are significantly affected by processes that govern the formation and dissipation of clouds that largely control the global water and energy budgets. Current uncertainties in cloud parameterization within climate models lead to drastically different climate outcomes. With all evidence suggesting that the precipitation onset may be governed by factors such atmospheric stability, it becomes critical to have at least first-order observations globally in diverse climate regimes. Similar arguments are valid for ice processes where more efficient ice formation and precipitation have a tendency to leave fewer ice clouds behind that have different but equally important impacts on the Earth’s energy budget and resulting temperature trends.\nTEMPEST is a unique program that will provide a small constellation of inexpensive CubeSats with millimeter-wave radiometers to address key science needs related to cloud and precipitation processes. Because these processes are most critical in the development of climate models that will soon run at scales that explicitly resolve clouds, the TEMPEST program will directly focus on examining, validating and improving the parameterizations currently used in cloud scale models. The time evolution of cloud and precipitation microphysics is dependent upon parameterized process rates. The outcome of TEMPEST will provide a first-order understanding of how individual assumptions in current cloud model parameterizations behave in diverse climate regimes.",

All along the Himalayan belt except in the eastern segment under study, the Main Frontal Thrust or equivalents at the immediate foothill of the Himalaya marks the southern edge of the locked segment, and region of high rate of surface strain accumulation is confined within a arc-parallel strip of around 200 km width. In the last 200 km long easternmost segment of the Himalaya, the southern boundary of the convergence related surface shortening seems to have been extended further south, much beyond the Himalayan frontal thrusts. This unusually wider deformation zone includes entire Shillong plateau in north-eastern part of India and extends into Bangladesh. New data from a recently established 16 station GPS network stretched over Bhutan, India and Bangladesh, in association with earlier data from the Indian network in this region provide better insight into this complex tectonic problem.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric processes span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Combined with the inherent non-linearity of many chemical processes, this presents difficulties for accurate numerical modeling of atmospheric composition. Earlier works have found that with coarse resolution models, ozone production tends to be overestimated in urban environments due to NOx being diluted within large grid cells that artificially mix both urban and non-urban air. The impact of grid resolution on modeling the chemical regime of the Southeastern US, which is largely affected by biogenic VOCs, has not been previously studied. In this study, the sensitivity of various species to resolution is examined by running the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25x0.3125 degree (~25 km), 2x2.5 degree, and 4x5 degree resolution and quantifying model errors as constrained by observations from the SEAC4RS aircraft campaign. Species respond differently to grid resolution depending on its lifetime and chemical non-linearity. We find that higher resolution models are better able to capture variability present in the observations, leading to better representation of extreme values, even if correlations between model and observations do not always improve with increasing resolution. Coarse resolution models also induce bias – the 4x5 and 2x2.5 degree models were unable to accurately simulate the low-NOx, high-isoprene environment found in parts of the Southeastern US, tending to underestimate isoprene and overestimate NOx, which leads to overestimates of ozone in these regions. At higher resolution, a smaller fraction of the isoprene hydroxy-peroxy radicals react with NO, possibly due to better segregation of high-NOx and low-NOx environments. Given the computational cost of running high-resolution simulations, it is important to understand what kind of biases and differences occur when running a model at different resolutions.",

            "abstract": "The formation, growth and migration of dunes have important implications for sediment transport and flow resistance in many of the world’s sand-bedded rivers. The notion that dunes scale with depth is often cited as a definitive feature of these bedforms and suggests that depth exerts a major control on dune geometry and dynamics. Empirical relations often suggest that height scales as 1/6 depth and length as 5 times the depth. However, there is limited evidence for this scaling in the literature and no widely accepted theory to explain why dunes grow to a certain height. Here, we reexamine published dune dimension data from over 20 flume and 20 field studies to critically test the assumption that dunes are depth-scaled in rivers. The results, particularity in the field data, do show a general trend of increasing dune height with depth but these relations are subject to considerable scatter. Most data plot higher than the 1/6 depth scaling and fall within a wide range from 1/2 to 1/25 depth. Depth must exert some control on dune dynamics as few dunes have heights above 1/2 the depth, yet the scatter indicates that depth is not the only control on dune size. Transport stage, defined as the non-dimensional Shields stress divided by its value at the threshold for sediment entrainment, exerts a stronger control on dune dimensions. As transport stage increase, dunes grow in height but then decrease as the length grows. This pattern produces a bell-shaped plot of aspect ratio (height/length) as transport stage increases. Further investigation of the physical mechanisms that control dune height and length are sorely needed in order to better understand dune dynamics in natural systems.",

The most significant projected change in rainfall characteristics for the Midwest is increases in the length of dry spells on the order of 10-15%. The predicted trends in temperature and precipitation have raised questions about the nature of plant functional responses to changing thermal and water stress, especially given that the rate of projected change is unprecedented with respect to historical pressures on adaptation. However, insights may be gleaned from measured ecosystem response to extreme events from the historical record. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of root distribution on the hydrodynamic response of vegetation to increasing length of dry spells in the Midwest. By combining soil moisture and eddy flux measurements we test the ability of Feddes- and Jarvis-type water use models to regulate the potential evapotranspiration response during periods of drydown as well as the sensitivity of these models to commonly used rooting parameterization.",

The ice sheets have been implicated in this rapid climate change, but a recent study of ancient corals has implicated the deep oceans (Thiagarajan et al. Abrupt pre-Bolling-Allerod warming and circulation changes in the deep ocean. Nature 511, 75-81, 2014). We will first review the climate data and then report on our numerical model, which seems to support the oceanic hypothesis. The mechanism is thermobaric instability, which depends on the increase of the thermal coefficient of expansion with depth and can lead to a sudden release of stored potential energy (Su and Ingersoll. Ocean Convective Available Potential Energy. Part I: Concept and Calculation, and Part II: Energetics of Thermobaric Convection. J. Phys. Oceanogr., submitted, 2014). The model is two-dimensional—a slice through a vertical plane. It has salt diffusion, temperature diffusion and viscous dissipation, and it conserves energy exactly—to the round off error of the machine. We have run our model with realistic parameters and will compare the results with the deglaciation record.",

            "abstract": "For the past decade the Arctic Observing Network included autonomous measurements of the mass balance of Arctic sea ice. A system of Ice Mass Balance (IMB) buoys measured time series of snow accumulation and ablation; ice growth and surface and bottom melt; and vertical profiles of air, snow, ice, and ocean temperature. The mass balance is the great integrator of heat and can be used to derive estimates of both the surface heat budget and ocean heat flux. Large spatial and interannual variations in surface and bottom melting are evident in the data record. For example, over the western Arctic the observed total summer surface melting ranges from as little as 0.05 m to over 0.75 m. Bottom melting exhibits an even more extreme range varying from 0.1 to 2.2 m. IMBs in the Beaufort Sea and Central Arctic during the summer of 2013 are selected for more detailed analysis, calculating the time series of net surface energy budget and of the ocean heat flux. Ice temperature profiles are used to determine internal melting of the ice. Results from these buoys are integrated with high resolution satellite imagery to examine the heat and mass balance on the aggregate scale. Incident solar radiation is obtained from reanalysis products and used to calculate solar heat input to leads and to the upper ocean. Floe perimeter, ice motion, and lead heat content are combined to estimate the amount of lateral melting. From this integrated analysis, summer ice losses due to surface, bottom, lateral, and internal melting are computed on the aggregate scale and compared regionally.",

            "abstract": "Surface reservoir age complicates the age models of marine sediment records. Age model uncertainty may cause different interpretations of the same process. For example, in order to circumvent dealing with surface reservoir age, Marchitto et al. (2007) built their age model on a linkage to Greenland oxygen isotope record. But the proxy they used for the linkage was a minor factor of the sediment diffuse spectral reflectance, and they assumed the sedimentation rate was constant between the tie points which could be several thousand years apart. Based on that age model they showed the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) was significantly older during deglaciation than LGM and Holocene. However, de Pol-Holz et al. (2010) argued that the change of deglacial AAIW radiocarbon age was not clearly different from the atmospheric change. Their age model was based on planktic foram (PF) 14C dates and an assumption that the surface reservoir age was constantly 400 years for a site near an upwelling region. These records are only as good as their age models. Here, we present a new way to build the age model of marine records, which is to date wood in marine sediments. We found a core in Panama Basin with constantly-present twigs at the same water depth with the core used by Marchitto et al. (705m), and the radiocarbon dates of the wood samples give a very good age-depth relationship without any age reversal. With benthic foram (BF) dated in the same layer where the twigs appear, we will be able to compare the AAIW radiocarbon concentration directly with the atmosphere. In this way, we can get the AAIW ventilation age without worrying about the surface reservoir age and elucidate whether there indeed was old water transported northward by AAIW during the last deglaciation. This would be very important to testify the hypothesis of LGM carbon sequestration in the deep ocean. On the other hand, we can evaluate how the surface reservoir age and/or upwelling strength changed in Eastern Equatorial Pacific (particularly Panama basin) over the last deglaciation by dating PF as well. This presentation will show the first ever wood-based age model of marine records as well as new BF and PF dates.",

            "abstract": "In Bolivian Andes, retreats of tropical glaciers are rapid, thus water resources currently available from glacierized catchments for drinking, agriculture, industry and hydropower would be changed in its volume and variations due to changing climate. Water resources in La Paz and El Alto, the capital city areas of Bolivia, strongly depend on the runoff from partially glacierized catchments located in the Cordillera Real, which is a combined contribution of surface and subsurface flow from glacierized and non-glacierized areas due to rainfall, snow melt and glacier melt. To predict the long-term availability of water resources for the capital city areas, we developed a semi-distributed conceptual glacio-hydrological model that considers various runoff pathways from partially glacierized high-altitudinal catchments located in the outer tropics. In the model, the retarding effect of lakes and wetlands was considered, based on the observed hydraulic functions and distribution of wetlands. The model was applied to three sub-catchments of the Tuni Lake watershed (98km2), from which the water resources for La Paz and El Alto are supplied. With calibrated parameters, the model reproduced well the observed seasonal variations of daily runoff during recent two years. Simulated results of water balance suggested that for the catchment with a larger glacier cover, more than 40% of the annual total runoff is contributed from glacierized areas due to glacier melt and snowmelt. The contribution from glacierized areas in other two sub-catchments, with relatively smaller areas covered by glacier ice, was calculated to be between 10-15%. We found that the role of wetlands and lakes are essential in retarding and regulating the runoff from partially glacierized high-mountain catchments.",

We compared CH4 and N2O emissions, global warming potential (GWP = N2O + CH4), yield-scaled GWP (GWPY = GWP Mg-1 grain), and plant growth characteristics of 8 cultivars within 4 study sites in California and Arkansas. Seasonal CH4 emissions differed between cultivars by a factor of 2.1 and 1.3 at one California and one Arkansas site, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions were negligible, comprised <10% of GWP, and were not different among cultivars. When sites and cultivars were pooled, and data were normalized to site averages, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.33) between root biomass at heading and seasonal CH4 emissions, but no correlation with shoot biomass at heading, or grain or straw biomass at maturity. Although differences in GWP and GWPY were observed, the consistency of some of the trends was variable across sites, indicating the importance of the genotype x environment interaction. While no high-yielding and low CH4-emitting cultivars were identified at the California sites, among the Southern varieties tested at the Arkansas site, the lowest emitting cultivar had the highest yield. This highlights the potential for breeding high-yielding varieties with low GWP, the ideal scenario to achieve low GWPY due to simultaneously mitigating GHG emissions and improving global food security.",

For the analysis we used GEODYN, a hydrocode, to simulate the impact and generate the source wave for the large-scale shallow water wave program, SWWP. Using state-of-the-art, high-performance computing codes we simulated three impact areas — two are located on the West Coast near Los Angeles’s shoreline and the San Francisco Bay, respectively, and the third is located in the Gulf of Mexico, with a possible impact location between Texas and Florida. On account of uncertainty in the exact impact location within the asteroid risk corridor, we examined multiple possibilities for impact points within each area.

Based on our experiments, we found that suspended particle concentration decayed more rapidly in the presence, rather than in the absence, of vegetation. Additionally, particle capture rates increased with stem density, particle size, and the presence of biofilm, while decreasing with flow velocity. These results demonstrate that low flow velocities and the presence of biofilm optimize particle capture by vegetation. Our results are relevant to floodplain and wetland restoration efforts.",

            "abstract": "Improving predictions of how forests in the eastern United States will respond to future global change requires a better understanding of the drivers of variability in tree growth rates. Current inventory data lack the temporal resolution to characterize interannual variability, while existing growth records lack the extent required to assess spatial scales of variability. Therefore, we established a network of forest inventory plots across ten sites across the eastern US, and measured growth in adult trees using increment cores. Sites were chosen to maximize climate space explored, while within sites, plots were spread across primary environmental gradients to explore landscape-level variability in growth. Using the annual growth record available from tree cores, we explored the responses of trees to multiple environmental covariates over multiple spatial and temporal scales. We hypothesized that within and across sites growth rates vary among species, and that intraspecific growth rates increase with temperature along a species' range. We also hypothesized that trees show synchrony in growth responses to landscape-scale climatic changes. Initial analyses of growth increments indicate that across sites, trees with intermediate shade tolerance, e.g. Red Oak (Quercus rubra), tend to have the highest growth rates. At the site level, there is evidence for synchrony in response to large-scale climatic events (e.g. prolonged drought and above average temperatures). However, growth responses to climate at the landscape scale have yet to be detected. Our current analysis utilizes hierarchical Bayesian state-space modeling to focus on growth responses of adult trees to environmental covariates at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This predictive model of tree growth currently incorporates observed effects at the individual, plot, site, and landscape scale. Current analysis using this model shows a potential slowing of growth in the past decade for two sites in the northeastern US (Harvard Forest and Bartlett Experimental Forest), however more work is required to determine the robustness of this trend. Finally, these observations are being incorporated into ecosystem models using the Brown Dog informatics tools and the Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) data assimilation workflow.",

            "abstract": "During one 17 month period ending October 2013, three major reports on sea level rise from three highly respected science providers produced three differing, in some cases wildly divergent, estimates of sea level rise through the year 2100. These reports, by the National Research Council, the IPCC, and the National Climate Assessment, collectively flummoxed the lay reader seeking direction on sea level rise projections to incorporate into adaptation planning. Guidance documents soon emerged from state entities, including regulatory agencies, which caused further confusion.\nThe City and County of San Francisco, surrounded by water on three sides, began developing City-wide sea level rise guidance in 2013. A Sea Level Rise Committee featuring representatives of key infrastructure managers met over a nine month period, and their work included an in-depth review of the science of sea level rise. To convert divergent scientific reports into “actionable science” required not only a close reading of each but extensive expert elicitation to tease out the meaning behind each of the numbers and the associated uncertainties. In the end, sufficient consistency between the differing projections, fortified by political exigencies, allowed a “scientific consensus” with actionable science value for the City to surface. The resulting document, “Guidance for Incorporating Sea Level Rise into Capital Planning in San Francisco,” begins by providing a scientific underpinning for planning, guidelines for incorporating uncertainty – particularly for accommodating multiple projections for any particular time slice – and outlines a four step process for assessment and adaptation. It also relies on new state-of-the-art inundation maps produced as part of the SFPUC’s capital improvement program. Together, the Guidance and associated tools provide a road map for successful assessment and adaptation to sea level rise. We will also draw lessons from the experience that may be of value to science leaders seeking to make contributions in the decision making domain.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission controls have led to improved air quality (particularly in the Eastern US) over the past two decades, but concerns have been raised that climate warming may offset some of these gains in the coming decades. Here we address these concerns by analyzing the effect of projected future changes of emissions and climate, in isolation and combination, on US surface ozone (O3) during the 21st century in an ensemble of simulations (3 members per scenario) performed with the GFDL chemistry-climate model CM3. We analyze two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Under both scenarios, NOx emissions decrease by ~80% over North America by 2100. In additional 3-member ensemble simulations, termed RCP4.5_WMGG and RCP8.5_WMGG, well-mixed greenhouse gases follow the respective RCP but O3 and aerosol precursor emissions are held at 2005 levels. These simulations enable us to isolate the role of well-mixed greenhouse gas induced climate change from that of emission reductions. Another set of simulations, following RCP8.5 but with methane (CH4) held fixed at 2005 levels, termed RCP8.5_2005CH4, allows us to quantify the background influence of CH4 on O3. For each season, we examine changes in the surface O3 distribution over the US during the 21st century, calculating policy relevant statistics: days above the current national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) of 75 ppb and other proposed future levels, as well as the probabilistic 1-year return levels for maximum daily 8-hour average ozone (MDA8 O3), within each model grid cell. Specifically, we analyze: (i) regional and seasonal changes in the frequency and return level of high O3 pollution events during the 21st century, as well as (ii) differences among the RCPs by the middle and end of the 21st century. We find that the response of surface O3 to changes in emissions and climate varies strongly, seasonally and spatially, with certain regions more prone to a ‘climate penalty’ (e.g., the Northern US) or a ‘climate benefit’ (e.g. the Southeast). Finally we demonstrate an empirical relationship between changes in O3 precursor emissions and O3 return levels on a regional basis.",

There is an increasing focus to study the environmental impact of agricultural crops, however not much is known on the influence on the energy, carbon and water cycles of energy crops, especially under drought conditions. This study compares the impact of drought episodes (in 2011 and 2012) on evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and water use efficiency (WUE; equals to NEP/ET) for Switchgrass (SW), Miscanthus (MXG), Maize (MZ) and native prairie (NP) grown in Central Illinois using the eddy covariance technique.\nDue to the prolonged drought and the rapid growth development with increasing ET of MXG in 2012, large water deficit (precipitation-ET) was observed for each species up to the highest deficit of -360 mm for this species. The gross primary production (GPP) of MZ was radically decreased by the drought in 2011 and 2012, while SW and NP were not influenced. MXG increased NEP throughout the typically wet and drought years, mainly due to the decrease in respiration and by the largest GPP upon the drought in 2012. Despite having the largest water deficit, MXG showed an enhanced WUE of 12.8 and 11.4 Kg C ha-1mm-1 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, in comparison to years typical to the region with WUE of 3.7-7.3 Kg C ha-1mm-1. Other species did not show a significant enhancement of WUE. Therefore we conclude that out of the studied species, MXG has more access to water, and uses this water the most efficiently to store carbon, under drought conditions.",

            "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technique for mitigating climate change by storing large volumes of carbon dioxide in deep saline aquifers. In California, the thick marine sediments of the Central and Salinas Valleys have been identified as prime targets for future CO2 storage. However, the potential impacts on water quality of overlying drinking-water aquifers must be studied before CCS can be implemented. In this study, we compare trace element release from San Joaquin Valley aquifer sediments with a wide range of textural and redox properties. Kinetic batch experiments were performed with artificial groundwater continuously equilibrated under CO2-saturated (at 1 atm) and background CO2 (0.002-0.006 atm) conditions, resulting in a shift of nearly 3 pH units. In addition, the reversibility of trace element release was studied by sequentially lowering the CO2 from 1.0 atm to 0.5 atm to background concentrations (0.002-0.006 atm) for CO2-saturated systems in order to mimic the dissipation of a CO2 plume in the aquifer. During exposure to high CO2, a number of elements displayed enhanced release compared to background CO2 experiments (Ca, Mg, Li, Si, B, As, Sr, Ni, Fe, Mn, V, Ti, and Co) with concentrations of As, Fe, and Mn exceeding EPA maximum contaminant levels in some cases. On the other hand, Mo and U showed suppressed release. Most intriguing, many of the elements showing enhanced release displayed at least some degree of irreversibility when CO2 concentrations were decreased to background levels. In fact, in some cases (i.e., for V), an element showed further release when CO2 concentrations were decreased. These results suggest that there may be longer-term effects on groundwater quality that persist even after the CO2 plume has dissipated. Several different mechanisms of trace element release including ion exchange, desorption, and carbonate mineral dissolution are explored. Preliminary modeling results suggest that carbonate mineral dissolution can play a key role in driving trace element release even in sediments where carbonates are in low abundance.",

We define a “test function” as the logarithm of the ratio between observed and predicted envelopes at every second in real time. Once the envelopes deviate beyond an acceptable threshold, we declare a misfit. Kurtosis and skewness of a time evolving test function are used to rapidly identify a misfit. Real-time kurtosis and skewness calculations are also inputs to a Linear Discriminant Analysis that ultimately decides if there is an unacceptable level of misfit.

            "abstract": "In this study, we present the phase transition from gabbro into granulite and finally into kyanite- bearing and bimineralic eclogite. The investigated rock sample is a heterogeneous kyanite- bearing and bimineralic eclogite from the Earth’s mantle collected at the Roberts Victor Diamond mine in South Africa. Plagioclase of the former granulite reacted completely out under low H2O activity (fH2O) to form this kyanite- bearing and bimineralic eclogite. To quantify the phase transitions of the original gabbroic precursor, which was first metamorphosed under H-T granulite facies conditions followed by metamorphism under Earth’s mantle conditions into both types of eclogite, a petrological, geochemical and a mass balance approach has been made. i) The results from our petrological approach show that Ca-rich garnet, which is coexistent with Ca-rich omphacite are the metastable phases from the original granulite in the kyanite-bearing relict while Mg-rich garnet, coexistent with Na-rich omphacite are the stable phases in the bimineralic eclogite part which shows equilibration conditions of ~5.5 Gpa and ~1200°C. ii) Our geochemical results show a positive Eu anomaly in garnet from the kyanite-bearing part, which indicates that the igneous precursor of the granulite was a gabbro, probably oceanic crust. Most of the rare earth elements show an excellent correlation with the major elements of the rock forming minerals during the plagioclase-out reaction of the former granulite. The LREE in garnet are removed during the formation of the bimineralic eclogite due to loss of the anorthite component in plagioclase of the former granulite. Contrary, the HREE are enriched in garnets in the bimineralic part of the eclogite compared to those in the kyanite zone, and correlate with the Mg-Ca exchange between both garnet generations. iii) Garnet d18O values ranging between ~5.27 and ~5.90 in the kyanite part and systematically decrease to values of ~5.81 to ~6.29 in the bimoneralic part. The difference in the d18O values is indicative for two different fluid pulses. iv) The following kyanite bearing and bimineralic eclogite forming reaction from the original granulite was calculated from our mass balance approach: 0.625 Cpx + 0.45 Plag + 0.925 Grs + 0.89 MgO + 1.15 CO2 = 1 Pyp + 1 Omph + 0.04 Ky + 1.15 Cc.",

Salient petrologic parameters derived from bulk lava major- and trace-element geochemistry, and from microprobe analyses of matrix glasses, phenocrysts, and melt-inclusions, are now incorporated into the USGS Volcano Science Center’s near real-time volcano-monitoring software platform, called the Volcano Analysis and Visualization Environment (VALVE).\n The petrologic parameters now imported into VALVE for correlation with geophysical and gas data streams are: 1) MgO systematics of bulk lava, glass, and olivine, used to portray pre-eruptive magma temperature and temperature of lava erupted at the vent, 2) incompatible element ratios of bulk lava and glass, used to track either sudden or long-term magma-mixing or magma-source changes , and 3) magmatic sulfur, measured within glass inclusions of olivine, used to infer pre-eruptive volatile content of magma.\nPetrologic data in VALVE provides added insight into magmatic processes. For example, since the onset of Kilauea’s summit eruption in 2008, correlations of summit deformation with MgO systematics and magmatic sulfur in coeval summit tephra and ERZ lava, along with their identical incompatible-element signatures, demonstrate summit-to-ERZ magmatic continuity. As constrained by geophysical and geologic observations at both ends of the eruptive plumbing system, changes in petrology of lava erupted at Puu Oo are likely associated with physical maturation of magma pathways along the shallow ERZ conduit, repeated intrusions and systematic over-pressurization during the 2003–2007 surge in magma supply. Two fissure eruptions uprift of Puu Oo in January 1997 and March 2011 also show a strong correlation of geophysical and gas signatures with a petrologic shift to cooler, incompatible-element enriched lava samples, indicating mixing with stored magmas within the ERZ.\nThis integration of disparate data sets enhances assessments of changing magmatic conditions and enables data-sharing amongst staff scientists monitoring and evaluating hazards associated with ongoing eruptions of Kilauea.",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt is an important source of surface water for ecosystems, river flow, drinking water, and production of hydroelectric power. Thus accurate modeling of snow accumulation and melt is needed to improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on mountain snowpack and for use in water resource forecasting and management decisions. One of the largest potential sources of uncertainty in modeling mountain snow is the net radiative flux. This is because while net irradiance makes up the majority of the surface energy balance, it is one of the most difficult forcings to measure at remote mountain locations.\nHere we investigate the use of irradiances derived from satellite measurements in the place of surface observations. NASA’s Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) SYN satellite product provides longwave and shortwave irradiances at the ground on three-hourly temporal and one degree spatial resolution.Although the low resolution of these data is a drawback, their availability over the entire globe for the full period of March 2000 through December 2010 (and beyond, as processing continues) makes them an attractive option for use in modeling. We first assessed the accuracy of the SYN downwelling solar and longwave fluxes by comparison to measurements at NOAA’s Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD) reference stations and at remote mountain stations. The performance of several snow models of varying complexity when using SYN irradiances as forcing data was then evaluated. Simulated snow water equivalent and runoff from cases using SYN data fell in the range of those from simulations forced with irradiances from higher quality surface observations or more highly-regarded empirical methods. We therefore judge the SYN irradiances to be suitable for use in snowmelt modeling and preferable to in situ measurements of questionable quality.",

            "abstract": "Since the 1980s the Amazon basin has experience an intensification of hydrological extreme events, which particularly affects the Andean Rivers. Particularly, the precipitation in the Peruvian Amazon area where Iquitos city is located shows the largest precipitation increment since the 1990s. Rain patterns show larger periods of droughts with more intense rains during the wet season. Recently, this region of the Peruvian Amazonian has experiment the most extreme flooding event since 1970, as a consequence of the change of regime in the rivers, where the extremes have become more pronounced. The extreme flood event that occurred in April 2012 inundated a considerable area of the city, setting a new water surface elevation record of the Amazon River in the zone. To study the impact in the floodplains and nearby Iquitos city, caused by the change of regime in the upper Amazon River, we analysed and simulated the past events to find patterns of inundation during floods. Data utilized for doing so, is based on the compilation and correlation of geological, and hydrological information related to flooding in Iquitos city. River overbank flow is a complex phenomenon that requires a correct representation of the physics. Actual approaches use algorithms that couple horizontally 1D model for the rivers and 2D models for the flood plains. They use over-simplifications for the interaction between flood plain and main channel and are unable to model the transversal momentum above the main channel. For that reason, we developed an algorithm that couples vertically the in-channel and overbank flows. This new model was validated against experimental results. The numerical results show an accurate approximation to the historical inundations of the city. The analysis and modelling shows that the flooding patterns have an substantial change due to the new regime observed in the upper Amazon River.",

            "abstract": "Until in-situ measurements can be made regularly on extraterrestrial bodies, thermodynamic models are the only tools to investigate the properties and behavior of chemical systems on those bodies. The resulting findings are often critical in describing physicochemical processes in the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface in planetary geochemistry and climate studies. The extremely cold conditions on Triton, Pluto and other Kuiper Belt Objects, and Titan introduce huge non-ideality that prevents conventional models from performing adequately. At such conditions, atmospheres as a whole—not components individually—are subject to phase equilibria with their equilibrium solid phases or liquid phases or both. A molecular-based thermodynamic model for cryogenic chemical systems, referred to as CRYOCHEM, the development of which is still in progress, was shown to reproduce the vertical composition profile of Titan’s atmospheric methane measured by the Huygens probe (Tan et al., Icarus 2013, 222, 53). Recently, the model was also used to describe Titan’s global circulation where the calculated composition of liquid in Ligeia Mare is consistent with the bathymetry and microwave absorption analysis of T91 Cassini fly-by data (Tan et al., 2014, submitted). Its capability to deal with equilibria involving solid phases has also been demonstrated (Tan et al., Fluid Phase Equilib. 2013, 360, 320). With all those previous works done, our attention is now shifting to the lower temperatures in Titan's tropopause and on Pluto’s surface, where much technical development remains for CRYOCHEM to assure adequate performance at low temperatures. In these conditions, solid-vapor equilibrium (SVE) is the dominant phase behavior that determines the composition of the atmosphere and the existing ices. Another potential application is for the subsurface phase equilibrium, which also involves liquid, thus three-phase equilibrium: solid-liquid-vapor (SLV). This presentation will discuss the current state of CRYOCHEM in representing the SVE and SLV of chemical systems at temperatures and pressures relevant to Titan’s tropopause and Pluto and the upper crusts of these objects.",

This analysis was performed over the period of 1950-2012 and for the Fraser, Peace, upper Columbia and Campbell River basins, which represent a range of distinct hydrologic characteristics. Four indicators are used to assess hydrologic change in this region, including minimum temperature, maximum snow water equivalent normalized by total annual runoff, total June-July-August (JJA) runoff normalized by mean annual precipitation, and river flow center of timing. The Coupled Model Intercomparison project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate simulations are used to quantify climate internal variability as well as climatic responses to different forcing agents, including solar variation, volcanic eruptions, greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols and other anthropogenic forcings. In order to estimate the hydrologic responses to these forcings the process based, semi-distributed Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model is calibrated based on observational records and then driven by downscaled CMIP5 data. Analysis of the trends of the hydro-climatic indicators showed that during recent decades, temperature has significantly increased in western Canada, while the normalized maximum SWE as well as normalized JJA runoff have significantly decreased, indicating a decreasing snow contribution to runoff and increasing evapotranspiration. River flow center of timing also shows a declining trend.",

            "abstract": "In this study, sensitivity simulations on the impact of rapid urbanization over Lake Victoria Basin in East Africa were done using a Regional Climate Model (RegCM4.4-rc29) with the Hostetler lake model activated. The simulations were done for the rainy seasons that is the long rains (March-April-May) and short rains (October-November-December). Africa is projected to have a surge in urbanization with an approximate rate of 590% in 2030 over their 2000 levels. The Northern part of Lake Victoria Basin and some parts of Rwanda and Burundi are amongst the regions with high urbanization projections. Simulations were done with the land cover for 2000 and the projected 2030 urbanization levels. The results showed that increasing the urban fraction over the northern part of the basin modified the physical parameters such as albedo, moisture and surface energy fluxes, aerodynamic roughness and surface emissivity, thereby altering the precipitation distribution, intensity and frequency in the region. The change in the physical parameters gave a response of an average increase in temperature of approximately 2oC over the urbanized region. A strong convergence zone was formed over the urbanized region and thereby accelerating the lake-breeze front towards the urbanized region center. Precipitation in the urbanized region and regions immediate to the area increased by approximately 4mm/day, while drying up the southern (non-urbanized) side of the basin. The drying up of the southern side of the basin could be a result of divergent flow and subsidence that suppresses vertical development of storms.",

            "abstract": "The proposed NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), or NISAR, Mission will make global integrated measurements of the causes and consequences of land surface changes. NISAR would provide a means of disentangling highly spatial and temporally complex processes ranging from ecosystem disturbances, to ice sheet collapse and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and landslides. The mission would capable of performing repeat-pass interferometry and collecting polarimetric data. The core of the payload would consist of an L-band SAR to meet all of the NASA science requirements. A secondary S-band SAR would be contributed by ISRO, the Indian Space Research Organisation. The instrument would comprise a large diameter deployable reflector and a dual frequency antenna feed and associated electronics to implement the fine-resolution, polarimetric, 240-km swath imaging system. Combined with an ambitious data acquisition plan that supports continuous mapping of Earth’s land and ice-covered surfaces at every opportunity over the life of the mission, the mission would generate over 1 Petabyte of raw data each year, which expands to greater data volumes for higher level products. Since many of the science requirements propose time-series analysis, which often involve combinatorial manipulation of images acquired over time, it would be impractical and inadvisable to create global time-series science products. As a result, the processing plan for the mission would be for the project to create a complete set of products through Level 2, and only selected Level 3 products over extended areas of calibration and validation. These sites would be chosen to be scientifically interesting, so that the mission products would include significant scientific results. In addition, the project will develop higher-level processing software to the community that will allow scientists to apply the mission data from Level 0 to 2 to their science problems.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of dissolved gases in lakes, rivers and oceans may be used to quantify underwater greenhouse gas generation, air-surface exchange, and pollution migration. Studies involving quantification of dissolved gases typically require obtaining water samples (from streams, lakes, or ocean water) and transporting them to a laboratory, where they are degased. The gases obtained are then generally measured using gas chromatography and isotope ratio mass spectrometry for concentrations and isotope ratios, respectively. This conventional, off-line, discrete-sample methodology is time consuming and labor intensive, and thus severely inhibits detailed spatial and temporal mapping of dissolved gases.\nIn this work, we describe the commercial development of a new portable membrane-based gas extraction system (18.75” x 18.88” x 10.69”, 16 kg, 85 watts) that interfaces directly to our cavity enhanced laser absorption based (or Off-Axis ICOS) gas analyzers to continuously and quickly measure concentrations and isotope ratios of dissolved gases. By accurately controlling the water flow rate through the membrane contactor, gas pressure on the outside and water pressure on the inside of the membrane, the system can generate precise and highly reproducible results. Furthermore, the gas-phase mole fractions (parts per million, ppm) may be converted into dissolved gas concentrations (nM), by accurately measuring the gas flow rates in and out of the extraction system.\nWe will present detailed laboratory test data that quantifies the performance (linearity, precision, and dynamic range) of the system for measurements of the concentrations and isotope ratios of dissolved greenhouse gases (methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide) continuously and in real time.",

            "abstract": "Capture and subsequent storage of CO2 in deep geologic reservoirs is progressively being considered as a viable approach to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In the long term, injected CO2 may become permanently entrapped as silicate minerals react with CO2 enriched fluids to form stable carbonate minerals. Potassium feldspars are highly abundant in the earth’s crust and are present in the caprocks and storage formations of many target reservoirs. While the dissolution kinetics and carbonation reactions of feldspars have been well studied in the aqueous phase, comparatively little work has focused on K-feldspar reactivity in the CO2-rich fluid. In this study, we used in situ infrared spectroscopy to investigate the carbonation reactions of natural microcline samples. Experiments were carried out at 50 °C and 91 bar by circulating dry or wet supercritical CO2 (scCO2) past a thin film of powdered sample. Water concentrations ranged from 0% to 125% relative to saturation, and transmission-mode absorbance spectra were recorded as a function of time for 48 hours. No discernible reaction was detected when the samples were exposed to anhydrous scCO2. However, in fully water-saturated scCO2, a thin film of liquid-like water was observed on the samples’ surfaces, and up to 0.6% of the microcline was converted to a carbonate phase. Potassium carbonate is the most likely reaction product, but minor amounts of sodium carbonate and siderite may also have formed from minor sample impurities. The extent of reaction appears to be related to the thickness of the water film and is likely a consequence of the film’s ability to solvate and transport ions in the vicinity of the mineral surface. Other features observed in the spectra correspond to microcline dissolution and precipitation of amorphous silica. Implications about the role of water in these reactions and the relative effectiveness of alkali feldspars for mineral trapping of CO2 will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Aeolian systems are ideal natural laboratories for examining self-organization in patterned landscapes, as certain wind regimes generate certain morphologies. Topographic information and scale dependent analysis offer the opportunity to study such systems and characterize process-form relationships. A statistically based methodology for differentiating aeolian features would enable the quantitative association of certain surface characteristics with certain morphodynamic regimes. We conducted a multi-resolution analysis of LiDAR elevation data to assess scale-dependent morphometric variations in an aeolian landscape in South Texas. For each pixel, mean elevation values are calculated along concentric circles moving outward at 100-meter intervals (i.e. 500 m, 600 m, 700 m from pixel). The calculated average elevation values plotted against distance from the pixel of interest as curves are used to differentiate multi-scalar variations in elevation across the landscape. In this case, it is hypothesized these curves may be used to quantitatively differentiate certain morphometries from others like a spectral signature may be used to classify paved surfaces from natural vegetation, for example. After generating multi-resolution curves for all the pixels in a selected area of interest (AOI), a Principal Components Analysis is used to highlight commonalities and singularities between generated curves from pixels across the AOI. Our findings suggest that the resulting components could be used for identification of discrete aeolian features like open sands, trailing ridges and active dune crests, and, in particular, zones of deflation. This new approach to landscape characterization not only works to mitigate bias introduced when researchers must select training pixels for morphometric investigations, but can also reveal patterning in aeolian landscapes that would not be as obvious without quantitative characterization.",

            "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of the amount and distribution of fuels is critical for appropriate fire planning and management, but also to improve carbon emissions estimates resulting from both wildland and prescribed fires. Airborne LiDAR (ALS) data has shown great capability to determine the amount of biomass in different ecosystems. Nevertheless, for most incidents a pre-fire LiDAR dataset that would enable the characterization of fuels before the incident is not available. Addressing this problem, we investigated the potential of combining a post-fire ALS dataset and a pre-fire Landsat image to model the pre-fire biomass distribution for the third-largest wildfire in California history, the Rim fire. Very high density (≈ 20 points/m2) ALS data was acquired covering the burned area plus a 2 km buffer. 500+ ALS-plots were located throughout the buffer area using a stratified random sampling scheme, with the strata defined by species group (coniferous, hardwood, and mixed forests) and diametric classes (5-9.9”; 10-19.9”; 20-29.9” and >30”). In these plots, individual tree crowns were delineated by the Watershed algorithm. Crown delineation was visually refined to avoid over- and under-segmentation errors, and the tree biomass was determined based on species-specific allometric equations. The biomass estimates for correctly delineated trees were subsequently aggregated to the plot-level. The next step is to derive a model relating the plot-level biomass to plot-level ALS-derived height and intensity metrics as explanatory variables. This model will be used to map pre-fire biomass in the buffer area outside the burn. To determine pre-fire biomass inside the fire perimeter, where ALS data are not available, we will use a statistical approach based on spectral information provided by a pre-fire Landsat image and its relationships with the 2 km buffer LiDAR-derived biomass estimates. We will validate our results with field measurements collected independently, before the fire.",

            "abstract": "Collisionless space plasmas often deviate from Maxwellian-like velocity distributions. To study kinetic waves and instabilities in such plasmas, the dispersion relation, which depends on the velocity distribution, needs to be solved numerically. Most current dispersion solvers (e.g. WHAMP) take advantage of mathematical properties of the Gaussian (or generalized Lorentzian) function, and assume that the velocity distributions can be modeled by a combination of several drift-Maxwellian (or drift-Lorentzian) components. In this study we are developing a kinetic dispersion solver that admits nearly arbitrary non-relativistic parallel velocity distributions. A key part of any dispersion solver is the evaluation of a Hilbert transform of the velocity distribution function and its derivative along Landau contours. Our new solver builds upon a recent method to compute the Hilbert transform accurately and efficiently using the fast Fourier transform, while simultaneously treating the singularities arising from resonances analytically. We have benchmarked our new solver against other codes dealing with Maxwellian distributions. As an example usage of our code, we will show results for several instabilities that occur for electron velocity distributions observed in the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric inverse modeling has been used to constrain biospheric and oceanic CO2 flux budgets for two decades. Recently, the idea of using such tools for quantifying anthropogenic CO2 emissions has also emerged. To date, most such applications have been at local to urban scales, which represent an important component of anthropogenic emissions but cannot be used directly to understand or verify regional to national scale budgets.\nThis presentation will bring together a number of efforts to address this gap through the development and application of inversion tools tailored to anthropogenic emissions. Rather than relying on isotopic signatures or co-emitted tracers, these studies are based on characterizing and leveraging the distinct spatiotemporal patterns of fossil fuel emissions.\nThe first set of studies assesses the extent to which fossil fuel emissions are discernable given current in situ and realistic satellite-based observations of atmospheric CO2. The second develops a wavelet-based parameterization that enables inversions that can resolve the fine-scale features characteristic of fossil fuel emissions from the diffuse information provided by atmospheric observations. The final set focuses on statistical strategies for disaggregating the fossil fuel and biospheric components of terrestrial CO2 fluxes.\nTaken together, these studies indicate that a number of confounding factors make the detection and attribution of regional-scale fossil fuel emissions very challenging using the current in situ monitoring network as well as satellite-based observations, especially during the growing season. They further indicate, however, that inversion approaches that leverage the distinct spatiotemporal statistical features of biospheric and anthropogenic emissions can be used to disaggregate these two types of fluxes directly from CO2 observations, given sufficient network sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "This presentation will bring together a series of studies that have probed the relationships between environmental drivers and CO2 flux at spatial scales ranging from the plot scale to the global scale, and time scales ranging from hourly to interannual. CO2 flux measurements from eddy covariance towers enable the examination of the primary drivers of flux variability at the plot scale, and across a range of temporal scales. Atmospheric inverse modeling studies that couple atmospheric CO2 observations with atmospheric transport models, on the other hand, make it possible to examine regional to global domains at spatial resolutions on the order of 100s of kilometers, and at hourly to monthly temporal resolutions. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that the environmental drivers that best explain flux variability differ substantially with spatial and temporal scale. This result implies that such scale-effects need to be explicitly considered in scaling up understanding of the processes controlling flux variability. This indicates, in turn, that extreme care must be taken in scaling up process parameterizations within terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), which are often parameterized, evaluated, and validated using plot-scale data. Such scaling is necessary in order to apply TBMs to reliably predict flux variability at regional to global, and at seasonal to interannual, scales.",

While the chemical pathways involved in ozonolysis driven SOA formation from individual monoterpene precursors is known, local and regional chemical transport models are still lacking observations of speciated monoterpenes from forested atmospheres. Here, we present high vertically resolved mixing ratio profiles of speciated monoterpenes from the ambient air of three neighboring forested ecosystems in the central Amazon Basin. Two well-drained plateau primary forests and one seasonally flooded valley forest were sampled during the afternoon hours (13:00 – 16:30) on walkup towers from the initiation of the 2013-14 wet season through the onset of the 2014 dry season (Nov 2013 – Jul 2014). Ambient mixing ratios in all three ecosystems were greatest in the upper canopy with secondary sources of some monoterpenes within the sub-canopies. Relative vertical compositions of monoterpenes did not change significantly throughout the seasons for either ecosystem type. Both ecosystem types were dominated by d-limonene (up to 1.6 ppb) with equally strong mixing ratios of alpha-pinene in the valley compared to the much weaker a-pinene mixing ratios on the plateaus (up to 200 ppt). The highly reactive cis- and trans-beta-ocimene were consistently present in both ecosystems (up to 250 ppt) with the addition of equally high camphene mixing ratios in the valley forest (up to 200 ppt) which is present in the plateau ecosystems in low quantities (50 ppt). With respect to clean atmosphere mixing ratios of 10 ppb ozone, lifetimes are below 2 hours for camphene and below 30 minutes for ocimene, suggesting a potentially large impact on local and possibly regional ozonolysis and subsequent SOA composition.",

            "abstract": "Determining the magnitude of warming since the last glacial maximum (LGM) is fundamental to our understanding of glacial-interglacial climate dynamics, but is currently poorly quantified in certain regions of the world. In the southern mid-latitudes, temperature reconstructions based on paleoceanographic and terrestrial proxies vary widely and the mean annual temperature during the LGM of the region remains an ongoing debate.\nThis study presents a reconstruction of LGM mean annual surface temperature in New Zealand using groundwater noble gas paleothermometry. The concentration of dissolved noble gases in groundwater depends on a dissolved-gas phase equilibrium reached at a distinct temperature, pressure, and salinity. Measurement of dissolved neon, argon, krypton, and xenon concentrations in paleogroundwater enables the reconstruction of mean annual surface temperature at the time of recharge.\nInitial results show an average last glacial period (LGP) mean annual surface temperature of about 4°C to 6°C cooler than today. Because the wells sampled have long (often >100 meters) screened intervals allowing for inflow of groundwater across a wide vertical profile, ‘mixing’ between LGP and modern waters influences the noble gas temperatures of LGP paleogroundwater samples. We therefore interpret the lowest temperature measured in this study, ~6°C cooler than today, as our best LGM mean-annual temperature estimate in New Zealand.\nThis value is larger than that of ~3°C, based on a number of paleoceanographic LGM temperature reconstructions in the vicinity of Australia and New Zealand derived from foraminiferal assemblages. However, this reconstructed mean annual temperature falls within the high end of a range of estimates from alkenones and foraminifera Mg/Ca-based studies, which have suggested LGM temperatures of 4-7°C cooler than present, and agrees closely with glacial-snowline based mean summer temperature estimates of ~6-7°C.",

            "abstract": "The Bengal Basin lies near the junction of the Himalaya and the Burma Arc subduction system. Continental collision is taking place to the north where the Indian Shield converges with the Himalayas with the intervening uplifted Shillong basement block. The Bengal Basin is built over the passive margin of India and has prograded the shelf 300-400 km since the Eocene. The basin is colliding with and subducting eastward under the Burma Arc. Global seismic velocity models do not apply well to this region because of the depositional environment in the Bengal Basin with sediment thicknesses ~20 km surrounded by Precambrian basement and an accretionary prism. Accurate velocity models are needed to improve earthquake locations and focal mechanism solutions in this region of high seismic hazard. While previous studies in this area show diffuse seismicity [Howe et al., 2013] there are several identifiable earthquake clusters. An improved velocity model will improve the accuracy of the hypocenters in known clusters as well as illuminate previously unidentified clusters. Several studies provide useful velocity constraints using well-logs, receiver function analysis, and surface wave dispersion [e.g., Sikder & Alam, 2003; Lindsay et al., 1991; Curray et al., 1991; Mitra et al., 2005,2008]. These approaches, as well as gravity studies [Rajasakhar & Mishra, 2008], support the suggestion of a layer of sediment gradually thickening from northwest to southeast, to more than 15-20 km thick in some places. While receiver function analysis and well-log data are extremely helpful with constrain depth-dependent crustal structure, lateral variations in structure are not well-sampled. In order to obtain better constraints, we use hypocenters and travel times of local and regional earthquakes that have source-receiver raypaths that stay within the crust and upper mantle. An array of seismographs has been in operation in Bangladesh since 2007. This study uses the recordings from this array to provides travel time data for local and regional events which are then used to compute better estimates of the crustal velocity structure in the region.

            "abstract": "Over the past century, global average surface temperature has warmed by about 0.16°C/decade, largely due to anthropogenic increases in well-mixed greenhouse gases. However, the trend in global surface temperatures has been nearly flat since 2000, raising a question regarding the exploration of the drivers of climate change. Water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Previous studies suggested that the sudden decrease of stratospheric water vapor (SWV) around 2000 may have contributed to the stall of global warming. Since 2004, the SWV observed by Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on Aura satellite has shown a slow recovery. The role of recent SWV variations in global warming has not been quantified. We employ a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model, the NCAR CESM, to address this issue. It is found that the CESM underestimates the stratospheric water vapor by about 1 ppmv due to limited representations of the stratospheric dynamic and chemical processes important for water vapor variabilities. By nudging the modeled SWV to the MLS observation, we find that increasing SWV by 1 ppmv produces a robust surface warming about 0.2°C in global-mean when the model reaches equilibrium. Conversely, the sudden drop of SWV from 2000 to 2004 would cause a surface cooling about -0.08°C in global-mean. On the other hand, imposing the observed linear trend of SWV based on the 10-year observation of MLS in the CESM yields a rather slow surface warming, about 0.04°C/decade. Our model experiments suggest that SWV contributes positively to the global surface temperature variation, although it may not be the dominant factor that drives the recent global warming hiatus. Additional sensitivity experiments show that the impact of SWV on surface climate is mostly governed by the SWV amount at 100 hPa in the tropics. Furthermore, the atmospheric model simulations driven by observed sea surface temperature (SST) show that the inter-annual variation of SWV follows that of SST, suggesting a close coupling between surface temperature and SWV.",

            "abstract": "Along-strike variations in seismicity of subduction megathrusts can be attributed to the frictional properties of the fault-zone material, which is affected by the distribution of weak clays (smectite and illite) within sediments on the incoming plate. In addition, metasomatic alteration of the subducting sediments may result in significant changes in fault strength and slip stability of the megathrust.\nWe examined an exhumed subduction thrust that separates serpentinite from tectonic mélange (argillite) of the Franciscan Complex, central California. The serpentinite represents a cataclastic shear zone, consisting of angular fragments in a fine-grained talc matrix. Talc schist also developed near the fault in beds up to 2 m thick. The argillite away from the fault displays a scaly fabric, composed of illite/muscovite and chlorite, while it is altered near the fault, characterized by the overgrowth of tremolite and minor chlorite along the previous foliation.\nWe determined the frictional characteristics of these samples by performing rotary shear experiments at pore fluid pressures of 40–120 MPa, effective normal stresses (σneff) of 60–180 MPa, temperatures (T) of 20–400°C, and sliding velocities of 0.3–100 μm/s. The serpentinite was frictionally strong (friction coefficient, μ, 0.6) and exhibited velocity strengthening only at 150°C. The talc schist showed a low μ of 0.1–0.2, characterized by velocity-strengthening behavior at all experimental conditions tested. Argillite showed μ ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 with increasing T and σneff and a transition from velocity strengthening to velocity weakening behavior as T increased above 300°C. The tremolite schist had a weaker normal-stress dependence of μ than argillite, with μ of 0.4–0.5 and a velocity strengthening to velocity weakening transition occurring at 400°C.\nWe propose that intense fluid–rock interactions took place during movement of the investigated fault. The serpentinite–argillite contact is frictionally unstable, capable of seismic slip, while metasomatic alteration will result in a temporal evolution of slip stability from unstable to stabile sliding behavior. Thus, fluid-assisted metasomatic changes are key in lowering fault strength and forming aseismically-slipping patches in the megathrust.",

            "abstract": "40Ar/39Ar age inter-calibration experiments, conducted as part of the US NSF sponsored EARTHTIME initiative, (\nhttp://www.earth-time.org\n), using two of the most commonly used 40Ar/39Ar mineral standards, Fish Canyon (FC, ~28.2 Ma) and Alder Creek (AC, ~1.2 Ma) sanidines, have revealed significant inter-laboratory inconsistencies. The reported ages for the AC sanidines range from 1.173 to 1.200 Ma (FC 28.02) (±~2%), ~4 times greater than the reported precision. These experiments have caused the 40Ar/39Ar community to scrutinize procedures and several informal lab intercalibrations have been conducted among different labs. This exercise is leading to better agreement, but discrepancies remain that need to be addressed.\nIn an effort to isolate the cause(s) of these inconsistencies, two Argon Inter-calibration Pipette System (APIS) were designed and constructed. Each consists of three gas canisters; one contains atmospheric Ar, while the other two contain artificial gas mixtures with 40Ar/39Ar ratios similar to those of FC and AC. Each canister has 4x10-10 moles of 40Ar, is equipped with 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 cc pipettes, and can deliver gas volumes from 0.1-0.7 cc. All volumes were determined manometrically to 0.4% or better and then filled to uniform pressure with Ar standard gases. This experimental design eliminates sample heterogeneity, leaving only interlaboratory variations in gas purification, data reduction, and isotopic measurement as potential sources of interlaboratory calibration discrepancies.\nAPIS-1 was designated as a traveling unit that is brought to participating labs. APIS-2 is the reserve/master standard. Currently, APIS-1 is in its early stages in the voyage and has been to three labs (Rutgers, LDEO, and New Mexico Tech) as of this writing. The interlaboratory comparisons are ongoing, and will include ASU, BGC, Univ. of Wisconsin, and Oregon State University, plus additional laboratories of opportunity. A progress report will be presented at AGU.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency events such as tsunamis generate acoustic and gravity waves which quickly propagate in the atmosphere. Since the atmospheric density decreases exponentially as the altitude increases and from the conservation of the kinetic energy, those waves see their amplitude raise (to the order of $10^5$ at 200km of altitude), allowing their detection in the upper atmosphere.\nVarious tools have been developed through years to model this propagation, such as normal modes modeling or to a greater extent time-reversal techniques, but none offer a low-frequency multi-dimensional atmospheric wave modelling.\nA modeling tool is worthy interest since there are many different phenomena, from quakes to atmospheric explosions, able to propagate acoustic and gravity waves.\nIn order to provide a fine modeling of the precise observations of these waves by GOCE satellite data, we developed a new numerical modeling tool.\nStarting from the SPECFEM program that already propagate waves in solid, porous or fluid media using a spectral element method, this work offers a tool with the ability to model acoustic and gravity waves propagation in a stratified attenuating atmosphere with a bottom forcing or an atmospheric source.\nAtmospheric attenuation is required in a proper modeling framework since it has a crucial impact on acoustic wave propagation. Indeed, it plays the role of a frequency filter that damps high-frequency signals.\nThe bottom forcing feature has been implemented due to its ability to easily model the coupling with the Earth's or ocean's surface (that vibrates when a surface wave go through it) but also huge atmospheric events.",

            "abstract": "Ultramafic mine tailings have an untapped capacity to sequester CO2 directly from air or CO2-rich gas streams via carbonation of tailings minerals [1]. The CO2 sequestration capacity of these sites could be exploited simply by increasing the supply of CO2 into tailings, such as through circulation of air or flue gas from mine site power plants [1,2]. Mine tailings storage facilities typically have heterogeneously distributed pore water [1], affecting both the reactive capacity of the porous medium and the exposure of reactive phases to CO2 [3]. We examine the physical reaction processes that govern carbonation efficiency in variably saturated porous media using meter-scale column experiments containing the tailings mineral, brucite [Mg(OH)2], that were supplied with 10% CO2 gas streams. The experiments were instrumented with water content and gas phase CO2 sensors to track changes in water saturation and CO2concentration with time. The precipitation of hydrated Mg-carbonates as rinds encasing brucite particles resulted in passivation of brucite surfaces and an abrupt shut down of the reaction prior to completion. Moreover, the extent of reaction was further limited at low water saturation due to the lack of water available to form hydrated Mg-carbonates, which incorporate water into their crystal structures. Reactive transport modeling using MIN3P-DUSTY [4] revealed that the instantaneous reaction rate was not strongly affected by water saturation, but the reactive capacity was reduced significantly. Surface passivation and water-limited reaction resulted in a highly non-geometric evolution of reactive surface area. The extent of reaction was also limited at high water content because viscous fingering of the gas streams injected at the base of the columns resulted in narrow zones of highly carbonated material, but left a large proportion of brucite unreacted. The implication is that carbonation efficiency in mine tailings could be maximized by targeting an intermediate water content in tailings storage facilities (e.g., ~20-60% saturation).\n[1] Wilson et al.

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is primarily due to the crystal preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine crystals, and reflects the space- and time-dependence of the deformation experienced by mantle rocks. Existing models (VPSC, Second Order, D-Rex, etc.) for the evolution of CPO make predictions in good agreement with laboratory experiments, but are too computationally intensive to be incorporated into 3-D mantle flow codes, especially when the flow is time-dependent. Using the state-of-the-art Second Order (SO) self-consistent model as our benchmark, we show that its predictions of crystallographic spin as a function of crystal orientation can be parameterized analytically in a surprisingly simple way that reduces the computational cost by orders of magnitude. The parameterization allows for different strengths of the three dominant olivine slip systems, as well as a macroscopic strain rate tensor having an arbitrary orientation relative to the finite-strain ellipsoid that encodes the prior deformation history. The parameterization agrees almost perfectly with the SO model (variance reduction greater than 99.7%), but with a computational cost that is smaller by a factor 2.104. We will illustrate the predictions of the parameterization using several geophysically relevant flow fields.",

The two-habit ice model is developed with state-of-the-art numerical methods for light scattering property calculations involving individual columns and column aggregates with the habit fractions constrained by in-situ measurements from various field campaigns. Band-averaged bulk ice cloud optical properties including the single-scattering albedo, the mass extinction/absorption coefficients, and the asymmetry factor are parameterized as functions of the effective particle diameter for the spectral bands involved in the broadband radiative transfer models. Compared with other parameterization schemes, the two-habit scheme generally has lower asymmetry factor values (around 0.75 at the visible wavelengths). The two-habit parameterization scheme is widely tested with the broadband radiative transfer models (i.e. Rapid Radiative Transfer Model, GCM version) and global circulation models (GCMs, i.e. Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). Global ice cloud radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere are also analyzed from the GCM simulation using the two-habit parameterization scheme in comparison with the CERES satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "The heightened media attention surrounding the 2013-14 solar maximum presented an excellent opportunity to examine the ever-increasing vulnerability of US national security and its Department of Defense to space weather. This vulnerability exists for three principal reasons: 1) a massive US space-based infrastructure; 2) an almost exclusive reliance on an aging and stressed continental US power grid; and 3) a direct dependence upon a US economy adapted to the conveniences of space and uninterrupted power.\nI tailored my research and work for the national security policy maker and military strategists in an endeavor to initiate and inform a substantive dialogue on America’s preparation for, and response to, a major solar event that would severely degrade core national security capabilities, such as military operations. Significant risk to the Department of Defense exists from powerful events that could impact its space-based infrastructure and even the terrestrial power grid. Given this ever-present and increasing risk to the United States, my work advocates raising the issue of space weather and its impacts to the level of a national security threat. With the current solar cycle having already peaked and the next projected solar maximum just a decade away, the government has a relatively small window to make policy decisions that prepare the nation and its Defense Department to mitigate impacts from these potentially catastrophic phenomena.",

            "abstract": "The historical reconstruction of past environmental changes in watersheds is essential to understand watershed response to disturbances and how those diturbances could affect the provision of valuable goods like water. That reconstruction requires the interpretation of natural records, mainly associated to sedimentary deposits that store detailed information in the form of specific biogenic molecules (i.e. biomarkers). In forested watersheds terrestrial vegetation is an important source of biomarkers like those associated to Lignin, a complex organic polymer used by plants to provide physical support in its tissues. Through litter inputs Lignin is deposited in soils and then is transported to sedimentary environments by rivers (e.g. floodplains, lake bottoms), serving as a source of information about vegetation changes in watersheds. In spite of the critical character of the information extracted from biomarkers in sedimentary records, the very concept of information is still used in a metaphorical sense, even though it was formally defined more than 60 years ago and has been applied extensively in ecology (e.g. Shannon's diversity index). Furthermore, sophisticated techniques are being used to deliver more complex molecular data that require examination and validation as indicators for watershed historical reconstructions. My research aims to explore the applicability of some information metrics (i.e. diversity indices, information coefficients) to a diverse molecular set derived from the chemical depolymerization of lignin deposited in floodplains and lake sediments in different basins. This approach attempts to assess the informational characteristics of Lignin as an indicator of natural/human-induced perturbations in forested watersheds. The formal assessment of the informational characteristics of natural records could have a profound impact not only in our methodological approaches but also in our philosophical view about information and communication in natural environments.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tohoku Earthquake of 11 March 2011 generated large deformation in and around the Japanese islands, and the large crustal deformation raises fear of further disasters including triggered volcanic activities. In this presentation, as an example of such potential triggered volcanic activities, we report the recent seismic activities of Hakkoda volcano, and discuss the relation to the movement of volcanic fluids.\nHakkoda volcano is a group of stratovolcanoes at the northern end of Honshu Island, Japan. There are fumaroles and hot springs around the volcano, and phreatic eruptions from Jigoku-numa on the southwestern flank of Odake volcano, which is the highest peak of the volcanic group, were documented in its history. Since just after the occurrence of the Tohokui Earthquake, the seismicity around the volcano became higher, and the migration of hypocenters of volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes was observed.\nIn addition to these VT earthquakes, long-period (LP) events started occurring beneath Odake at a depth of about 2-3 km since February, 2013, and subtle crustal deformation caused by deep inflation source was also detected by the GEONET GNSS network around the same time. The spectra of LP events are common between events irrespective of the magnitude of events, and they have several spectral peaks at 6-7 sec, 2-3 sec, 1 sec, and so on. These LP events sometimes occur like a swarm with an interval of several minutes. The characteristics of observed LP events at Hakkoda volcano are similar to those of LP events at other active volcanoes and hydrothermal area in the world, where abundant fluids exist. Our further analysis using far-field Rayleigh radiation pattern observed by NIED Hi-net stations reveals that the source of LP events is most likely to be a nearly vertical tensile crack whose strike is NE-SW direction. The strike is almost perpendicular to the direction of maximum extensional strain estimated from the geodetic analysis, and is almost parallel to the direction connecting Odake summit crater and Jigoku-numa.\nThese results suggest that the extensional field generated by the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake causes the upward movement of volcanic fluids and heat from the deep, and results in an activation of hydrothermal activities at the pre-existent fracture zone at the Hakkoda volcanic group.",

            "abstract": "Synthetic climate time series are widely used in hydrologic modeling, analysis and design. There are several methods for generating time series and downscaling them to the required spatial and temporal scale. Nonetheless, many of these methods are unable to preserve local variability and spatial correlation, as well as other information of the General Circulation Model (GCM) output used to generate the time series. Moreover, these methods are very difficult to implement in semi-arid and highly variable climate regions. This work presents a weather generator method capable of generating future climate time series specially designed to address these drawbacks. The method considers three step: (1) GCMs probabilistic trend extraction, (2) locally coherent stochastic generation of annual precipitation and temperature data around the trend, and (3) annual data disaggregation into smaller time scales using the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method. The probabilistic trend allows quantifying explicitly the impact of the uncertainty in the generated trend and comparing it against the natural variability. The method was successfully applied to the Limarí, Maipo and Maule River basins, three river basins with very different climate conditions in the semi-arid and Mediterranean region of Chile. Results show that the use of the k-NN resampling process allows preserving the strong seasonality typical of these areas, as the negative precipitations, commonly generated by alternative methods, are avoided. Despite the weather generator was designed for semi-arid regions, we show that it is valid to other climates.",

            "abstract": "Historic mining practices were conducted with little environmental forethought, and hence generated a legacy of environmental and human-health impacts. However, an awareness and understanding of the impacts of mining on ecosystem services has developed over the past few decades. Ecosystem services are defined as benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems, and upon which they are fundamentally dependent for their survival. Ecosystem services are divided into four categories including provisioning services (i.e., food, water, timber, and fiber); regulating services (i.e., climate, floods, disease, wastes, and water quality); supporting services (i.e., soil formation, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycling) and cultural services (i.e., recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual benefits) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Sustainable mining practices have been and are being developed in an effort to protect and preserve ecosystem services. This and related efforts constitute a new generation of “modern” mines, which are defined as those that are designed and permitted under contemporary environmental legislation. The objective of this study is to develop a framework to monitor and assess the impact of modern mining practices and sustainable mineral development on ecosystem services. Using the sustainability performance indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as a starting point, we develop a framework that is reflective of and adaptive to specific local conditions. Impacts on surface and groundwater water quality and quantity are anticipated to be of most importance to the southern Arizona region, which is struggling to meet urban and environmental water demands due to population growth and climate change. We seek to build a more comprehensive and effective assessment framework by incorporating socio-economic aspects via community engaged research, including economic valuations, community-initiated environmental monitoring, and environmental human-health education programs.",

The goal of this work is to mine data archives acquired from commercial operators using new algorithms that can detect when a space weather (or non-space weather) event of interest has occurred or is in progress. We have developed algorithms to statistically analyze power amplifier current and temperature telemetry and identify deviations from nominal operations or other trends of interest. We then examine space weather data to see what role, if any, it might have played. We also closely examine both long and short periods of time before an anomaly to determine whether or not the anomaly could have been predicted.",

            "abstract": "Surfzone vorticity was measured at Duck, NC using a novel 5-m diameter vorticity sensor deployed in 1.75 m water depth. During the 4-week deployment the initially alongshore uniform bathymetry developed 200-m long mega-cusps with alongshore vertical changes of 1.5 m or more. When waves were small and the vorticity sensor was seaward of the surfzone, vorticity variance and mean vorticity varied with the tidally modulated water depth, consistent with a net seaward flux of surfzone-generated vorticity. Vorticity variance increased with incident wave heights up to 2-m. However, vorticity variance remained relatively constant for incident wave heights above 2-m, and suggests that eddy energy may become saturated in the inner surfzone during large wave events. In the presence of mega-cusps the mean vorticity (shear) is often large and generated by bathymetrically controlled rip currents, while vorticity variance remains strongly correlated with the incident wave height.\nFunded by NSF, ASD(R&E), and WHOI Coastal Ocean Institute.",

This is perhaps most apparent in the proliferation of so-called \"accelerators\" such as the Intel Xeon Phi or NVIDIA GPGPUs, but the trend also holds for CPUs, where serial performance has grown slowly and effective use of hardware threads and vector units are becoming increasingly important to realizing high performance. This has significant implications for weather, climate, and Earth system modeling codes, many of which display impressive scalability across MPI ranks but take relatively little advantage of threading and vector processing. In addition to increasing parallelism, next generation codes will also need to address increasingly deep hierarchies for data movement: NUMA/cache levels, on node vs. off node, local vs. wide neighborhoods on the interconnect, and even in the I/O system. We will discuss some approaches (grounded in experiences with the Intel Xeon Phi architecture) for restructuring Earth science codes to maximize concurrency across multiple levels (vectors, threads, MPI ranks), and also discuss some novel approaches for minimizing expensive data movement/communication.",

            "abstract": "Proppants are small particles used to prop or hold open subsurface fractures to permit fluid flow through these pathways. In many oil and gas well applications, the most common proppant materials are sand, ceramic particles, resin-coated sands, glass beads or even walnut shells. More dense proppants require additives to create viscous fluids which can transport them further along wells and into fractures, but are generally preferred over neutrally buoyant options due to their increased strength. Currently, proppant strength and generation of broken fragments (“fines”) is analyzed via a standardized crush test between parallel plates. To augment this type of information, we present here the results of various experiments involving resin-coated proppants held at increasing pressures in fractured samples of Marcellus shale. The shale/proppant samples were imaged continuously with an industrial tomography scanner during pressurization up to 10,000psi. This technique allows for in situ characterization of fracture/proppant interactions and fracture void volume and average aperture with varying confining pressures.",

            "abstract": "The hydrology of high latitude catchments is sensitive to small changes in temperature, and likely to be impacted by changes in climate. Vegetation water usage can play a large role in catchment hydrologic pathways, affecting how water is stored, released, and partitioned within a landscape. Thus a better understanding of how vegetation impacts water partitioning in northern catchments can help us understand how climate change will impact high-latitude hydrology.\nAs part of the VeWa project, five catchments were chosen between 44oN and 64oN in Europe and North America, to compare the role of vegetation in the movement of water across northern landscapes. These catchments vary in aspect as well as extent of snowpack and their vegetative landscapes include heather moorland, coniferous and deciduous forests, mixed grass, and tundra landscapes. Importantly, all the catchments have records of stable isotopes in different waters of the system. An initial comparison of the water isotopes in these catchments demonstrates variation between the catchments, with the lower latitude sites showing more fractionation suggestive of evapotranspiration. While all catchments show a depletion of heavy isotopes in the spring, the depletion is most evident in catchments with a heavier snowpack. The vegetative growing season during the summer months shows the greatest impact of evapotranspiration on isotopes, indicating that an increased summer in a warmer climate would likely alter water partitioning and storage dynamics in these regions.",

            "abstract": "The future of water availability and security is of paramount importance. A climacteric challenge toward the future sustainability of this precious resource is to identify where and when water may become substantially limited in the coming decades and what are the key drivers. The sustainability of water resources are affected by many factors that include: population, wealth, energy, land use, as well as climate. Yet, prediction systems are challenged by uncertainties in models and observational support as well as the practical and theoretical limits-to-prediction of the Earth's systems. This limits any one forecast of a potential future as actionable information - and the scientific community has moved toward risk-based assessments to provide a likelihood of outcomes - to the fullest extent possible.\nWe present a synopsis of recently published and ongoing analyses from experiments with the MIT Integrated System Model (IGSM) linked to a Water Resource System (WRS). These experiments address the future of water stress in a global context as well as with regional lenses over the United States and a large portion of Southern and Eastern Asia. By 2050, global economic growth and population change can lead to an additional 1.8 billion people living under at least moderate water stress, with 80% located in developing countries. Combined, socioeconomic growth and uncertain climate change lead to a 1.0–1.3 billion increase of the world’s 2050 projected population living with overly exploited water conditions—where total potential water requirements will consistently exceed surface water supply. Using a large ensemble of scenarios that are consistent across economics, emissions, climate, population, etc., we develop risk portfolios of water stress over a large portion of Asia (Figure 1) and isolate the effects of socioeconomic growth (population and wealth) and climate change. We find the number of people under water stress more than doubles from about 800 million to 1.7 billion by 2050. These insights point to needed actions to adapt and protect future water supplies. Further experimental simulations are presented to demonstrate the utility of widespread adaptive measures that include: enhanced storage and transfer as well as water-use efficiency and reduced consumption.",

USACE is working to explore and develop global-scale, physically-based frameworks to serve as a baseline for hydrologic policy comparisons and consequence assessment, and such frameworks must include a reasonable representation of groundwater systems. To this end, we demonstrate the effects of different subsurface parameterizations, scaling, and meteorological forcings on surface and subsurface components of the Catchment Land Surface Model Fortuna v2.5 (Koster et al. 2000). We use the Land Information System 7 (Kumar et al. 2006) to process model runs using meteorological components of the Air Force Weather Agency's AGRMET forcing data from 2006 through 2011. Seasonal patterns and trends are examined in areas of the Upper Nile basin, northern China, and the Mississippi Valley.

            "abstract": "Automation in GPS coordinate time series analysis makes results more objective and reproducible, but not necessarily as robust as the human eye to detect problems. Moreover, it is not a realistic option to manually scan our current load of >20,000 time series per day. This motivates us to find an automatic way to estimate station velocities that is robust to outliers, discontinuities, seasonality, and noise characteristics (e.g., heteroscedasticity). Here we present a non-parametric method based on the Theil-Sen estimator, defined as the median of velocities vij=(xj–xi)/(tj–ti) computed between all pairs (i, j). Theil-Sen estimators produce statistically identical solutions to ordinary least squares for normally distributed data, but they can tolerate up to 29% of data being problematic. To mitigate seasonality, our proposed estimator only uses pairs approximately separated by an integer number of years (N–δt)<(tj–ti )<(N+δt), where δt is chosen to be small enough to capture seasonality, yet large enough to reduce random error. We fix N=1 to maximally protect against discontinuities. In addition to estimating an overall velocity, we also use these pairs to estimate velocity time series. To test our methods, we process real data sets that have already been used with velocities published in the NA12 reference frame. Accuracy can be tested by the scatter of horizontal velocities in the North American plate interior, which is known to be stable to ~0.3 mm/yr. This presents new opportunities for time series interpretation. For example, the pattern of velocity variations at the interannual scale can help separate tectonic from hydrological processes. Without any step detection, velocity estimates prove to be robust for stations affected by the Mw7.2 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, and velocity time series show a clear change after the earthquake, without any of the usual parametric constraints, such as relaxation of postseismic velocities to their preseismic values.",

To date, however, radio searches for exoplanetary radio emission have been unsuccessful likely because the observing frequencies are too high. Using the relatively new Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), we present analyses of observations of the highly eccentric Jovian exoplanet HD80606b during five epochs before and after the planet's periastron.\nAll of the gas giants in the solar system, as well as the Earth, exhibit magnetospheric radio emission due to the electron cyclotron maser instability. The power of this emission is modulated by the solar wind intensity. HD80606b is in a highly eccentric (e=0.93) orbit with a 111 day period. As the planet passes from apastron (0.88 AU) to periastron (0.03 AU), it experiences widely varying stellar wind conditions which should lead to variable radio emission with the highest power corresponding to periastron passage. HD80606b has been observed previously with the VLA at 325 MHz and 1425 MHz by Lazio et. al (2010), but LOFAR's lower frequency range (30-75 MHz) and high sensitivity is better suited to Jovian-type radio emissions.\nThe LOFAR observations were made 48 hours and 18 hours pre-periastron, plus 18 and 48 hours post-periastron to capture the predicted strongest emission, and near apastron to provide a baseline level. The data are analyzed for both time-dependent and frequency dependent emission at each of the five observation epochs. This work presents the ongoing analysis of the data.\nPart of this research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

We develop a very high resolution map of urban tree biomass, assess the scale sensitivities in biomass estimation, compare our results with lower resolution estimates, and explore the demographic relationships in biomass distribution across the City of Boston. We integrated remote sensing data (including LiDAR-based tree height estimates) and field-based observations to map canopy cover and aboveground tree carbon storage at ~1 m spatial scale. Mean tree canopy cover was estimated to be 25.5±1.5% and carbon storage was 355 Gg (28.8 Mg C ha-1) for the City of Boston. Tree biomass was highest in forest patches (110.7 Mg C ha-1), but residential (32.8 Mg C ha-1) and developed open (23.5 Mg C ha-1) land uses also contained relatively high carbon stocks. In contrast with previous studies, we did not find significant correlations between tree biomass and the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods, including income, education, race, or population density. The proportion of households that rent was negatively correlated with urban tree biomass (R2=0.26, p=0.04) and correlated with Priority Planting Index values (R2=0.55, p=0.001), potentially reflecting differences in land management among rented and owner-occupied residential properties. We compared our very high resolution biomass map to lower resolution biomass products from other sources and found that those products consistently underestimated biomass within urban areas. This underestimation became more severe as spatial resolution decreased. This research demonstrates that 1) urban areas contain considerable tree carbon stocks; 2) canopy cover and biomass may not be related to the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods; and 3) that recent advances in high resolution remote sensing have the potential to improve the characterization and management of urban vegetation.",

Vegetation heterogeneity, in addition to spatial and temporal variations of source contributions, makes prediction and modeling of these components complicated. Fine scale isotope (δ18O and δD) measurements of sources compared with water vapor isotope composition can provide a greater understanding of the potential temporal shifts of ET sources. In this study, we measured the stable isotope composition of δ18O and δD in water vapor at the vegetation surface using an isotope laser spectrometer while concurrently measuring the isotopic composition of terrestrial water sources, including snow, leaf, stem, soil, and surface water. As snow melt progressed and plant activity increased, we monitored how the isotopic composition of the terrestrial sources changed and compared these results with changes in isotopic composition of water vapor during the same period. This work was conducted in a subalpine watershed located in southeastern Wyoming during a six-week period in the early growing season. The goal of this research was to better understand how ET sources shift temporally during spring snowmelt.",

            "abstract": "Over the last several years, hydrocarbon exploitation and development in North America has been heavily centered on shale gas plays. However, the physical attributes of shales and their manifestation on transport properties and storage capacity remain poorly understood. Therefore, more experimentally based data are needed to fill the gaps in understanding both transport and storage of fluids in shale. The proposed work includes installation and testing of an experimental system which is capable of monitoring the dynamic evolution of shale core permeability under variable loading conditions and in coordination with X-ray microCT imaging. The goal of this study is to better understand and quantify fluid flow patterns and associated transport dynamics of fractured shale samples. The independent variables considered in this study are: mechanical loading and pore pressure. The mechanical response of shale core is captured for different loading paths. To best replicate the in-situ production scenario, the pore pressure is progressively depleted to mimic pressure decline. During the course of experimentation, permeability is estimated using the pulse-decay method under tri-axial stress boundary conditions. Simultaneously, X-ray microCT imaging is used with a tracer gas that is allowed to flow through the sample as an illuminating agent. In the presence of an illuminating agent, either Xenon or Krypton, the X-ray CT scanner can image fractures, global pathways and diffusional fronts in the matrix, as well as sorption sites that reflect heterogeneities in the sample and localized deformation. Anticipated results from these experiments will help quantify permeability evolution as a function of different loading conditions and pore pressure depletion. Also, the X-ray images will help visualize the change of flow patterns and the intensity of sorption as a function of mechanical loading and pore pressure.",

            "abstract": "Here we report dynamic recrystallization processes of calcitic fossils in weakly to fully recrystallized marbles to discuss the survivability of fossils and possible recognition of former fossils in fully recrystallized marbles. The marble is from the early Paleozoic sequence in the Jeongseon area of South Korea. Each crinoid stem in a weakly or non-recrystallized marble cut perpendicular to its length appears as a donut shape and consists of five calcite grains (300-500µm in size) with the same c-axis but different a-axis orientations. The misorientation angle between adjacent grains in a crinoid stem is 40-50°. The outer and inner diameters of the donut-shaped crinoid stems are about 900 and 500 µm, respectively. The recrystallization processes initiate on grain boundaries as bulging recrystallization while transgranular subgrain walls form within lattice-distorted grains. New grains also nucleate on twin boundaries and subgrain boundaries. Some subgrain walls become grain boundaries as they collect more dislocations with subgrain boundary migration. The newly recrystallized grains grow to reach a steady-state grain size of 20-50µm. In fully recrystallized and deformed marbles, the crinoid stems occur as elongated donut-shaped calcite aggregates. The crinoid stems can be recognized by their size larger than that of recrystallized matrix grains (5-20µm), With a higher degree of dynamic recrystallization, the randomness of the misorientation angle distribution of the recrystallized grains within a crinoid stem increases, indicating weaker lattice preferred orientation. We are trying to test whether lattice orientation maps (or AVA diagrams) can be used to recognize former fossil traces in fully recrystallized marbles.",

            "abstract": "For over 25 years, effective hazard communication has been key to effective mitigation of volcanic hazards in the North Pacific. These hazards are omnipresent, with a large event happening in Alaska every few years to a decade, though in many cases can happen with little or no warning (e.g. Kasatochi and Okmok in 2008). Here a useful hazard mitigation strategy has been built on (1) a large database of historic activity from many datasets, (2) an operational alert system with graduated levels of concern, (3) scenario planning, and (4) routine checks and communication with emergency managers and the public. These baseline efforts are then enhanced in the time of crisis with coordinated talking points, targeted studies and public outreach. Scientists naturally tend to target other scientists as their audience, whereas in effective monitoring of hazards that may only occur on year to decadal timescales, details can distract from the essentially important information. Creating talking points and practice in public communications can help make hazard response a part of the culture. Promoting situational awareness and familiarity can relieve indecision and concerns at the time of a crisis.",

In addition, solar radiation and reactive collisions with the torus plasma give rise to both new neutral species and water group ions. The interaction is strong enough to create an ionosphere with a density much larger than the background torus plasma, heat the atmosphere and significantly distort the background fields. We are in the process of developing a new model that combines a 3 D MHD model for the plasma interaction with Europa and its atmosphere and a 3 multi-species DSMC kinetic model that is an extension of the 2 D model of Smyth and Marconi (2006). While Europa's atmosphere has been modeled previously, this combined model will simulate the important mutual interaction of the magnetosphere and atmosphere f or the first time.

            "abstract": "Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) will pass Mars at a distance of 131,000 ± 3,000 km on Oct 19, 2014. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) will observe the comet on multiple orbits within 2.5 days before and after closest approach. The HiRISE telescope has a 50 cm aperture and an instantaneous field of view of one micro-radian per pixel, so the best image will have a scale near 131 m/pixel. If imaging is successful (i.e., not too smeared) and if the nucleus is larger than ~200 m diameter, this will provide the first resolved images of the nucleus of a long-period comet. Previous resolved images cover the nuclei of short-period comets, whose surfaces have been processed by many close passes by the sun. The encounter velocity is 56 km/s, so the best observations of the nucleus are only possible a few hours near closest approach, as seen from portions of 3 MRO orbits. A total of 20 HiRISE observations are planned for these 3 orbits, with exposure times varying from 0.13 to 2.5 s to cover a range of potential brightness. The HiRISE CCDs are operated at much higher temperatures, 20-30C, than those used for astronomical observations, so the maximum exposure time is limited by dark current signal. HiRISE objectives are to measure the shape and dimensions of the nucleus, determine its albedo (currently unknown for long-period comets), measure the rotation period and axis, and observe the inner coma for bright jets or outbursts. The phase angles range from 90 to 107 degrees, which will make imaging the nucleus challenging. The fast relative motions and changing geometries of the comet and MRO also make it challenging to acquire unsmeared images, since the image must pass directly down the 128 lines used for time-delay integration (TDI). Although the comet’s trajectory is probably well known (as nongravitational effects have not been detected), the exact timing is uncertain. Small timing errors could result in the image passing down the TDI rows at an angle, producing smeared images. Larger timing errors could result in the comet falling outside the HiRISE image boundaries.",

            "abstract": "The auroral acceleration region is an integral part of the magnetosphere-ionosphere electrodynamic system, and plays a key role in the transport of plasma and energy between Earth and space. This region is embedded with field-aligned currents that couple the magnetosphere to the ionosphere and is where parallel electric fields form that accelerate plasma to and from these regions. Though considerable progress has been made, the complex interplay between field-aligned current system formation, the development of parallel electric fields, changes in the plasma constituents, and auroral emissions consequences are not fully understood. The Cluster mission is well suited for studying the structure and dynamics of the auroral acceleration region. Over its lifetime, Cluster has sampled much of this region with closely spaced probes enabling the distinction between temporal effects from spatial variations. Moreover, this data when combined with auroral images from IMAGE or THEMIS GBO-ASI enable an assessment of the auroral emission response to spatial morphology and temporal development of structures seeded in the auroral acceleration region. In this study we present a survey of Cluster multi-point traversals within and just above the auroral acceleration region (≤ 3 Re altitude). In particular we highlight the spatial morphology and developmental sequence of auroral acceleration current systems, potentials and plasma constituents, with the aim of identifying controlling factors, and assessing ionospheric consequences under different conditions. Our results suggest that the \"Alfvénic\" activity may be an important precursor and perhaps may be playing an essential role in the development of \"quasi-static\" current systems during quiet and substorm active times. Such events are generally the result of an injection mediated process at or near the plasma sheet boundary layer, resulting in the local expansion of the plasma sheet. Key features of the conversion from Alfvén wave dominated to \"inverted-V\" current systems, such as transition times, spatial scales, and relationship to electric field, plasma density, and distribution features, and other properties will be discussed. Causal linkages between such processes and auroral emission features will also be addressed.",

            "abstract": "When massive storm events are imminently expected over a given area, flood forecast centers often need to execute hydrologic model simulations for multiple watersheds some of which may be large in size for distributed models to be able to complete in a relatively short time. And since it is advantageous to subdivide the watersheds for a distributed model like GSSHA to be able to have short run times, the operational solution needs to consider simultaneous simulations runs for the models of the individual sub-basins. The number of simulations in each watershed would increase if there are different scenarios that consider several weather forecasts with storm tracks and direction that produce many rainfall patterns that would differ in the magnitude and spatial distribution of rainfall. The problem is further increased when it is necessary to analyze several possible watershed conditions and several emergency operation alternatives for flood control. Some computer hardware solution is needed to perform the many that would result from the combination of the forecasted scenarios, the operation alternatives, watershed conditions in an already large number of watersheds which might also be subdivided into many sub-basins. The first problem is finding a suitable watershed sub-division that breaks down the size of the areas for the models in a way that saves run-time. This is accomplished in two test-case watersheds using a workflow of basin-model orchestration where arrangements of parallel and cascade simulations are done for the sub-basins of tributary rivers and the main river. The second problem of running all the possible simulations is dealt with using distributed computing options such as HT Condor and Microsoft Azure. The results are compared using operational performance indicators.",

            "abstract": "It is now well established that most of the terrestrial planets underwent a magma ocean stage during their accretion. On Earth, it is probable that at the end of accretion, giant impacts like the hypothesised Moon-forming impact, together with other sources of heat, melted a substantial part of the mantle. The thermal and chemical evolution of the resulting magma ocean most certainly had dramatic consequences on the history of the planet.\nConsiderable research has been done on magma oceans using simple 1-D models (e.g.: Abe, PEPI 1997; Solomatov, Treat. Geophys. 2007; Elkins-Tanton EPSL 2008). However, some aspects of the dynamics may not be adequately addressed in 1-D and require the use of 2-D or 3-D models. Moreover, new developments in mineral physics that indicate that melt can be denser than solid at high pressures (e.g.: de Koker et al., EPSL 2013) can have very important impacts on the classical views of the solidification of magma oceans (Labrosse et al., Nature 2007).\nThe goal of our study is to understand and characterize the influence of melting on the long-term thermo-chemical evolution of rocky planet interiors, starting from an initial molten state (magma ocean). Our approach is to model viscous creep of the solid mantle, while parameterizing processes that involve melt as previously done in 1-D models, including melt-solid separation at all melt fractions, the use of an effective diffusivity to parameterize turbulent mixing, coupling to a parameterized core heat balance and a radiative surface boundary condition. These enhancements have been made to the numerical code StagYY (Tackley, PEPI 2008).\nWe will present results for the evolution of an Earth-like planet from a molten initial state to present day, while testing the effect of uncertainties in parameters such as melt-solid density differences, surface heat loss and efficiency of turbulent mixing. Our results show rapid cooling and crystallization until the rheological transition then much slower crystallization, large-scale overturn well before full solidification, the formation and subduction of an early crust while a partially-molten upper mantle is still present, transitioning to mostly-solid-state long-term mantle convection and plate tectonics.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the nature and dynamics of heterogeneous flow in diamond subjected to shock compression is important for many fields of research, from inertial confinement fusion to the study of carbon rich planets. Waves propagating through a shocked material can be significantly altered by the various deformation mechanisms present in shocked materials, including anisotropic sound speeds, phase transformations, plastic/inelastic flow and brittle failure. Quantifying the spatial and temporal effects of these deformation mechanisms has been limited by a lack of diagnostics capable of obtaining simultaneous micron resolution spatial measurements and nanosecond resolution time measurements. We have utilized the 2D Janus High Resolution Velocimeter at LLNL to study the time and space dependence of fracture in shock-compressed diamond above the Hugoniot elastic limit. Previous work on the OMEGA laser facility (Rochester) has shown that the free-surface reflectivity of µm-grained diamond samples drops linearly with increasing sample pressure, whereas under the same conditions the reflectivity of nm-grained samples remains unaffected. These disparate observations can be understood by way of better documenting fracture in high-strain compression of diamond. To this end, we have imaged the development and evolution of elastic-wave propagation, plastic-wave propagation and fracture networks in the three primary orientations of single-crystal diamond, as well as in microcrystalline and nanocrystalline diamond, and find that the deformation behavior depends sensitively on the orientation and crystallinity of the diamonds.",

            "abstract": "Two problems common to many geoscience domains are the difficulties in finding tools to work with a given dataset collection, and conversely, the difficulties in finding data for a known tool. A collaborative team from the Earth Science Information Partnership (ESIP) has gotten together to design and create a web service, called ToolMatch, to address these problems. The team began their efforts by defining an initial, relatively simple conceptual model that addressed the two uses cases briefly described above. The conceptual model is expressed as an ontology using OWL (Web Ontology Language) and DCterms (Dublin Core Terms), and utilizing standard ontologies such as DOAP (Description of a Project), FOAF (Friend of a Friend), SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) and DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary). The ToolMatch service will be taking advantage of various Semantic Web and Web standards, such as OpenSearch, RESTful web services, SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) and SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language). The first version of the ToolMatch service was deployed in early fall 2014. While more complete testing is required, a number of communities besides ESIP member organizations have expressed interest in collaborating to create, test and use the service and incorporate it into their own web pages, tools and / or services including the USGS Data Catalog service, DataONE, the Deep Carbon Observatory, Virtual Solar Terrestrial Observatory (VSTO), and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. In this session, presenters will discuss the inception and development of the ToolMatch service, the collaborative process used to design, refine, and test the service, and future plans for the service.",

            "abstract": "The comprehensive particle and wave measurements of the Van Allen Probes enable us to monitor the entire radiation belt near the equator from L-shells of 2.5 to 6. Using the particle measurements, we create an improved, high-level quantity representing the entire outer belt. This quantity, the total radiation belt electron content (TRBEC), is the half-orbit sum of outer belt electrons over the radiation belt energy ranges of importance and all pitch angles using data from RBSP-ECT instrument on board both spacecraft. The goal is to characterize statistically the dynamics of the entire radiation belt by comparing TRBEC with solar wind parameters, magnetospheric waves, and electron seed population. When comparing TRBEC with solar wind velocity, our result shows a triangle-distribution similar to that which Reeves et al. (2011) found using geosynchronous electron flux. We also correlate TRBEC with other solar wind parameters to identify which solar wind conditions effectively enhance or deplete radiation belt electrons. In addition, plasma waves in the inner magnetosphere, via wave-particle interaction, are key elements affecting the dynamics of the radiation belt. Therefore, we compare TRBEC with integrated EMIC and chorus (upper and lower bands) wave power calculated from EMFISIS wave measurements to determine the relative importance between each wave-particle process. Finally, we demonstrate the ~100 keV seed population’s characteristics that correspond to the MeV population enhancement. While the gross features of the two populations are similar, the MeV population’s dynamics lag behind those of the seed population by 5 to 60 hours, which implies the acceleration or loss processes vary by event.",

            "abstract": "Coral reefs host a plethora of marine life and thereby provide a wealth of aesthetic and economic benefits to coastal countries. Anthropogenic influences, including local coastal water contamination, however threaten the health of these delicate ecosystems. Metal incorporation into carbonate minerals, the backbone of coral reefs, is known to have a large yet variable impact on carbonate structure and solubility. Yet, trace metal influences on the structure, porosity, composition, and solubility of coral skeletons is largely unknown. Here, we coupled synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (u-XRF) mapping and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy with micro-X-ray diffraction (XRD) to explore the distribution and speciation of trace metals associated with corals and their impact on the carbonate structure of corals obtained from reefs varying in anthropogenic influence – Florida Keys, FL USA and the Federated States of Micronesia. Iron and copper were the most abundant metals in the biological tissue, while in some areas zinc was observed in the tissue, overlapping with the skeleton. Trace metals were not detectable in the aragonite skeletons; in fact, the distributions of Ca and Fe were anti-correlated. XANES spectra show that the iron is primarily Fe(III), likely as the poorly crystalline iron oxide ferrihydrite structure or trapped within ferretin proteins. The same trace metals were observed in corals of different species and from different environments. This in situ investigation corroborates previous studies that corals tend to incorporate iron into the biological components but not into the aragonite skeleton. Given the dominant partitioning of metals within the biological tissue rather than the coral skeleton, the specific carbon molecules responsible for metal attenuation and their fate under changing geochemical conditions and following coral death require exploration.",

            "abstract": "Understanding spatial and temporal patterns of microbial conversion of nitrate (NO3-) to nitrogen (N) gas (denitrification) is important for predicting permanent losses of reactive N from systems. In many landscapes, wetlands serve as hotpots of denitrification by providing optimal condition for denitrifiers (sub-oxic, carbon-rich sediments). Much research on denitrification has occurred in non-urban or highly managed urban wetlands. However, in urban landscapes N-rich stormwater is often discharged into areas not designed or managed to reduce N loads. “Accidental” wetlands forming at these outfalls may have the capacity to remove NO3-; however, these “accidental” urban wetlands can contain novel soils and vegetation, and are subject to unique hydrologic conditions that could create spatial and temporal patterns of denitrification that differ from those predicted in non-urban counterparts. We performed denitrification enzyme assays (measuring denitrification potential, or DP) on soil samples taken from nine wetlands forming at storm drain outfalls in Phoenix, AZ. The wetlands ranged from perennially flooded, to intermittently flooded (~9 months/year), to ephemerally flooded (2-3 weeks/year). To assess spatial variation in carbon availability to denitrifiers, samples were taken from 3-4 dominant vegetation patch types within each wetland. To assess temporal variation in DP, samples were taken across three seasons differing in rainfall pattern. We found small- and large-scale spatiotemporal patterns in DP that have important implications for management of urban wetlands for stormwater quality. DP varied among plant patches and was typically highest in patches of Ludwigia peploides, indicating that plant species type may mediate within-wetland variations in carbon availability, and therefore NO3- removal capacity. We found a range of responses in DP among wetlands to season, which appeared to be driven in part by flood regime: DP in perennially-flooded wetlands was largely unchanged across seasons, DP in intermittently-flooded wetlands generally increased in summer monsoons and decreased in winter, and ephemerally-flooded wetlands had a variable response in DP to season. This pattern indicates temporally variable controls on NO3- removal capacity at the whole-wetland scale.",

To understand how tree species composition and stand structure change across temperate mountains, the species composition, size, and environmental information were collected over the past fourteen years in 880 quadrats of 20 m x 50 m of woodland communities distributed across Jiri and Baekoon Mountains, South Korea. The preliminary investigation on variations of tree species revealed that overall composition of tree species increased in terms of both diversity and biomass growth of tree species, reflecting fast and wide changes in temperate forests of Korea. Among dominant trees, the Quercus mongolica, Styrax japonicu, and Acer pseudosieboldianum recorded the highest increase in stand density, implying the most prosperous species under current conditions, while the species of Quercus variabilis and Fraxinus mandshurica appeared as fast declining species in the number. In terms of biomass growth of dominant species, the Stewartia pseudocamellia showed the largest increase of biomass, followed by Quercus serrata and Quercus mongolica., while the Fraxinus mandshurica appeared to have a rapid decline, followed by Alnus japonica and Quercus dentata. Overall, the fast change of composition in tree species is clear and further analysis to clarify the reasons for such fast and species-specific changes is underway especially to separate the effect of successional change and climate change.",

It is very important to generate high resolution flood return period map for the government and insurance company to evaluate the flood risk. This research was initiated to achieve this goal. A 2000 year spatial distributed stochastical rainfall was generated by analyzing the historical rainfall of South Korea using principle component analysis. A rainfall-runoff model and a routing model were calibrated by driving the model with historical forcing and calibrated against gauge observations. The calibrated model was used to couple with the stochastical forcing to generate 2000 year discharge and runoff. The flood maps with different return periods were generated by numerically solving the shallow water equations using finite volume method on GPUs. The results of this research showed a reasonable flood map in South Korea, compared with the observed data.

The DMS imagery is primarily used for identifying and locating open leads for LiDAR sea-ice freeboard measurements and documenting snow and ice surface conditions. The DMS is a COTS Canon SLR camera utilizing a 28mm focal length lens, resulting in a 10cm GSD and swath of ~400 meters from a nominal flight altitude of 500 meters. Exterior orientation is provided by an Applanix IMU/GPS which records a TTL pulse coincident with image acquisition. Notable for virtually all IceBridge flights is that parallel grids are not flown and thus there is no ability to photogrammetrically tie any imagery to adjacent flight lines.\nApproximately 800,000 Level-3 DMS Surface Model data products have been delivered to NSIDC, each consisting of a Digital Elevation Model (GeoTIFF DEM) and a co-registered Visible Overlay (GeoJPEG). Absolute elevation accuracy for each individual Elevation Model is adjusted to concurrent Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) Lidar data, resulting in higher elevation accuracy than can be achieved by photogrammetry alone. The adjustment methodology forces a zero mean difference to the corresponding ATM point cloud integrated over each DMS frame. Statistics are calculated for each DMS Elevation Model frame and show RMS differences are within +/- 10 cm with respect to the ATM point cloud. The DMS Surface Model possesses similar elevation accuracy to the ATM point cloud, but with the following advantages:\n· Higher and uniform spatial resolution: 40 cm GSD\n· 45% wider swath: 435 meters vs. 300 meters at 500 meter flight altitude\n· Visible RGB co-registered overlay at 10 cm GSD\n· Enhanced visualization through 3-dimensional virtual reality (i.e. video fly-through) \nExamples will be presented of the utility of these advantages and a novel use of a cell phone camera for aerial photogrammetry will also be presented.",

GPS-constrained kinematisc models that incorporate block and continuum techniques are used to assess patterns of regional tectonic deformation and its implications to seismic potential. We determine interplate coupling distributions, fault slip-rates, and intraplate crustal strain rates in combination with historic earthquakes within 40 seismic zones crust to provide moment rate constraints. Along the Nazca subduction zone, we resolve a series of highly coupled patches, interpreted as high-friction producing “asperities” beneath the coasts of Ecuador, Peru and Chile. These include areas responsible for the 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule Earthquake and the 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique Earthquake. Predicted tectonic block motions and fault slip rates reveal that the northern part of South America deforms rapidly, with crustal fault slip rates as much as ~20 mm/a. Fault slip and locking patterns reveal that the Oca Ancón-Pilar-Boconó fault system plays a key role in absorbing most of the complex eastward and southward convergence patterns in northeastern Colombia and Venezuela, while the near-parallel system of faults in eastern Colombia and Ecuador absorb part of the transpressional motion due to the ~55 mm/a Nazca-SA plate convergence. These kinematic models, in combination with historic seismicity rates, provide moment deficit rates that reveal regions with high seismic potential, such as coastal Ecuador, Bucaramanga, Arica and Antofagasta. We eventually use the combined information from moment rates and fault coupling patterns to further constrain stochastic seismic hazard models of the region by implementing realistic trench rupture scenarios (see Mahdyiar et al., this volume).",

            "abstract": "Wave-Particle Interaction Analyzer (WPIA), which is a new instrumentation proposed by Fukuhara et al. (2009), measures a relative phase angle between a wave magnetic field vector and a velocity vector of each particle and calculates the energy exchange from waves to particles. The WPIA has a potential to directly detect wave-particle interactions in space plasmas and will be installed on the ERG satellite of JAXA/ISAS. In the present study, in addition to the energy exchange proposed by Fukuhara et al. (2009), we propose the direct measurement of the pitch angle scattering of resonant particles by plasma waves via the WPIA by computing the Lorentz force of wave electromagnetic fields acting on each particle. We apply the proposed method to results of the one-dimensional electron hybrid simulation reproducing the generation of whistler-mode chorus emissions around the magnetic equator [Katoh and Omura, 2007]. By using the wave and particle data obtained at fixed observation points assumed in the simulation system, we analyze the Lorentz force acting on each particle and compute the averaged force in the whole simulation time, corresponding to 20,000 gyro periods. We use 200 keV electrons and the time, kinetic energy, and pitch angle resolutions of 500 gyro-periods, ±10%, and 1 degree, respectively, for the analysis of the averaged Lorentz force. In the result of the analysis, we obtain significant values for electrons in the kinetic energy and pitch angle ranges satisfying the cyclotron resonance condition with the reproduced chorus emissions. The obtained value is three times larger than the magnitude of perturbations in other pitch angle ranges. We compared the result of the analysis with the temporal variation of pitch angle distributions and wave spectra observed at fixed points in the simulation. While the pitch angle distribution varies similarly in both hemispheres, the obtained Lorentz force is only significant in the pitch angle range corresponding to the electrons moving northward (southward) in the southern (northern) hemisphere, indicating the pitch angle scattering of electrons by pole-ward propagating chorus emissions. The results of the present study demonstrate that the proposed method enables us to identify the location where the pitch angle scattering occurs in the simulation system.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation phenology strongly controls photosynthetic activity and ecosystem function and is essential for monitoring the response of vegetation to climate change and variability. Terrestrial biosphere models require robust phenology models to understand and simulate the relationship between ecosystems and changing climate. In thi\ns study, we combine satellite observations (MODIS) and large-scale climatic datasets(NLDAS and Daymet) to develop and refine phenology models for characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of grassland green-up variations in 2001 - 2010. We implement and calibrate multiple phenological models, which predict the timing of grassland spring onset via commonly available climatological variables. Model evaluation using satellite observations suggests that the Modified Growing-Degree Day (MGDD) model and theAccumulated Growing Season Index (AGSI) model perform better than other tested models. Inclusion of a photoperiod trigger in the temperature-based phenology model could improve the model applicability at the regional scale. In addition, we observe that AGSI outperforms MGDD by capturing interannual phenology variation in large semi-arid areas, likely due to explicit consideration of vapor pressure deficit. We further validate modeled timing of spring onset with eddy covariance datasets from flux tower sites. The timing of grassland spring onsets derived from recalibrated models show good agreement with reference timingsfrom satellite observations and in-situ measurements. Our results are in line with recent studies and imply that there is a need to calibrate current phenology models to predict grassland spring onsets accurately. We present a new spring phenology model that uses vapor pressure deficit to down-regulate GDD accumulation. We demonstrate the feasibility of combining satellite observations and climatic datasets for phenology model developments.",

ROV Jason was used to collect ultrahigh-resolution (submeter) bathymetric data sufficient to quantify characteristics of volcanic, tectonic and hydrothermal features; differences within vent fields from north to south include a change from low-relief volcanic domes cut by faults and fissures to higher aspect ratio volcanic domes dominated by aa-type lava morphologies (Ferrini et al., G-cubed, 2008). Highest temperature fluids are associated with crosscutting faults at all but Mariner vent field where faults are not observed.\nThe detailed maps were used to target areas within vent fields for observations and sampling. Vent deposit morphologies are similar at the northernmost vent fields (Kilo Moana, TowCam, Tahi Moana), with black smokers and diffusers present on branched edifices. Vent deposits at the more southerly ABE, Tui Malila and Mariner vent fields vary in morphology, despite similar substrate lithology. Examples include abundant flanges at ABE and Tui Malila and ~20m-tall spires and squat barite-rich edifices at Mariner.\nGeochemical analyses and petrographic observations document the influence of lithology, fluid temperature, pH, and extents of seawater mixing on deposit formation. Concentrations of As, which increase from north to south, reflect lithologic control. Sb, Pb, and Ba concentrations also reflect lithologic control, but are affected as well by low pH and/or extents of seawater mixing. The significant differences in Mariner deposits reflect formation from very high temperature, low pH (<3 vs >4) fluids that keep Zn in solution, combined with local subsurface mixing. Overall, results document the influence of the Tonga Subduction Zone on vent deposits through its affects on lithology and vent fluid composition.",

Our goal has been to reduce the primary barrier preventing us from acquiring the observations we need to understand geodetic processes, and the hazards they present, at subduction zones, submarine volcanoes, and subsea landslides.\nTo this end, we have designed a payload package for one of the University of Hawaii Wave Gliders which incorporates an acoustic telemetry package, a dual frequency geodetic-grade Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, meteorological sensors, processing computer, and cellular communications. The Wave Glider will interrogate high accuracy pressure sensors on the seafloor to maintain a near-continuous stream of pressure and temperature data. The seafloor geodetic monument seats a sensor capable of recording pressure, temperature, and sound velocity for a deployment duration of over 5 years with an acoustic modem for communications, and an integral acoustic release for recovery and replacement of batteries. The design of the geodetic monument allows for precise repositioning of the sensor to extend the pressure record beyond a single 5+ year deployment, and includes the capability to install a mobile pressure recorder for calibration of the linear drift of the continuous pressure sensor.\nWe will present the design of the Wave Glider payload and seafloor geodetic monument, as well as a discussion of nearshore and offshore field tests and operational procedures. An assessment of our ability to determine cm-scale vertical seafloor motions will be made by integrating the seafloor pressure measurements recovered during field testing with independent measurements of sea surface pressure and sea surface height made by the sea surface payload.",

            "abstract": "Urban heat islands (UHIs) occur when urban and suburban areas experience temperatures that are elevated relative to their rural surroundings because of differences in the fraction of gray and green infrastructure. Traditional methods of characterizing UHIs rely on the comparison of near-surface air temperature measurements between few sites in an urban area with those in a nearby rural area. This methodology assumes (1) that the UHI can be characterized by the difference in air temperature from a small number of points, and (2) that these few points represent the urban and rural signatures of the region. While this methodology makes it possible to compare the UHI of cities around the globe, it ignores the rich information that could be gained from measurements across the urban to rural transect. This transect could traverse elevations, water bodies, vegetation fraction, and other land surface properties.\nWe deployed a network of ~200 temperature sensors across the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) beginning in July 2011 and continuing to the present. Our network covers a 5000-km2 area encompassing the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul as well as suburban and rural areas within the seven-county region. The TCMA includes ~3.4 million people, nearly 900 lakes, and two major interstate highways and a beltway system. We employed a cokriging method to interpolate sensor measurements onto a continuous grid using satellite-based impervious surface fraction data.\nOur results show consistent warm anomalies, when compared with a background rural temperature, over the two downtown cores and along major highways and dense suburban areas. Anomalies switch between positive and negative values (i.e., warmer or cooler than the rural, respectively) depending on season over large lakes. The warm season (May – October) average TCMA UHI (all urban areas – all rural areas) peaks at night at 1.5 °C, while the cold season (November – April) UHI is ~1 °C and is less variable over the diurnal cycle. When the top 25 UHI events of 2011 – 2014 are averaged, there is a maximum UHI of 5 °C in the cold season and ~4.5 °C in the warm season centered on downtown Minneapolis with a value near 3 °C in suburban areas in both seasons. These results yield insights into UHI behavior that cannot be gleaned from sparse observational methods.",

Preliminary paleoseismic trenching confirmed that Fault 3432 had displacements in the late Quaternary indicating that it is with long recurrence, but the style of faulting and its role within the greater geologic context remains unresolved. Detailed site-specific geophysical investigations were performed in order to help characterize the Fault 3432 and plan future paleoseismic investigations. Seven two-dimensional seismic reflection lines were acquired using a distributed networked recording configuration. Standard seismic reflection processing and surface wave processing using IMASW were performed to resolve shallow stratigraphy within Camp Shasta Basin and Burney Mountain Hillside Basin locations. Using this data combined with geomorphology facilitated our mapping and interpretation of fault zone architecture within the study area. In both Camp Shasta and Burney Mountain locations, seismic reflection data helped locate discrete fault strands extending near surface. In addition, our interpretation of seismic profiles show that near-vertical steep faults merge at depth indicating negative flower structure. This fault structure suggests that the dominant style of faulting in the study area is strike slip with a normal component.",

Sediments display a range of stable isotopic and elemental chemistries suggesting there are changes in lake level, climate, or both during the Holocene in central New York. A ~13.5 m sediment core collected from the Catharine Creek wetland located south of Watkins Glen, NY at the southern tip of Seneca Lake was analyzed for total nitrogen (% TN), total organic carbon (% TOC), C/N ratios, δ13C of bulk organic matter (δ13Corg) and δ13Ccc and δ18Occ of carbonate. There is little change in TOC with the exception of an organic-rich interval (~20% TOC) between 5.5 and 4.3 m. Between 13.5 and 6 m, the C/N ratios decrease gradually upcore, from ~40 to ~10 – 20 and is paralleled by an increase in δ13Corg values from ~ -27‰ to ~ -24‰. Between 6-5.5 m, δ13C becomes significantly more negative (~ -30‰). The δ13Corg increases (to -26‰) upcore from 5.5 to 2.4 m. High C/N values (ranging from 60 to 20) from 15.5 to 11.8 m are consistent with input of land plants. The C/N values from 11.8 to 2.6 m range from 10 – 20 and represents a mixed signal of both algal and land plant derived organic matter. Throughout the Holocene, there has been a steady shift from negative δ13Corg values to more positive values of organic matter, which is consistent with an increase in the abundance of C4 plants in the watershed. Shifts in C/N over the length of the core suggest changes in lake level. In contrast, carbonate isotopic values (δ13Ccc and δ18Occ) do not covary and trends are consistent with a fresh-water, over-filled lake. In most lacustrine carbonate studies, calculated paleo-water temperatures from δ18Occ are commonly used prima facie to reflect environmental variability and constrain temperatures. In this study, wide variations in the calculated paleo-water temperatures reflect multiple carbonate sources / fractionations invalidating their use as a first order indication of temperature. We interpret the vertical stratigraphic variations of both δ13Corg and δ13Ccc to reflect either multiple sources or changes in internal carbon cycling / processes or both driven by a complex history of lake level changes associated with isostatic rebound.",

We consider O++, S++ as the main constituents of the Jovian plasma torus at Europa while its neutral atmosphere is considered to be composed primarily of (neutral) O2 molecules. We consider ionization processes of the neutral O2 atmosphere which is then a source of dense population of pick-up ions at Europa. We examine global structure of the interaction and we compare the simulated results with in situ measurements of spacecraft Galileo. The plasma composed of pick-up ions represents an obstacle for the Jovian magnetic field resulting in the compression of the magnetic field lines which in return causes development of temperature anisotropies. We study examine the regions where the threshold of temperature anisotropy driven instabilities has been reached. We also focus on the refiling processes of the small cavity formed in the plasma downstream the relative plasma flow between Europa and the magnetospheric plasma. We acquire high resolution simulated data along virtual trajectories of Galileo which allows us to directly compare simulation results to in situ observations.",

            "abstract": "Use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction from unconventional reservoirs has increased in the past decade and expanded across diverse geographic regions with varying water resource constraints. Hydraulic fracturing completions can require several millions of gallons of freshwater over a 2-4 week time period. This freshwater is often acquired from nearby surface or ground water, which will exert additional pressures on local water resources, potentially resulting in unsustainable development of unconventional reservoirs. The State of Michigan has a Water Withdrawal Assessment Tool (WWAT) that serves as a screening instrument for permitting high-volume water withdrawals. Although it was not originally designed to assess transient groundwater withdrawals, it is currently being used to evaluate groundwater withdrawals associated with hydraulic fracturing activities in Michigan. As a result, it may not accurately capture stream-groundwater interactions during hydraulic fracturing water withdrawals.\nIn this study we developed a high-resolution groundwater flow model in MODFLOW to investigate scenarios where hydraulic fracturing water withdrawals from unconfined shallow aquifers occur in the vicinity of headwater streams. The region of study is in Michigan’s northern Lower Peninsula where the surface geology is dominated by sandy glacial till and headwater streams are primarily groundwater-fed. In this region the Utica-Collingwood shale formation is being developed via high-volume hydraulic fracturing with individual gas well completions having reported use of over 20 million gallons of water. For future well development, the State has granted permission to withdraw up to 35 million gallons per well. Stream-groundwater interactions in the area are examined under transient pumping conditions similar to those expected during such groundwater withdrawals. We also evaluate the influence of the distance from the well to the stream, withdrawal well density, pumping rates, aquifer heterogeneity, and coincident industrial activities on potential reductions in base flow to the stream. Results from our modeling effort will be compared to those of the existing WWAT to assess the adequacy of the State’s WWAT in screening hydraulic fracturing water withdrawals in Michigan.",

To better understand these reactions, environmental chamber experiments have often been conducted at elevated terpene concentrations and HO2/RO2/NO3 ratios that are not representative of the real atmosphere, resulting in a range of yields.\nTo elucidate the reasons for these varying yields, a new series of experiments were conducted with varying concentration ratios of α-pinene or Δ-carene with N2O5 (source of NO3 radical) and with/without formaldehyde in a 8000 L Teflon chamber. Formaldehyde served as a precursor for HO2 to bias the system towards HO2-RO2 reactions, elevated N2O5 caused NO3-RO2 reactions to dominate, and elevated monoterpene concentrations (but not amount reacted) favored RO2-RO2 reactions. The chamber products in the gaseous and aerosol phase were characterized using an NO3/N2O5 Cavity Ringdown Spectrometer (CRDS), an Aerodyne High-Resolution Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS), a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), an Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counter (UCPC), an Aerodyne High-Resolution Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer using Iodide ion chemistry (I- CIMS), and a chemiluminescence NOx detector. The mechanistic reasons for the starkly different SOA yield from the NO3 + α-pinene vs. NO3 + Δ-carene systems were explored in addition to differences in gas and aerosol-phase composition and yields under the varying conditions of the primary terpene RO2 radical fate.",

            "abstract": "At the Mason Mountain Wildlife Management Area (MMWMA) near Mason, Texas, we conducted a 2D ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey using single-input-multi-output (SIMO) acquisition technique to image a Pennsylvanian high-angle normal fault. At the MMWMA, the surface geology is mapped extensively but the subsurface remains largely unknown. The main objective of our study is to develop a detailed subsurface structural image of the fault and evaluate existing hypotheses on fault development. Also, to develop and apply a new methodology based on Polarimetric SIMO acquisition geometry. This new methodology allows the subsurface structures to be viewed simultaneously from different angles and can help reduce noise caused by the heterogeneities that affect the electromagnetic waves. We used a pulseEKKO pro 200 GPR with 200 MHz antennae to acquire 8 north-south lines across the fault. Each line is 30 meters long with the transmitter starting on the Town Mountain Granite, footwall, with the receiver stepping 40 cm until the end of the line crossing the fault on to the Hickory Sandstone, hanging wall. Each pass consisted of a stationary transmitter antenna and the moving receiver antenna. The data were initially processed with standard steps including low-cut dewow filter, background subtraction filter and gain control. Advanced processing techniques include migration, phased array processing, velocity analysis, and normal moveout. We will compare the GPR results with existing geophysical datasets at the same site, including electromagnetic (EM), seismic, and seismoelectric.",

From December 2011 to February 2012 an earthquake swarm took place on a portion of the CCRDB, near the town of Tobosi, in the Cartago province. In this study, we use data recorded by the National Seismological Network of Costa Rica (RSN: UCR-ICE) to relocate 22 of these earthquakes and calculate focal mechanisms. Additionally, we analyze the Tectonic Geomorphology of the region. Our results show a transtension structure near the town of Tobosi, which comprises at least three faults, named: the Tobosi, Tablon, and Alumbre faults. This structure is located only 5 km south of the Aguacaliente fault, which caused the deadliest earthquake in Costa Rican history on May 4, 1910 (Ms 6.4). The earthquake locations analyzed are aligned with the Tobosi Fault. The events varied in moment magnitude between 2.4 and 3.9 Mw and depths of 1 and 8 km. The largest events were felt mainly in the town of Tobosi and as far as San Jose, the capital city of Costa Rica. We found that the Tobosi fault is an active left-lateral strike-slip fault with a normal component and is the source of the Tobosi earthquake swarm. The study of active faults in Central Costa Rica is significant as it may greatly improve seismic hazards assessment for this region where most of the population and the main economic activities are concentrated.",

            "abstract": "A key component of a dust emission scheme is the threshold for sediment transport, which is a function of soil size distribution, soil moisture, air and soil particle density, and surface roughness. For a particular region or landform that is not vegetated the variable that controls the transport threshold the most is soil moisture. This is because it is assumed that the other components vary little (air and soil particle densities) or are kept constant (soil size distribution and surface roughness). This puts the emphasis very heavily on soil moisture and wind stress as the key drivers of dust emission for specific landforms and dust emission schemes. Dust emission measurements were undertaken in 2011 on Sua Pan in Botswana, a large, flat, unvegetated salt pan, as part of the Dust Observation for Models (DO4 Models) campaign. The observations consisted of 11 climate stations placed within a 144 km2. Out of the measured and calculated erodibility parameters responsible for predicting transport threshold within current schemes, surface soil moisture and aerodynamic roughness length varied the most over the duration of the project and spatially across the pan. In 2011, the pan was drying from extensive flooding and rainfall in the previous wet season. Within the dry winter season months of June through September the dominantly eastern winds dried the pan developing a directional increase in aerodynamic roughness length over time. This cumulated in a region of maximum roughness length with the highest potential for dust emissions. In some cases, the aerodynamic roughness length of the bare soil increased by three orders of magnitude within the three month period. This increase in roughness almost doubles the modelled threshold shear velocity required for this surface to be emissive. The temporal and spatial variability of the calculated transport threshold is explored with observed data and compared with the modelled transport threshold for this region for the campaign duration. These results suggest that for dry saline lakes and other evaporite and unvegetated emissive surfaces the surface roughness changes dramatically from season to season and can have a direct effect on the soil surface emissivity. In conclusion, more research is needed to resolve the variation in spatial and temporal dust production within these landform.",

That means there are two controlling factors impacting the processes of channel avulsions: (1) Rc—bankfull hydraulic radius of transverse section of the bifurcation point, which is determined by inputting water and sediment conditions upstream; (2)Sc—local riverbed slope of the bifurcation point, which exhibits a good nonlinear relation with the channel length downstream from the point to the sea. The results in this paper imply that: firstly, the channels in the estuary are divided into two states: stable when τ>τc, non-stable (channel avulsion) when τ<τc; Secondly, channel avulsions of costal deltas of alluvial rivers are determined not only by inputting water and sediment conditions upstream (impacting on transverse sections), but also by base eroding levels in estuaries downstream (impacting on longitudinal sections).",

The rapidly increasing availability of data and information in digital form from a variety of data repositories, networks, and other sources provides new opportunities to link and integrate both traditional data holdings as well as emerging “big data” resources in ways that enable interdisciplinary research and facilitate the use of objective scientific data and information in society. Taking advantage of these opportunities not only requires improved technical and scientific data interoperability across disciplines, scales, and data types, but also concerted efforts to bridge gaps and barriers between key communities, institutions, and networks. Given the long time perspectives required in planning sustainable approaches to development, it is also imperative to address user requirements for long-term data continuity and stewardship by trustworthy repositories. We report here on lessons learned by CIESIN working on a range of sustainable development issues to integrate data across multiple repositories and networks. This includes CIESIN’s roles in developing policy-relevant climate and environmental indicators, soil data for African agriculture, and exposure and risk measures for hazards, disease, and conflict, as well as CIESIN’s participation in a range of national and international initiatives related both to sustainable development and to open data access, interoperability, and stewardship.",

The length of the run allows us to account for interannual variability of North African dust emissions and transport in the model. CESM’s monthly climatology of both aerosol optical depth and surface dust concentration at Cape Verde and Barbados, respectively, agree well with available observations, as does the aerosol size distribution at Cape Verde. In addition, CESM shows strong seasonal cycles of dust burden and lower tropospheric cloud fraction, with maximum values occurring during boreal summer, when a strong correlation between these two variables exists over the subtropical North Atlantic. Calculations of Estimated Inversion Strength (EIS) and composites of EIS on high and low downstream North Africa dust months during boreal summer reveal that dust is likely increasing inversion strength over this region due to both solar absorption and reflection. We find no evidence for a microphysical link between dust and lower tropospheric clouds in this region. These results yield new insight over an extensive period of time into the complex relationship between North African dust and North Atlantic lower tropospheric clouds, which has previously been hindered by spatiotemporal constraints of observations. Our findings lay a framework for future analyses using different climate models and sub-monthly data over regions with different underlying dynamics.",

            "abstract": "During geomagnetically active times, the ionosphere – thermosphere (IT) system is strongly affected by magnetospheric energy that comes in the form of auroral particle precipitation and Poynting flux. This ultimately results in the increase of the thermospheric mass density, a critical parameter not only for determining and predicting air drag on satellites, but also for understanding the solar wind - magnetosphere- IT coupling. We use observations and model simulations to explore when, where and how energy transfers from the solar wind through the magnetosphere and is deposited into the IT system during solar wind disturbances. We observe and simulate dynamic pressure impacts on the magnetosphere and a magnetic storm main phase. We use thermospheric density observations from the CHAMP and GRACE satellites and Poynting flux measurements from Defense Meteorological Satellite Platform (DMSP) satellites. We show that the thermosphere density as well as the downward Poynting flux intensified shortly after (within ~20 min) the sudden enhancement of the solar wind dynamic pressure mostly in the dayside auroral zone and polar cap regions with the peaks in the vicinity of the cusp. Simulations from the two-way coupled OpenGGCM-CTIM magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere model show that the ionospheric Joule heating also increases abruptly along with the sudden enhancement of the dynamic pressure in the same regions. The modeling results show that the pair of high-latitude localized cusp field-aligned currents (FACs) are intensified and extended azimuthally as a result of the enhanced dayside high-latitude reconnection caused by the sudden increase of the solar wind dynamic pressure. They are likely the source of the enhanced Joule heating and the ensuing thermospheric heating in that region. We also look at the first hours of a magnetic storm main phase where the picture is significantly more complex, but Poynting flux and thermospheric density first enhance at polar latitudes within the same spatial region before the heating moves equatorward. We look for general trends of the correlation between Poynting flux and thermospheric heating with an initial superposed epoch analysis study.",

These parameters are useful to better understand the process of spatial and temporal stress distributions in a mine. In this study, variations of travel time and amplitude of seismic waves derived from the conventional constant velocity models are compared to the ones derived from 3D variable velocity model. The results show a significant variation in seismic energy distribution at the mine due to presence of very strong elastic contrast, and the observed complexity of the propagated seismic waves require the use of a variable velocity model. An active deep mine located in Sudbury Ontario Canada hosted this study. Dense 3D arrays of geophones, which are distributed around ore-bodies, have been monitoring controlled production blasts and microseismic events since the mine has started production. It is shown here that the conventional empirical method used to calculate peak particle velocities and accelerations (PPVs/PPAs), tends to underestimate the intensity of seismic waves in stopes or areas close to blast sites. This could be corrected if a more realistic model was implemented. Comparing the travel time information from recorded events in the past few years showed the temporal changes in the mine velocity model as mining progressed, thus updating the velocity model of the mine is needed if better accuracy of event location is required. In this study, a 2D/3D finite difference modeling method is used.",

            "abstract": "Soil depth and soil water holding capacity are fundamental controls on land surface processes and terrestrial ecology, and are critically important in understanding links between water and climate globally. However, field surveys of soil water below 1-meter are sparse, and sub-surface water storage variability is nearly impossible to monitor over a global domain.  NASA's GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) mission has been observing global terrestrial water storage anomalies at consistent, monthly intervals over a longer than 10-year record, allowing us to measure dynamic soil water storage as a component of that signal. Here, we combine 1-degree scaled GRACE water storage observations with estimates of surface and snow water storage to derive a global, sub-surface water storage anomaly time series with uncertainty. We convolve this result with global maps of soil porosity from the FAO/UNESCO Harmonized Soil Database and a simple model of soil saturation to produce an observation-based estimate of effective soil profile depth with global coverage. Our results show 1-degree global soil storage requirements typically ranging between 2 to 100 cm, for a total terrestrial soil water storage capacity of roughly 15x103 km3.  The observed storage indicates effective soil depths between 0.5 and 10 meters, with a global mean value of 1.5 +/- 0.5 meters. Effective soil depths are correlated with land cover type, temperature and precipitation. Comparisons with previous statistical and empirical methods suggest greater capacity and greater depth using the GRACE-based method. This methodology offers a new tool for ongoing monitoring of global soils, and has implications for hydrological fluxes in Earth System models which usually assume a globally uniform soil depth.",

To answer this, we first need to understand the relationship between environmental and ecosystem change – i.e., the ecosystem sensitivity. Addressing this question requires understanding of how biota respond to (a succession of) sudden environmental perturbations of varying sizes and durations in varying background conditions (i.e., climatic, oceanographic, biotic).\nHere, we compare new and published data from the Early to Middle Eocene greenhouse world to understand the sensitivity of marine ecosystems to background environmental change and hyperthermal events. This work focuses on the early Paleogene, because it is considered to be a good analog for a future high CO2 world. Newly generated high-resolution multiproxy datasets based on northern Atlantic DSDP Leg 48 and IODP Leg 342 material will allow us to compare the marine ecosystem responses (including bentho-pelagic systems) to abiotic drivers across climatic disruptions of differing magnitude.\nInitial results of a benthic foraminiferal community comparison including the PETM and ETM2 hyperthermals in the northeastern Atlantic DSDP sites 401 and 5501 suggest that benthic ecosystem sensitivity may actually be non-linearly linked to background climate states as reflected by a range of geochemical proxies (XRF, TOC, CaCO3, grain sizes, XRD clay mineralogy and foraminiferal δ18O, δ13C, Mg/Ca)2,3, in contrast to planktic communities4. Testing the type of scaling across different taxa, communities, initial background conditions and time scales may be the first big step to disentangle the often synergistic effects of environmental change on ecosystems5.\n",

In this project, different geological models were designed to analyze some difficulties encountered in the interpretation of seismic data. Another idea is these data become available for LENEP/UENF students to test new tools to assist in seismic data processing.\nThe geological models were created considering some characteristics found in oil exploration. We simulated geological medium with volcanic intrusions, salt domes, fault, pinch out and layers more distante from surface (Kanao, 2012).\nWe used the software Tesseral Pro to simulate the seismic acquisitions. The acquisition geometries simulated were of the type common offset, end-on and split-spread. (Figure 1)\nData acquired with constant offset require less processing routines. The processing flow used with tools available in Seismic Unix package (for more details, see Pennington et al., 2005) was geometric spreading correction, deconvolution, attenuation correction and post-stack depth migration. In processing of the data acquired with end-on and split-spread geometries, we included velocity analysis and NMO correction routines.\nAlthough we analyze synthetic data and carefully applied each processing routine, we can observe some limitations of the seismic reflection in imaging thin layers, great surface depth layers, layers with low impedance contrast and faults.",

            "abstract": "Adapting from a traditional government-funded research program to supporting the work through a start-up company is a difficult (and often not successful) transition. This is made more challenging in that with the relative decline in federal funding for the sciences the transition is forced on many researchers as a matter of survival. The business model of traditional research is not that different from that of the private sector; the development of an idea, models or mock-ups of the product, pitching to sources of funding, creating and marketing the product. However they differ significantly in the environment in which they are applied, as well as in the life span of a project or product. The environments for pitching an idea and gaining investment are very different in academia from that of the private sector, and most academics are stymied by the new approach. In addition, many universities labor under the illusion that start-ups will be a windfall, when in reality they represent a long term investment that will not pay out for many years. This extended timeline is also something new to academics, though persistence pays and a project may take years to fund, after it is complete and the publications written, many in the geosciences go on to new ideas. If a business is to be successful it must continue with a product long term, and develop new ideas around it. A hopefully successful balance of these approaches is being tried at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where start-ups can build upon university intellectual property and use university resources to build a successful business. In turn the business supports research and development, primarily through faculty, staff and students at the university.",

            "abstract": "Numerous speleothem studies have analysed the age distribution of stalagmites harvested from multiple caves and inferred important changes in paleoclimates to explain stalagmite growth phases. However, stalagmites take tens to hundreds of thousands of years to grow, and thus the twin desires to preserve the cave condition for future generations and advance palaeoclimate science are often in conflict. In this study we use U/Th ages from low impact mini-cores extracted in situ from the bases of stalagmites, thus keeping the intrinsic value of the cave intact.\nOur case study is based on 77 individual stalagmites drilled in situ in thirteen caves located in and around Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The stalagmites grew during discrete time intervals within the last ~530,000 years, and analysis of their age distribution shows an exponential decrease in the number of older stalagmites surviving to the present day. The age distribution indicates that the rate of natural attrition of stalagmites is approximately constant through time, probably in response to a number of natural processes, including downward erosion of the karst terrain, cave collapse, in-cave erosional processes and in-cave sedimentation covering stalagmites. Natural attrition of stalagmites is likely to be a general cave phenomenon, and has important implications for cave conservation because it highlights that random removal of stalagmites without prior knowledge of their ages will result in unnecessary replication and a failure to sample the full length of the available paleoclimate record.\nDeparture from this “normal” exponential profile can be used to infer palaeoclimate information: significant deviations are produced by periods of more frequent stalagmite growth, inferred here to reflect increases in monsoon rainfall over Sulawesi (345–340, 75–70 and 10–5 kyr BP). By adjusting the record to account for stalagmite attrition, more statistically robust paleoclimate information can be inferred.\nCrucially, these insights on past climates have been obtained entirely from reconnaissance-style basal mini-core ages. This novel technique is therefore suitable for caves where the removal of stalagmites would cause irreparable damage, or jeopardize local cultural and tourism potential.",

            "abstract": "Research over the last 35 years has demonstrated a substantial influence of deep-sea hydrothermal venting on seawater chemistry proximal to vent sites, but basin-scale hydrothermal effects are to date only hypothesized on the basis of limited seawater and sediment sampling downstream of vent sites. The U.S. GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect cruise investigated these potential long-range hydrothermal influences by sampling along the 15°S southern East Pacific Rise (EPR) plume, which is known to extend >4000 km from the EPR based on He-3 distributions. We present measurements of 30 particulate elements (>0.45 µm, filtered from GO-Flo bottles) at 11 stations along this transect. Concentrations of pFe and pMn peaked at 90 nM and 9 nM at 2425m above the EPR ridge axis (Sta 18), with no measurable back-transport to the east. A clear plume signature was detected at all stations from the ridge axis to the last station 4300 km to the west, where attenuated but background-distinguishable pFe and pMn peaks of 0.31 and 0.11 nM persisted at 2500m (Sta 36). Notably, the pMn peak appeared slightly deeper than the pFe peak near-field, and distal pMn decreased faster than pFe, a prime example of variable particle composition and settling behavior along the plume. The oxyanions pV (377 pM max) and pP (20 nM max) and particle-reactive pNd (2.42 pM max) all showed strong correlations with pFe and similarly remained enriched at distal stations, suggesting scavenging by Fe oxyhydroxides. The chalcophiles pCu (0.27 nM), pZn (75 pM), pCd (0.35 pM), and pCo (5.7 pM) were all enhanced near-field but, except pCu, reached background concentrations by Sta 23, indicating that sulfide particles either preferentially settle or dissolve early in plume evolution. Elevated pCu, in contrast, persisted throughout the sampled plume length. No elevated pAl, pTi, or pNi was evident in the hydrothermal plume, yet a substantial nepheloid layer with high concentrations of crustally-dominated elements was detected from 4000m to near-bottom depths >5000m in the westernmost section (Sta 32 and 36). Further physical and chemical characterization and modeling of this 4300-km particulate hydrothermal plume will help reveal what combination of size, density, and chemical speciation permits such long-range hydrothermal particle transport in the South Pacific.",

            "abstract": "The Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ) in the Pacific Northwest where the pacific plate is subducting beneath the North American plate may be capable of producing M 9 earthquakes. At its southern end, the CSZ terminates at the Mendocino triple junction in northern California, a region of frequent seismic activity. The 1992 M 7.1 Cape Mendocino earthquake caused up to 1.4 m of measured coseismic deformation and it is thought to have been rupture of the southern end of the CSZ. I will present static GPS monument relocation data and the positions of intertidal organisms to measure the interseismic crustal deformation in the 22 years since the 1992 event. This evidence for post- and interseismic lithospheric response may show whether the earthquake was due to rupture of the southern end of the CSZ or a subsidiary fault. Because the megathrust has higher strain rates than subsidiary faults, we expect that significant interseismic deformation should have occurred if the 1992 earthquake was on the subduction zone interface. It will also provide an estimate of whether post-seismic recovery has been occurring since that event. Although the coseismic deformation was well documented via leveling and Vertical Extent of Mortality (VEM) of sessile intertidal organisms, no post seismic work had been done to measure the interseismic deformation. This study utilizes high resolution GPS observation of established benchmarks compared with the leveling from 1992 to measure the vertical change. It also compares elevation of specific intertidal organism colonies to the elevation of living organisms following the 1992 uplift as a proxy for relative sea level change. Quantifying the interseismic deformation allows us to better understand the source of the earthquake and how the upper plate is responding to strain accumulation along the subduction zone. Significant interseismic deformation would indicate that the fault may be reloading quickly and the earthquake was likely associated with rupture of the megathrust, which has much higher strain rates than subsidiary faults. This, in turn, may suggest segmentation of the southern CSZ. Little interseismic deformation might indicate the 1992 earthquake occurred on a subsidiary fault and not the megathrust itself. Preliminary results indicate that there has been little interseismic deformation.",

            "abstract": "Many science projects in the future will be accomplished through collaboration among 2 or more NASA centers along with, potentially, external scientists. Science teams will be composed of more geographically dispersed individuals and groups. However, the current computing environment does not make this easy and seamless. By being able to share computing resources among members of a multi-center team working on a science/ engineering project, limited pre-competition funds could be more efficiently applied and technical work could be conducted more effectively with less time spent moving data or waiting for computing resources to free up. Based on the work from an NASA CIO IT Labs task, this presentation will highlight our prototype work in identifying the feasibility and identify the obstacles, both technical and management, to perform \"Cloudbursting\" among private clouds located at three different centers. We will demonstrate the use of private cloud computing infrastructure at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Langley Research Center, and Ames Research Center to provide elastic computation to each other to perform parallel Earth Science data imaging. We leverage elastic load balancing and auto-scaling features at each data center so that each location can independently define how many resources to allocate to a particular job that was \"bursted\" from another data center and demonstrate that compute capacity scales up and down with the job. We will also discuss future work in the area, which could include the use of cloud infrastructure from different cloud framework providers as well as other cloud service providers. ",

            "abstract": "Abundance and spatial distribution of standing dead trees (snags) are key indicators of forest biodiversity and ecosystem health and represent a critical component of habitat for various wildlife species, including the great grey owl and the black-backed woodpecker. In this work we assess the potential of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to discriminate snags from the live trees and map their distribution. The study area encompasses the burn perimeter of the Rim Fire, the third largest wildfire in California’s recorded history (~104.000 ha) and represents a heterogeneous mosaic of mixed conifer forests, hardwood, and meadows. The snags mapping procedure is based on a 3D single tree detection using a Watershed algorithm and the extraction of height and intensity metrics within each segment. Variables selected using Gaussian processes form a feature space for a classifier to distinguish between dead trees and live trees. Finally, snag density and snag diameter classes that are relevant for avian species are mapped. This work shows the use of LiDAR metrics to quantify ecological variables related to the vertical heterogeneity of the forest canopy that are important in the identification of snags, for example, fractional cover. We observed that intensity-related variables are critical to the successful identification of snags and their distribution. Our study highlights the importance of high-density LiDAR for characterizing the forest structural variables that contribute to the assessment of wildlife habitat suitability.",

The measured efficiencies are compared to the calculated values. The free-standing zone plate, a binary zone plate consisting of open spaces and interconnected Au opaque bars, has the advantage that a support membrane is not required, resulting in excellent long-term stability in space against contamination, radiation damage, and other effects that could alter the efficiency and instrument throughput. The interconnections of the zones are designed as a robust open mesh of the same type that supports transmission gratings in current spaceflight instruments.\nThe 4 mm outer diameter of the zone plate and compact size of the optical train make these zone plates attractive for small CubeSats and other space flight missions where resources are extremely limited.",

Due to their lush vegetation, water resources, and cool temperature meadows have long been utilized for human use. Through neglectful practices and extreme weather events meadows across the west have been degraded. Round Meadow, located 4 km southwest of Pinecrest Lake in the Stanislaus National Forest in California suffered a severe flood in the 1960’s which largely contributed to its current degraded state. To restore Round Meadow’s natural ecohydrologic functions a meadow restoration has been planned. In this research, MODFLOW models are linked with R script to simulate the snowmelt, streamflow and groundwater flow at Round Meadow. HyperNiche2 is used to model foliar cover. Two versions of “pond and plug” restoration are simulated without and with a divergent stream channel. It is found that moist meadow cover is increased by 0.61 and 1.32 hectares respectively over degraded conditions. The meadow aquifer was recharged as result of restorations and modeling suggests increased late year base flows.",

Recent catastrophic flooding and documented biological impairment downstream of MTM/VF has drawn sharp criticism of this practice. Despite its extent, scale, and continued use since the 1970’s, the impacts of MTM/VF on hydrology is poorly understood. The goal of this research is to quantify the hydrological impacts of this practice in a headwater and a mesoscale catchment at storm, seasonal, and annual timeframes. Results show a general trend in the conversion of forests to mines, and significant decreases in maximum streamflow and variability, and increases in base flow ratio attributed to valley fills and deep mine drainage. Decreases in variability are shown across spatial and temporal scales having important implications for water quantity and quality.",

            "abstract": "We present methods for normalizing fan aggradation time-series by coupling radiocarbon dating of alluvial fan deposits with analysis of high resolution elevation data, which yield catchment-averaged denudation rates for small, steep catchments within the semi-arid montane Dry Creek Experimental Watershed, located within the Idaho Batholith of the Northern Rockies. Alluvial fan deposits are useful for understanding past landscape response to fire, and relationships among erosional processes and climate variability. However, although radiocarbon dating of alluvial stratigraphy provides a time-series of fan aggradation, which reflect catchment erosion rates, fan deposition is also influenced by catchment size and depositional confinement, which complicates comparisons of aggradation rates among catchments. Modern high resolution elevation data facilitate measurement of fan and catchment geometries, which we use to convert fan aggradation rates into catchment erosion rates. Airborne LiDAR point clouds were iteratively processed to produce optimal 1 and 0.5 m resolution elevation data for delineation of landforms. Alluvial fan 3-D surface areas were reconstructed by fitting conical surfaces through fan surface remnants. Aggradation time-series were converted to volumetric deposition by extrapolating surface-normal sample depths across reconstructed fan surfaces. Normalizing volumetric deposition by the 3-D surface areas of respective source catchments yielded catchment-averaged denudation time-series, with rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.016 mm/yr during the Holocene for a range of catchments of various size, aspect, and vegetation cover. These erosion rates span time periods between 500-8,000 cal. yr. BP, and are intermediary to short-term (10-84 yr) rates of 0.001 to 0.01 mm/yr and long-term (5,000-27,000 yr, and 10 m.y.) rates of 0.02 to 0.15 mm/yr previously established in the region. This suggests the method is viable for measuring erosional time-series for catchments in steep mountainous terrain, where the dominant erosional processes are related to wildfire and produce, and are recorded in, alluvial fan deposits. This work will facilitate ongoing comparisons of fire and erosional time-series among catchments of varying size, relief, elevation, aspect, and vegetation cover.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic (EM) methods are used to characterize the electrical conductivity distribution of the earth. Since EM methods consider time-varying fields, we typically treat EM in either the frequency domain (FD) or the time domain (TD). Recently, due in part to computational advances, EM geophysical surveys are increasingly being simulated and inverted in 3D. However, the availability of computational resources does not invalidate the use of lower dimensional formulations and methods, which can be useful depending on the geological complexity as well as the survey geometry. For example, we can treat the measured EM data either in TD or FD, and a progressive procedure can be used to invert these data, starting with 1D inversions, then moving to multi-dimensional inversions. As such, we require a set of tools that allow a geophysicists to easily move between dimensions and formulations of the EM problem. This is the motivation behind the open source software package SimPEG-EM which is part of a software ecosystem for Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics (SimPEG). In this presentation, we will share examples as well as our experience from creating a range of simulation and inversion tools for EM methods that span dimensions (1D, 2.5D and 3D) and apply analytic, FD and TD formulations in a consistent framework. The flexibility and consistency in our EM package allows us to be methodical so that we have the capacity to tackle a spectrum of problems in EM geophysics.",

            "abstract": "In 1938, heavy rains over the Los Angeles Basin resulted in widespread and costly flooding of the Los Angeles River floodplain. In response to the resultant damage, 51 miles of the River was concreted from the San Fernando Valley to the Pacific Ocean. Today proposals to modify the river to capture more water and to restore it to a more natural state have been approved. Through comparison of rainfall data, we test whether channelization can adequately handle the extreme flooding events occurring since 1938. Between February 27th to March 3rd 1938, two major storms resulted in 14.1 inches of rain in Pasadena, CA leading to the flooding of the Los Angeles River, 115 fatalities, the destruction of 5,601 buildings, and to $627 million (2011 dollars) in damages. Downtown Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation a year, while the San Gabriel Mountains, where most of the Los Angeles River watershed rainfall is collected, typically receive more than 40 inches of rain annually. Eight record storms, each with rainfall totals over 11 inches, since the 1938 flood could have created devastating deluges were it not for channelization. Presently, at full stage the channelized Los Angeles River can accommodate a discharge of 129,000 cfs. During the 1938 flood event the discharge peaked at 68,000 cfs above Arroyo Seco and 79,000 cfs below Firestone Blvd. A similar storm event today would have led to increased discharge due to urbanization. Since 1938, the greatest discharge recorded at the same stations was 52,200 and 74,400 cfs during the February 16th 1980 storm. Although damage was substantial during this storm, river channelization prevented fatalities and much damage. To date, the channelization of the Los Angeles River has been successful in flood control. However, our research shows that southern California precipitation is becoming more intense which may result in increased flooding. Any future modifications to the river must be prepared to handle the extreme flooding events and water managers must also be mindful of these events.",

            "abstract": "For the past 9 months, we have been studying the presence of disease and genetic variation in the Cameroonian species Xenopus longipes, found only in a lake on Mount Oku. During research trips to this lake (Lake Oku) over the past decade, mortalities of this species have been observed, and in addition there may be evidence of declines in other frog species in these mountains. It is well understood that in many parts of the world, amphibians are currently declining due to disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and possibly also by the iridovirus ranavirus. A previous study suggested that ranavirus could be found in Lake Oku, and also that Bd may be present. Using 25 X. longipes liver samples collected during the summer of 2013 and 10 samples collected during the summer of 2011, we screened for Ranavirus through PCR amplification and sequencing, and screened for Bd in our 25 samples from 2013 through quantitative PCR. We also PCR amplified and sequenced 1950bp of the X. longipes 16S gene to look for genetic variation. We did not find ranavirus present on these frogs, and we found low prevalence (4%) of Bd. Through our analysis of 16S data, we found low genetic variation among the X. longipes, with a maximum divergence of 0.37% observed between any two individuals. Time is of the essence and it is crucial that the causes of these die offs be identified. While there have been observed mortalities of X. longipes since 2006, and this species remains on the Critically Endangered List, the cause of these mortalities is still unknown. If and when a cause can be identified, it would be monumental for this species’ population and can hopefully be used to preserve and save these frogs.",

            "abstract": "The concentration of hydroxyl (OH)—the main sink for the greenhouse gases methane and hydrofluorocarbons—in Earth’s northern and southern hemispheres is an important longstanding puzzle in atmospheric chemistry. Observations of methylchloroform imply that there is about 10% more OH-loss in the southern hemisphere. In contrast, global 3-D atmospheric models (CTMs and GCMs) simulate 28 ± 10 % greater OH concentrations and methane loss in the northern hemisphere, according to a recent survey. This apparent shortcoming of many models derives in large part from an inconsistent definition of the hemispheres. For model results, OH concentrations and methane/methylchloroform loss are commonly averaged over the geographic hemispheres, with the geographic equator as the dividing line. For the observations, however, the hemispheres are separated by the atmosphere’s circulatory mixing barrier, which rarely coincides with the geographic equator. Instead the barrier to interhemispheric mixing corresponds to the rising branch of the Hadley circulation and follows the seasonal migration of the sun.\nWe use artificial tracers in a CTM to define the atmospheric (as opposed to geographic) hemispheres. We show that the tracer definition corresponds with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where it is well defined and robust against several different tracer definitions. The atmospheric equator lies at 3°N on average (10°N in boreal summer) and extends as far as 30°N during the South Asian summer monsoon (Figure 1). When methane/methylchloroform loss rates are calculated for the dynamic and time-varying hemispheres, the CTM has just 5% greater loss in the northern hemisphere (Figure 1). Thus, using a definition of atmospheric hemispheres that is consistent with atmospheric circulations reveals that OH distributions in CTMs, while still slightly overestimating northern hemisphere OH, are much closer to observational constraints than has been implied by past work. We also discuss the implications of the unequal-sized hemispheres for other problems in atmospheric chemistry. For example, two-box models are commonly used to infer inter-hemispheric air mass exchange times from observations of SF6 or other long-lived gases, but results will be biased if the hemispheric boxes are assumed to have equal sizes.",

            "abstract": "Frictional heating in the fast deforming ice of an ice stream potentially warms the ice to the melting point and there is evidence that a substantial region of temperate ice may exist near the base of the ice-stream margins. The production of meltwater in such a region alters the heat balance and the usual temperature equation solved in ice-sheet models must be modified to take account of this. In some cases, simply capping the temperature at the melting point and assuming excess heating produces meltwater can give the correct dynamics. But in general this is too simplistic an approach. Meltwater drains under gravity and dynamic pressure gradients, and the resulting transport of heat must be accounted for in order to correctly locate the boundaries between temperate and subtemperate ice. In this study, we look in detail at the dynamics of the temperate ice, focussing on the movement of meltwater in a compacting, viscous matrix of ice and the way in which meltwater transport influences the subtemperate-temperate transition. Four canonical cases can be considered: when the ice flows into or out of the temperate region, and when the meltwater flows towards or away from the interface. We examine the possible formation of boundary layers near these regions, and discuss how these may be responsible for channeling meltwater to the ice bed. We also discuss the use of numerical enthalpy and enthalpy-gradient methods, and the conditions under which these can correctly describe the dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is a critical component of healthy soils. It improves soil structure, increases aeration, water infiltration, water holding capacity, and nutrient cycling. Increasing the SOM pools of soils has been repeatedly identified as a carbon (C) sequestration strategy to mitigating climate change. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to SOM stabilization is limited, particularly in agricultural ecosystems where significant potential for C sequestration exists. Roots and shoots fundamentally differ in their ability to contribute to SOM formation both in litter quality and in the soil depths they impact. Roots are primary contributors to SOM, particularly in the deep soil, due to fine root turnover and exudation and proximity to the soil matrix. In agriculture, roots are often the primary organic matter input to the system after aboveground materials are harvested. Litter quality, such as differences in C to N ratio and % lignin, is a critical factor in the early stages of decomposition, but its relevance to SOM formation has been questioned in recent years. The recently proposed Microbial Efficiency - Matrix Stabilization hypothesis states that more labile substrates are rapidly incorporated into microbial biomass based on the stoichiometric needs of the microbes, and therefore less C is lost from the system as CO2. Thus, more labile compounds are primary contributors to SOM. In order to address these differences in roots versus shoots, we have designed an experiment to answer the following questions: 1) how does initial quality of the root litter versus shoot litter lead to differences in the efficiency with which they are decomposed and incorporated into SOM; and 2) how does root contribution to SOM formation change as rooting depth increases? We combined 13C and 15N stable isotope enrichment of the litter with an innovative in situ decomposition method in order to accurately quantify root and shoot contribution to SOM up to 90cm soil depth. The isotopic enrichment allows us to trace the movement of decomposition products (root-derived C and N) to physical soil organic matter fractions (such as aggregates, light fraction and mineral fractions), informing us on the flow and likely stability of C and N over time. We will present data on the first harvest of a two-year experiment.",

            "abstract": "There is a boundary where pressure and tension axes dramatically change by almost at the right angles around northwestern area of the Kanto plain (north of Tokyo), reported by Suzuki (1989). Since 2013, we have launched Japan Unified High-resolution Relocated Catalog for Earthquakes (JUICE) project. The relocation method using the Double-Difference method (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000) provided the high-resolution earthquake catalog, which enabled to further evaluate active faults (e.g. seismogenic layer thickness, or slip tendency direction etc.) In this presentation, we revisit the previous mystery regarding to the stress-field orientation boundary in northwestern Kanto plain by looking at much more and high-resolution data available than before.\nThe stress axis boundary runs at particularly close (about 5 km north and parallel direction) to the Fukaya fault, which caused the M6.9 Western Saitama earthquake in 1931 occurred at very shallow depth, involving severe damages and many casualties in Kanto region. The high-resolution catalog clearly showed the majority of pressure (P-axis) and tension stress axis (T-axis) lie about 150˚ and 60˚ in the north of the stress axis boundary, while both the axes change into about 45˚ and 150˚ in the south of this boundary, respectively. In fact, both P- and T- axis, by crossing the boundary, suddenly changes about 90˚. The focal mechanism around this area dominated by the strike and thrust and both mechanisms seem to be randomly co-existing. Yet, depth distribution pattern changes abruptly across the boundary. The depth distribution pattern of north part of the boundary seems more confined than the southern part.\nWe discuss the sharp stress discontinuity by two main perspectives. The first focuses on the effect due to local structure, such as possibly the buried Median tectonic line and/or ancient failed rift formed while the Sea of Japan had opened. The second focuses on the tectonic force due to complicated subduction of two oceanic plates, the Philippine Sea plate and Pacific plate, beneath the North American plate in this Kanto region.",

            "abstract": "The Nicoya Peninsula in northern Costa Rica overrides the subduction zone where the Cocos plate subducts northeast beneath the western edge of the Caribbean plate along Middle American Trench. Historically, large subduction zone earthquakes (M > 7) strike this area approximately every 50 years [Protti et al., 1994]. A magnitude Mw 7.6 thrust earthquake occurred in September 2012 with strong aftershocks lasting for several months, following the historic pattern. The released moment was close to the accumulation estimate based on a simple recurrence model and GPS observations during 1996-2010 [Feng et al., 2012]. A continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) network has operated in the Nicoya peninsula of northern Costa Rica since 2002. The network observes surface displacements above the subduction zone between Cocos and Caribbean plate, and has detected strain accumulation and Slow Slip Events (SSEs) along part of the plate boundary. We invert observed surface displacements induced by SSEs during 2002-2012 to estimate slip distribution on the plate interface, and assess their impact on the strain accumulation process. The maximum slips are distributed in areas lacking significant interseismic coupling. Three major slow slip patches are identified, with different slip magnitude and recurrence intervals. Both shallow and deep slip patches are observed, with a depth range of 10-50 km. Geodetic modeling shows that over ten years’ observation period, frequently occurring SSEs in northwestern Nicoya released 20% of accumulated elastic strain. Less frequent, more deeply occurring SSEs in southeastern Nicoya peninsula release all accumulated strain, downdip of the 1990 earthquake, assuming current behavior continues. Central Nicoya experienced a fully locked plate interface between 2007 and 2011, with the location and amount of slip roughly equivalent to that release in the September 2012 thrust earthquake, assuming constant behavior over the last 50 years. We observe an apparent relation between micro seismicity and SSEs, and, the aftershock area of the 1990 earthquake coincides with our deep SSE location.",

By running close to 10 km of GPR lines and two 20mX20m grids with a 200 MHz antenna we were effectively able to sample the subsurface of the area and thus recreate the paleolandscape. Raw radargrams were viewed and processed through the MATLAB and GPR-SLICE programs. Both the raw and processed radargrams showed a distinct boundary as the GPR was moved from gravel hill conditions to sandy valley conditions. This boundary was interpreted to be an interface in the subsurface between sand on top and gravel layers below. A sinuous, meandering depression within that boundary that progressed down valley was interpreted as a paleochannel incised into the local gravels. Within the 20mx20m grids two 1mx1m test pits were dug on the assumed banks of the paleochannel. The pits served both to ground truth the inferred transition from sand to gravel and to help define a precise velocity of radar propagation for the sand layer.

Specifically, we examined seasonal and inter-annual variability in utilization of three major inorganic nutrients (nitrate and nitrite, phosphate, silicate) by spring phytoplankton blooms and potential drivers responsible for shaping those variations, using a 20-year time series (1992-2012) near Palmer Station on the wAP. Seasonal and inter-annual covariability in the 50-m depth integrated nutrients and chlorophyll-a (Chl) was analyzed using principle component analysis. We found no linear trends in any of the nutrients or Chl, but there were strong year-to-year fluctuations in seasonal nutrient drawdown and phytoplankton blooms. On average, Chl peaked around days 290-310, stayed high for ca. 40 days, and gradually decreased to the end of the growing season (March-April). Nitrate and nitrite and phosphate behaved in the opposite way of chl-a indicating biological utilization by phytoplankton, but silicate was not utilized in all years, implying non-diatom blooms. Annual anomalies showed a cyclic pattern in Chl, with a maximum occurring every four to six years on average. These years were found to be associated with the negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in preceding winter. Our results suggest large-scale climate variability as a potential driver of biological utilization of nutrients and phytoplankton blooms.",

            "abstract": "The formation of pallasites, meteorites composed mainly of intermixed FeNi metal and angular to rounded olivine crystals, has been a paradox because these components should have separated into distinct layers at their putative location of origin: the core-mantle boundary (CMB) of an asteroid. Paleomagnetic study of gem-like angular olivine bearing minute magnetic inclusions from the main group Esquel and Imilac pallasite meteorites, however, reveals the past presence of strong magnetic fields requiring a core dynamo. A CMB location is too hot for pallasites to record these magnetizations. Alternatively, the paleomagnetic field strengths, combined with cooling rate data and thermal modeling, suggest an origin for main group pallasites in the shallow mantle of a parent body, with the FeNi metal originating from the liquid core of an impactor (Tarduno et al., Science, 2012). Here, we extend this model to include the origin of main group pallasite meteorites with rounded olivine, and pallasites of the Eagle Station group. Main group pallasites with rounded olivine (e.g., Springwater) could have formed in larger intruded liquid FeNi masses relative to the thinner dikes envisioned for the formation of pallasites with angular olivine crystals. Pallasites of the Eagle Station group have an oxygen isotope composition different from that of the main group and thus require a separate parent body. Olivine from the Eagle Station pallasite also carries a paleomagnetic record; therefore pallasites from this group may have also formed by collision. Interestingly, the magnetization of the Eagle Station pallasite is multi-component and distinctly different from the main group. This signal potentially records a combination of a dynamo signal and a later shock heating event. Mesosiderites may represent a third parent body formed by impactor liquid FeNi metal injected into the crust of an asteroid. These observations suggest liquid metal intrusion from differentiated impactors may have been a common process influencing the formation of planetesimals and protoplanets.",

This is particularly important in the central San Joaquin Valley (SJV), California, USA, where severe droughts have accentuated the need to conserve water and improve on-farm water management. In the current study, we adopt an integrated approach for estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) involving the use of weighing lysimeters and satellite imagery. In the first phase of the study with the crop lysimeter, conducted on a clay loam soil with processing tomatoes grown under sub-surface drip irrigation, observations of crop ground cover were conducted weekly and evapotranspiration (ET) data were collected daily to derive relationships between crop coefficients and fractional cover. Data collected during the first year of the study, indicted that the crop coefficients (Kc) obtained at peak season were relatively higher than those generally reported for tomatoes commonly grown in the central SJV. Overall, there was a good correlation between fractional cover and crop coefficients (r2 = 0.91), with the average peak ET and Kc values ranging from 6 to 7 mm per day and from 0.8 to 0.9, respectively. Data obtained from satellite imagery, representing relatively larger spatial measurements than the lysimeters, are being compared with the surface observations from the lysimeters and will also be discussed in our presentation.",

            "abstract": "To successfully recruit and retain underrepresented minority (URM) students and early career scientists, many programs supplement traditional curricular activities with multiple online platforms, establishing “virtual communities\" that are free and easily accessible. These virtual communities offer readily sustainable opportunities to facilitate communication across a wide range of cultural lines and socioeconomic levels thereby broadening participation and inclusivity in STEM. Established in 2003, the Minorities Striving and Pursuing Higher Degrees of Success (MS PHD’S) in Earth System Science Professional Development Program has successfully used virtual community tools such as a listserv, community forum, social media, and VoIP technologies, to extend the face-to-face activities of the program and support the advancement of URM students and early career scientists in STEM. The use of multiple facets of virtual community by MS PHD’S participants supports and encourages “real life” interactions and mentorship, facilitates networking and professional development, and maintains continuity of shared networks. The program is now in its ninth cohort and supports 213 participants. To date, 54 participants have completed their PhD and another 61 are currently enrolled in doctoral programs.",

Studies with sectional aerosol models suggest limited efficacy due to aerosol growth; and studies with coupled models suggest possible impacts on stratospheric dynamics and chemistry. Modeling simulations to date have specified tropical SO2 injections at 18 km altitude or higher, which is above the flying ceiling of most existing aircraft. We simulate tropical SO2 injections at 13 km altitude (160 mb) and 20 km altitude (50 mb) and mid-latitude injections at 13 km altitude using the 60-level CAM5/CARMA model, which allows for detailed vertical resolution of the stratosphere, sectional aerosol bin representation, and interactions between aerosols, chemistry, radiation, and clouds. We quantify the resulting aerosol evolution, radiative effects, and surface temperature effects, as well as the impacts of SO2 injections on tropospheric clouds.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both a carbon source for the microbial food web (and thus a source of CO2 to the atmosphere) and as a light inhibitor in marine environments. The presence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM; the optically active portion of total DOM) can have significant controlling effects on transmittance of sunlight through the water column and therefore on primary production as well as the heat balance of the upper ocean. However, CDOM is also susceptible to photochemical degradation, which decreases the flux of solar radiation that is absorbed. Knowledge of the current spatial and temporal distribution of CDOM in marine environments is thus critical for understanding how ongoing and future changes in climate may impact these biological, biogeochemical, and physical processes. We describe the quantity and quality of CDOM along five key productive transects across a developing Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) in the Pacific Arctic region. The samples were collected onboard the CCGS Sir Wilfred Laurier in July 2013 and 2014. Monitoring of the variability of CDOM along transects of high productivity can provide important insights into biological and biogeochemical cycling across the region. Our analyses include overall concentrations of CDOM, as well as proxy information such as molecular weight, lability, and source (i.e., autochthonous vs. allochthonous) of organic matter. We utilize these field observations to compare with satellite-derived CDOM concentrations determined from the Aqua MODIS satellite platform, which ultimately provides a spatially and temporally continuous synoptic view of CDOM concentrations throughout the region. Examining the current relationships among CDOM, sea ice variability, biological productivity, and biogeochemical cycling in the Pacific Arctic region will likely provide key insights for how ecosystems throughout the region will respond in future scenarios of climate change.",

            "abstract": "Spatial variation in streamflow generation was studied in a small and steep headwater catchment to clarify the spatio-temporal water yield pattern. Streamflow were gauged at three locations in 170 m long stream, and groundwater elevations and soil moisture were also monitored in the catchment. Results showed that, for base flow, the upstream water yield surpassed the mid- and downstream water yield during the rainy season and kept higher yield during the large recession periods. The timing when the upstream water yield became larger than downstream water yield overlapped with the timing when groundwater upwelling was observed in the area where the stream starts, indicating the groundwater upwelling at the base of zero-order basin increased the relative size of upstream water yield. For the event flow, the relationship between soil moisture and streamflow was used to determine the potential connectivity between hillslope and stream. Among a total of 57 events identified in 2013, hillslope subsurface flow was generated in 13, 19 and 28 events in up-, mid- and downstream hillslope, respectively. The steeper valley structure and weathered bedrock in the downstream portion may be a factor for the more frequent establishment of connectivity. The results of this study demonstrated that the contribution of groundwater at the base of zero-order basin, longitudinal channel gradient and hillslope arrangement produced the spatial variability in streamflow generation in the headwater catchment.",

            "abstract": "Environment Canada is developing an autonomous tropospheric ozone and aerosol lidar system for deployment in support of short-term field studies. Tropospheric ozone and aerosols (PM10 and PM2.5) are important atmospheric constituents in low altitude pollution affecting human health and vegetation. Ozone is photo-chemically active with nitrogen oxides and can have a distinct diurnal variability. Aerosols contribute to the radiative budget, are a tracer for pollution transport, undergo complex mixing, and contribute to visibility and cloud formation. This particular instrument will employ two separate lidar transmitter and receiver assemblies. The tropospheric ozone lidar, based on the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique, uses the fourth harmonics of a Nd:YAG laser directed into a CO2 Raman cell to produce 276 nm, 287nm and 299 nm (first to third Stokes lines) output wavelengths. The aerosol lidar is based on the 3+2 design using a tripled Nd:YAG to output 355 nm, 532 nm and 1064nm wavelengths. Both lidars will be housed in a modified cargo trailer allowing for easy deployment to remote areas. The unit can be operated and monitored 24 hours a day via an internet link and requires an external power source. Simultaneous ozone and aerosol lidar measurements will provide the vertical context necessary to understand the complex mixing and transformation of pollutants - particularly when deployed near other ground-based in-situ sensors. Preliminary results will be shown from a summer field study at the Centre For Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE).",

            "abstract": "Hydro-acoustic energy in the 1-100 Hz range from under-water explosions can easily spread for thousands of miles due to the unique properties of the deep sound channel. This channel, aka SOFAR channel, exists almost everywhere in the earth's oceans where the water has at least 1500m depth. Once the energy is trapped in this channel it spreads out cylindrically, and hence experiences very little loss, as long as there is an unblocked path from source to receiver. Other losses such as absorption due to chemicals in the ocean (mainly boric acid and magnesium sulphate) are also quite minimal at these low frequencies. It is not surprising then that the International Monitoring System (IMS) maintains a global network of hydrophone stations listening on this particular frequency range.\nThe overall objective of our work is to build a probabilistic model to detect and locate under-water explosions using the IMS network. A number of critical pieces for this model, such as travel time predictions, are already well known. We are extending the existing knowledge-base by building the remaining pieces, most crucially the models for transmission losses and detection probabilities. With a complete model for detecting under-water explosions we are able to combine it with our existing model for seismic events, NET-VISA.\nIn the conference we will present threshold monitoring maps for explosions in the earth's oceans. Our premise is that explosive sources release an unknown fraction of their total energy into the SOFAR channel, and this trapped energy determines their detection probability at each of the IMS hydrophone stations. Our threshold monitoring maps compute the minimum amount of energy at each location that must be released into the deep sound channel such that there is a ninety percent probability that at least two of the IMS stations detect the event.\nWe will also present results of our effort to detect and locate hydro-acoustic events. In particular, we will show results from a recent under-water volcanic eruption at the Ahyl Seamount (April-May 2014), and compare our work with the current processing, both automated and human, at the IDC.",

            "abstract": "The University of Denver Nucleation-Mode Aerosol Size Spectrometer (NMASS) was used to measure aerosol size distributions during 12 flights on board the Spec Learjet during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) campaign. The NMASS consists of 5 continuous flow CPCs operating in parallel which allows for the measurement of 5 channel size distributions covering size range of 4 to 60 nm with 1 Hz temporal resolution.\nOn-going new particle formation events, such as gas to particle conversion, can create particles with diameters of one to two nanometers. Through coagulation and condensation, these particles can grow to diameters sufficiently large as to act as cloud condensation nuclei. In-situ measurements of particles with the NMASS provide evidence for recent new particle formation since nanometer sized particles are converted rapidly by coagulation to detectable size ranges (diameters > 4 nm).\nDuring SEAC4RS, strong evidence of new particle formation was seen in the lower, < 1.5 km, and the upper, 8-12 km , troposphere. At mid altitudes (2-7 km), much fewer NPF events were seen correlating strongly with a decrease in total measured particle concentrations. Evidence of NPF was seen in approximately 20% of all of our measurements during SEAC4RS, though over 90% of measurements near the tropopause were indicative of NPF. Forward trajectories of newly formed particles have been determined using NOAA’s Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) along with calculations of aerosol coagulation to determine the impact of these newly formed particles downwind of their sources.",

            "abstract": "Models of deformation in the India-Asia collision vary between those that emphasize continuity of deformation, distributed horizontally throughout the Tibetan plateau and/or vertically through a weak crust, and those that emphasize the importance of lithospheric-scale faults translating relatively rigid blocks. These models make different predictions for what should happen where the conjugate faults bounding the eastward-escaping Tibetan plateau meet. Our new field and remotely sensed data suggest that the right-lateral Karakoram Fault and the conjugate left-lateral Longmu-Gozha Co Fault, an extension of the Altyn Tagh Fault, are linked by a large-offset (> 40 km), east-dipping, listric normal fault system we refer to as the Angmong Fault. This fault system is marked by kilometer-high, faceted topographic scarps, suggesting recent activity. There is also a huge jump in metamorphic grade across this fault, which separates nearly unmetamorphosed strata with open folds in the hanging wall from upper-amphibolite-grade rocks with tight to isoclinal folds and subhorizontal mineral lineation in the footwall, which crop out in a triangular wedge trailing ~40 km NW of the Angmong Fault. Pseudosection modeling of late-syn-deformational porphyroclast rims and matrix phases suggests footwall pressures around 640 ± 100 MPa, for rocks up to at least 15 km behind the Angmong Fault, in contrast to hanging wall pressures < 100 MPa. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb geochronology on an extensive network of narrow, variably deformed leucocratic dikes that pervade the footwall gives intrusion ages as young as 13.7±0.2 Ma, suggesting that footwall rocks remained hot and were not exhumed until after this time. Our mapping suggests that the ENE-trending Longmu-Gozha Co Fault terminates into the N-S trending Angmong Fault, and all the strike-slip displacement of the former is absorbed by normal displacement of the latter. The Angmong detachment only displaces the upper crust of Tibet eastwards, leaving the ductile mid-crust exhumed in its wake. This suggests that the Longmu-Gozha Co Fault also only displaces the upper crust. Because geophysical data and xenolith sampling suggest a hot, weak mid-crustal layer extends beneath most or all of the Tibetan plateau, similar mid-crustal decoupling likely occurs throughout Tibet.",

How development occurs, what resources are in use and who makes these decisions is both interesting and relevant for students.\nWe develop case studies around current, active, local land use issues large enough in scale to have a formal environmental review at the County and/or the State level. Sections of each case study are dedicated to addressing the range of environmental issues that are central to each land use decision. Water, its availability, planned use and treatment on the site, brings in both a review of local hydrology and a discussion of storm water management. Air quality and the impact of the proposed project’s density, transportation plans, and commercial and industrial uses brings in air quality issues like air quality ratings, existing pollution, and local air monitoring. A review of the site plans brings in grading plans for the project area, which highlights issues of drainage, soil stability, and exposure to toxins or pollutants depending on the historic use of the site. Brownfield redevelopments are especially challenging with various monitoring, clean up and usage restrictions that are extremely interesting to the students.\nStudents’ work with mentors from the community who represent various roles in the planning process including a range of geosciences, community business members and other players in the planning process. This interplay of individuals provides a realistic look at the forces that move land use decision-making in a community. Discussion of impacts and mitigations highlight the intersection of policy and science. Debate arises on how much science should guide policy and how much land use policy decisions require science monitoring, pushing new scientific developments.",

This work uses a sophisticated algorithm developed to analyze separately the different populations - core, halo and strahl - of the electron velocity distribution function (eVDF) up to 'super-halo' energies (2 keV). The code determines their respective set of parameters through fits to the measured eVDF, taking properly into account spacecraft charging and other instrumental effects. We use here several years (half a solar cycle, approximately 1.5 million of independent measurements) of core, halo and strahl electron parameters to investigate the properties of these different populations and the physical processe(s) that likely act to control and regulate them.\nWe discuss new results obtained on (1) the electron temperature anisotropies and their variation with collisions and/or solar wind fluctuations and instabilities, (2) the properties of core and halo drifts in the solar wind proton frame, (3) the electron heat flux, and (4) the electron strahl. These new observations emphasize the non-negligible role of Coulomb collisions in shaping the electron distribution function and regulating of the thermal and supra thermal electrons, but that the solar wind electron expansion and compression are limited fundamentally by some instabilities under certain conditions.",

However, the observation of kilometer scale variations at sub-second cadence has not been practically realizable until recently. Quantifying the irregularities at these sizes and scales is necessary for an understanding of the dynamics leading to fine scale phenomena in the high latitude environment.\nWe present measurements of kilometer-scale plasma variations made at the northern auroral zone using an array of specialized Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. These 6 CASES receivers (plus 1 from ASTRA, LLC) are sited at the Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska, and have been collecting data since late 2013. The array monitors for ionospheric scintillations, fluctuations in phase and amplitude of the GPS L-band signals received due to ionospheric variations. The array spans 2 km east-west and about 1 km north-south, with a variety of intermediate baseline lengths down to about 200 m. In addition to measuring amplitude and phase scintillation with the S4 and sigma_phi indices at 100-s cadence, these receivers also record 100 Hz raw power and phase measurements from GPS baseband signal processing. These low-rate data are publicly available for download through a web portal at http://apollo.tbc.iit.edu/~spaceweather/ with high rate available upon request.\nA detailed case study is presented from the December 8, 2013, 0300-0400 UT time period. During this period several interesting scintillation periods were observed. We use array cross-correlation processing methods to first estimate direct ground parameters of the array including a) estimate the 2D drift velocity on the ground; b) estimate a de-correlation (or turbulent) speed; and c) parameters of correlation elliptical coordinates (axial ratio and tilt angle). We then use these results and cross-correlation measurements to derive the ground 2D spatial spectrum of the observed phase and amplitude. From these results we then use inverse modeling to estimate parameters of the spectrum of the ionospheric irregularities, altitude of the irregularities, and thickness of the irregularity region. Finally, we compare our results with observations from PFISR, the all-sky imager and wind imager.",

            "abstract": "Coating and rock alteration formation on Mars is constrained by both the availability of water and rock composition. Detection of these materials depends on the both formation rate and the rate of abrasion that these alteration products and coatings experience. ChemCam on the Curiosity rover can investigate coating/alteration formation and preservation by looking at chemical composition as a function of depth into the rock.\nChemCam LIBS works by firing a laser focused to a 350 - 550 mm diameter spot that produces plasma from the rock. Spectra of elemental emission lines are recorded from 240-850 nm and used to determine the elemental composition of the rock. A chemical composition is generated from each individual spectrum. Each laser firing penetrates deeper into the rock allowing for a composition as a function of depth to be determined. By comparing geochemical trends from the beginning and end of the observations evidence for coatings and alteration can be assessed by geologic setting and rock type.\nPrevious ChemCam work has identified Li variations (Ollila et al 2014) and MnO coatings (Lanza et al 2014) on a few rocks with high abundances of these elements. However this work is the first systematic assessment of alteration and coatings in the entire data set.\nFrom landing until Sol 583 there were 2,610 good quality ChemCam rock and outcrop observations. These measurements were assessed for internal elemental composition variability by the calculation of heterogeneity index. Only 7% (178) had positive internal heterogeneity. However, internal heterogeneity can be due to other factors besides coatings and alteration. Thick soil coverage and differential sampling of materials in coarse-grained rocks also produce positive heterogeneity indexes. The actual number of potential coatings at Gale is significantly lower. For most of Gale, current geochemical alteration rates are slower the rate of abrasion. This result is consistent with limited availability of water in the current epoch. Detailed analysis rocks with of potential alteration signatures and coatings will be undertaken to determine if there are materials that have been protected from abrasion. Limits on the rates of formation of coatings/alteration in the current epoch will be estimated and implications for water availability and habitability discussed.",

            "abstract": "Chemoautrophic microbial mats form in shallow intertidal pools adjacent to sulfidic hydrothermal vents in San Pedro, CA. Sulfide is primarily geologically derived. However, microscopy revealed deltaproteobacteria closely associated with Beggiatoa -like filaments, indicating an additional biogenic sulfide source, derived from sulfate reduction or sulfur disproportionation. At small scales the intercellular interaction of sulfide producing and sulfide consuming bacteria may play a important role in biogeochemical sulfur cycling. We explored the intracellular transfer of biologically derived sulfide in this system with triple and quadruple stable isotope labeling experiments: 13C, 15N, 33S, and 34S. Silicon wafers colonized by microbial mats in situ, were then incubated with 34SO42- or 34SO42- and 33S0 as well as 13C-acetate and 15NH4+and analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled to nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). We observed enrichment of 34S and 33S in both deltaproteobacteria and sulfide oxidizing gammaproteobacteria. Greater enrichment relative to killed controls occurred in deltaproteobacteria than the sulfide oxidizers during both sulfate reducing (Δ34Sdelta-killed = 240‰, Δ34Sgamma-killed = 40‰) and sulfur disproportionating incubations (Δ33Sdelta-killed = 1730‰, Δ33Sgamma-killed = 1050‰). These results provide a direct visualization of interspecies sulfur transfer and indicate that biogenic sulfide derived from either sulfate or intermediate oxidation state sulfur species plays a role in sulfur cycling in this system.",

            "abstract": "The observations of CHAMP satellite showed the existence of longitudinal wave patterns in the neutral mass density at an altitude of 400 km. The wave pattern could be characterized by the zonal wave number 4 (wave 4), and the wave 4 pattern showed a strong dependence on the solar cycle. This phenomenon was explained by the direct penetration of non-migrating atmospheric tides into the F region height. However, the existence of the wave 4 pattern in the thermosphere has not yet been verified from other observations. In this study, we investigate the tidal characteristics (focused on the DE3 tide) in the thermosphere at an altitude range of 200–400 km by analyzing the observations of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) band emission by TIMED/GUVI. The radiance of LBH band is used as a proxy of the column number density of molecular nitrogen. Our preliminary results obtained from the TIMED/GUVI data in 2008 show that the wave 4 pattern does not exist in any months in the altitude range. This result contradicts the results obtained from the CHAMP observations. In addition, recent studies by model simulations showed that the thermospheric structure in low latitudes can be induced by the ion drag along the magnetic field line. We will extend our investigation of the tidal signature in the thermosphere to the period of other solar cycle. The coupling of the thermosphere with atmospheric tides will be discussed by reviewing previous studies and comparing with model simulation results.",

            "abstract": "Over the last century in the circumpolar north, changes in vegetation include shrub cover expansion and shifts in tree line. Invasion of tundra by trees and shrubs may be further facilitated by wildfire disturbance, which creates opportunities for establishment where recruitment is otherwise rare. Even moderate increases in warm-season temperatures are predicted to increase the likelihood of tundra fires. Understanding the consequences of a change in fire regime are complicated by the fact that there are relatively few large recent fires to study. However, the Seward Peninsula is a region that currently experiences more frequent and large fires than other tundra regions in Arctic Alaska. In this tundra region, there are areas of overlapping burns dating back to the 1970s. Using a chronosequence approach, we looked at post-fire biomass accumulation as well as foliar and soil C and N. Our experimental design incorporated sites that showed no evidence of recent burning, sites that burned in 1971, 1997, 2002, and 2011 as well as sites that burned multiple times over the last 30 years. We found that fire had a significant effect on total biomass and shrub basal area in tussock tundra. Our site that burned in 2011 had the lowest total biomass, about half of the biomass of our unburned site. However, our results indicated the site that burned in 1971 had over double the aboveground biomass and more soil N than the unburned site. We found that sites that repeatedly burned since 1971 were very similar in biomass to unburned tundra. This suggests that repeat fires keep a post-fire site at unburned levels of biomass. However, in these repeat fire sites, foliar C/N was ~25% greater and soil C and N was ~50% less than in unburned tundra. These results indicate that repeat fires are potentially causing nitrogen loss that not likely to be replenished into the system. As tundra fires become more frequent prediction of post-fire ecosystem effects is critical due to impacts on wildlife habitat, permafrost degradation, carbon release, and range expansion of species from the neighboring boreal forest.",

            "abstract": "Water footprints have been proposed as potential sustainability indicators, but these analyses have thus far focused at the country-level or regional scale. However, for many countries, especially the United States, the most relevant level of water decision-making is the city. For water footprinting to inform urban sustainability, the boundaries for analysis must match the relevant boundaries for decision-making and economic development.\nInitial studies into city-level water footprints have provided insight into how large cities across the globe—Delhi, Lagos, Berlin, Beijing, York—create virtual water trade linkages with distant hinterlands. This study hypothesizes that for large cities the most direct and manageable virtual water flows exist at the metropolitan area scale and thus should provide the most policy-relevant information.\nThis study represents an initial attempt at quantifying intra-metropolitan area virtual water flows. A modified commodity-by-industry input-output model was used to determine virtual water flows destined to, occurring within, and emanating from the Phoenix metropolitan area (PMA). Virtual water flows to and from the PMA were calculated for each PMA city using water consumption data as well as economic and industry statistics. Intra-PMA virtual water trade was determined using county-level traffic flow data, water consumption data, and economic and industry statistics. The findings show that there are archetypal cities within metropolitan areas and that each type of city has a distinct water footprint profile that is related to the value added economic processes occuring within their boundaries. These findings can be used to inform local water managers about the resilience of outsourced water supplies.",

            "abstract": "The late Pliocene, ~3 million years ago (Ma), is the most recent period in geologic history with elevated atmospheric CO2 and global surface temperature estimates analogous to those projected for the end of the 21st century making it a focus of paleoclimate research. Proxy reconstructions suggest average global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were ~2-3°C above present during the late Pliocene warm period (~3.3-2.9 Ma). In the North Atlantic, regional SST anomalies reached as much as +6°C and even larger temperature anomalies occurred on land in the northern hemisphere. An episode of global cooling and sea level fall following the warm late Pliocene is attributed to a major expansion of northern hemisphere ice sheets at ~2.73 Ma and referred to as the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation (NHG). We reconstruct the thermal and geochemical history of North Pacific deep water (ODP Site 1208) from 3.3-2.5 Ma at orbital scale resolution using benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca and stable isotopic ratios (δ18O, δ13C) in order to evaluate changes in continental ice volume and deep ocean circulation as the climate deteriorated and NHG intensified. We find that the oceanic cooling trend which followed late Pliocene warmth did not occur in the deep Pacific Ocean and an average ~21±10 m sea level equivalent ice growth occurred from 3.15-2.75 Ma prior to the intensification of NHG. Furthermore, both the benthic d18Oc and BWTs in the Pacific are offset from the North Atlantic prior to 2.75 Ma. By ~2.73 Ma (interglacial-glacial cycle G7-G6), the Atlantic-Pacific BWT and d18O gradients were reduced to <1°C and <0.1‰, respectively. We interpret these abrupt hydrographic changes as the initiation of stronger heat and salt transfer from the North Atlantic to the Pacific due to a fundamental change in deep ocean circulation driven by late Pliocene ice growth on Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "This study examines dynamical impacts of lower-tropospheric southerly wind surges originating in midlatitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) on the development of mixed Rossby gravity (MRG) waves over the central Pacific during June-August 1979-2012, through the statistical analysis of the JRA-55 products and NOAA outgoing long wave radiation data. The central Pacific MRG waves are identified by an extended EOF (EEOF) analysis on 2-8-day filtered daily 850-hPa meridional wind anomalies during June-August 1979-2012. Composite analysis based on the leading EEOF time coefficients is able to capture the development of the MRG waves associated with a southerly surge originating in the SH extratropics. As a weak clockwise gyre as a part of an off-equatorial easterly wavetrain moves eastward and southeastward from the off-equatorial eastern Pacific into the equatorial central Pacific, the southerly surge penetrates into the equatorial tropics at around 150W. Then, the clockwise gyre develops into a MRG-type gyre over the central Pacific. A transition from an easterly wave-type gyre into a MRG-type gyre occurs associated with the southerly surge. The southerly surge forms a cross-equatorial flow on the western flank of the MRG-type gyre. The gyre is amplified when the southerly surge reaches the equatorial tropics. At the same time, convection coupled with the MRG-type gyre is enhanced. The southerly surges are originated in the midlatitude South Pacific, and they are induced by synoptic-scale baroclinic disturbances propagating along the SH midlatitude westerly jet. An eddy vorticity budget analysis indicates that the southerly surge plays an important role in spinning up the MRG-type gyre through transient advection of absolute vorticiy. A case study of a MRG-wave event in mid-July 2006 also illustrates development of a MRG wave associated with the southerly surge and an easterly wave-to-MRG wave transition.",

            "abstract": "Experts have used a variety of techniques for calibration of hydrologic models including optimization-based and Bayesian methods. The simulated outcome of calibrated hydrologic models should be consistent with both the measured response data and the catchment’s hydrological behaviour. The literature indicates that, due to the computational issues associated with many-criterion optimization-based calibration, calibration experiments start by the optimization against performance metrics, e.g., the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency measure, and are followed by the evaluation of the results with respect to hydrological signatures, e.g., the flow duration curve indices, to verify the hydrological consistency of the obtained parameter sets. The proposed research develops a full multi-criterion calibration framework that is capable of utilizing many goodness-of-fit and hydrological signature-based measures to locate the hydrologically consistent parameter sets. This calibration approach applies optimization concepts to facilitate the parameters search, and moreover, implements experts’ priorities in terms of the level of acceptability for each calibration measure. The preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed many-criterion calibration approach yields a higher proportion of hydrologically consistent parameter sets in comparison to the traditional approaches in the literature. The proposed approach can be extended to other calibration studies where the modeller has specific targets for individual calibration criteria.",

            "abstract": "Restoring agricultural areas to wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta of California can help reverse subsidence and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Predicting outcomes and developing best practices of wetland management therefore requires a robust understanding of the sensitivity of GHG exchange in these ecosystems to factors such as management and meteorology. However, wetlands can exhibit complex, overlapping, and asynchronous couplings between site characteristics, environmental drivers and GHG exchange. In this research we demonstrate the use of wavelets and information theory (process networks) as sophisticated tools to disentangle and characterize ecosystem couplings to CO2 and CH4 exchange (measured by eddy covariance) in two restored Delta wetlands. Using wavelets we isolated processes acting at different time scales, then used process networks to determine the direction, strength, and lag properties of ecosystem couplings. We found that despite differences in age, architecture and management, CO2 exchange at both wetlands was most sensitive to similar meteorological factors such as radiation and temperature up to a time scale of several days. At the monthly timescale, however, the effect of a more variable water table management in one wetland became dominant, revealing a reduction in net CO2 uptake during long term water table drawdowns. The analysis of CH4 exchange in this wetland revealed a more sensitive and complex coupling with water table. CH4 exchange was sensitive to relatively small, multi-day shifts in water table and displayed a lagged response to larger, longer shifts. With these methods we were able to disentangle the effects of management from meteorology and better understand the sensitivities of GHG exchange. Our results provide important insights for modeling efforts and management practices.",

If quantity of the　methane　plume is quantified, I may estimate the quantity of existing methane underground and can estimate the scale of methane melting into it in seawater. The　methane　plume solved in seawater is one element of the carbon cycle. It is important that I elucidate this element in thinking about the carbon cycle of the wide sense.　However, there is not the report that I showed quantitatively how much methane melts into it in seawater a year from the methane plume. Therefore, in this article, I identified an aspect of gush methane as it by the sound data with the fishfinder and by a gush picture of the methane plume. With that in mind, I quantified the quantity of the methane plume. As a result, the following things became clear. The methane hydrate grain to gush out from a gush mouth is a solid at the bottom of the sea direct top. In this sea area, methane of 7.7*104m3 per unit area gushes out. In addition, the sea area where 6.3*106m3 gushed out existed.",

            "abstract": "Rivers, especially those in mountainous settings, are known to respond to tectonic and climatic drivers through both gradual and abrupt changes in slope, hydraulic geometry, and planform. Modification of drainage network topology by stream capture, in which drainage area, and therefore water and sediment, is diverted suddenly from one catchment into another, represents the rapid end of the fluvial response spectrum. Such sudden drainage rearrangement affects the river’s potential for incision and sediment transport, and thus has implications for the development of topography and for depositional histories in sedimentary basins. Despite recognition of the importance of this process in landscape evolution, the factors controlling the occurrence of stream capture are not well understood. Here we investigate the process of stream capture using strike-slip faults as a natural experiment. Lateral fault motion drives stream capture when offset is enough to juxtapose adjacent fault-perpendicular streams. In the simplest scenario, the capture events should occur regularly in space and time whenever two streams are juxtaposed, the frequency of capture depending only on drainage spacing and fault slip rate. However, in real-world settings such as the San Andreas Fault Zone of California and the Marlborough Fault System of New Zealand, such regularity is not always observed. We use the Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development Model (CHILD) to investigate the mechanisms and frequency of stream capture in a strike-slip setting. Models are designed to address the connection between the size (i.e. drainage area) of juxtaposed rivers and the likelihood that capture will occur between them. We also explore the role of sediment load in the capture process by modeling both detachment-limited and transport-limited systems. Comparison of these model results to case-study field sites will help us to interpret the landscape signature of strike-slip faulting, and to understand the prevalence of sudden topological changes in drainage network evolution.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying Greenland's future contribution to sea level rise is a challenging task and requires accurate estimates of ice flow sensitivity to climate change. Transient ice flow models are promising tools for estimating future ice sheet behavior. However, confidence in these types of future projections is low, especially because evaluation of model historical runs is so challenging due to the scarcity of continental-wide data for validation. For more than a decade, NASA's GRACE has continuously acquired time-variable measurements of the Earth's gravity field and has provided unprecedented surveillance of mass balance of the ice sheets, offering an opportunity for ice sheet model evaluation. Here, we take advantage of a new high-resolution (~300 km) monthly mascon solution for the purpose of mass balance comparison with an independent, historical ice flow model simulation using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). The comparison highlights which regions of the ice sheet differ most from GRACE. Investigation of regional differences in trends and seasonal amplitudes between simulations forced with three different Regional Climate Model (RCM)-based estimates of surface mass balance (SMB) allows us to make conclusions about the relative contributions of various error sources in the model hindcast. This study constitutes the first regional comparison of GRACE data and an ice sheet model. Conclusions will aid in the improvement of RCM SMB estimates as well as ice sheet simulation estimates of present and future rates of sea level rise.

SPRUCE (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Climate and Environmental change) is an interdisciplinary study of the effects of elevated temperature and CO2 enrichment on NPEs. Peat cores (0-3.0 m) were collected from 16 large plots located on the S1 peatland (an ombrotrophic bog treed with Picea mariana and Larix laricina) in August, 2012 for baseline characterization before the experiment begins. Peat samples were analyzed at depth increments for total Hg, bulk density, humification indices, and elemental composition. Net Hg accumulation rates over the last 10,000 years were derived from Hg concentrations and peat accumulation rates based on peat depth chronology established using 14C and 13C dating of peat cores. Historic Hg deposition rates are being modeled from pre-industrial deposition rates in S1 scaled by regional lake sediment records. Effects of peatland processes and factors (hydrology, decomposition, redox chemistry, vegetative changes, microtopography) on the biogeochemistry of Hg, S, and other elements are being assessed by comparing observed elemental depth profiles with accumulation profiles predicted solely from atmospheric deposition. We are using principal component analyses and cluster analyses to elucidate relationships between humification indices, peat physical properties, and inorganic and organic geochemistry data to interpret the main processes controlling net Hg accumulation and elemental concentrations in surface and subsurface peat layers. These findings are critical to predicting how climate change will affect future accumulation of Hg as well as existing Hg stores in NPE, and for providing reference baselines for SPRUCE future investigations.",

Furthermore, because lakes within this watershed have very different hydraulic residence times, extending from days (e.g., Upper Angora Lake) to centuries (Lake Tahoe), the Tahoe Basin represents an ideal experimental system in which to characterize long-lived DOM. We used a variety of analytical tools, including elemental, stable isotope and radiocarbon measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, comprehensive 2D gas chromatography coupled to time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry and fluorescence measurements, to characterize solid phase extracted (SPE) DOM, and in some cases, whole DOM. Our data show that DOM with typical terrestrial characteristics is quickly removed in lakes with >annual water residence time, leaving behind SPE DOM that is extremely N-rich, with a functional group distribution that is consistent with protein. Furthermore, our radiocarbon measurements estimate a 100-200 year residence time for the N-rich DOM accumulating in Lake Tahoe. All of the analytical techniques distinguish samples based on lake water residence time, which indicates that the lacustrine reactor plays an important role in determining the composition of DOM that accumulates on long timescales. We also examined temporal variations in the microbial community of Lake Tahoe to identify taxa that may be involved in processing DOM from distinct sources. Our results confirm the importance of DOM as a currency for carbon and nitrogen exchange between different compartments of the terrestrial ecosystem and argue for its inclusion in models that examine the response of lake ecosystems to global change.",

            "abstract": "The aims of hydrological model identification and calibration are to find the best possible set of process parametrization and parameter values that transform inputs (e.g. precipitation and temperature) to outputs (e.g. streamflow). These models enable us to make predictions of streamflow. Several sources of uncertainties have the potential to hamper the possibility of a robust model calibration and identification. In order to grasp the interaction between model parameters, inputs and streamflow, it is important to account for both systematic and random errors in inputs (e.g. precipitation and temperatures) and streamflows. By random errors we mean errors that are independent from time step to time step whereas by systematic errors we mean errors that persists for a longer period. Both random and systematic errors are important in the observation and interpolation of precipitation and temperature inputs. Important random errors comes from the measurements themselves and from the network of gauges. Important systematic errors originate from the under-catch in precipitation gauges and from unknown spatial trends that are approximated in the interpolation. For streamflow observations, the water level recordings might give random errors whereas the rating curve contributes mainly with a systematic error.\nIn this study we want to answer the question “What is the effect of random and systematic errors in inputs and observed streamflow on estimated model parameters and streamflow predictions?\".\nTo answer we test systematically the effect of including uncertainties in inputs and streamflow during model calibration and simulation in distributed HBV model operating on daily time steps for the Osali catchment in Norway. The case study is based on observations from, uncertainty carefullt quantified, and increased uncertainties and systmatical errors are done realistically by for example removing a precipitation gauge from the network.We find that the systematical errors in precipitation input and streamflow observations has large impact, both for prediction and for water balance parameters while the dynamic parameters are less effected.",

Water quality remains a predominant issue, and the health of freshwater systems has been linked to the cycling and transformation of carbon. A speciation dominated by carbonates and bicarbonates is conducive to higher alkalinity waters, which is part of an environmental signature in which cholera and other bacteria thrive. Numerous human activities such as deforestation, biomass burning, and agricultural practices have radically changed the abundances of carbon on land and rivers in Haiti. In Haitian small mountainous rivers, carbon speciation is also influenced by the weathering of limestone and other carbonate rocks. Additionally, rain events and natural disturbances such as earthquakes have shown to drastically increase the amount of carbon in rivers and coastal waters.\nSince 2010, a network of both satellite and autonomous hydrometeorological stations has been deployed to monitor the climate in southwestern Haiti. Additionally, various hydrological parameters from river, reservoir, and coastal sites have been measured during field visits. Research will be continued into the wet season, providing temporal analysis needed for quantifying the abundances and transformations of carbon. Together, data from weather stations and field sites can be contextualized with local land use patterns and other human activities to offer unique insights on the carbon system. Findings may offer new perspectives on the relationships between hydrologic cycles, human health, and environmental sustainability in Haiti.",

            "abstract": "This paper reports the outcome of a NSF project in developing a large-scale web crawler PolarHub to discover automatically the distributed polar dataset in the format of OGC web services (OWS) in the cyberspace. PolarHub is a machine robot; its goal is to visit as many webpages as possible to find those containing information about polar OWS, extract this information and store it into the backend data repository. This is a very challenging task given huge data volume of webpages on the Web. Three unique features was introduced in PolarHub to make it distinctive from earlier crawler solutions: (1) a multi-task, multi-user, multi-thread support to the crawling tasks; (2) an extensive use of thread pool and Data Access Object (DAO) design patterns to separate persistent data storage and business logic to achieve high extendibility of the crawler tool; (3) a pattern-matching based customizable crawling algorithm to support discovery of multi-type geospatial web services; and (4) a universal and portable client-server communication mechanism combining a server-push and client pull strategies for enhanced asynchronous processing. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the impact of crawling parameters to the overall system performance. The geographical distribution pattern of all PolarHub identified services is also demonstrated. We expect this work to make a major contribution to the field of geospatial information retrieval and geospatial interoperability, to bridge the gap between data provider and data consumer, and to accelerate polar science by enhancing the accessibility and reusability of adequate polar data.",

One of the main objectives of GoAmazon is to study the aerosol lifecycle under pristine condition and the impact from Manaus urban plume. During GoAmazon, comprehensive characterization of aerosol and trace gases are carried out both at surface sites continuously, and onboard the DOE Gulfstream-1 (G-1) research aircraft from February 15th to March 25th (wet season), and from September 5th to October 15th, 2014. Here we present diurnal variation of aerosol properties, including aerosol size distribution and CCN spectrum under pristine conditions observed at the T3 site, 70 km downwind of the Manaus city. Also shown are vertical distributions of aerosol observed onboard the G-1. The sources and sinks of aerosol particles under pristine conditions are discussed. Measurements show strongly enhanced nucleation and Aiken mode particle concentrations in the Manaus plume. As the plume travels downwind, particle growth and higher CCN activation fraction are observed. The particle growth inside the plume is likely due to condensation of secondary species and coagulation. The vertical distribution of aerosol measured onboard the G-1 suggests cumulus clouds enhance the upward transport of aerosol and pollutants from the surface. The impact of the Manaus urban plume on aerosol size distribution and CCN spectrum are examined, and the results from wet and dry seasons are compared.",

            "abstract": "Active margins are dominated by erosion, structural deformation, tectonic dissection, and igneous intrusions. These destructive processes lead to an incomplete record of past magmatism in active margins. Volcanic airfall tuffs that are transported and deposited in distal sedimentary basins may be more likely to be preserved in the rock record. Tuffs, however, may be affected by atmospheric fractionation during transport, postdepositional weathering, and diagenesis during burial, potentially altering ash texture, mineralogy, and geochemistry. We use outcrop observations, stratigraphic relationships, whole rock geochemistry, U-Pb zircon geochronology, and zircon rare-earth element geochemistry from Permian-Triassic strata of South Africa and South America to correlate distal volcanic ashes to proximal volcanic deposits and plutonic suites within southern Gondwana. U-Pb zircon signals of the tuffs are treated as \"detrital\"; the distinct zircon signals were then used to correlate distal airfall ashes to potential magmatic sources. This suggests that airfall fractionation of zircon populations is not a significant concern in tuff geochronology. Additionally, zircon inheritance may be a useful tool in matching far-traveled ashes with parental magmatic suites. Although previous studies have shown that the geochemistry of volcanic tuff deposits varies with distance from the volcanic vent, we employ whole rock and zircon REE compositions to differentiate distinct magmatic periods using distal ashes that were deposited >750 km from the volcanic source.  The results of this study support a geochronologic interpretation that the Karoo strata of S. Africa are >10 Ma younger than previously thought based on biostratigraphy. Since the Karoo basin is heavily studied as a record of the end-Permian extinction and paleoclimate change, our results have major implication for this key time in Earth History.",

Such changes could have substantial ecological, economic, and sociological consequences. However, climate models in general do not correctly reproduce the frequency distribution of precipitation, especially at the regional scale. In this study, a validated analogue method is employed to diagnose the potential future shifts in the probability of extreme precipitation over the United States under global warming. The method is based on the use of the resolved large-scale meteorological conditions (i.e. flow features, moisture supply) to detect the occurrence of extreme precipitation. The CMIP5 multi-model projections have been compiled for two radiative forcing scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5). We further analyze the accompanying circulation features and their changes that may be responsible for shifts in extreme precipitation in response to changed climate. The application of such analogue method to detect other types of hazard events, i.e. landslides is also explored. The results from this study may guide hazardous weather watches and help society develop adaptive strategies for preventing catastrophic losses.",

            "abstract": "The occurrence of large, stand replacing wildfires is more frequent in the western United States now than ever before. The loss of canopy cover due to wildfire drastically modifies landscapes and alters ecosystems as high intensity burns replace canopies with charred branches and trunks, change soil composition and erosion processes, and affect hydrologic flow paths and water chemistry. Precipitation that is not intercepted by the forest canopy makes its way to the forest floor as throughfall or stemflow. Tracking variations in the amount and chemistry of precipitation that interacts with burned versus unburned forest stands, as well as open precipitation, will help to quantify changes in hydrologic routing and catchment water chemistry caused by wildfire. This study investigates the effects of fire on the volume and chemical composition of precipitation diverted to the forest floor as stemflow and throughfall by observing the impact of the June 2013 Thompson Ridge wildfire in the Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory field site in the Valles Caldera National Preserve of New Mexico.\nThroughfall and stemflow collectors were installed beneath both burned and unburned canopies and open areas in two catchments impacted by the Thompson Ridge fire. Initial results of field parameters, including electrical conductivity, pH and volume of precipitation collected from both burned and unburned sites, show variations across collector type (stemflow, throughfall and open precipitation), site location as the two catchments differ in aspect and gradient, and burn severity. Throughfall, stemflow and open precipitation samples were analyzed for trace metals, major cations, anions, nutrients and organic matter to determine how fire affects the chemical composition of the precipitation that interacts with burned canopies. This study is one of the first to quantify the relationship between wildfire and the chemistry and flux of stemflow and throughfall in conjunction with a full suite of pre and post fire precipitation, soil and surface water chemistry.",

Combining hydrometric and hydrochemical observations can shed light on potential differences in runoff processes under changing land covers. We compare event-based dual member hydrograph separations across humid tropical lowland forest (142 ha), mixed land use (176 ha) and pasture (36 ha) catchments following two years of monitoring during the seasonal dry to wet season transition. Stable water isotope and electrical conductivity tracer event water fraction estimations agree well during small runoff events, but exhibit different results during a large runoff event with a greater runoff coefficient. Geochemical tracers exhibit event water fraction maximums during hydrograph recessions and a seasonal transition in runoff behavior among all land uses.

Multiyear (MY) sea ice thinning and retreat of the oldest and thickest ice, will accelerate further ice loss. MY sea ice also represents the greatest impediment to navigation in the Arctic and greatest hazard to marine infrastructure. Recirculation of sea ice within the Beaufort Gyre is critical to the replenishment of MY ice lost from the Arctic through either melt or export. Here we analyze thickness changes of sea ice as it drifts in different regions of the Gyre.\nUsing a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach we identify satellite-tracked buoys that made repeat overpasses within 30 km of four moored ice profiling sonars (IPSs), which comprise part of the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Program (BGEP). Using the IPS data, we derive ice draft distributions corresponding to each of these overpasses, which allows tracking of changes in the ice thickness in vicinity of each buoy. Changes in modal values of ice thickness during winter agree with simple models of thermodynamic growth.In the case of one buoy that made a total of four overpasses (see figure below), a dramatic shift in a secondary modal thickness during the summer of 2007 agrees well the magnitude of melt recorded by a nearby ice mass balance buoy (IMB).\nTo extend the number of repeat passes, we generate pseudo-Langrangian ice drift tracks using daily gridded fields of satellite-derived ice velocity. This allows us to deploy “numerical buoys” every day anywhere in the Arctic. Using this approach we identify numerous cases where sea ice observed over one mooring persistently drifts over another. Such inter-mooring ice advection events allow us to examine how sea ice thickness distribution in the Beaufort Gyre is influenced by dynamic and thermodynamic processes processes.",

Knowledge of the spatial and temporal variation of PSD can be used to evaluate the interaction between suspended sediment and biological and chemical components in coastal ocean. In this study the PSD were measured at more than 100 sites in the Yellow River Plume (YRP) before and after water and sediment diversion using a laser diffractometer (LISST-100X Type-B) in concert with multiple biogeochemical parameters collected during summer 2014. The measured PSD is fitted with Junge distribution to obtain the power-law slope and the differential number concentration for reference diameter. Results show that the total suspended particles ranged between 10 and 654 μL L-1, median particle diameter (d0.5) ranged between 21 and 281μm, power-law fitted PSD slopes ranged from 3.2 to 4.4, reflecting the dominance of inorganic particles associated with the sediment discharged from the Yellow River. The spatial distribution of PSD also clearly displayed a dominant effect of riverine inputs. The depth-distribution of PSD slopes indicated that the deposition-resuspension process might be an important factor of the sediment dynamics. Our study provides valuable information on the distribution and transport of sediment discharged from the Yellow River in surrounding coastal water.",

We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate’s influence is substantial: for each one standard deviation (1sd) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2sd to 4sd by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.",

Telepresence increases the potential pace and scope of ocean exploration by enabling experts to join an expedition from anywhere, providing unlimited access to intellectual capital, while simultaneously expanding the reach of ocean science expeditions to public audiences worldwide. “America’s Ship for Ocean Exploration”, NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, is the first and only federal vessel purpose-outfitted for conducting telepresence-enabled ocean exploration. As a platform for testing new technologies and methodologies, her primary operating paradigm focuses on using telepresence to enable the majority of expedition scientists to participate and guide explorations from shore in real-time. Between 2010-2014, NOAA and partners implemented different models to conduct telepresence-enabled ocean exploration on NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, all with the majority of the participating expedition scientists located on shore. These expeditions tested different scientist participation models, communication technologies, operating procedures, internet video streams, data distribution methods, and internet-based collaboration tools, and provided varying levels of real-time access to ongoing expeditions. Each expedition provided new insights into what makes remote science participation “work”, and identified challenges that remain to be overcome.

            "abstract": "We used measurements of differential S to P seismic attenuation in the rupture zone of the 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule, Chile earthquake (33°S-38°S) to characterize the seismic attenuation structure of the South American crust and upper mantle wedge. We used data obtained from the IRIS CHAMP rapid-response temporary seismic network, filtered between 0.7-20 Hz. For events with large signal to noise ratios, we visually identified the P and S arrivals on the seismograms and used an evolving time window to determine 400 individual Qs and t* values and their uncertainties using a spectral ratio method. Using a phase pair method allows us to neglect the source-time function and instrument response of each P-S phase pair. Assuming a constant Qp/Qs ratio for a given P-S phase pair, we evaluated the 400 spectral ratios and discarded portions of the evolving time window that incorporate multipathed phases. We recalculated the Qs and standard deviation of the retained window and excluded measurements with standard deviations larger than half of the Qs value. We also excluded measurements that span frequency windows longer than 10 Hz as they contain noise that contaminates Qs measurements. We examined ~200 local events yielding a total of 1,076 path-integrated Q­s measurements. Qs values are low (100-400) for the majority of ray paths evaluated, however we observe a spatial distribution of low path-integrated Qs values (100-300) in the northeastern portion of the rupture zone and higher values (300-600) in the southwest. We divided the rupture zone into cubes and implemented a bounded linear inequality least squares inversion (0<Qs<1200) to solve for Qs in individual model regions. We used a constant starting model of Qs=450 and solved for perturbations to the model using our observed δt* values and a radial-earth velocity model (IASPI91). Our ray coverage provides good resolution extending to depths of ~75 km in the mantle wedge.",

            "abstract": "It is clear that aerosols contribute to the observed differences in cloud droplet size distributions between maritime and continental and between non-polluted and polluted convection. In addition, other factors such as cloud base temperature, boundary layer depth, thermodynamic profile (updraft speeds) that vary between land and ocean regions, could also be contributing to the observed differences or acting in concert with aerosol effects. In addition, the initial cloud droplet spectra at cloud base to a large extent determines the microphysical processes of precipitation formation (water and ice) at higher levels in the clouds and thus the vertical transport of aerosols and gases in deep convective clouds. During the 2013 NASA SEAC4RS field campaign we have collected a large amount of microphysical data in both shallow and deep convective clouds. This data will be compared to data from other field campaigns to detect specific characteristics of the cloud base droplet size distribution and relate it to onset and evolution of the coalescence process in clouds. The presentation will provide a survey of the cloud droplet size distributions at cloud base in both shallow and deep convective clouds and will relate them to environmental parameters to better understand aerosol-cloud interactions and the other parameters that play a role in the onset of coalescence in convective clouds. We will relate the airborne aerosol variations (size and concentration in different environments) to the cloud droplet size distribution. Model simulations using a detailed coalescence model will be used to obtain a better understanding of the onset of the coalescence process.",

            "abstract": "In field environments, bottom roughness transformation have been observed in response to extreme storm events, flooding, and tsunamis. Bottom roughness transformation is considered to be instances when an observed stable bed state (e.g. ripples) rapidly transforms into an alternate stable state (e.g. flat bed). This type of extreme change is observed when forcing mechanisms due to shear stress and pressure gradients reach significant magnitude and duration. This research utilizes a full scale wave laboratory environment (O.H. Hinsdale Large Wave Flume at Oregon State University) over a sandy substrate to closely investigate bottom boundary layer dynamics coupled with observations of extreme morphologic change from a rippled to a flat bed. The observational array includes two millimeter scale resolution profiling ADVs (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter), a PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) used to estimate velocity fields as well as morphologic evolution, porewater pressure sensors, and multiple single point ADVs and wave gages. An emphasis is made towards investigating the effects of solitary waves (i.e. tsunamis) upon events of extreme morphologic change, both isolated as well as introduced into bimodal wave groups. Additionally, observations demonstrate that instances of roughness flattening and then rebuilding occurring within sets of irregular waves (i.e. storm events). During instances of rapid bed flattening boundary layer streaming is observed in coincidence with estimates of excess applied bed stress and exceedance of critical Shields parameter for sediment motion. Additionally, during extreme flattening, measured pressure gradients indicate conditions for pressure gradient induced sediment transport, supported by the porewater pressure sensor data and the estimated Sleath parameter.",

            "abstract": "Eutrophication and nutrient pollution of surface waters occur within complex governance, social, hydrologic and biophysical basin contexts. The pervasive and perennial nutrient pollution in Lake Champlain Basin, despite decades of efforts, exemplifies problems found across the world’s surface waters. Stakeholders with diverse values, interests, and forms of explicit and tacit knowledge determine water quality impacts through land use, agricultural and water resource decisions. Uncertainty, ambiguity and dynamic feedback further complicate the ability to promote the continual provision of water quality and ecosystem services. Adaptive management of water resources and land use requires mechanisms to allow for learning and integration of new information over time. The transdisciplinary Research on Adaptation to Climate Change (RACC) team is working to build regional adaptive capacity in Lake Champlain Basin while studying and integrating governance, land use, hydrological, and biophysical systems to evaluate implications for adaptive management. The RACC team has engaged stakeholders through mediated modeling workshops, online forums, surveys, focus groups and interviews. In March 2014, CSS2CC.org, an interactive online forum to source and identify adaptive interventions from a group of stakeholders across sectors was launched. The forum, based on the Delphi Method, brings forward the collective wisdom of stakeholders and experts to identify potential interventions and governance designs in response to scientific uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding the effectiveness of any strategy, climate change impacts, and the social and natural systems governing water quality and eutrophication. A Mediated Modeling Workshop followed the forum in May 2014, where participants refined and identified plausible interventions under different governance, policy and resource scenarios. Results from the online forum and workshop can identify emerging consensus across scales and sectors and be simulated in adaptation scenarios within integrated models. Comparing interventions and scenarios to existing and planned policy and governance systems in Lake Champlain Basin allows for new feedback to build adaptive capacity to identify key leverage points in the coupled natural and human system.",

            "abstract": "The Whipple mission will conduct a blind occultation survey to detect small solar system bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune extending to thousands of AU. Flux from a distant star occulted by an intervening body varies over time periods of tenths to a few seconds, depending on the distance to the object and its size. Other parameters that characterize the observed light curve include the impact parameter, angular size and magnitude of the monitored star, sampling rate, and relative velocity of the observer and the occulting body. Using an idealized light curve generator based on these parameters, and a model for the Whipple instrument and spacecraft (including the telescope PSF, photon shot noise, readout noise, detector non-uniformity; spacecraft jitter and stray light), we generate random instances of an observation. A chi-squared test that matches pre-computed templates to the simulated observation is used to determine best fit size and distance estimates, keeping the known star angular size, magnitude, cadence and relative velocity parameters fixed.\nFor objects characteristic of the Kuiper Belt (35-50 AU distant), the size of small objects (1–3 km in radius) is determined to better than ~15%, while distances are determined ~30%. Both size and distance estimates are slightly biased, with sizes slightly smaller and distances generally larger than the ideal values. For objects characteristic of the outer Oort Cloud (> 3,000 AU), the size of 10-20 km objects is determined to better than ~25% and the distances are determined to better than about 50%, with biases similar to what we find for KBOs.\nThese preliminary results demonstrate that the Whipple mission can observe and characterize the population of small bodies with sufficient accuracy to permit classification as belonging to the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud (inner and outer), and with a sufficient number of detections, comparison to model predictions for the numbers of objects and their size distributions.",

            "abstract": "Pore-scale investigation of multiphase fluid behavior in porous media is useful for obtaining quantitative information about relationships between micro-pore structures and multiphase flow and their impact on fluid distribution under different conditions. Recent advances in imaging techniques such as X-ray computed microtomography (microCT) allows us to examine three-dimensional (3D) micro-pore structures and multiphase distribution. However, many previous experiments with microCT imaging have been largely limited to static conditions. In this work, we focus on stress-dependent granular compaction under flowing conditions and its impact on displacement mechanisms and multiphase distribution under multiple drainage and imbibition cycles. A stack of 3D images were obtained with microCT to examine pore structures and fluid distribution under each cycle. Advanced imaging processing techniques were employed to improve the quality of multiphase segmentations. Key characteristics of pore structures and fluid distribution include porosity, permeability, specific surface area, interfacial area, Euler characteristic, and phase saturation. Additional lattice-Boltzmann simulations are used to investigate how inter-granular compaction mechanisms may affect fluid displacement and residual trapping at the pore-scale. This will improve our understanding of the dynamic interaction of slow compaction and fluid flow relevant to subsurface applications such as geologic CO2 storage and enhanced oil recovery.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall-runoff response is an important index for expressing the water storage and drainage characteristics in the catchment. To clarify the mechanisms of runoff generation we investigated runoff ratio (=direct flow volume/event rainfall volume) and hydrometric and isotopic features (δ18O) of stream water, soil water and groundwater at concave and planar hillslope in each storm event in a small forested catchment (area 5.9 ha), western Japan, and analyzed the relationships between runoff ratio and flow pass and the critical rainfall amount (Rc, mm) controlling runoff magnitude. Results from 30 storm events showed 2 types of hydrograph shapes, i.e., quick peak type with small runoff ratio (<0.03) and delayed peak type with large runoff ratio (>0.10). The peak time of hydrograph coincided with that of groundwater level at concave hillslope rather than soil moisture content or groundwater level at planar hillslope. In addition, analysis of groundwater peak provided the threshold value (-1.06 m below land surface) between the quick peak and delayed peak response. The critical rainfall amount depended on the initial groundwater level (GL, m) and was expressed as a linear equation, Rc = -357GL-379. These results imply that the hillslope topography can be a significant factor for both groundwater dynamics and rainfall-runoff response, especially the groundwater level at concave hillslope as a determinant of runoff ratio, and that its initial level at concave hillslope has a great potential to predict a rainfall amount needed for occurrence of runoff with a large magnitude.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms of field line breaking and magnetic energy dissipation that result in magnetic reconnection have yet to be determined by spacecraft observations. Many parameters have been proposed to locate the reconnection site, but they either fail to identify uniquely the reconnection site or have not been tested for asymmetric reconnection. We demonstrate that the change in magnetopause structure caused by reconnection can be used to locate and estimate proximity to the site of reconnection. Cluster observations of quiet magnetopause crossings, for which no evidence of reconnection is found, show no obvious spatial dependence of the DC electric field, while the plasma density and velocity make the transition from magnetosheath to magnetosphere values simultaneously with the tangential magnetic field (BL) reversal. Conversely, in-situ observations of several active crossings, for which signs of reconnection are evident, show that the density transition and BL reversal can occur simultaneously or be offset from one another by over 100 ion skin depths (λi) (assuming a constant magnetopause velocity), the outflow jet can occur anywhere from the BL reversal to several λi earthward of the density gradient, and the DC electric field changes sign on either side of the density gradient. Laboratory experiments and 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations of asymmetric reconnection reveal that the relative transition offsets are due to exhaust crossings at different proximities to the X-line. Only within the thin electron current layer surrounding the X-line do the transitions remain concurrent. We present one reconnection event during which the transitions in plasma density, DC electric field, and BL are simultaneous in two of the four Cluster spacecraft and offset in the other two spacecraft. The multiple satellite encounter allows us to examine spatial features in the region surrounding the X-line.",

            "abstract": " The anthropogenic construction activities frequently occur in the cutting side of mountainous area and result in localized landslide associating with multiple environmental factors. Although Differential Interferometric SAR (DInSAR) analysis is attractive tool to foresee the susceptibility of landslide, it is difficult to attain sufficient enough accuracy in DInSAR measurement due to many error factors such as the vegetation canopy which causes the decorrelation of InSAR phase, the highly steep slope and distribution of water vapor inducing the propagation delay.\nIn this study, we tackled such problems employing the solutions as follows; i) DInSAR analysis with L band ALOS PLASAR producing higher correlation in weakly vegetated area, ii) the water vapor observation from weather Research Forecasting (WRF) with 1 km spatial resolution, iii) the usage of high resolution LIDAR DEM or additional algorithm to compensate the correlated error between baselines and DEM offsets.\nThe target areas of this study were chosen in the eastern part of Korean peninsula centered in Uljin and Gangneung respectively. In there, the landslide originated by the geomorphic factors such as high sloped topography and localized torrential down pour is critical issue. The landslide susceptibilities in Uljin are crossly compared between the results using L band DInSAR analysis and GIS interpretation of landslide triggering factors such as vegetation, slope and geological properties. Gangneung was targeted by multi pass X band SAR images. Thus, sub meter resolution pixel tracing and DInSAR analysis were combined to decompose precise displacement vectors which are more useful to be compared with the ground based deformation measurement. After then the local landslide hazard map together with the GIS interpretation of landslide triggering factors was extracted.\nThe study will be further extended for the application of future SAR sensors by incorporating the dynamic analysis of topography to implement practical landslide forecasting scheme.",

            "abstract": "The north component of gravity and gravity gradient changes from the high degree (up to degree 96) data products of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) are used to study the coseismic gravity change for five earthquakes over the last decade including the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and 2005 Nias earthquakes, the 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake, the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes, and the 2007 Bengkulu earthquake. We demonstrate the advantage of these components to reduce north-south stripes and preserve higher spatial resolution signal in GRACE Level 2 (L2) data, revealing gravity change up to –33 μGal for the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and 2005 Nias earthquakes, which is by far the highest coseismic signal achievable by innovative GRACE data processing, and revealing the detectability of earthquakes as small as Mw 8.6 (e.g., the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes). The localized spectral analysis is applied as an efficient method to determine the practical spherical harmonic truncation degree leading to acceptable signal-to-noise ratio, and to evaluate the noise level for each component of gravity and gravity gradient change of the seismic deformations. For each of the earthquakes, the centroid moment tensor parameters, in particular the centroid location, depth, and slip rake angle are estimated via forward modeling inversions using the improved GRACE gravity and gravity gradient data.",

            "abstract": "The success of Terra-based observations using the ASTER instrument of active volcanic processes early in the mission gave rise to a funded NASA program designed to both increase the number of ASTER observations following an eruption and validate the satellite data. The urgent request protocol (URP) system for ASTER grew out of this initial study and has now operated in conjunction with and the support of the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the University of Hawaii, the USGS Land Processes DAAC, and the ASTER science team. The University of Pittsburgh oversees this rapid response/sensor-web system, which until 2011 had focused solely on the active volcanoes in the North Pacific region. Since that time, it has been expanded to operate globally with AVHRR and MODIS and now ASTER VNIR/TIR data are being acquired at numerous erupting volcanoes around the world. This program relies on the increased temporal resolution of AVHRR/MODIS midwave infrared data to trigger the next available ASTER observation, which results in ASTER data as frequently as every 2-5 days. For many targets, the URP has increased the observational frequency over active eruptions by as much 50%. The data have been used for operational response to new eruptions, longer-term scientific studies such as capturing detailed changes in lava domes/flows, pyroclastic flows and lahars. These data have also been used to infer the emplacement of new lava lobes, detect endogenous dome growth, and interpret hazardous dome collapse events. The emitted TIR radiance from lava surfaces has also been used effectively to model composition, texture and degassing. Now, this long-term archive of volcanic image data is being mined to provide statistics on the expectations of future high-repeat TIR data such as that proposed for the NASA HyspIRI mission. In summary, this operational/scientific program utilizing the unique properties of ASTER and the Terra mission has shown the potential for providing innovative and integrated synoptic measurements of geothermal activity, volcanic eruptions and their subsequent hazards globally.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in 3D diffusion codes for the high energy electron radiation belt have shown that the model representation of microphysical processes in terms of diffusion coefficients, capturing radial, energy and pitch-angle diffusion (including mixed diffusion terms) is quite capable of capturing the dynamics and physics of the radiation belt system, while remaining computationally tractable; making these codes an ideal candidate for operational application. However, we hold that the major obstacle to a realistic application of such codes for now- or forecasting is our insufficient knowledge of drivers and inputs to these codes - rather than any additional improved physics in the codes. These include the specification of the initial conditions, knowledge of the background plasma distribution, the global distribution of waves, the low-energy boundary condition and the outer boundary condition.\n In this talk we will discuss realistic and affordable strategies of specifying these inputs through the use of proxies, ground based measurement techniques and data assimilative methods; present examples of where this is already possible (outer boundary and global chorus wave and plasma density specification), and outline where additional effort is needed.\n Finally we present an example of using such realistic model drivers in a state-of-the-art 3D diffusion code which demonstrates a remarkable ability of such codes to reproduce the observed dynamics - by simply using the existing physics in the code but providing the \"correct\" drivers and boundary conditions.",

            "abstract": "When the Earth surface heaves during major earthquakes, it acts like the membrane of a drum, sending air pressure waves upward. With increasing height and decreasing air density these waves increase in amplitude, leading to ionospheric perturbations known as Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs). However, prior to many major earthquakes, without any up and down movement of the Earth surface, similar ionospheric perturbations are often recorded above the future epicenters hours to days before the seismic events. The origin of these pre-seismic AGWs is unknown.\nIn this study, we examine possible formation mechanisms of pre-seismic AGWs based on the findings that, when rocks are stressed, highly mobile electronic charge carriers are activated. Those charge carriers are positive holes, ie. defect electrons in the oxygen anion sublattice. They are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume and able to traverse kilometers of overlying rocks. At the Earth surface they cause microscopic but steep electric fields, capable of field-ionizing air molecules.\nThis process leads to the injection of massive amounts of predominantly, often exclusively, positive airborne ions at the ground-to-air interface, often over a wide area around the future epicenter. The air ionization is not a steady process but tends to occur in bursts, lasting from seconds in laboratory experiments to minutes to tens of minutes in the field. The introduction of positive ions at the Earth surface is bound to cause a variety of effects, including electric phenomena and – importantly – air pressure pulses, which will propagate upward. We describe early theoretical work on the injection of positive airborne ions, on their upward movement through the atmospheric column, and on how this process may cause pre-seismic AGWs in the ionosphere.",

This area is the least economically developed and have the smallest population compared to the other two areas. Over 80% of water usage in Baodi is for agriculture and only less than 15% is from groundwater. The rapid subsidence at TJBH and TJWQ were caused by huge groundwater withdrawals associate with rapid urban and industrial developments in Binhai and Wuqing.

            "abstract": "Within a given valley setting, interactions between river hydraulics, sediment, topography, and vegetation determine attributes of channel morphology, including planform, width and depth, slope, and bed and bank properties. These feedbacks also govern river behavior, including migration and avulsion. Bank cohesion, from the addition of fine sediment and/or vegetation has been recognized in flume experiments as a necessary component to create and maintain a meandering channel planform. Greater bank cohesion slows bank erosion, limiting the rate at which a river can adjust laterally and preventing so-called “runaway widening” to a braided state. Feedbacks of bank cohesion on channel hydraulics and sediment transport may thus produce distinct topographic signatures, or patterns in channel width, depth, and point bar transverse slope. We expect that in bends of greater outer bank cohesion the channel will be narrower, deeper, and bars will have greater transverse slopes. Only recently have we recognized that biotic processes may imprint distinct topographic signatures on the landscape. This study explores topographic signatures of three US rivers: the lower Minnesota River, near Mankato, MN, the Le Sueur River, south central MN, and the Fall River, Rocky Mountain National Park, CO. Each of these rivers has variability in outer bank cohesion, quantified based on geotechnical and vegetation properties, and in-channel topography, which was derived from rtkGPS and acoustic bathymetry surveys. We present methods for incorporating biophysical feedbacks into geomorphic transport laws so that models can better simulate the spatial patterns and variability of topographic signatures.",

            "abstract": "Although the deep ocean remains a challenging place to study, recent progress in technologies such as advanced in situ chemical sensors is beginning to broaden the scope of ocean exploration by enabling more comprehensive measurements at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. Such sensors are designed to be compatible with remotely and human operated vehicles and thus shed light on the geochemical composition of, and processes occurring in, seafloor environments. Among these sensors is a recently-developed in situ laser-based analyzer which utilizes Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (ICOS). This instrument is capable of measuring stable carbon isotope ratios of methane (δ13CCH4), making it a powerful tool for assessing biogeochemical activity in the deep sea. With the aim of improving the sensitivity of this membrane inlet-based chemical sensor, a Membrane Inlet Dissolved Gas Extractor (MIDGE) was developed. Recent work on the MIDGE focused on improving design elements with the aim of enhancing gas transport through the membrane and reducing water vapour in the gas stream. This was accomplished by implementing a newly-designed membrane flow-through inlet geometry, testing a variety of membrane materials, and incorporating an acidification module to evolve dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to gaseous CO2. We will report on results from a September 2014 research cruise, in which the MIDGE ICOS is to be deployed as part of an interdisciplinary mission conducting the first-ever in situ chemical and stable isotopic exploration of two seafloor sites in the Caribbean: the Barbados Mud Volcanoes and Kick ‘em Jenny (KEJ). The goals of this project are to 1) use in situ measurements of methane and DIC carbon isotopes to enable biogeochemical exploration and mapping of methane seeps, and 2) measure the composition of bubble streams emanating from the crater of KEJ.",

            "abstract": "Changing seasonal sea ice conditions and seawater temperatures strongly influence biological processes and marine ecosystems at high latitudes. In the Pacific Arctic, persistent regions termed “hotspots”, are localized areas with high benthic macroinfaunal biomass that have been documented over four decades (see Figure). These regions are now being more formally tracked to relate physical forcing and ecosystem response as an Arctic Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) supported by the US National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan and international partners. These hotspots are important foraging areas for upper trophic level benthic feeders, such as marine mammals and seabirds. South of St. Lawrence Island (SLI) in the northern Bering Sea, benthic feeding spectacled eiders, bearded seals and walruses are important winter consumers of infauna, such as bivalves and polychaetes. Gray whales have historically been a major summer consumer of benthic amphipods in the Chirikov Basin to the north of SLI, although summertime sightings of gray whales declined in the Chirikov from the 1980s up until at least 2002. The SE Chukchi Sea hotspot, as are the other hotspots, is maintained by export of high chlorophyll a that is produced locally as well as advected by water masses transiting northward through the system. Both walrus and gray whales are known to forage in this hotspot seasonally on high biomass levels of benthic prey. Notably the center of the highest benthic biomass regions has shifted northward in three of the DBO hotspots in recent years. This has coincided with changing sediment grain size, an indicator of current speed, and is also likely a response to changes in primary production in the region. Studies of these broad biological responses to changing physical drivers have been facilitated through development of the DBO cooperative effort by both US and international scientists. The DBO includes a series of coordinated, multi-trophic level observations that integrate physical, biogeochemical and biological measurements along transect lines that intersect all of the benthic hotspots. We will highlight results at three of the DBO time-series sites from the northern Bering Sea to the SE Chukchi Sea in relation to retrospective and ongoing process-oriented studies in the region.",

            "abstract": "Step-pools are important features in fluvial systems. Through energy dissipation, step-pools provide stability in high-energy environments that otherwise may erode and degrade. Although research has focused on geomorphological aspects of step-pool channels, the ecological significance of step-pool streams is increasingly recognized. Step-pool streams often contain higher density and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates and are critical habitats for organisms such as salmonids and tailed frogs. Step-pools are therefore increasingly used to restore eroding channels and improve ecological conditions. This paper addresses a restoration reach of Wildcat Creek in Berkeley, California that featured an installation of step-pools in 2012. The design framework recognized step-pool formation as a self-organizing process that produces a rhythmic morphology. After placing step particles at locations where step-pools are expected to form according to hydraulic theory, the self-organizing approach allowed fluvial processes to refine the rocks into adjusted sequences over time. In addition, a 30-meter \"experimental\" reach was created to explore the co-evolution of geomorphological and ecological characteristics. After constructing a plane bed channel, boulders and cobbles piled at the upstream end allowed natural flows to mobilize and sort them into step-pool sequences. Ground surveys and LiDAR recorded the development of step-pool sequences over several seasons. Concurrent sampling of benthic macroinvertebrates documented the formation of biological communities in conjunction with habitat. Biological sampling in an upstream reference reach provided a comparison with the restored reach over time. Results to date show an emergent step-pool channel with steps that segment the plane bed into initial step and pool habitats. Biological communities are beginning to form, showing more distinction among habitat types during some seasons, although they do not yet approach reference values at this stage of development. Research over longer timeframes is needed to reveal how biological and physical characteristics may co-organize toward an equilibrium landscape. Such integrated understanding will assist development of innovative restoration designs.",

            "abstract": "A strikingly super and long-lasting Arctic storm occurred in August 2012, along with which a record low sea ice extent was observed. In this study, the physical processes and mechanisms responsible for its long persistence and strong intensity were investigated by using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. The storm was generated over northeastern Siberian coast on August 2, 2012, and then moved into Arctic Ocean. It intensified to reach its minimum sea level pressure of 959hPa on August 6. Afterwards, the storm lingered over the Arctic Ocean for 7 days. Its intensity and duration is greater than 99% of all Arctic storms. Our WRF simulation results suggest that both troposphere baroclinic instability and Tropopause Potential Vorticity (TPV) anomaly contribute to the drastic intensification and long persistence of the storm. If only baroclinic instability is present, the storm can intensify to some degree of its observed strength but has very short lifetime. Without the troposphere baroclinic instability, TPV anomaly alone can help to maintain the storm persistence but the intensity is much weaker.",

            "abstract": "Each year the Arctic atmosphere experiences a dramatic transition to spring (Arctic spring onset or ASO) that is characterized by a rapid increase in surface air temperature (T2m). The annual timing of ASO, defined in terms of the acceleration of T2m, exhibits strong interannual variability with a bi-modal distribution of onset dates. The horizontal and vertical structure of the atmospheric changes occurring during ASO is investigated through a composite analysis. The associated warming signature is roughly zonally symmetric over Arctic latitudes and extends from the surface upward to the mid-troposphere. Further to the south, ASO is associated with zonally asymmetric warming patterns over the high-latitude continental regions with a common warming signature observed over Northern Siberia (denoted the “critical” warming region). In addition, sub-categories of ASO events exhibit regional warming signatures over Greenland-North American, East Asia, and/or Alaska, respectively. Composite analyses of sea level pressure indicate that the evolution of the surface circulation provides favorable synoptic conditions for producing the observed regional temperature increases. The related advective, diabatic, and adiabatic contributions to the regional warming signatures are assessed via a heat budget analysis.",

At the 95% confidence interval, we found that the stress-based forecast failed to outperform the ETAS forecast during the first eight weeks following the 10/16/1999 Hector Mine earthquake, in both earthquake number and spatial distribution. The rate-and-state forecast was most effective in forecasting far-field events (earthquakes occurring at least 50km away from modeled active faults). Near active faults, where most aftershocks occurred, stress singularities arising from modeled fault section boundaries obscured the Coulomb stress field. In addition to yielding physically unrealistic stress quantities, the stress singularities arising from the slip model often failed to indicate potential fault asperity locations inferred from aftershock distributions. Here, we test the effects of these stress singularities on the rate-and-state forecast’s effectiveness, as well as mitigate stress uncertainties near active faults. We decrease the area significantly impacted by stress singularities by increasing the number of fault patches and introducing tapered slip at fault section boundaries, representing displacement as a high-resolution step function. Using recent seismicity distributions to relocate fault asperities, we also invert seismicity for a fault displacement model with higher resolution than the original slip distribution, where areas of positive static Coulomb stress change coincide with earthquake locations.",

            "abstract": "High spatial density geochemical data sets from the N-EPR and S-JdFR are used to re-evaluate the across-axis geochemical variations in major and trace elements at mid-ocean ridges (MORs). At two axial melt lens (AML) segments, north and south, at the 9-10°N EPR, N-MORB MgO varies across-axis from the most primitive above the AML to more evolved away from the axis. This trend is distinct at the northern (magmatically more robust) segment with an axial MgO range of 8-9 wt% and off-axis (>2km) range of 6.5-8 wt%. This decrease is also reflected in E-MORB MgO variation. There is more variability at the southern segment but, off-axis progression to more evolved MgO is still evident. Interestingly, the Cleft segment, JdFR, displays similar geochemical behavior to the EPR with an axial MgO range of 7-8.5 wt% and off-axis (>2km) range of 6-7.5 wt%.\nEPR geochemical studies over the past 30 years have described models of upper crustal accumulation ranging from eruptions limited to the axis, to temporal variation in the composition of magma in the AML, to multiple eruption sites across the ridge crest and flanks (<5km). Eruptions limited to the axis, with topographically controlled flow off-axis, cannot reproduce the observed off-axis change to more evolved N-MORB. Time-dependence could explain one instance of evolved lavas off-axis but, similar geochemical behavior is observed at two separate AML segments. Multiple instances of consistent compositional variability at multiple AML segments, and at different ridges, point to a common process of crustal accretion at MORs.\nIn light of recent geophysical discoveries of Off-axis AMLs (OAMLs) at the EPR and JdFR, we propose that the trend of more evolved lavas for the majority of N-MORB lavas with distance from the axis is controlled by thermal distribution in the underlying crystal mush zone (CMZ). Higher magma flux beneath the axis facilitates higher temperatures and high porosity melt pathways, reducing crustal residence times, and erupting more primitive lava compositions. OAMLs at the edges of the CMZ, where it is cooler, feed more evolved off-axis eruptions. Lower magma flux at the edges increases crustal residence time and the extent to which magmas crystallize. OAMLs outside of the CMZ host magmas that may escaped any central mixing and erupt a greater range of compositions.",

            "abstract": "The NASA\nTHEMIS\nand\nARTEMIS\nsatellite missions study “space weather,” which describes the solar wind influence on Earth's protective magnetic shield, the magnetosphere. Space weather is important to study and predict because it can damage critical GPS and communications satellites, harm space travelers, and even disable our global electrical grid. The Planeterrella is an innovative heliophysics outreach demonstration, expanding public awareness of space weather by visualizing the sun-Earth connection up close and in-person. Using a glass vacuum chamber, two magnetized spheres and a 1kV power supply, the device can simulate plasma configurations of the solar corona, solar wind, Van Allen radiation belts, and auroral ovals, all of which are observable only by satellites. This \"aurora in a bottle” is a modernized version of the original Terrella built by Kristian Birkeland in the 1890s to show that the aurora are electrical in nature. Adapted from plans by\nLilensten et al.\nat CNRS-IPAG, the UCLA Planeterrella was completed in Nov. 2013, the second device of its kind in the U.S., and the centerpiece of the THEMIS/ARTEMIS mobile public outreach exhibit. In combination with captivating posters, 3D magnetic field models, dazzling aurora videos and magnetosphere animations, the Planeterrella has already introduced over 1200 people to the electrical link between our sun and the planets. Most visitors had seen solar flare images in the news, however the Planeterrella experience enhanced their appreciation of the dynamic solar wind and its effects on Earth's invisible magnetic field. Most importantly, visitors young and old realized that magnets are not just cool toys or only for powering hybrid car motors and MRIs, they are a fundamental aspect of ongoing life on Earth and are key to the formation and evolution of planets, moons, and stars, extending far beyond our galaxy to other planetary systems throughout the universe. Novel visualizations such as the Planeterrella can significantly increase awareness of space weather and act as a catalyst for the pursuit of STEM careers by allowing students to form a personalized, emotional connection to the incredible phenomena surrounding our planet. This can translate into greater support for the heliophysics satellite infrastrucure that safeguards our modern society.",

Alternatively, it could slow the adoption of renewables and, done poorly, release toxic chemicals into water and air. Based on research to date, some primary threats to water resources come from surface spills, wastewater disposal, and drinking-water contamination through poor well integrity. For air resources, an increase in volatile organic compounds and air toxics locally is a potential health threat, but the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation will reduce sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, and particulate pollution regionally. Critical needs for future research include data for 1) estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of unconventional hydrocarbons; 2) the potential for further reductions of water requirements and chemical toxicity; 3) whether unconventional resource development alters the frequency of well-integrity failures; 4) potential contamination of surface and ground waters from drilling and spills; and 5) the consequences of greenhouse gases and air pollution on ecosystems and human health.",

            "abstract": "In the southeastern North Qaidam terrane, near Dulan, felsic host gneisses enclose minor eclogite lenses. A small (~3°C/km) increase in temperatures to the west based on Zr-in-Rt thermometry is supported by a textural trend of zoned garnet with prograde mineral inclusions in the west to unzoned garnet with only peak-stage inclusions in the east. A western eclogite sample contains minor Ep and trace Phe in addition to Grt-Omp-Qtz-Rt; a strong foliation is defined by banding of Grt and Omp. Garnet Ca falls significantly from core (Alm44Prp23Grs32) to rim (Alm48Prp27Grs23). Phengite contains 3.34-3.36 Si pfu. Conventional Grt-Omp-Phe thermobarometry yields 23-27 kbar, 660-730°C, and Zr-in-Rt thermometry yields 671 ± 9°C (n = 37). An isochemical phase diagram (pseudosection) for the system NCKFMASHO calculated with PerpleX indicates that garnet Xgrs decreases with increasing P and T, suggesting that observed garnet zoning reflects prograde growth. Garnet rim compositional isopleths intersect at 23-27 kbar, 580-620°C, depending on choice of effective bulk composition and assumed Fe3+/Fetotal. Garnet rims help define the foliation, suggesting that these P-T conditions apply to this deformation. An eastern eclogite sample contains minor Ep and abundant, coarse-grained Phe in addition to Grt-Omp-Qtz-Rt; foliation is weak. Garnet zoning is weak; compositions are Alm41-43Prp26-28Grs29-32. Phengite cores contain 3.48-3.56 Si pfu. Conventional Grt-Omp-Phe thermobarometry yields 32-36 kbar, 700-750°C, and Zr-in-Rt thermometry yields 691 ± 12°C (n = 34). Conventional thermobarometry and pseudosections yield similar peak P-T conditions, but from different mineral compositions: thermobarometry yields peak P from high-Ca Grt, but the pseudosection yields peak P from intermediate-Ca Grt; maximum Ca in Grt is predicted at lower P and T. Pseudosection-based peak Ts are significantly lower than those from Zr-in-Rt and conventional thermometry. Wide isopleth spacing in the observed assemblage field makes isopleth positions very sensitive to the bulk composition; Zr-in-Rt results are therefore regarded as the best estimate of peak conditions, but isopleth patterns provide valuable constraints on possible P-T paths.",

            "abstract": "We present results on the zonal current variations along the equator in the upper layers of eastern Indian Ocean in relation to variations in the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Our study utilizes data from the Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) and model outputs from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts - Ocean Reanalysis System 4 (ECMWF-ORAS4) for 1960-2011. Surface currents are characterized by strong semi-annual eastward flowing Wyrtki jets in boreal spring and fall, forced by westerly monsoon transition winds along the equator. The fall jet intensifies during negative IOD (NIOD) events when westerlies are stronger than normal but significantly weakens during positive IOD (PIOD) events when westerlies are weaker than normal. Associated with weakened PIOD zonal wind stresses, sea surface height becomes unusually low in the eastern basin and high in the west, setting up an anomalous pressure force that drives increased eastward transport in the thermocline. In contrast, during NIOD events when equatorial westerlies and the normal zonal surface height gradient intensify, the eastward zonal current in the thermocline significantly weakens. A surface layer mass budget calculation for the eastern pole of the IOD indicates upwelling at a rate of ~2.9±0.7 Sv during normal periods, increasing by 40-50% during PIOD events and reducing to zero during NIOD events. IOD-related variations in Wyrtki jet and thermocline transports are major influences on these upwelling rates, which are consistent with observed sea surface temperature changes.",

Since Sol 310, MARDI has acquired images under twilight illumination to optimize image quality for quantitative sedimentology analysis. This imaging, carried out after each rover drive, permits systematic measurement of clast size distribution, inter-clast spacing distribution, and surface areal coverage. Sedimentological parameters derived from these observations include clast sorting (mean/var of size) and other characteristics related to transport mechanisms or in-place weathering. Measured surface parameters (e.g., clast sorting) can be correlated with surface units qualitatively defined (e.g., smooth, rocky, outcrop) in images obtained by HiRISE, MSL Mastcam and MSL Navcam. In addition, a preliminary longitudinal analysis has been conducted to examine possible source regions for the bulk of the gravels by correlating sedimentary parameters with distance from either Peace Valles or Mt. Sharp, with evidence of trends associated with inter-clast spacing.\nSets of stereo MARDI images that allow the creation of high vertical precision (±2 mm) digital elevation models (DEMs) have also been acquired via two techniques. First, MARDI images taken at each step of comprehensive wheel imaging activities yield 5 MARDI images with ~50% overlap. Second, two MARDI sidewalk video imaging mode (SVIM) experiments yielded a continuous set of images during a rover drive with 75-82% overlap. DEMs created via either technique can be used to quantify terrain properties and measure clast cross-sectional shapes. The microtopographic properties of the Sol 651 surface (e.g., mean/sigma of local elevation and slopes) and its sub-cm texture as measured in the SVIM-derived DEM are consistent with the characterization of the terrain as smooth with few rocks >20 cm. Characterization of the Sol 691 surface as rockier than the Sol 651 surface is supported by a DEM with larger local slopes at cm scales (mean ~40°), slope variances over 20° and cm-scale height variance in excess of 2 cm. Ultimately, the analysis of clast sizes, spatial patterns, areal cover, and 3D shapes is expected to result in the identification of sub-populations, potentially tied to depositional events in the region and their sources.",

            "abstract": "The Walvis Ridge-Tristan/Gough seamount province in the South Atlantic represents 130 Myr of continuous intra-plate volcanism that can be connected to the once conjunct Parana-Etendeka flood basalt province. With this it represents one of the few primary hotspots consistent with the thermal plume model. However, around 60 Ma, the morphological expression of the Walvis Ridge changed drastically from a robust 200 km wide aseismic ridge into a 400 km wide region of diffuse and diminished volcanism. As a result, this part of the plume trail has been described by two subtracks, one ending at Tristan da Cunha and another at Gough Island more than 400 km to the SSE. Where the Walvis Ridge forks into these two tracks there is a center prong. There is also the 39.5°S lineament of seamounts between, but oblique to, the two subtracks, which is parallel to the local fracture zone directions. All these features are at odds with the classical definition of a narrow hotspot track although Rohde et al. (2013) showed that the Tristan and Gough subtracks retain a distinct geochemical signature over 70 Myr and are consistent with a zoned, deep-seated plume.\nThe first Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic and trace element analyses from the detailed dredge sampling cruise MV1203 show that samples from two prominent seamounts at the western end of the 39.5°S lineament have a Gough-type signature, which makes an upper mantle source for this lineament unlikely but rather indicates that the Gough-type source stretches some 200 km NNW from Gough. Tristan track seamount samples are comparable with published data, however, one new sample has a Gough-type composition suggesting leakage of this component into the Tristan-type plume zone. Seamounts on the middle prong of the Walvis Ridge fork have compositions intermediate to Gough and Tristan domains, suggesting mixing between sources or melts of the two domains.\nThus, the Gough-component in the last 60 Myr of plume activity is volumetrically much more significant than previously apparent in only a small number of seamounts with this signature. A spread over much of the width of the seamount province is indicated including some leakage into the Tristan track.",

            "abstract": "The complexity involved in accurate observation and numerical simulation of regional evapotranspiration (ET) can lead to a large range of uncertainty between techniques, usually attributed to methodological deficiencies. In this study, we hypothesize instead that such discrepancies in ET estimates are sometimes warranted, and in extreme cases can be applied to measure the effect of anthropogenic influences on ET fluxes in a developed river basin. We compare an ensemble of monthly ET estimates from land surface models (as a representation of “natural” ET fluxes) with monthly satellite-based estimates (as a representation of “realistic” ET fluxes) in the intensely managed Colorado River Basin (CRB) to contrast human impacts and natural variability. Two remote sensing estimates of ET are evaluated: a water balance approach applying GRACE data and a surface radiation budget approach using MODIS and GOES data. A comparison between model ensemble and satellite-based ET indicates that satellite observations yield larger amplitudes during summer months in the CRB, primarily during the growing season. The CRB has a total observation-based ET flux of 142 ± 5 MAF yr-1, and we estimate approximately 10% of this flux (14.9 +/- 3 MAF yr-1) is due to anthropogenic influences. Our results highlight the relative importance of human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the properties and behaviors of materials and multi-phase aggregates under conditions of high pressure and temperature is vital to unraveling the mysteries that lie beneath the surface of the planet. Advances in in situexperimental techniques using synchrotron radiation at these extreme conditions have helped to provide answers to fundamental questions that were previously unattainable. Synchrotron-based ultrasonic interferometry measurements have proven to be especially important in determining acoustic velocities and thermoelastic properties of materials at high pressures and temperatures. However, due to relatively slow data collection times, it has been difficult to measure the effects of processes as they occur, and instead the measurement is made on the end product of these processes. DIASCoPE is an important step toward addressing this problem.\nOver the last three years, we have designed and developed an on-board ultrasonic acoustic velocity measurement system that cuts data collection time down by over an order of magnitude. We can now measure P- and S-wave travel times in samples at extreme conditions in less than one second. Moreover, the system has been fully integrated with the multi-anvil apparatus and the EPICS control system at beamline X17B2 of the National Synchrotron Light Source, allowing for greater ease of control andfull automation of experimental data collection. The DIASCoPE has completed the testing and commissioning phase, and the first data collected using this powerful new system will be presented here.\nDIASCoPE represents a major step forward in acoustic velocity collection time reduction that will finally allow us to begin to witness what effects various processes in the deep Earth may have on the physical properties of materials at extreme conditions as they occur. These new capabilities will allow us to change the focus of study from the product to the process itself and will lead to a greater understanding of the materials and processes that shape the Earth and other terrestrial planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "Scientists, land managers, and policy makers are facing new challenges as fire regimes are evolving as a result of climate change (Westerling et al. 2006). In high latitudes fires are increasing in number and size as temperatures increase and precipitation decreases (Kasischke and Turetsky 2006). Peatlands, like the large complexes in the Alaskan tundra, are burning more frequently and severely as a result of these changes, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases. Remotely sensed data are routinely used to monitor the location of active fires and the extent of burned areas, but they are not sensitive to the depth of the organic soil layer combusted, resulting in underestimation of peatland greenhouse gas emissions when employing the conventional ‘bottom up’ approach (Seiler and Crutzen 1980).\nAn alternative approach would be the direct estimation of the biomass burned from the energy released by the fire (Fire Radiative Energy, FRE) (Wooster et al. 2003). Previous works (Boschetti and Roy 2009; Kumar et al. 2011) showed that the sampling interval of polar orbiting satellite systems severely limits the accuracy of the FRE in tropical ecosystems (up to four overpasses a day with MODIS), but because of the convergence of the orbits, more observations are available at higher latitudes.\nIn this work, we used a combination of MODIS thermal data and Landsat optical data for the estimation of biomass burned in peatland ecosystems. First, the global MODIS active fire detection algorithm (Giglio et al. 2003) was modified, adapting the temperature thresholds to maximize the number of detections in boreal regions. Then, following the approach proposed by Boschetti and Roy (2009), the FRP point estimations were interpolated in time and space to cover the full temporal and spatial extent of the burned area, mapped with Landsat5 TM data. The methodology was tested on a large burned area in Alaska, and the results compared to published field measurements (Turetsky et al. 2011).",

            "abstract": "Tsunami deposits are recordings of tsunami events, containing the information about the flow conditions during events. Deciphering quantitative information from the deposits is especially important for paleo events where deposits are the only left-over physical evidence. Inversion of the flow conditions has been attempted in the past. One summarizing conclusion from the different inversion models is that it is a difficult endeavor, and the physical meaning of the inverted quantities depends on the physical assumptions that are applied. The aim of our study is to relate the time-varying characteristics of tsunamis with the deposits, and quantify the error and uncertainty that go with it. For this, we combine TsuSpeedv1 for the deposition with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnkF) method to study the deposition of an idealized deposit by one tsunami wave. In our modeling, we assume that information from the idealized deposit at different depths within the deposits can be used as observations, and the coupling between TsuSpeedv1 and EnkF allows us to correct for the different flow conditions causing deposition as the tsunami travels over a certain area. Applying an idealized deposit enables us to study the uncertainty and error that accompanies the inversion process by, for example, varying the number of unknown variables that we aim to invert, or how many observations are available, among others. Our tentative results indicate that sampling methods and sampling frequencies of tsunami deposit influence not only the magnitude of the inverted variables, but also their error and uncertainty. An interesting result of our technique is that a larger number of samples from a given tsunami deposits does not automatically mean that the inversion of, for example, flow speed and flow depth is more robust with smaller error and decreased uncertainty. The same also holds for the number of measured grain-size classes in the deposits. From a more general viewpoint, these two examples indicate that the gap between results from modeling and fieldwork needs to be narrowed or closed because only together more robust inversion can be achieved. In this sense, researchers focusing on fieldwork must understand more about modeling, and more theoretical researchers must better comprehend the limitations and constraints of fieldwork. ",

Several hundred Mastcam multispectral observations have been acquired to date, documenting a diversity of visible to near-infrared spectral behavior observed along Curiosity’s traverse toward the base of Mt. Sharp. These observations include both near-field images of materials in or near the rover workspace and also observations targeted towards the more distant central mound. Near-field observations document both outcrop and float rocks, the latter of which may include both local material as well as material transported from nearer the crater rim. Far-field observations of the central mound include the lower and upper layers of the mound as well as the encircling dune field, both of which have been noted in published studies to exhibit spectral variability in the visible to near-infrared from orbital spectral data. Float rocks with spectra distinct from local outcrops may have spectral matches at locations observed only from orbit, suggesting potential source regions. Furthermore, ground-based Mastcam observations may help “ground-truth” orbital data and in turn benefit from orbital predictions of spectral diversity along the future rover traverse. We present comparisons of CRISM and Mastcam multispectral observations of Gale Crater materials to better interpret observed spectral diversity and anticipate areas of likely opportunities for observations of spectral diversity.",

            "abstract": "Semi-arid environments make up a large percentage of the world's terrestrial ecosystems, and climate is a major factor influencing soil carbon storage and release. However, the roles of local controls such as parent material, aspect and microtopography have received less attention and are important for consideration in soil carbon modeling. The purpose of this study is to understand the role that parent material, aspect and micro-topography play in storage and release of soil carbon along an elevation gradient in a semi-arid climate. Johnston Draw (JD) is a first order watershed within the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory in southwestern Idaho with underlining late cretaceous, granitic Idaho batholith bedrock. Upper Sheep Creek (USC) is a first order watershed consisting of basalt. Both watersheds were chosen for this project due to similar size, aspect, elevation, vegetation and for the contrast in parent material. Two transects, totaling approximately nine soil pits, were excavated on both the north and south facing slopes of each watershed running parallel to the water channel. Soil carbon was generally higher in basalt compared to the granite parent material in pits with similar aspect, elevation and vegetation. Preliminary data using soil organic matter (SOM) as a proxy for organic carbon (OC) and soil water dynamics showed that percent OC declines markedly with elevation in JD and soil depth at lower elevations and is more homogenous throughout the profile moving up elevation (1646 meters 4.3-9.7%; 1707 meters 6.87-3.83%). Similarly, aspect controls patterns of SOM at depth more strongly at lower elevations. Findings from our study suggest that parent material and topography may play as important roles in semi-arid ecosystems as climate factors in controlling soil carbon storage.",

            "abstract": "One of the outstanding challenges of field geology is inaccessibility of exposure. The ability to view and characterize outcrops that are difficult to study from the ground is greatly improved by aerial investigation. Detailed stratigraphic architecture of such exposures is best addressed by using advances and availability of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) that can safely navigate from high-altitude overviews of study areas to within a meter of the exposure of interest. High-resolution photographs acquired at various elevations and azimuths by sUAS are then used to convert field measurements to digital representations in three-dimensions at a fine scale. Photogrammetric software is used to capture complex, detailed topography by creating digital surface models with a range imaging technique that estimates three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences. The digital surface model is overlain by detailed, high-resolution photography. Pairing sUAS technology with readily available photogrammetry software that requires little processing time and resources offers a revolutionary and cost-effective methodology for geoscientists to investigate and quantify stratigraphic and structural complexity of field studies from the convenience of the office.\nThese methods of imaging and modeling remote outcrops are demonstrated in the East Coast Basin, New Zealand, where wave-cut platform exposures of Miocene deep-water deposits offer a unique opportunity to investigate the flow processes and resulting characteristics of thin-bedded turbidite deposits. Stratigraphic architecture of wavecut platform and vertically-dipping exposures of these thin-bedded turbidites is investigated with sUAS coupled with Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry software. This approach allows the geometric and spatial variation of deep-water architecture to be characterized continuously along 2,000 meters of lateral exposure, as well as to measure and quantify cyclic variations in thin-bedded turbidites at centimeter scale. Results yield a spatial and temporal understanding of a deep-water depositional system at a scale that was previously unattainable using conventional field geology techniques, and a virtual outcrop that can be used for classroom education.",

            "abstract": "We present a comparison of retrieved cloud properties based on transmitted and reflected light for a cloud sampled during the recent Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS). Transmitted light interacts with cloud particles throughout the vertical extent of the cloud, while reflected light, commonly used for satellite remote sensing of clouds, is more influenced by the top-most cloud particles. To quantify cloud properties from transmitted shortwave radiation, a new retrieval utilizing spectrally resolved measurements is employed. Spectral features in shortwave radiation transmitted through clouds are sensitive to changes in cloud properties including cloud optical thickness, effective radius, and thermodynamic phase. The absorption and scattering of light by liquid water and ice clouds result in shifts in spectral slopes, curvatures, maxima, and minima of cloud-transmitted radiance. These spectral features have been observed in measured and modeled transmittance and have been quantified by 15 parameters, representing a new framework to evaluate spectral features in shortwave radiation. These parameters are used to retrieve cloud properties from measurements of zenith radiance from aircraft by using the Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research (4STAR) instrument. The 4STAR instrument was deployed on an airborne platform during SEAC4RS alongside the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR). The cloud optical thickness and effective radius from the retrieval based on transmitted shortwave radiation are compared to cloud properties obtained from above the cloud by using reflected shortwave radiation measured with SSFR and with the enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS). We present the difference in calculated surface cloud radiative forcing when using input of cloud properties obtained from retrievals based on transmitted instead of reflected light.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol-cloud interactions have so complicated feedback mechanisms that it is difficult to differentiate only aerosol impacts accompanying an instability-driven forcing from various results such as changes in circulation and precipitation, etc, probably based on the simple observational frameworks. Therefore a carefully-designed target-oriented approach is needed for the understanding of aerosol effects on meteorology with regard to its radiative and physical properties. Analysis of long-term trends of aerosol and cloud optical properties derived from satellite remote sensings does not show any significant annual trends, probably their cancelling effects each other, but with a strong gradient of aerosol optical depth over the Yellow Sea in the perspective of long-term average. However urban-induced aerosols effect on cloud and precipitation is discernible in the downwind of the metropolitan area in several-hours’ time scale and within less than around 100 km spatial domain, an increasing trend of precipitation amount and frequency at the far downwind region of Seoul Metropolitan Area during 35 years, especially for light precipitation of less than 1mm per day (Eun et al., 2011). In a couple of days the much wider spread haze transported to Korea might possibly modify its radiative and cloud microphysical modification, which is difficult to draw aerosol effects only. In this regard Northeast Asia will be a good testbed for aerosol’s regional scale analysis in terms of its forcing and response regions, both of which can be separated in the specific seasons with a favorable condition.",

            "abstract": "Surface mining activities have significantly depleted natural tree cover, especially trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), in the Boreal Forest and Aspen Parkland Natural Regions of Alberta. The natural soil profile is usually destroyed during these mining activities and soil and landscape reconstruction is typically the first step in the reclamation process. However, the mine tailings and overburden materials used for these new soils often become compacted during the reconstruction process because they are subjected to high amounts of traffic with heavy equipment. Compacted soils generally have low porosity and low penetrability through increased soil strength, making it difficult for roots to elongate and explore the soil. Compaction also reduces infiltration capacity and drainage, which can cause excessive runoff and soil erosion. To improve the pore size distribution and water transmission, subsoil ripping was carried out in a test plot at Genesee Prairie Mine, Alberta. Within the site, six replicates with two treatments each, unripped (compacted) and ripped (decompacted), were established with 20-m buffers between them. The main objective of this research was to characterize the effects of subsoil ripping on soil physical properties and the longevity of those effects.as well as soil water dynamics during spring snowmelt. Results showed improved bulk density, pore size distribution and water infiltration in the soil as a result of the deep ripping, but these improvements appear to be temporary.",

            "abstract": "Changes in the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are key drivers of anthropogenic climate change. It is hence not surprising that current and emerging U.S. governmental science priorities and programs focused on climate change (e.g. a U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Plan; the U.S. Carbon Cycle Science Program, the U.S. Global Change Research Program, Executive Order 13653 'Preparing the U.S. for the Impacts of Climate Change') all call for an improved understanding of these sources and sinks.. Measurements of the total atmospheric burden of these gases are well established, but measurements of their sources and sinks are difficult to make over spatial and temporal scales that are relevant for scientific and decisionmaking needs. Quantifying the uncertainty in these measurements is particularly challenging.\nThis talk reviews the intersection of the state of knowledge of GHG sources and sinks, focusing in particular on CO2 and CH4, and science and decision-making needs for this information. Different science and decision-making needs require differing levels of uncertainty. A number of high-priority needs (early detection of changes in the Earth system, projections of future climate, support of markets or regulations) often require a high degree of accuracy and/or precision. We will critically evaluate current U.S. planning to documents to infer current perceived needs for GHG source/sink quantification, attempting to translate these needs into quantitative uncertainty metrics. We will compare these perceived needs with the current state of the art of GHG source/sink quantification, including the apparent pattern of systematic differences between so-called “top down” and “bottom-up” flux estimates. This comparison will enable us to identify where needs can be readily satisfied, and where gaps in technology exist. Finally, we will examine what steps could be taken to close existing gaps.",

            "abstract": "The WNW-trending Gaeum Fault System (GFS) in the Cretaceous Gyeongsang Basin can give important clues for understanding the crustal deformation history in the SE Korea during the late Cretaceous to Paleogene. This study focuses on the Sinnyeong Fault, one of the most conspicuous strands among the GFS, based on the detailed field observations. Its main movement is interpreted as sinistral strike-slip with small reverse component, although it could have experienced other faultings with difference senses before/after this movement. An intriguing feature of the fault is the asymmetry of damage zones on both sides of the fault core. Sedimentary strata of the southern damage zone are much more folded and deformed than those of the northern damage zone, and the southern damage zone width is much wider than the northern one. The NW-trending en-echelon folds are also exclusively localized in the southern periphery along the fault with a continuous width less than 30 m, indicating a NE-SW compressional stress regime. The folds are interpreted to have formed coevally with or immediately before the sinistral movement of the fault, because they only occur in the nearby area of the fault and are sharply cut by the fault core. The asymmetric damage zone probably resulted from the concentration of regional compressional stress along pre-existing WNW-trending weak zone, such as densely populated fracture zone, within a relatively stable intraplate region. In the Gyeongsang Basin, the NNE-trending Yangsan Fault System dextrally cuts through the granites of ca. 48 Ma and the GFS sinistrally cuts through the granites of ca. 52 Ma. These similar ages as well as the geometries and kinematics of the two fault systems support that they acted as a great conjugate fault system under the NE-SW compressional stress regime. In addition, many previous studies have mentioned that the regional crustal uplift, folding, and reactivation of inherited structures occurred due to a tectonic inversion in East Asia during the late Eocene to Oligocene. It is thus concluded that the most conspicuous two fault systems in the Gyeongsang Basin were reactivated simultaneously as a conjugate fault system along the suitably orientated pre-existing crustal weaknesses under the NE-SW compressional stress regime during the late Paleogene.",

The niche perspective assumes that species have evolved and occupy deterministically different roles within its environment. This view differs from that of the neutral theories, which assume ecological equivalence between all species but incorporates stochastic demographic processes along with long-term migration and speciation rates. Both approaches have demonstrated tremendous power in predicting aspects species biodiversity. By combining tools from both approaches, we use modified birth and death processes to simulate plant species diversification in the Amazon/Andes and their space-time ecohydrological controls. By defining parameters related to births and deaths as functions of available resources, we incorporate the role of space-time resource variability on niche formation and community composition. We also explicitly include the role of a heterogeneous landscape and topography. The results are discussed in relation to transect datasets from neotropical forests.",

            "abstract": "Global general circulation models typically cannot provide the detailed and accurate regional climate information required by stakeholders for climate adaptation efforts, given their limited capacity to resolve the regional topography and changes in local sea surface temperature, wind and circulation patterns. The study region in Northwest Costa Rica has a tropical wet-dry climate with a double-peak wet season. During the dry season the central Costa Rican mountains prevent tropical Atlantic moisture from reaching the region. Most of the annual precipitation is received following the northward migration of the ITCZ in May that allows the region to benefit from moist southwesterly flow from the tropical Pacific. The wet season begins with a short period of “early rains” and is interrupted by the mid-summer drought associated with the intensification and westward expansion of the North Atlantic subtropical high in late June. Model projections for the 21st century indicate a lengthening and intensification of the mid-summer drought and a weakening of the early rains on which current crop cultivation practices rely.\nWe developed an expert elicitation to systematically address uncertainties in the available model projections of changes in the seasonal precipitation pattern. Our approach extends an elicitation approach developed previously at Carnegie Mellon University. Experts in the climate of the study region or Central American climate were asked to assess the mechanisms driving precipitation during each part of the season, uncertainties regarding these mechanisms, expected changes in each mechanism in a warming climate, and the capacity of current models to reproduce these processes. To avoid overconfidence bias, a step-by-step procedure was followed to estimate changes in the timing and intensity of precipitation during each part of the season. The questions drew upon interviews conducted with the regions stakeholders to assess their climate information needs.\nThis study is part of the FuturAgua project funded by the Belmont Freshwater Security call. The expert opinions on expected changes in the seasonal precipitation pattern are being used to inform regional efforts to build drought resilience and to create and compare alternative water management strategies with the region’s stakeholders.",

            "abstract": "Near-surface abundance of trace gas species can exhibit complex horizontal and vertical structures, which may present challenges for satellite based observation or model sub-grid parameterization. Even long-lived species, which are often modeled as globally well mixed, have been observed to contain significant regional and local anomalies from the global seasonal background. The vertical profile of these anomalies is critical in deriving surface and column distributions from remote sensing retrievals. Complex emissions patterns both in time and space present a major challenge in characterizing regional scale concentrations. Vertical mixing, and local wind circulation, which can be strongly modulated on diurnal time scales, contribute to the relationship between column and surface abundances and the horizontal scales of variability.\nThe San Joaquin Valley (SJV) contains a complex mix of surface emissions including urban, agricultural, oil and gas exploration and processing, and major highways. In addition, the ventilation of the SJV is highly variable and periods of stagnation can exist for several days. During the campaign, two such stagnation periods were observed, interrupted by the passage of Pacific mid-latitude systems. We present results showing the relationship between emissions, regional meteorology and chemistry in explaining the modes of variability observed in key trace gas species including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, odd nitrogen, ammonia and methane.",

            "abstract": "In this study we explore the mechanisms of synoptic rainfall variability using observations from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite. While previously shown to have an important impact on North American monsoon rainfall, tropical cyclones are excluded from this analysis, in order to focus on more frequent synoptic disturbances within the region. A rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis of North American monsoon rainfall for June through September 2002-2009 suggests low-level tropical disturbances contribute to the leading two modes of precipitation variability within this region. The low-level disturbances result in gulf surges, or low-level surges of moisture up the Gulf of California, and provide a key low-level moisture source to facilitate development of organized convection. In the first mode the low-level trough brings precipitation to lower elevations along the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental south of Hermosillo, Mexico and over the southern Baja Peninsula. In the second mode the low-level trough interacts with an upper-level inverted trough enhancing precipitation into the southwestern United States and northwest Mexico. In particular, the upper-level trough contributes to the easterly-northeasterly shear across the region, favoring mesoscale convective organization and enhanced deep convection over the Sierra Madre Occidental and higher elevations in southeast Arizona. The EOF methodology offers an objective approach for determining the dominant modes of precipitation for the monsoon region useful for identifying past and monitoring future low-frequency impacts on these modes.",

            "abstract": "Heating from tidal dissipation is so extreme on Io that its mantle is partially molten, and it is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. The detection of an induced magnetic field in Io suggests that the partially molten layer in the interior is at least 50 km thick and at least 20% molten [1]. The presence of this magma changes the nature of convection. Stagnant lid convection alone cannot produce Io’s high observed surface heat flux [2], and Io’s surface shows no evidence of plate tectonics. Instead, Io loses most of its internal heat through magma migration and volcanic eruptions or the ‘heat pipe mechanism’. Previous studies of heat loss from Io’s mantle have considered either migration of magma [3] or convection of solid mantle material [e.g. 4], but not both. Here we present numerical simulations that include both processes allowing for the first self-consistent test of the hypothesized heat-pipe mechanism on Io. We use the mantle convection code StagYY, which includes the generation, segregation, and eruption of magma, to conduct two-dimensional numerical simulations in Cartesian geometry considering a region ¼ the width of Io’s mantle and the full depth of Io’s mantle. We find that Io has a partially molten mantle, which is consistent with the detected induced magnetic field. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate the viability of the heat pipe mechanism on Io. We find that Io loses two orders of magnitude more internal heat via magmatic eruption than via conduction through its stagnant lid. These magmatic eruptions are the source of Io’s high heat flux. Although the average heat flux from magmatic eruptions is equal to Io’s observed heat flux, the magmatic heat flux oscillates around this value with time, which is consistent with the variable nature of volcanic eruptions despite our simplified parameterization of eruption.\n[1] Khurana K.

            "abstract": "Understanding the feedbacks between water, sediment, and vegetation in deltas is an important part of understanding deltas as ecomorphodynamic systems. We conducted a set of laboratory experiments using alfalfa (Medicago sativa) as a proxy for delta vegetation to determine (1) the effects of plants on delta growth and channel dynamics and (2) the influence of fine material on delta evolution. Vegetated experiments were compared to a control run without plants to isolate the effects of vegetation, and experiments with fine sediment were compared to a set of similar experiments with only sand. We found that alfalfa increased sediment trapping on the delta topset, and that the plants were especially effective at retaining fine material. Compared to the control run, the vegetated experiments showed an increased retention of fine sediment on the floodplain that resulted in increased delta relief and stronger pulses of shoreline progradation when channel avulsion and migration occurred. In other words, a higher amount of sediment storage with the addition of vegetation corresponded to a higher amount of sediment excavation during channelization events. In natural systems, dense bank vegetation is typically expected to help confine flow. We seeded our delta uniformly, which eliminated typical vegetation density gradients from riverbank to island center and therefore diminished the gradient in overbank sedimentation that best confines channels by creating levees. Dense clusters of alfalfa throughout the interior of the floodplain and delta islands were therefore able to induce flow splitting, where channels diverged around a stand of plants. This created several smaller channels that were then able to more widely distribute sediment at the delta front compared to unvegetated experiments. We conclude that plants are efficient sediment trappers that change the rate and amount of sediment storage in the delta topset, and that gradients in vegetation density are an important factor in determining how channel behavior may change.",

            "abstract": "Laser-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) technology coupled with x-ray diffraction (XRD) probe has become a powerful tool to explore the mineralogy of the deep Earth. However, powder diffraction alone has the intrinsic limitations when the sample consists of multiple different phases; only a couple of low angle diffraction rings are unique to each of the phases; most overlapping diffraction rings cannot be used for unique identification or accurate determination of crystallographic parameters. Such powder refinements at extreme P–T conditions also suffer from unreliable intensity measurements caused by texturing of the sample and spottiness due to crystal growth under high T. In addition, new structures and minor phases are often overshadowed by the diffraction peaks of major phases.\nThe crystal structure and unit-cell parameters of Fe-bearing minerals change with pressure/temperature, spin transition, and Fe redistribution. Precise structure analysis is required to understand the role of Fe in the geophysical and geochemical processes in the deep Earth. To overcome the difficulties, we introduced a multigrain crystallography method to determine crystallographic orientations of individual crystallites within a polycrystalline sample in-situ in a DAC. Using this method, we are able to separate individual crystallites and treat them as individual single crystals. The high-brilliance x-ray beam available at the 3rd generation synchrotron facilities has made it possible to collect diffraction spots in a powder sample comprised of hundreds of submicron-sized crystallites. Once separated, the data set for each crystallite can be treated with the standard single-crystal refinement program, resulting in excellent statistics in refinement and maximal coverage of the reciprocal space. The combination of powder diffraction and multigrain crystallography is very powerful in unequivocal determination of symmetry and unit cells, solving new structures, and picking out minor phases. The method has been demonstrated for solving crystallographic problems above megabar pressures.",

            "abstract": "We present model simulations of climate change impacts on snowmelt processes over a 1600 km2 area in the southern Sierra Nevada, including western Sequoia National Park. The domain spans a 3600 m elevation gradient and ecosystems ranging from semi-arid grasslands to giant sequoia groves to alpine tundra. Three reference years were evaluated: a moderately dry snow season (23% below average SWE), an average snow season (7% above average SWE), and a moderately wet snow season (54% above average SWE). The Alpine3D model was run for the reference years and results were evaluated against data from a multi-scale measurement campaign that included repeated manual snow courses and basin-scale snow surveys, dozens of automated snow depth sensors, and automated SWE stations. Compared to automated measurements, the model represented the date of snow disappearance within two days. Compared to manual measurements, model SWE RMSE values for the average and wet snow seasons were highly correlated (R2=0.89 and R2=0.73) with the distance of SWE measurements from the nearest precipitation gauge used to force the model; no significant correlation was found with elevation. The results suggest that Alpine3D is highly accurate during the melt season and that precipitation uncertainty may critically limit snow model accuracy. The air temperature measured at 19 regional stations for the three reference years was modified by +1°C to +6°C to simulate the impact of warmer temperatures on snowmelt dynamics over the 3600 m elevation gradient. For all years, progressively warmer temperatures caused the seasonal SWE centroid to shift earlier and higher in elevation. At forested middle elevations, 70 – 80% of the present-day snowpack volume is lost in a +2°C scenario; 30 – 40% of that change is a result of precipitation phase shift and the remainder is due to enhanced melt. At all elevations, spring and fall snowpack was most sensitive to warmer temperatures; mid-winter sensitivity was least for elevations >3100 m. Interestingly, the dominant effect of warmer temperatures on snowmelt was a reduction in daily melt rates. The drier year was most sensitive to temperature changes with a greater decrease in the number of days with high melt rates. The results offer insight into the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to warmer temperatures in the Sierra Nevada.",

            "abstract": "The Little Ice Age (LIA) glacial advances, represented as a set of “fresh and bouldery” moraines a few hundred meters downstream from modern glaciers, have been widely recognized in Central Asian highlands. However, few studies have been conducted to constrain the formation ages of these moraines. Glaciers provide critical freshwater supply in Central Asia, so understanding the dynamics of glaciers, especially in the past a few hundreds of years, is of great importance. In a NSF funded project reported here, we aim to constrain the formation ages of these putative LIA moraines in the eastern Tian Shan, China, using cosmogenic 10Be surface exposure dating. Our initial results showed 10Be exposure ages ranging from 0.17±0.10 ka to 0.28±0.10 ka, from 0.38±0.03 ka to 0.86±0.08 ka, and from 0.36±0.04 ka to 0.41±0.10 ka for these moraines from the Bayinbuluke Valley in the Nalati Range, the Turgan Valley in the Karlik Range, and the Daxi Valley in the Tianger Range, respectively. We are currently processing 30 samples for the “LIA” moraines in six valleys located in the Heigou Valley of the Bogeda Range, the Haxilegen Pass in the Borohoro Range, and the Urumqi River headwaters in the Tianger Range. Except for one older age of 5.1±0.6 ka, which might be an outlier, our recently measured four ages range from 0.19±0.04 ka to 0.61±0.10 ka. These ages suggest that these fresh moraines were formed during the LIA, but glaciers might advance to their maximum extents slightly differently in different sites. This work demonstrates the importance of absolute dating in reconstructing past glacial fluctuations, and provides quantitative evidence in assessing the impact of glacier change on the ecosystem and society in recent centuries.",

We continue our analysis of events that produced radio emissions that are sufficiently distinct to estimate the TGF source altitude from the timing of ground and ionospheric reflections. Moreover, an even smaller (but nonempty) subset of measured radio emissions enable altitude estimation of the sequence of lightning leader pulses that precede and follow the TGF.

The GAIMs are physics-based four-dimensional models and capable of assimilating a variety of ground-based and spaceborne observations on global scales. In this presentation, we will discuss various data assimilation techniques and data sources used in GAIMs to capture ionospheric perturbations. The results of GAIM studies of ionospheric disturbances during the April 2011 and March 2013 geomagnetic storms, respectively, will be presented. The two storms were driven by space weather perturbations caused by high speed stream (HSS) and coronal mass ejection (CME) events, respectively. With distinguished solar wind characteristics these two types of Sun-Earth connection events caused different variations in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system. In the assimilative ionospheric modeling, GPS data from hundreds of globally-distributed ground stations and six COSMIC satellites are assimilated into GAIMs. Both storm-time and quiet-time ionosphere have been reproduced to reveal disturbance patterns and to help investigate the differences in the M-I-T coupling processes driven by the two types of storms.",

            "abstract": "Strain localization is a ubiquitous feature of granular materials undergoing nonhomogeneous deformation. In unsaturated porous media, how the localized deformation band is formed depends crucially on the degree of saturation, since fluid in the pores of a solid imposes a volume constraint on the deformation of the solid. When fluid flow is involved, the inception of the localized deformation band also depends on the heterogeneity of a material, which is quantified in terms of the spatial variation of density, the degree of saturation, and matric suction. We present a mathematical framework for coupled solid-deformation/fluid-diffusion in unsaturated porous media that takes into account material and geometric nonlinearities [1, 2]. The framework relies on the continuum principle of thermodynamics to identify an effective, or constitutive, stress for the solid matrix, and a water retention law that highlights the interdependence of degree of saturation, suction, and porosity of the material. We discuss the role of heterogeneity, quantified either deterministically or stochastically, on the development of a persistent shear band. We derive bifurcation conditions [3] governing the initiation of such a shear band. This research is inspired by current testing techniques that allow nondestructive and non-invasive measurement of density and the degree of saturation through high-resolution imaging [4]. The numerical simulations under plane strain condition demonstrate that the bifurcation not only manifests itself on the loading response curve and but also in the space of the degree of saturation, specific volume and suction stress. \n",

The midnight temperature maximum (MTM) is a large scale neutral temperature anomaly with wide spread influence on the low-latitude thermosphere and ionosphere. Variations in the low latitudes’ nighttime neutral density, termed midnight density maximum (MDM) have also been observed and modeled. Although there is a large body of work on the characteristics of the MTM (& MDM) there are still a few questions which remain to be answered concerning the global scale distribution of the MTM (&MDM), their spatial extent and longitudinal variations, their global seasonal occurrence pattern and amplitude.\nThe Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII) flown on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) provides among other parameters multiyear observations of O(1D) nightglow volume emission rates (VER), Doppler temperatures, and neutral winds over the altitude range from 150 to 300 km with continuous latitude coverage from 42°N to 42°S and to 72° in one hemisphere every 36 days. These correlative in time and space data are employed in the study of the global and seasonal extent of the MTM/MDM. The results are compared with simulations by the Canadian Ionosphere and Atmosphere Model (C-IAM). Reasonable agreement is obtained in terms of temporal, solar flux, and solar zenith angle variations.",

            "abstract": "Although many observations in the hydrologic sciences are easy to obtain, requiring very little training or equipment, spatial and temporally-distributed data collection is hindered by associated personnel and telemetry costs. Lack of data increases the uncertainty and can limit applications of both field and modeling studies. However, modern society is much more digitally connected than the past, which presents new opportunities to collect real-time hydrologic data through the use of participatory sensing. Participatory sensing in this usage refers to citizens contributing distributed observations of physical phenomena. Real-time data streams are possible as a direct result of the growth of mobile phone networks and high adoption rates of mobile users. In this research, we describe an example of the development, methodology, barriers to entry, data uncertainty, and results of mobile phone based participatory sensing applied to groundwater and surface water characterization. Results are presented from three participatory sensing experiments that focused on stream stage, surface water temperature, and water quality. Results demonstrate variability in the consistency and reliability across the type of data collected and the challenges of collecting research grade data. These studies also point to needed improvements and future developments for widespread use of low cost techniques for participatory sensing.",

            "abstract": "Soils hold a globally important stock of carbon (C) and can act as both a C source and sink, depending on management and environmental conditions. Pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) is produced naturally during fires, and contains relatively stable forms of C. Its intentional production has also been proposed as a mechanism for C management (in such cases PyOM is often referred to as “biochar”). However, the impact of natural or anthropogenic PyOM production on soils is complex and depends on many factors. In particular, PyOM additions to soils may have effects on plant growth and on native soil C cycling. The response of the soil microbial community to PyOM additions is likely key to understanding these interactions, but remains poorly characterized. We studied soil C dynamics and soil microbial communities in a field study with 350°C PyOM from 13C-labelled corn stover, a C3-derived soil, and C4 plants (sudangrass). PyOM additions only temporarily increased total soil CO2 fluxes, dramatically less than the increase associated with the addition of corn stover, which likely increased SOC losses. We used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S region on the MiSeq platform to characterize the initial, 12-day and 82-day soil bacterial communiities. We used three-part stable isotopic partitioning after two months to distinguish 334% higher root-derived CO2 fluxes in the plots with PyOM additions than those without, and 45% lower PyOM-C derived CO2 fluxes in the plots with plants present. The 84% increase in estimated cumulative soil CO2 emissions with stover additions was accompanied by a significant shift in the soil bacterial community on days 12 and 82, while the PyOM additions only resulted in significant changes to the overall community on day 82. We investigate which taxa are driving these community shifts, and how they may relate to the soil CO2 fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Shale gas is an unconventional fossil energy resource that is already having a profound impact on US energy independence and is projected to last for at least 100 years. Production of methane and other hydrocarbons from low permeability shale involves hydrofracturing of rock, establishing fracture connectivity, and multiphase fluid-flow and reaction processes all of which are poorly understood. The result is inefficient extraction with many environmental concerns. A science-based capability is required to quantify the governing mesoscale fluid-solid interactions, including microstructural control of fracture patterns and the interaction of engineered fluids with hydrocarbon flow. These interactions depend on coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes over scales from microns to tens of meters. Determining the key mechanisms in subsurface THMC systems has been impeded due to the lack of sophisticated experimental methods to measure fracture aperture and connectivity, multiphase permeability, and chemical exchange capacities at the high temperature, pressure, and stresses present in the subsurface. This project uses innovative high-pressure microfluidic and triaxial core flood experiments on shale to explore fracture-permeability relations and the extraction of hydrocarbon. These data are integrated with simulations including lattice Boltzmann modeling of pore-scale processes, finite-element/discrete element models of fracture development in the near-well environment, discrete-fracture modeling of the reservoir, and system-scale models to assess the economics of alternative fracturing fluids. The ultimate goal is to make the necessary measurements to develop models that can be used to determine the reservoir operating conditions necessary to gain a degree of control over fracture generation, fluid flow, and interfacial processes over a range of subsurface conditions.",

The geographical position of the Pantanal, altitude, latitude, longitude, climate and weather conditions are determined by the dynamics of the atmosphere that affects the whole South America and consequently influence the ecological framework of ecosystems. The results shown by the components considered in the energy balance were more significant during the day, which the atmospheric boundary layer extends from the ground to about 50 or 100 meters height, showing greater instability and turbulence (u* 〉 0.2 m / s), and this turbulence is what justifies the use of the eddy covariance method to estimate the sensible and latent heat flux. The Pantanal presents seasonal difference between the densities estimates of sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat flux. During the rainy season the sensible heat flux (H) was 30% and the latent heat flux (LE) 58%. During the dry season the sensible heat flux (H) was 46% and the latent heat flux (LE) 40% of the energy budget.",

            "abstract": "One of the key lessons of the last decade of great earthquakes is that long paleoseismic records are a vital part of the body of knowledge required for accurate earthquake forecasting, and that the longest, most detailed records provide the best understanding of the complete range of fault behavior. In addition to being the source of one of the decade’s great earthquakes, the Mentawai segment of the Sunda megathrust also has one of the most detailed paleoseismic and paleogeodetic records, thanks to studies of coral microatolls. The high spatial and temporal resolution of these records has illuminated many features that are difficult to discern using most other techniques. Examples of varying types of segmentation, asperity mosaicking, superimposed seismic cycles with varying periods, and time-varying interseismic coupling are all exhibited by this megathrust segment. While the northern end of the segment in the Batu Islands appears to be a persistent barrier to rupture throughout the paleoseismic record, the behavior of the central Mentawai segment is more heterogeneous. Ruptures from both ends generally terminate in this region, yet also often overlap by 100–200 km. This behavior, likely due to smaller-scale heterogeneities in frictional properties of the fault interface, results in the characteristic rupture of the Mentawai segment in a series of events rather than a single end-to-end rupture. Beyond that similarity, it is clear that each of these rupture sequences evolves uniquely in terms of the order and grouping of asperities that rupture. Additionally, the ruptures that begin the sequences frequently alter the distribution of fault coupling, thus influencing the progression of future ruptures. Heterogeneities in fault frictional properties at the scale seen in the Mentawai case are probably common and control the rupture extent, magnitude and distribution of slip in great earthquakes worldwide. Though the details are usually less clear, analogs to the Mentawai supercycles can be found in both subduction and continental faulting environments. The Mentawai example highlights many of the complexities researchers should expect to discover in seismic cycles on major faults around the world.",

Viruses infecting marine phytoplankton can be significant agents of mortality and disrupt the canonical flow of carbon and nutrients through the microbial loop via the “viral shunt.” A large proportion of the ocean’s primary production is contributed by photosynthetic eukaryotes, which are important members of the picophytoplankton size class. The smallest picoeukaryote Ostreococcus represents a diverse and widely distributed genus. While the genomes of several viruses infecting the coastal species Ostreococcus lucimarinus have been sequenced, the dependence of viral infection dynamics on environmental parameters such as light and nutrient availability has not been characterized. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine how light synchronization and nutrient availability modulate the infection of three O. lucimarinus viruses. Viruses were introduced to mid-exponentially-growing O. lucimarinus cultures at different points during a 14:10h light:dark cycle and the infections were followed through a lysis event. Additionally, viral infection dynamics were quantified for cultures of O. lucimarinus under either nutrient-replete or nutrient-deplete conditions. Preliminary results suggest that both light and nutrient availability influence viral infection dynamics, and that low nutrient availability may dampen the severity of infection. This work provides insight to the role of light and nutrient availability in controlling viral replication in an ecologically important picophytoplankton. Considering virus-host interactions is therefore critical for understanding marine plankton-driven biogeochemical processes.",

The SMC is ~30 km off the Pacific Coast and it is oriented parallel to the coast. The annual rainfall exceeds 6 m and most of this takes place during summer season when low-pressure systems and cyclones are frequent. The rivers in SMC incise into the granite and transport large volumes of sediment. Even though rivers can be regarded as bedrock bedrock channels these suddenly change to alluvial–type rivers when these flow in the coastal plain which is ~10 km from the headwater of rivers. There are not data available of the sediment yield of rivers, however, the well–broad coastal plain and the wide continental shelf suggest that the sediment transport from the mountain area to the lowlands is significantly high. Here we assess the main morphological, climatic and structural factors controlling water discharge and sediment load of the rivers flowing from the SMC to the Pacific Coast by means of (1) topographical analysis on a high-resolution DEM, (2) grain–size and OSL analysis on sediment extracted from the riverbed of the main rivers and (3) time-series analysis from the available data of sediment discharge and sediment load. Our results indicate that the river incision and sediment transport is particularly high at the southern sector of the SMC where the topographic and climatic factors promote higher erosion rates.",

            "abstract": "Nominally anhydrous minerals are a reservoir for water in otherwise dry rocks. This water may play a role in facilitating metamorphic reactions and enhancing deformation. In this study, we examined orthopyroxene-bearing granites from the Athabasca Granulite terrane in northern Saskatchewan. These rocks intruded the lower crust (pressures of 1 GPa) at circa 2.6 Ga at temperatures of > 900 ºC and were subsequently metamorphosed at granulite facies conditions (700 ºC and 1 GPa) in the Paleoproterozoic (Williams et al., 2000). One of the primary reactions recorded by these rocks is locally known as the “Mary” reaction and involves the anhydrous reaction: orthopyroxene + Ca-plagioclase = clinopyroxene + garnet + Na-plagioclase. Measurements of water concentrations in both product and reactant assemblages were performed using a Bruker Vertex 70 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and revealed that there is a slight excess of water in product minerals over reactant minerals. There are two possible explanations for this. The first is that water was derived from an external source, possibly hydrous, likely contemporaneous, mafic dikes. This interpretation is supported by higher concentrations of K, which is essentially absent from the reactant minerals, in the Na-rich rims of plagioclase. However, only modest amounts of external fluids could have been introduced, or amphiboles would have been stabilized at the expense of clinopyroxene (Moore & Carmichael, 1998). An alternative interpretation is that slightly more water-rich minerals reacted more readily, releasing water that was then incorporated into their products, whereas the water-poorer minerals failed to react. Support for this interpretation comes from very low water concentrations in orthopyroxene and plagioclase from an unreacted and undeformed sample. This interpretation suggests that water in anhydrous minerals may catalyze metamorphic reactions, and a lack of water may be critical for preserving metastable assemblages.\nMoore & Carmichael (1998).

            "abstract": "As the spatial resolution of heath data continues to improve (i.e., from aggregates within census tracts to point-level residential addresses from patient records), the spatial resolution and coverage of air pollution exposure estimates must also improve for studies that aim to investigate the impact of air pollution on health outcomes. As part of the Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology (SCAPE) air quality models are being developed to provide enhanced exposure metrics for spatially resolved time-series epidemiologic studies. To generate spatiotemporal air quality metrics unique data fusion approaches are developed that combine ground level observations from regulatory monitoring networks, chemical transport model results (CTM), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from satellite retrievals. The objectives of this presentation are to compare data fusion approaches and assess the ability of the different data fusion models to predict ground level PM2.5 concentrations specific for use in exposure assessments. We present data fusion results from statistical downscaling of gridded CTM simulations and AOD data, to predict ambient ground level PM2.5 concentrations. The downscaling framework will focus on four model configurations using CTM results (CMAQ) or satellite AOD as a spatial predictor, with and without additional land use and meteorology predictors. Daily, spatially resolved (12-km) PM2.5 concentrations for the southeastern United States from 2003 to 2005 will be shown. Data withholding and monitoring data from an independent dataset are used to calculate prediction performance statistics for comparison. The independent dataset will also be used to compare these results with results from previously published data fusion models that are being increasingly utilized for health analyses in the United States. It is expected that the downscaling approach with land use regression terms will improve prediction performance, especially for the CTM spatial predictor where the temporal data coverage is more complete than it is for satellite AOD.",

            "abstract": "The Eastern North America Margin (ENAM) Community Seismic Experiment (CSE) is scheduled to collect on- and offshore active source seismic data including more than 2500 km of multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles in the fall of 2014. The project was designed to address a wide array of questions related to the evolution and modification of the eastern North American rifted margin in conjunction with the arrival of the Earthscope transportable array on the US East Coast. The planned rifting-parallel profiles north and south of Cape Hatteras are expected to cross the front between the warm water of the Gulf Stream western boundary current and colder North Atlantic water providing the opportunity to image mesoscale features related to the front and their associated fine structure. Standard MCS data has been shown to be well-tuned to image ocean fine structure resulting from abrupt vertical changes in temperature and salinity in the ocean. Thus, the same seismic data that is collected to investigate the sub-seafloor geology can also be processed to image reflections in the water that reveal ocean processes with a horizontal resolution of ~10 m and vertical resolution of ~4 m. As an add-on to the ENAM CSE, 30 additional expendable bathythermographs and 3 conductivity temperature depth probes belonging to the University of Wyoming are planned for deployment during the collection of the MCS profiles resulting in an average hydrographic profile spacing of ~33 km. We present a first look at this new seismic oceanography data set providing 2-D images of ocean acoustic reflectivity correlated with closely spaced hydrographic measurements across the Gulf Stream front.",

            "abstract": "Documented warming of intermediate waters by ~1oC over the past 30 years along the western Svalbard margin has been suggested as a driver of climate-change induced dissociation of marine methane hydrate. However, recent evidence suggests methane release from gas hydrate has been occurring for thousands of years near the upper limit of methane hydrate stability and that seasonal changes in bottom water temperature may be more important than longer-term warming of intermediate waters. Nevertheless, this area has been and remains an active area for researching the physical and climate controls of methane release from the seafloor, yet the amount of methane reaching the atmosphere (the ultimate climate driver) in this region is largely unknown. As part of the MOCA project led by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU), water column and atmospheric marine boundary layer methane data were collected in June 2014 aboard the R/V Helmer Hanssenduring a collaboration among CAGE at University of Tromsӧ, NILU, GEOMAR, and the USGS. The results provide a continuous record of surface methane concentration and carbon isotope data from continental slope sites near temperature-sensitive hydrate-bearing seeps along the shelf-break and upper slope, the deep-water pockmarked gas-venting Vestnesa Ridge and a shallow water seep area within the Forlandet moraine complex at the shelf. Surface water methane and associated data used to calculate sea-air fluxes were obtained with the cavity ring-down spectrometer-based USGS Gas Analysis System (USGS-GAS). Only the shallow seep site (~90 m water depth) had appreciable methane in surface waters. We conducted an exhaustive survey of this site, mapping the full extent of the surface methane plume. To provide three-dimensional constraints, we acquired 65 vertical dissolved methane profiles to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of the subsurface methane plume. Using these data, we assess how effectively shallow arctic seeps transmit methane to the atmosphere by determining what fraction of methane in the geochemical plume is emitted to the atmosphere. We also compare the methane mass flux from the seep site to an adjacent section of the Prins Karls Forland coastal margin to constrain the relative importance of different types of high-latitude seafloor methane emissions.",

            "abstract": "Fire products derived from coarse (500m to 1km) spatial resolution satellite data have become an important source of information for the fire science and applications communities. There is however a demand for moderate spatial resolution burned area maps that are systematically generated at regional to global scale. This paper presents a multi-temporal methodology to fuse the MODIS 1km active fire product with Landsat data to map burned areas at 30m on a temporally rolling basis. A multistage mapping approach is used, with an initial per-pixel change detection on Landsat 30m time series to identify candidate burned areas. The candidate burned area objects are then either retained or discarded by comparison with contemporaneous MODIS active fire detections. Results are illustrated showing 30m burned area maps of the conterminous United States and Alaska for two years (2002 and 2008) generated from weekly Web Enabled Landsat (WELD) Landsat mosaics and daily Terra and Aqua MODIS active fire detections. Validation is conducted by systematic comparison with all the fire perimeter vectors provided by the USGS Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. The presented methodology pathfinds the use of the Landsat archive to contribute to a long term burned area data record. Prospects for future developments and global application are discussed.",

Thus, the enhanced phase of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) can be thought of as a large contiguous area, in which most air columns have crossed over this moisture threshold. What processes dictate how this threshold is crossed at intraseasonal timescales?\nTo begin answering this, we introduce a Lagrangian perspective on the column moisture budget of the MJO. As opposed to conventional Eulerian metrics, a Lagrangian perspective allows us to consider moistening processes with respect to air columns that are being advected by the flow. Techniques are introduced for estimating the column moisture tendencies using analysis and satellite observations, and estimates are compared for validation. We then examine how the critical column moisture threshold can influence how we think about MJO dynamics. Implications for MJO compositing methods will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We examine California geothermal fields to determine if historical earthquakes may yield evidence of a maximum magnitude limit for future events. An earthquake catalog presents a limited past sample of a population of earthquake magnitudes, whose properties can be extrapolated. For a catalog of events at each geothermal field, we postulate a limiting maximum magnitude, and ask if it is consistent with the data. If enough earthquakes near the limit should have occurred but did not, we reject the suggested magnitude limit with confidence. For a Poisson process, we are unable to reject a limiting magnitude unless the expected number of events is >3 and the number observed is zero.\nOur search has begun for an earthquake catalog with a finite magnitude limit, based on real earthquake data. McGarr (2014) suggests that maximum magnitudes for injection-induced earthquakes are constrained by volume of fluid injected, and that future induced earthquake magnitudes may be limited by this relationship. For appropriate catalogs, we evaluate whether McGarr’s hypothesis may be explained by an insufficient number of events. When catalogs do not provide for a maximum magnitude limit, we will extrapolate current magnitude-frequency distributions to obtain future probabilities of occurrence for specific magnitudes over a given time period.",

            "abstract": "Ordos block is a typical representative of cratonic lithosphere in North China. It is stable in the block ,but around the block there are a series of faulted basins and folded mountains, the new tectonic movement around the block is intense. Some scholars propose that the upper mantle flow is an important factor to the extension activity of the fault zone around the block. But it has never been discussed in detail that how the upper mantle flow affects the movement and deformation around Ordos block? A 3D viscoelastic modeling is realized for studying the deformation effect of the upper mantle flow to Ordos and its surroundings, based on the comprehensive geological and geophysical data ,such as 3d rheological structure, the active blocks of China, thermal structure, shear wave splitting, et al. The modeling results indicate that in the vertical direction, compared with the local uplift and depression caused by the compression among the plates, the uplifting of Ordos block as a whole is mainly effected by mantle upwelling. In general the upper mantle surrounding of Ordos block is upwelling, Linfen basin goes up more faster. In the horizontal direction, The general flow direction of upper mantle in the study area is NE, basically the same as Qingzang block movement direction. But there is a bifurcation flow along the southwestern margin of Liupanshan. Generally speaking, the regional deformation is drive mainly by the movement of Qingzang block and adjacent blocks pushing into each other,the deformation effect of the upper mantle flow to Ordos and its surroundings is a superposition and partial adjustment.",

In general, dam inflow forecasting with stochastic time series model is possible to apply when the data is stationary because most of stochastic process based on stationarity. However, recent hydrological data cannot be satisfied the stationarity anymore because of climate change. Therefore a stochastic time series model, which can consider seasonality and trend in the data series, named SARIMAX(Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Average with eXternal variable) model were constructed in this study. This SARIMAX model could increase the performance of stochastic time series model by considering the nonstationarity components and external variable such as precipitation. For application, the models were constructed for four coordinated dams on Han river in South Korea with monthly time series data. As a result, the models of each dam have similar performance and it would be possible to use the model for coordinated dam operation.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was supported by a grant 'Establishing Active Disaster Management System of Flood Control Structures by using 3D BIM Technique' [NEMA-NH-12-57] from the Natural Hazard Mitigation Research Group, National Emergency Management Agency of Korea.",

            "abstract": "Wavefield simulation is an integral part of full-waveform inversion. Therefore, the accuracy and stability of the numerical methods for forward modeling are of paramount importance for the inversion procedure. In this presentation we will focus on the accuracy and stability analysis of a novel method for wave propagation, namely, the Interior-Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin Method (IP-DGM).\nIP-DGM is a generalization of the finite-element method in which the basis functions are discontinuous across the element interfaces and continuity is weakly imposed using penalty terms. The advantages of this method for seismic modeling are that it can handle general non-structured finite-element meshes and any type of boundary conditions, which allow the accommodation of topography and heterogeneities in a natural manner. Furthermore, it is also suitable for parallelization in modern high-performance computers and for local time stepping.\nWe will show here that the stability of this method strongly depends on the polynomial order of the basis functions and on the choice of the penalty. Furthermore, we give necessary and sufficient stability conditions for the acoustic and elastic cases and for basis functions of orders 1 to 10. Based on this analysis we conclude that the stability conditions of this method are more restrictive than those of other high-order methods like the spectral-element method.\nWe have also analyzed the accuracy of this method based on a grid-dispersion criteria. The accuracy of this method is similar to that of other high-order finite-element methods. The grid-dispersion analysis shows that the accuracy is greatly improved by using high-order basis functions. In particular, using fourth-order basis functions yields minimal dispersion and negligible numerical anisotropy.\nWe will finally show examples that illustrate the advantages of this method for seismic modeling.",

Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex (APVC), located between 21 and 24ºS, is a volcano-tectonic province constituted by diverse caldera complexes and ignimbrite deposits (Upper Miocene – Lower Pleistocene) that covers an area ~50.000 km2. In this work, we present data from three new ignimbrites discovered in a portion of APVC (22°–22,4°S), with the objective to establish its origin and provenance. Were identified 3 new ignimbrites: 1) Cabana ignimbrite (>7.5 Ma), constituted by 3 pyroclastic flow and 1 pyroclastic surge units of crystal-glass rich dacitic tuffs, 80 m maximum thick, 0.18 km3 volume and 0.14 km3 DRE; 2) Inacaliri ignimbrite (7.5 Ma) constituted by two members, corresponding to glassy dacitic (basal member) and basaltic andesites (upper member) tuffs, the total thick reach up 20 m, 0.003 km3 volume and 0.002 km3 DRE; 3) Tolar ignimbrite (>1.3 Ma), constituted by a single pyroclastic flow and a basal fall glassy dacitic deposits, 50 m maximum thick, 0.04 km3 volume and 0.03 km3 DRE. Cabana ignimbrite seems to have been originated from a single caldera complex, whose cannot be recognized in the field. Inacaliri ignimbrite could be related to initial phases of building of Inacaliri and Apacheta-Aguilucho volcanic complexes, or originated to a buried caldera located below both volcanic complexes. Finally, Tolar ignimbrite corresponds to initial building stage of Toconce volcano, located 2 km at NE from these deposits.",

            "abstract": "Verification of geophysics codes is imperative to avoid serious academic as well as practical consequences. In case that access to any given source code is not possible, the Method of Manufactured Solution (MMS) cannot be employed in code verification. In contrast, employing the Method of Exact Solution (MES) has several practical advantages. In this research, we first provide four new one-dimensional analytical solutions designed for code verification; these solutions are able to uncover the particular imperfections of the Advection-diffusion-reaction equation, such as nonlinear advection, diffusion or source terms, as well as non-constant coefficient equations. After that, we provide a solution of Burgers’ equation in a novel setup. Proposed solutions satisfy the continuity of mass for the ambient flow, which is a crucial factor for coupled hydrodynamics-transport solvers. Then, we use the derived analytical solutions for code verification. To clarify gray-literature issues in the verification of transport codes, we designed a comprehensive test suite to uncover any imperfection in transport solvers via a hierarchical increase in the level of tests' complexity. The test suite includes hundreds of unit tests and system tests to check vis-a-vis the portions of the code. Examples for checking the suite start by testing a simple case of unidirectional advection; then, bidirectional advection and tidal flow and build up to nonlinear cases. We design tests to check nonlinearity in velocity, dispersivity and reactions. The concealing effect of scales (Peclet and Damkohler numbers) on the mesh-convergence study and appropriate remedies are also discussed. For the cases in which the appropriate benchmarks for mesh convergence study are not available, we utilize symmetry. Auxiliary subroutines for automation of the test suite and report generation are designed. All in all, the test package is not only a robust tool for code verification but it also provides comprehensive insight on the ADR solvers capabilities. Such information is essential for any rigorous computational modeling of ADR equation for surface/subsurface pollution transport. We also convey our experiences in finding several errors which were not detectable with routine verification techniques.",

            "abstract": "Modern paleomagnetic studies of achondrites have found that at least several planetesimals generated dynamos with inferred surface magnetic fields ranging from tens to hundreds of µT. In fact, an achondrite without evidence for paleomagnetic fields has not been previously identified, hinting that the dynamo process may have been extremely common among early planetary bodies. To further expand our understanding of the diversity of planetesimal dynamos, we have been studying the paleomagnetism the ungrouped achondrite NWA 7325. This ancient meteorite (Pb/Pb and Al/Mg ages of ~4563 Ma) is highly depleted in siderophile elements, indicating that it formed on a differentiated body that underwent large-scale metal-silicate fractionation. We present new paleomagnetic, rock magnetic transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and Ar/Ar analyses of this rock that constrain the field intensity in which it cooled. In particular, we employ a new controlled oxygen fugacity system that enables us to conduct thermal demagnetization while greatly mitigating oxidation-reduction reactions. This system is critical because of the extremely reduced conditions (at least 3 log units below the iron-wüstite buffer) in which this meteorite formed. The extremely fine grain size (<200 nm) of many FeNi metal grains in NWA 7325 (pseudo single domain-superparamagnetic size) means that it has extremely high fidelity magnetic recording properties. We find no stable remanent magnetization and no evidence for any magnetic fields greater than ~2 µT at the time of last cooling below the Curie point. Our Ar/Ar thermochronometry suggests that the last major thermal event experienced by NWA 7325 was at 500 Ma. Because this age is well after the expected lifetime of early planetesimal dynamos, our data indicate that any crustal fields on the parent body are extremely weak. This stands in stark contrast to Vesta, for which our analyses of the eucrite ALHA 81001 suggest has substantial (~10 µT) crustal fields. This makes NWA 7325 the first example of an essentially unmagnetized igneous rock from a differentiated body in the early solar system. We discuss the implications of this for early planetary thermal histories and the hypothesis that NWA 7325 may have originated from Mercury",

            "abstract": "We report a case study of eastward-propagating auroral vortices detected by the ground-based network of all-sky imagers and magnetometers in the northern Scandinavia. The three eastward-propagating mesoscale aruroal vortices were observed intermittently at about 15-minute intervals in the post-midnight sector (0:00-0:40 UT; 2:30-3:10 magnetic local time). Their properties are analogous to those of the omega bands or torches, which propagate typically eastward with a similar recurrence period in the post-midnight sector during the recovery phase of the substorm. In addition, the vortices were accompanied by characteristic magnetic variations corresponding to eastward-drifting pairs of downward and upward field-aligned currents (FACs).\nOn the other hand, we found some distinct differences from the omega bands and torches, described as follows: (1) The auroral vortices occurred during the expansion phase of the substorm, almost simultaneously with Pi 2 pulsations at the magnetic equator. (2) The drift velocity of the vortices was approximately 3 - 10 km/s at 100 km altitude, which is much faster than the typical velocity of the omega bands (V = 0.4 - 2 km/s). (3) The vortices were accompanied by the magnetic variations with periods of 3 - 5 min, which were shorter than periods of Ps 6 pulsations (T = 5 - 40 min) that typically coincide with the omega bands. (4) The ionospheric equivalent current systems derived from the magnetometer data indicated the upward FAC in the dark region inside the vortices, whereas the downward FAC is typically detected in the dark region between the torches. We interpret the observed aurora vortices as the transient phenomena associated with the generation process of the omega bands.",

            "abstract": "The major threats to human health from heavy metals are associated with exposure to arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium, mercury, as well as some other elements. The effects of such heavy metals on human health have been extensively studied and reviewed by international organizations such as WHO. Due to their toxicity, heavy metal contaminations have been regulated by national environmental standards in many countries, and/or laws such as the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act in Japan.   Leaching of naturally occurring heavy metals from the soils, especially those around abandoned metal mines into surrounding water systems, either groundwater or surface water systems, is one of the major pathways of exposure. Therefore, understanding the leaching properties of toxic heavy metals from naturally polluted soils is of fundamentally importance for effectively managing abandoned metal mines, excavated rocks discharged from infrastructure constructions such as tunneling, and/or selecting a pertinent countermeasure against pollution when it is necessary.   In this study, soil samples taken from the surroundings of abandoned metal mines in different regions in Japan were collected and analyzed. The samples contained multiple heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and chromium. Standard leaching test and sequential leaching test considering different forms of contaminants, such as trivalent and pentavalent arsenics, and trivalent and hexavalent chromiums, together with standard test for evaluating total concentration, X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (XRF), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) tests were performed. In addition, sequential leaching tests were performed to evaluate long-term leaching properties of lead from representative samples. This presentation introduces the details of the above experimental study, discusses the relationships among leaching properties and chemical and mineral compositions, indicates the difficulties associated with remediation of naturally polluted sites, and emphasizes the importance of risk-based countermeasures against naturally occurring heavy metals.

            "abstract": "Matlab is one of the areas in SE Bangladesh highly affected with elevated concentrations of dissolved As in drinking waters. Matlab is stratigraphically composed of thick floodplain deposits of Holocene age overlying Plio-Pleistocene grey fine to coarse sands with considerable clay (Dupi Tila). The dissolved As concentrations in the studied area ranged from <1 to 3644 µg/l and more than 70% of functioning tubewells exceeded the WHO guideline of 10 µg/l. To test the hypothesis that young labile organic carbon (LOC) accelerates As release in reducing aquifer systems as long as As-bearing iron oxides/hydroxides are available, we collected 19 groundwater (depths from 14 to 240 m) and 9 surface water (8 pond and 1 canal in proximity to the piezeometer nests) samples from 4 nests in north and south Matlab, respectively, during monsoon months (Jun-Jul, 2014). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), fluorescent properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (e.g., E. coli) counts using field ColilertTM test kits were undertaken to understand the chemical character and potential sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in groundwater and surface waters. DOC concentrations were high (1.5-12.2 mg/l) in shallow aquifers (14-33 m) where dissolved As ranged from 100-500 µg/l. DOC concentrations were lower (0.7-4.2 mg/l) in intermediate to deeper depths (52-240 m) with lower As concentrations of 0-50 µg/l. In surface water bodies, the range of DOC was 2.9-8.1 mg/l. MPN based analyses for both ground and surface waters indicate the frequency of E. coli detection in shallow well waters (MPN= 3.6-74.1) was high as well as in ponds and canals (MPN= 8.5-433.4). Microbial activity in groundwater was lower than in unprotected surface waters. Freshness index (β:α), humification index (HIX), fluorescence source index (FI) values showed that DOM in shallow and surface water bodies was distinct from deep groundwater. Concurrent with the lower DOC in deeper wells, the overall fluorescence intensities decreased with depth. The results thus far point to more humic DOM in shallow groundwaters, which is not expected to be a labile carbon source for microorganisms, but which may be involved in complexation or other biogeochemical reactions that mobilize arsenic.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) are sites of high primary productivity which contribute to the deposition of Corg-rich sediments. Unique nutrient and trace element cycling occurs within an OMZ. The extent and severity of OMZs is changing globally, making it critical to understand these fluctuations and their important implications for biogeochemical cycling in both the water column and sediments. The Eastern Tropical North Pacific OMZ impinges on basin slopes where laminated, hemipelagic sediments record useful proxies of OMZ fluctuations. In an OMZ, low O2 content promotes water column denitrification; this enriches the residual nitrate pool in 15N. This 15N-enriched nitrate assimilated by primary producers imparts its isotopic signature on Particulate Organic Nitrogen (PON) exported from euphotic zone and buried in sediments. The intensity of anoxia is reflected in the degree of 15N enrichment in the sedimentary PON. We will present high-resolution δ15N records obtained from laminated sediment cores from the Pescadero Slope (Gulf of California) and the Santa Monica Basin (California Borderland) that show distinct temporal fluctuations in the δ15-PN with a decadal to multi-decadal frequency. The Pescadero gravity core has age control provided by 24 14C dates. Comparisons between δ15Nsed and percent biogenic silica in sediments help elucidate the factors driving the changes in the intensity of the OMZ. Preliminary data show enriched δ15Nsed values correspond to increased percentages of biogenic silica in sediments, indicating a connection between increased bSi productivity and the intensity of the OMZ in the ETNP.",

However, the role of SST over the Japan Sea on precipitation during summer is not well understood. The heavy precipitation event occurred over the northern main island of Japan in early-August, 2013. The unusual precipitation seems to be associated with the significant moisture flux over the Japan Sea where the sea surface temperature was warmer than the normal. Here, the impact of SST warming over the Japan Sea on the heavy precipitation event is examined using a regional atmospheric model. In one experiment, the actual SST is prescribed as a lower boundary condition, while the climatological mean SST is given in another experiment. The simulated precipitation amount associated with the heavy rainfall event in the former experiment is more than that in the latter experiment, associated with the increased moisture flux. The results suggest a potential impact of SST on severe precipitation events even during summer.",

            "abstract": "A recently drilled groundwater investigation borehole, drilled to a depth of 1760 m in the Humu’ula Saddle of Hawaii Island, encountered an unexpectedly high temperature gradient of more than 160 ̊C/km. Although prior MT surveys across the region identified conductive formations of modest extent in the region, there were few surface manifestations of geologic structures likely to host a geothermal system and no evidence of an active, extensive hydrothermal system. Cores recovered from the borehole showed the presence of intrusive formations and moderate hydrothermal alteration at depth with progressive infilling of fractures and vesicles with depth and temperature. Independent modeling of gravity data (Flinders et al., 2013) suggests the presence of a broad intrusive complex within the region that is consistent with the borehole’s confirmation of a high-elevation (~1400 m amsl) regional water table. A subsequent MT survey covering much of the western Saddle region has confirmed the presence of highly conductive conditions, consistent with thermal activity, to depths of 4 km and greater. Light stable isotope data for the borehole fluids indicate that the regional water table is derived from recharge from the upper elevations of Mauna Kea; major element chemistry indicates that formation temperatures exceed 200 ̊C. A conceptual model of the hydrothermal system, along with isotopic and fluid chemistry of the thermal fluids will be presented.",

Interpretation of these measurements will require accurate reconstruction of the large-scale coronal magnetic field. In a related presentation by S. Jones et al., we argue that such reconstruction can be performed using photospheric extrapolation methods constrained by white-light coronagraph images. Here, we present the image-processing component of this project dealing with an automated segmentation of fan-like coronal loop structures.\nIn contrast to the existing segmentation codes designed for detecting small-scale closed loops in the vicinity of active regions, we focus on the large-scale geometry of the open-field coronal features observed at significant radial distances from the solar surface. The coronagraph images used for the loop segmentation are transformed into a polar coordinate system and undergo radial detrending and initial noise reduction. The preprocessed images are subject to an adaptive second order differentiation combining radial and azimuthal directions. An adjustable thresholding technique is applied to identify candidate coronagraph features associated with the large-scale coronal field. A blob detection algorithm is used to extract valid features and discard noisy data pixels. The obtained features are interpolated using higher-order polynomials which are used to derive empirical directional constraints for magnetic field extrapolation procedures based on photospheric magnetograms.",

            "abstract": "Recent bark beetle outbreaks in western North America have impacted millions of hectares of conifer forests leading to uncertainty about whether these forests will become new sources of atmospheric CO2. In large part, this depends on whether enhanced respiration from the decomposition of newly dead organic matter will outpace the recovery of ecosystem carbon uptake by the ecosystems. To understand how rapidly conifer forest carbon pools turn over following these disturbances, we examined changes in the isotopic composition of soil respiration (δ13Cresp) following beetle and girdling mortality in two subalpine forests in Colorado, U.S.A. At the beetle-impacted forest δ13Cresp declined by ~1‰ between 3 and 8 years post-disturbance, but recovered in years 9–10. In the girdled forest, deep (<10 cm depth) soil respiration from plots at <1 to 2 years post-girdling was depleted by ~1‰ relative to ungirdled plots, but then gradually increased until there was a significant spike in δ13Cresp at 8–9 years post-girdling. Based on our understanding of isotopic composition in carbon pools and fluxes at these forests, we attribute these changes to removal of recently assimilated C in rhizosphere respiration (1–2 years) followed by the decomposition of litterfall (needles and roots) 8–10 years post-disturbance. Relative to ungirdled plots, there was also a transient enrichment in surface δ13Cresp from plots at <1 to 2 years post-girdling (~0.5‰, not statistically significant) and significant declines in microbial carbon in surface soils in 2–4 year post-girdling plots. Again, based on current understanding, we interpret these to signify the rapid turnover of mycorrhizal and rhizosphere microbial biomass in the 2 years following girdling. A potential confounding factor in this study is that seasonal variation in δ13Cresp was similar in magnitude to changes with time since disturbance and was significantly related to variation in soil temperature and water content.",

            "abstract": "Drizzle occurs frequently in shallow, warm boundary layer clouds. For example, in stratocumulus it occurs approximately 1/3 of the time in full cloud cover conditions (Wood 2012). Drizzle affects moisture and energy budgets, and cloud albedo, morphology and lifetime. At the cloud scale, processes that control drizzle formation include turbulence production via radiative cooling and/or shear, entrainment, and surface moisture fluxes. At the micro-scale, collision-coalescence is the primary process relevant to warm drizzle formation. Differential gravitational sedimentation and turbulent air motions cause cloud droplets to collide, creating drops much larger than can be formed by condensation alone. Other factors, such as preferential concentration and entrainment mixing may also be relevant. The process is typically subdivided into three regimes: autoconversion (small drops self-collide), accretion (large drops collect small drops), and hydrometeor self-collection (large drops self-collide). Of these regimes, autoconversion is the rate-limiting step in existing analytical representations.\nThis study (i) evaluates whether our best theoretical understanding of collision-coalescence in the autoconversion regime can replicate observations, with a broader goal of (ii) exploring which cloud-scale factors are most important for drizzle initiation. A state-of-the-art turbulent collisional growth model is applied to a bin microphysics scheme within a large-eddy simulation such that the full range of cloud drop growth mechanisms are represented (i.e. CCN activation, condensation, collision-coalescence, mixing, etc.) at realistic atmospheric conditions. We compare cloud drop spectra produced by the LES with observations to assess the quality and limits of our theoretical knowledge. The comparison will be performed over a range of observational cases that span a range of drizzle rates. These cases differ in their radiative cooling rates, shear, cloud-top temperature and moisture jumps, and entrainment rates. Using these diverse cases, we will begin to tease apart the cloud-scale factors governing drizzle rates. \nInitial results for question (i) suggest that in some cases enhancements of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over predicted collision rates are necessary to reproduce observations.",

            "abstract": "The increasing spread and abundance of an invasive perennial grass, buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare), represents an important shift in the vegetation composition of the Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona. Buffelgrass out-competes native species and alters fire regimes, and its control and management is a high-priority issue for resource managers who seek to preserve the unique and iconic Sonoran Desert flora. Herbicidal treatment of buffelgrass is most effective when the vegetation is actively growing; however, the erratic timing and length of active buffelgrass growth periods in southern Arizona confound effective management decision-making. The goal of our research is to enable the strategic application of buffelgrass herbicide by using remote sensing data to detect when and where buffelgrass is photosynthetically active. We integrated ground-based observations of buffelgrass phenology (green-up and senescence) in the Tucson, Arizona area with climate information and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery at 250m spatial and both 8-day and 16-day composite temporal resolution to understand dynamics, relationships and resonance between these disparate datasets during 2011 to 2013. Fourier harmonics analysis was used to derive land surface phenology (LSP) metrics from MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) greenness data and to quantify the temporal patterns of the climate and phenophase abundance datasets. Regression analyses and statistical tests were used to identify correlations between temporal patterns of the data sets. Our results reveal strong correlations between the observed greenness of in-situ buffelgrass and satellite LSP metrics, confirming that MODIS-EVI data can be a useful indicator of active buffelgrass growth at multiple scales. The analysis also reveals strong harmonics between precipitation and greenness, but with a lagged response, suggesting that precipitation can be a predictor of the location and intensity of buffelgrass green-up at landscape scales. This information can be used by resource managers to treat buffelgrass during optimal conditions.",

A variety of different processes (including the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability, reconnection, and flux transfer events) are thought to input the energy for the ULF waves. We use THEMIS simultaneous observations in the upstream solar wind and in the downstream magnetosphere from October 24, 2007 to June 23, 2014. We use 3 s velocity moments from the THEMIS ESA instrument and 3 s magnetic field magnitude from the THEMIS FGM instrument to perform a Fast Fourier analysis and determine the dominant frequencies of the waves during 10 minutes and 1 hour intervals. The typical periods for solar wind fluctuations are 209 s and typical periods in magnetosphere are 267 s based off of magnetic fluctuation magnitudes. We discuss the foreshock as a trigger in the generation of ULF waves in the magnetosphere. We examine the effects of upstream solar wind parameters on exciting ULF waves pulsations in the magnetosphere.",

Our \nresults indicate that it is important to consider the reduction in the dissolution rate after the fingers begin to interact with the bottom of the aquifer.

            "abstract": "Stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Cryogenian glacial successions provide primary data for elucidating climatic change of this critical interval. The Cryogenian strata of South China were deposited in a rift basin, and exhibit dramatic facies change from the basin center to margin, which complicates stratigtraphic correlations. Here we present new sedimentological, geochemical and stratigraphic data based on the detailed analyses of more than ten well exposed sections along a basinward transect from north-south. In the basin center, Cryogenian strata are about 4000 m thick and characterized by two glaciogenic diamictite units separated by a diamictite-free siliciclastic interval. Initiation of the Chang’an glaciation (Sturtian equivalent) is conformable and gradational with dropstones appearing in siltstone at the basal part of the Chang’an Formation followed by a shoaling-up sequence that is interpreted to represent a glacio-eustatic sea-level fall. In the basin center, >600 m of graded beds of siliciclastic rocks and debrites of the Fulu Formation overlie the Chang’an Formation. The Fulu Formation is succeeded by a thin (<10 m) fine-grained siliciclasitic unit with black shale and manganese carbonate at the base, which is assigned to the Datangpo Formation, and massive glacigenic diamitictite of the Marinoan-age Nantuo Formation. On the basin margin, the Datangpo Formation is up to 300 m thick and is underlain by a glaciogentic diamictite (Tiesi’ao/Dongshanfeng/Gucheng Formations). Taking factors of glacial dynamics and active tectonism into account, we develop a facies model to interpret the sedimentology and stratigraphic architecture of these successions. Combined with new geochronological data, our data will provide tests for Cryogenian climatic models.",

            "abstract": "Yellowstone hotspot center migration during the mid-Miocene northeast along the Snake River Plain (SRP) resulted in a succession of explosive caldera-forming super-eruptions, often involving 1000’s of km3 of ejecta and covering 10,000’s of km2. The frequency and volume of the rhyolitic eruptions in the SRP are of both academic and societal interest, yet remain poorly known. Identification and correlation of individual eruption deposits are critical for evaluating eruption volumes and frequency over time and the relationship with climate and tectonics. Rhyolitic ash-flow deposits flank both the northern and southern margins of the SRP, but have not been successfully correlated because of their similarity in both outcrop appearance and chemical composition. Paleomagnetic correlation using the stable magnetic remanence direction has the advantage of very high temporal resolution, on the order of centuries because of the geologically rapid rate of geomagnetic secular variation and the high accuracy in which extrusive volcanic rocks may record the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field. The strength of a paleomagnetic correlation increases with the rarity of the field direction recorded by the ash flow. Here we demonstrate correlation of SRP ignimbrites by sampling the Cougar Point Tuff (CPT) Xll at three widely spaced (~25 km) locations. The transitional polarity recorded by titanomagnetite in CPT Xll enables a strong paleomagnetic correlation. CPT Xll, however, is weakly magnetized because it was erupted during a polarity transition of Earth’s magnetic field, and therefore is more susceptible to magnetic overprinting. Nonetheless, careful alternating-field demagnetization coupled with line- fit and great-circle analysis, yields well-constrained directions of stable remanence. Gyroremanent magnetization, a spurious component produced by demagnetization at the higher field steps, is dealt with satisfactorily by taking small alternating-field steps and by permuting the order of demagnetization along the three sample axes.",

            "abstract": "Glaciated continental shelves are host to numerous morphologic features that help understand past glacier dynamics. Southeastern Alaska is home to the St. Elias Mountains, an active orogen being impacted by temperate marine glaciers. During glacial periods ice streams advance across the continental shelf, carving shelf-crossing troughs that reach the shelf edge. We use high-resolution multibeam data to develop the relationship between two troughs, the Yakutat and Alsek Sea Valleys, and associated continental slope morphology. The shelf and slope geomorphology can be divided into statistical groupings that relate to the relative balance of erosion and deposition. Our analysis indicates that only the Yakutat system has been able to build an incipient trough-mouth fan. The extreme sediment supply from this region was able to overwhelm the steep initial topography of the transform margin, while farther to the east sediment slope-bypass dominates. This analysis provides an extreme end member to existing studies of temperate glaciation along continental margins. The unique interplay between rapid uplift due to ongoing collision and the massive erosion caused by temperate glaciers in a coastal system with extremely high precipitation provides for sedimentary flux far greater than other systems and thus allows for formation of a trough mouth fan in spite of a tectonically generated steep slope.",

            "abstract": "A long term perspective on several quasi-decadal cycles of intensifying drought stress across boreal Alaska has been synthesized from monitoring of forest reference stands at Bonanza Creek LTER, Interior Alaska Research Natural Areas, and tree ring sampling across Alaska. The Alaska boreal forest is largely made up of tree populations with two growth responses to temperature increases. Negative responders are more common, and found across the warm, dry Interior. Positive responders are largely in western Alaska, a maritime climate region near the Bering Sea, and at high elevation of the Brooks and Alaska Ranges. Following the North Pacific climate regime shift in 1976-77, negative responder Interior white and black spruce, aspen, and birch all experienced major growth reductions, particularly in warm drought years. Elevated summer temperatures and low annual precipitation of recent decades at low elevations of the Tanana and central Yukon Valleys were outside the values which previously defined the species distributions limits, Long term survival prospects are questionable. Simultaneously, recent elevated temperatures were associated with growth increases of positive responders. On fertile floodplain sites of the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, the growth rate of positive responding white spruce is now greater than negative responders for the first time in centuries. NDVI trends in recent decades confirm these opposite growth trends in their respective regions. During peak warm/dry anomalies, forest disturbance, an important process for tree regeneration over the long term, intensified in boreal Alaska. Several insect outbreaks of wood-boring and defoliating species associated with warm temperature/drought stress anomalies appeared, many of them severe, and some not previously known to outbreak. Significant tree injury (e.g. top dieback) and mortality resulted. Wildfire extent and severity increased and reached record levels. The overall pattern has been described as biome shift. Future research is needed on the distribution of boreal forest refuge habitats in the Interior, drought effects on natural tree regeneration and growth/health of young tree populations, carbon accumulation profiles under the modern drought regime compared to earlier, and the genetic disruption of biome shift.",

One such collaboration, which came out of Expedition 345 to the Hess Deep Rift, resulted in an interactive lab to explore sampling rocks from the usually inacessible lower oceanic crust, offering an insight into the geological processes that form the structure of the Earth’s crust. This Hess Deep Interactive Lab aims to explain several significant discoveries made by oceanic drilling utilizing images of actual thin sections and core samples recovered from IODP expeditions. . Participants can interact with a physical model to learn about the coring and drilling processes, and gain an understanding of seafloor structures. The collaboration of this lab developed as a need to explain fundamental notions of the ocean crust formed at fast-spreading ridges. A complementary interactive online lab can be accessed at\nwww.joidesresolution.org\nfor students to engage further with these concepts.

(McKenzie, 1990, p. 109-110)\nI present a comprehensive tectonic model for the strike-slip fault geometry, seismicity, material rotation, and stress rotation, in which new, optimally oriented faults can form when older ones have rotated about a vertical axis out of favorable orientations. The model was successfully tested in the Mojave region using stress rotation and three independent data sets: the alignment of epicenters and fault plane solutions from the six largest central Mojave earthquakes since 1947, material rotations inferred from paleomagnetic declination anomalies, and rotated dike strands of the Independence dike swarm. The model led not only to the anticipation of the 1992 M7.3 Landers, CA earthquake but also accounts for the great complexity of the faulting and seismicity of this event.\nThe implication of this model for crustal deformation in general is that rotations of material (faults and the blocks between them) and of stress provide the key link between the complexity of faults systems in-situ and idealized mechanical theory of faulting. Excluding rotations from the kinematical and mechanical analysis of crustal deformation makes it impossible to explain the complexity of what geologists see in faults, or what seismicity shows us about active faults. However, when we allow for rotation of material and stress, Coulomb's law becomes consistent with the complexity of faults and faulting observed in situ.",

            "abstract": "We use output from the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)_Version 3.6 - both coupled to the Noah Unified land model - to investigate the short-term forecast error covariance structure of surface and atmospheric variables linked in the local coupling process chain, which spans the soil moisture-precipitation feedback pathway. Quantities of interest include: soil moisture, temperature, humidity, surface turbulent heat fluxes, convective available potential energy, lifting condensation level, planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, total column integrated water vapor, and precipitation. Using the five longest sustained periods of wet and dry coupling in the recent period of record at U.S. DOE's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program Southern Great Plains (SGP) site, we produce analogue error structures of default WRF. These analogues are then used to point to aspects/vertical model layers where the greatest gains in model forecast skill can be expected during like coupling regime events at the SGP. Finally, the same wet- and dry-coupling periods are run with the initial soil moisture and temperature prescribed from NLDAS-2 Noah output. These runs provide analogues of model improvement magnitudes, which we evaluate in the context of the land-atmosphere coupling process chain.\nIn this study, two key and highly interdependent issues are the land initialization sequence protocol (especially when the perturbation is of considerable magnitude) and configuration-related systematic biases in WRF tied to PBL, convective parameterization, and (Noah) land schemes. We provide guidance on both issues for simulations at SGP. Insights gained from our study are directly applicable to future fully-coupled land data assimilation runs over the region.",

            "abstract": "Very high temperature fumaroles unambiguously represent samples of magmatic gas expanding to the surface from sub-volcanic magma bodies. Here we present the results of thermochemical modelling of measured fumarole gas compositions that confirm that magmatic gases are SO2-dominant when redox is controlled by homogeneous gas reactions involving SO2, H2S and other species, i.e. the ‘gas buffer’. In subsurface volcanic environments, SO2 also dominates when oxygen fugacity, fO2, is greater than the value imposed by the Ni-NiO buffer; a common situation in arc environments. These results indicate that to understand the systematics of arc magma degassing, it is necessary to investigate how SO2, the principle sulfur gas, reacts directly with magmatic materials.\nThermochemical modelling of the interaction between SO2-bearing gas mixtures and common rock-forming minerals such as anorthite and calcite indicates that SO2 spontaneously disproportionates to form anhydrite and a reduced sulfur species. Experimental investigation of these reactions in a gas-mixing tube furnace at 600-800 °C, 1 bar, demonstrates extremely rapid anhydrite formation on the surface of crystalline anorthite through chemisorption.\nIn the presence of H2O, the reduced sulfur species is H2S, which may subsequently react with co-transported metals such as Fe and Cu in the magmatic gas to form metal sulfides. It is proposed that this mechanism provides a straightforward explanation for the massive amounts of coexisting sulfate and sulfide cogenerated at depths of 1 to 4 km inside volcanic systems and now exposed as porphyry copper deposits. Anhydrite dissolution may contribute to the fragility of volcanic structures.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind, magnetospheric ions and micrometeorites impact the surface of airless bodies in the solar system and deposit energy in the surface material. Excitation and momentum transfer processes lead to sputtering or desorption of molecules and atoms, thereby creating a dynamic exosphere about an otherwise airless body. Ion mass spectrometry of ejected materials provides a highly sensitive method for detecting sputter products and determining the surface composition [Johnson and Baragiola, 1991; Elphic et al., 1991]. Though most of the material is sputtered as neutral gas, UV photons can ionize ejected neutrals and a small fraction of the ejecta leaves the surface in an ionized state. However, ions are deflected by the variably-oriented solar wind magnetic field and thus relating their detection to a surface location can be problematic. Here we estimate the average ion density close to the surface of Phobos or Deimos to predict whether modern mass spectrometry instruments [Mahaffey et al. 2014] would be able to obtain sufficient compositional information to place constraints on their origin. The open source Monte Carlo program SRIM.SR was used to simulate the effect of ions incident onto a surface representing several different meteorite compositions and gave estimates of the damage and sputtering effects. As much of the empirical data supporting SRIM results comes from sputtering of metallic and organic molecular targets which can differ greatly from materials that make up planetary surfaces, measurements of cohesive energies and enthalpies of formation were used to estimate the surface binding energies for minerals, though these can vary significantly depending on the chemical composition. Since these properties affect the sputtering yield, comparisons of simulations with laboratory measurements were made to test the validity of our estimates. Using the validated results and a constant fraction to estimate ion yields, the density of ejected ions and neutrals vs. altitude from Phobos and Deimos was calculated using analytical equations. We use the results to make predictions on the expected signal for several meteorite classes.",

            "abstract": "The karst aquifer region of northern Puerto Rico is the area with the highest groundwater extraction in the island. Urban and industrial development has led to extensive contamination of the groundwater in the region. Of particular concern, is the presence of emerging and legacy organic contaminants, such as phthalates and chlorinated organic compounds (CVOCs), because there high risk for exposure and adverse health impact. Variable sources and the heterogeneous and dynamic conditions of karst groundwater systems, limits the ability to properly assess and manage the water quality of these precious water resources. This work develops a monitoring and water analysis scheme to assess spatial-temporal exposure of hazardous contaminants trough karst water in northern Puerto Rico. Groundwater and tap water are sampled in the region and analyzed for phthalates, CVOCs, and common ions. Detections and concentrations of phthalates and CVOCs are determined by using modified EPA methods, which rely on liquid-liquid extractions and gas chromatography techniques. The modified methods have reduced the volume of samples and solvent waste, decreased the time of analysis, increased analysis outcomes, and lower potential for hazardous exposure. Results show intermittent presence of di-ethyl, di-butyl and di (2-ethyl hexyl) phthalates in 36% of the groundwater and 53% of tap water samples, with detected concentrations ranging between 0.1-88.7 μg/L. These results indicate that karst groundwater can serve as a route of exposure for phthalates, but there are additional disperse sources in the water system. CVOCs are detected in groundwater at much higher frequencies (50%) than phthalates, and include trichloromethane (TCM), carbon tetrachloride (CT), trichloroethylene (TCE), and tetrachloroethylene (TCE). CVOCs, except for TCM, are found at lower frequencies on tap water (5.8%) than groundwater (27%). TCM is detected more frequently and at higher concentrations in tap water (56.8%) than tap water (30%). Results indicated that most CVOCs on tap water come from groundwater sources. Spatial-temporal analysis of CVOC data shows that transport through karst system is highly heterogeneous variable, and reflect high capacity of the system to store and slowly release contaminants through rate-limited mass transport process.",

The Coast Range Ophiolite Microbial Observatory (CROMO) plumbs groundwaters percolating through a tectonic mélange of Jurassic-aged oceanic crust, with blocks of metabasalt and metagabbro, variably serpentinized ultramafics, Great Valley Sequence sedimentary rocks including the Jurassic Knoxville formation and the Cretaceous Crack Canyon formation, as well as rocks resulting from silica-carbonate alteration of serpentinites (marginal listvenites). All of these rock units are accessible in the McLaughlin Natural Reserve (administered by the University of California-Davis). In this work, we report on persistent geochemical trends in CROMO waters, which are gas-rich, high pH (11+), Ca2+-OH- type waters, contrast their characteristics with other continental sites of serpentinization and deep sea serpentinizing vent systems, and place the evolution of these waters in a water-rock reaction context based on geochemical modeling.",

            "abstract": "Budburst, the initiation of annual growth in plants, is sensitive to climate and is used to monitor physiological responses to climate change. Accurately forecasting budburst response to these changes demands an understanding of the drivers of budburst. Current research and predictive models focus on population or landscape-level drivers, yet fundamental questions regarding drivers of budburst diversity within an individual tree remain unanswered. We hypothesize that foliar temperature, an important physiological property, may be a dominant driver of differences in the timing of budburst within a single tree. Studying these differences facilitates development of high throughput phenotyping technology used to improve predictive budburst models. We present spatial and temporal variation in foliar temperature as a function of physical drivers culminating in a single-tree budburst model based on foliar temperature.\nWe use a novel remote sensing approach, combined with on-site meteorological measurements, to demonstrate important intra-canopy differences between air and foliar temperature. We mounted a thermal infrared camera within an old-growth canopy at the H.J. Andrews LTER forest and imaged an 8m by 10.6m section of a Douglas-fir crown. Sampling one image per minute, approximately 30,000 thermal infrared images were collected over a one-month period to approximate foliar temperature before, during and after budburst. Using time-lapse photography in the visible spectrum, we documented budburst at fifteen-minute intervals with eight cameras stratified across the thermal infrared camera’s field of view. Within the imaged tree’s crown, we installed a pyranometer, 2D sonic anemometer and fan-aspirated thermohygrometer and collected 3,000 measurements of net shortwave radiation, wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. We documented a difference of several days in the timing of budburst across both vertical and horizontal gradients. We also observed clear spatial and temporal foliar temperature gradients. In addition to exploring physical drivers of budburst, this remote sensing approach provides insight into intra-canopy structural complexity and opportunities to advance our understanding of vegetation-­atmospheric interactions.",

Gravity gradient is a derivative of gravity acceleration, due to the high order feature of gravity gradient, it is more sensitive to short wave component, and can reflect the details of the source so that the gravity gradient measurement has wide applications in geophysical science, resource exploration, and inertial navigation. Airborne gravity gradient measurement uses the plane or ship as the platform, and it is efficient and high precision. In this paper, We compared the gravity and gravity gradient measurement, and analyzed the advantages of the gravity gradient measurement compared with gravity measurement. The airborne gravity gradient measurement system and the inertial stabilization platform were discussed. By setting a goal sensitivity of the gravity gradient measurement being 1 E/√Hz, the key factors of the stabilized platform, namely the pointing accuracy, pointing stability, and gyroscope random drift, are 0.5°, 0.01°/hr/√Hz, and 0.01°/hr respectively. Compared with the airborne gravity measurement whose goal sensitivity is 1mGal/√Hz, the requirements of moving-based gravity gradient measurement on the inertial stabilization platform is significantly lower and hence easy to realize, and the major reason is the differential measurement mode being used.",

On the fast slipping Gofar transform fault on the East Pacific Rise (EPR), Mw ~6.0 earthquakes occur every ~5 years and repeatedly rupture the same asperities (fault patches), suggesting that the intervening fault segments (rupture barriers) stop the propagation of the largest earthquakes. In 2008, an ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) deployment captured the end of a seismic cycle on Gofar transform fault [McGuire et al., 2012]. We determine stress drop for earthquakes recorded during this experiment to investigate how the source properties of moderate sized earthquakes (3.0 < Mw < 5.5) differ between the rupture patch and rupture barrier fault segments. The OBS experiment on Gofar transform fault recorded an extensive foreshock sequence localized within a 10 km rupture barrier, the Mw 6.0 mainshock and its aftershocks that occurred in a ~10 km rupture patch, and an earthquake swarm that was located in a second rupture barrier adjacent to the ridge-transform intersection. Using waveforms recorded with a sample rate of 50 Hz on the OBS accelerometers, we calculate stress drop using the Madariaga [1976] circular crack model, with the corner frequency derived from an empirical Green’s function (EGF) method, and seismic moment obtained by fitting an omega-squared source model to the low frequency amplitude of individual event spectra. Results for ~300 earthquakes in the foreshock, aftershock, and swarm zones have a range of stress drops from 0.2 to 50 MPa. Values for the best constrained 10% of earthquakes show a weighted average stress drop in the aftershock zone that is more than twice the weighted average stress drop in the foreshock zone (3.5 MPa and 1.1 MPa, respectively). These variations in earthquake stress drop reflect systematic differences in along strike fault zone properties between rupture patches and rupture barriers on Gofar transform fault.",

Both N and S deposition can affect plant growth, decomposition, and nitrous oxide production, with sometimes synergistic and sometimes contradictory responses; yet their separate effects are rarely isolated and their interactive biogeochemical impacts are often overlooked. For example, S deposition and consequent acidification and mortality may negate stimulation of plant growth induced by N deposition; decomposition can be slowed by both N and S deposition, though through different mechanisms; and N2O production may be stimulated directly by N and indirectly by S amendments. Recent advances in conceptual models and whole-ecosystem experiments provide novel means for disentangling the impacts of N and S in terrestrial ecosystems. Results from a new whole-ecosystem N x S- addition experiment will be presented in detail, examining differential response of tree and soil carbon storage to N and S additions. These results combine with observations from a broad array of long-term N addition studies, atmospheric deposition gradients, stable isotope tracer studies, and model analyses to inform the magnitude, controls, and stability of ecosystem C storage in response to N and S addition.",

A Regional-scale Observing System Simulattion Experiment (OSSE ) has been conducted over Europe to determine the impact of S5-precursor carbon monoxide total column future observations on tropospheric composition forecasting and analysis. This OSSE study involves two independant CTM models which is a considerable advantage for the study, since it guarantees that the OSSE results will not be overly optimistic results and the OSSE will more realistically simulate an assimilation of real observations. The nature run which consitute the true composition atmospheric state is simulated by LOTOS-EUROS model combined with the global TM5 chemistry-transport model. The synthetic S5-p CO total column measurements and their error characterisitcs are derived from the nature run data and generated by KNMI and FMI teams using a state-of-the-art retrieval algorithm involved in TROPOMI development. The control run in which we assimilate the CO measurements is MOCAGE model. Interestingly, the OSSE results show substantial benefit from CO data assimilation especially in the boundary layer on both the forecast and analysis, and demenstrated that a high-spatial resolution and high-quality measurements of S5 CO total column could potentially constrain the concentration in the atmospheric boundar layer.",

            "abstract": "The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Mw 7.9) initiated within the southern part of the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault that is the middle-northern segment of the Central Longmen Shan fault zone, eastern Tibet Plateau. The earthquake rupture propagated unilaterally to the northeast over a distance of ~300 km and was accompanied by sinistral-thrust slip within the fault zone. However, the kinematics of the termination of the rupture on its two ends remains poorly constrained. Although surface rupture terminated near Kuangpingzi village in the northeast, the aftershock distribution suggests that the rupture may extend at depth to northeast of Qingchuan along a NE-trending zone. Our field observations suggest that the aftershock zone is likely in accordance with a NE-trending linear active structure at surface. Our field work also shows that the Qingchuan fault did not rupture during the Wenchuan earthquake. Detailed investigations show that the aftershock distribution belt at the northern end stopped at an area between the Qingchuan fault and the North-Qingchuan fault where these two faults bound a 10-to-20-km-wide mountain block. The Qingchuan fault, the North-Qingchuan fault and the block between, which are called as oblique cross-structures, have a trend (E to NEE strike) different from the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault. These pre-existing cross-structures may act as a persistent structural barrier that halt fault propagation. The NEE-striking pre-existing structures appear to be less likely to produce strong magnitude events. Along them, no surface evidence for late Quaternary faulting has been found thus far and historical seismicity shows small events. At the surface, the southern-most part of the Wenchuan earthquake rupture zone is marked by a NE-trending, 50-cm-high uplift near the intersection between the southern segment and the middle-northern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone. The intersection between these two fault segments is a Qionglai Shan mountain block that trends northerly and is bounded by faults. The Qionglai Shan block may have acted to arrest spread of the rupture to the southwest onto the adjacent southern segment of the Longmen Shan fault zone. The initiation and propagation of rupture are all at fault tips, which means the entire Yingxiu-Beichuan fault ruptured during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Nitrate is one of the major ions found in polar and alpine snow. The oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate offers unique potential for examining the oxidation chemistry of past atmospheres. Additionally, nitrogen isotope ratios may contain information abut the contribution of the nitrogen oxide precursors (NOx = NO + NO2) to atmospheric nitrate from different sources (e.g., fossil fuel combustion, biomass burning, soil microbial emissions, lightning and stratospheric injection). Nitrate in snow, however, is sensitive to post-depositional processing and isotopic alteration, thereby obscuring the atmospheric record ultimately archived in an ice core. At sites with very low snow accumulation rates (such as East Antarctica), nitrate is particularly vulnerable to photolytic loss due to long residence times near the surface. However, under higher accumulation regimes (such as Summit, Greenland), previous work has shown that loss can be more limited and nitrate isotopic composition preserved. Here we present results from a two-part study assessing the modern and paleo isotopic composition of nitrate in West Antarctica. We present seasonally-resolved snowpit and shallow core records from 7 West Antarctic sites which span a range of accumulation rates in order to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of deposited nitrate and how preservation varies with snowfall. This work is requisite to an accurate interpretation of a new nitrate isotopic record from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide deep ice core, from which we show decadal- to centennial-scale measurements since the last glacial stage.",

Insights from GOAmazon datasets will fill gaps in our understanding, ultimately improving constraints in tropical rain forest climate model parameterizations. As part of GOAmazon, the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) has been collecting a unique set of observations near Manacapuru, Brazil, a site known to experience both the pristine condition of its locale as well as, at times, the effects of the Manaus, Brazil, mega city pollution plume. In order to understand the effects of anthropogenic aerosol on clouds, radiative balance and climate, documentation of cloud and precipitation properties in the absence and presence of the Manaus plume is a necessary complement to the aerosol measurements collected during the campaign. The AMF is uniquely equipped to capture the most complete and continuous record of cloud and precipitation column properties using the UHF (915 MHz) ARM zenith radar (UAZR) and vertically pointing W-Band (95 GHz) ARM Cloud Radar (WACR). Together, these radars provide multiple methods (e.g., moment-based, dual-frequency, and Doppler spectral techniques) to retrieve properties of the cloud field that may be influenced by aerosols. This includes drop size distribution, dynamical and microphysical properties (e.g., vertical air motion, latent heat retrievals), and associated uncertainties. Additional quality assurance is available from independent rain gauge and column platforms. Here, we merge data from the UAZR and WACR (WACR-ARSCL VAP) radars, along with ARM Sounding observations and optical parsivel measurement constraints, to present a first look at select convective and stratiform events, their precipitation properties and statistical profile characterization.",

            "abstract": "NASA Goddard is developing an integrated-path, differential absorption (IPDA) lidar approach to measure atmospheric CO2 concentrations from space as a candidate for NASA’s ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons) mission. The approach uses pulsed lasers to measure both CO2 and O2 absorption simultaneously in the vertical path to the surface at a number of wavelengths across a CO2 line at 1572.335 nm and an O2 line doublet near 764.7 nm. Measurements of time-resolved laser backscatter profiles from the atmosphere allow the technique to estimate column CO2 and O2 number density and range to cloud tops in addition to those to the ground. This allows retrievals of CO2 column above clouds and cloud top pressure, and all-sky measurement capability from space. This additional information can be used to evaluate atmospheric transport processes and other remote sensing carbon data in the free atmosphere, improve carbon data assimilation in models and help global and regional carbon flux estimates.\nWe show some preliminary results of this capability using airborne lidar measurements from the summers of 2011 and 2014 ASCENDS science campaigns. These show simultaneous retrievals of CO2 and O2 column densities for laser returns from low-level marine stratus clouds in the west coast of California. This demonstrates the supplemental capability of the future space carbon mission to measure CO2 above clouds, which is valuable particularly for the areas with persistent cloud covers, e.g, tropical ITCZ, west coasts of continents with marine layered clouds and southern ocean with highest occurrence of low-level clouds, where underneath carbon cycles are active but passive remote sensing techniques using the reflected short wave sunlight are unable to measure accurately due to cloud scattering effect. We exercise cloud top pressure retrieval from O2 absorption measurements during the flights over the low-level marine stratus cloud decks, which is one of fundamental parameters related to cloud radiative forcing and their feedback to global warming. These retrievals are evaluated with those from in-situ measured during the campaigns.",

            "abstract": "Ocean circulation modeling in near-shore regions can be accomplished by nesting a high-resolution model in fields obtained from a global or basin-scale operational forecast model; however, the accuracy obtained using this strategy can be limited by coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the operational forecast models. The objective of this study was to investigate nesting of a sub-mesoscale model for near-shore circulation in output fields from an operational forecast model in order to determine both the appropriate boundary condition type, as well as the spatial and temporal sampling requirements, for boundary- and initial-condition specification. A high resolution (~50 m) Delft3D model for the San Diego Bay region for a four-day period in June 2014 is the focus of this study. Boundary and initial condition data is obtained via nesting in the output from the Southern California (SOCAL) regional Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM), with ~3.5 km spatial resolution and three-hour temporal sampling, produced daily by the Naval Oceanographic Office. To assess the impact of different nesting approaches, the Delft3D model results are compared to contemporaneous data for velocity, sea surface heights, temperature, and salinity in the region and also to the low-resolution forecast fields. Results show that the fidelity and consistency of the nested model depend on boundary-condition type, as well as details of the boundary-condition specification, and on the turbulence closure implementation. Results also exhibit sensitivity to bathymetry differences between the low- and high-resolution models; offshore, bathymetry such as ETOPO2 (with 2-minute spatial resolution) is sufficient, but near the shore a higher resolution bathymetry, such as the 1-arc-second Southern California Coastal Relief Model v.2, is required. The results demonstrate the ability to nest high-resolution models within operational forecasts to yield consistent circulation predictions for near-shore regions at higher spatial and temporal resolution than currently available from regional or basin-scale operational models.",

            "abstract": "A magnetic substorm is the result of an explosive release of energy on the night-side magnetosphere due to the coupling of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) with the Earth’s magnetic field resulting in a storage of energy in the night side magnetosphere. The consequential auroral substorm is characterized by a rapid brightening and poleward expansion of the aurora following the release of energy in the night-side magnetosphere. Two predominant hypotheses exist which predict the sequence of events leading to substorm onset and the physical mechanism responsible for triggering this onset, the near-Earth neutral line (NENL) and current disruption models (CD). The NENL model suggest that onset is the result of magnetic reconnection between 10-20 Earth radii in the magnetotail. The CD model suggests onset is the result plasma instabilities forming inside of 10 Earth radii. This study examines a newer model presented by Nishimura et al. (2010, JGR), which suggests that enhanced earthward plasma flows from the distant magnetotail to the near-Earth region lead to sub-storm onset, which is manifested in the aurora by a poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and equatorward motion of a North-South auroral feature. The purpose of this study is to determine and identify the poleward-most and equatorward-most arcs, as well as the morphology of the aurora in order to develop a more complete picture of the auroral substorm and ultimately test the three substorm models described above. Preliminary results demonstrate that equatorward motion of the onset arc during the growth phase is typical and that no distinct North-South arcs exist during the growth phase. Future research will include characterizing the intensity and tracking the brightness of the arcs comparatively as well as the motion within the arc.",

The overpressure field calculated by fluid flow modeling within a reservoir confined by two fault zones in the vicinity of the Kimberlina injection well is input to induced earthquake simulations carried out using the code RSQSim (Dieterich and Richards-Dinger, Seismol. Res. Let., 2012). Velocity and attenuation structures developed using geological data for the reservoir overburden and underburden are used for numerical wave propagation modeling to calculate surface ground motion time series produced by the simulated microseismic events. We then invert the time series data using a fat-ray double-difference tomography method to locate the events, and compare the results with the known locations. The tomography method is applied to time series calculated for different surface recording network configurations to study the resulting variations in event locations uncertainties, and to assess an optimal network for cost-effective, long-term monitoring for CCUS.",

Under changing climate a large portion of soil C could potentially transfer back to the atmosphere as CO₂, pushing the earth system into a positive feedback loop between increasing soil CO₂ emissions and rising temperatures. We rely on models to estimate soil responses to climate change; however recent global carbon cycle model intercomparisons have shown poor model performance in capturing C cycle processes in the soil. To gain more confidence in the range of potential soil C emissions over a long-term period of climate change it is necessary to match the model outputs with the observations. Studies have shown that data-model fusion techniques can improve conventional models’ spatial representation of observed soil carbon, and that adding an explicit microbial component further improves model performance. The soil carbon datasets used to inform conventional models often do not contribute much information to model parameters associated with processes happening on a short time scale, such as turnover rates of fast organic matter, rates of enzyme production and loss, activation energy of microbial uptake of dissolved organic carbon, etc. In this study we (1) inform conventional and microbial soil models with observed time series of soil respiration and estimate the optimum parameter sets for various plant functional types, (2) explore the drivers of variability in the optimum parameters across plant functional types, and (3) investigate whether including explicit microbial dynamics improves model performance compared to that of a conventional model.",

            "abstract": "Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) and its oxidation products were measured on the board of the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) Amundsen and above melt ponds in the Arctic during July 2014 in the context of the NETCARE study which seeks to understand the effect of DMS and its oxidation products with respect to aerosol nucleation, as well as its effect on cloud and precipitation properties. The objective of this study is to quantify the role of DMS in aerosol growth and activation in the Arctic atmosphere. Atmospheric DMS samples were collected from different altitudes, from 200 to 9500 feet, aboard the POLAR6 aircraft expedition to determine variations in the DMS concentration and a comparison was made to shipboard DMS measurements and its effects on aerosol size fractions. The chemical and isotopic composition of sulfate aerosol size fractions was studied. Sulfur isotope ratios (34S/32S) offer a way to determine the oceanic DMS contribution to aerosol growth. The results are expected to address the contribution of anthropogenic as well as biogenic sources of aerosols to the growth of the different aerosol size fractions. In addition, aerosol sulfate concentrations were measured at the same time within precipitation and fogs to compare with the characteristics of aerosols in each size fraction with the characteristics of the sulfate in each medium. This measurement is expected to explain the contribution of DMS oxidation in aerosol activation in the Arctic summer. Preliminary results from the measurement campaign for DMS and its oxidation products in air, fog and precipitation will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) project, in association with the NASA Langley Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC), has this year adapted its original production software to generate near-real time (NRT) cloud-motion winds as well as radiance imagery from all nine MISR cameras. These products are made publicly available at the ASDC with a latency of less than 3 hours. Launched aboard the sun-synchronous Terra platform in 1999, the MISR instrument continues to acquire near-global, 275 m resolution, multi-angle imagery. During a single 7 minute overpass of any given area, MISR retrieves the stereoscopic height and horizontal motion of clouds from the multi-angle data, yielding meso-scale near-instantaneous wind vectors. The ongoing 15-year record of MISR height-resolved winds at 17.6 km resolution has been validated against independent data sources. Low-level winds dominate the sampling, and agree to within ±3 ms-1 of collocated GOES and other observations. Low-level wind observations are of particular interest to weather forecasting, where there is a dearth of observations suitable for assimilation, in part due to reliability concerns associated with winds whose heights are assigned by the infrared brightness temperature technique. MISR cloud heights, on the other hand, are generated from stereophotogrammetric pattern matching of visible radiances. MISR winds also address data gaps in the latitude bands between geostationary satellite coverage and polar orbiting instruments that obtain winds from multiple overpasses (e.g. MODIS). Observational impact studies conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and by the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) have both demonstrated forecast improvements when assimilating MISR winds. An impact assessment using the GEOS-5 system is currently in progress. To benefit air quality forecasts, the MISR project is currently investigating the feasibility of generating near-real time aerosol products.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in sensor technology have enabled Lacoste and Romberg type relative gravity meters to improve in accuracy to the point where other non-sensor related sources of error serve to limit the overall accuracy of the system. One of these sources of error is derived from the inability of the platform, in which the sensor is mounted, to keep the sensor perfectly level during survey flight. Off level errors occur when the aircraft is unable to maintain straight and level flight along a survey line. The levelling platform of a typical Lacoste and Romberg type dynamic gravity meter utilizes a complex feedback loop involving both accelerometers and gyroscopes with an output connected to torque motors mounted to the platform to sense an off level situation and correct for it.\nThe current system is limited by an inability of the platform to distinguish between an acceleration of the platform due to a change in heading, altitude or speed of the aircraft and a true change in the local gravity vertical. Both of these situations cause the platform to tilt in reponse however the aircraft acceleration creates an error in the gravity measurement. These off level errors can be corrected for to a limited degree depending on the algorithm used and the size and duration of the causal acceleration.\nHigh precision GPS now provides accurate real time position information which can be used to determine if an accleration is a real level change or due to an anomalous acceleration. The correct implementation of the GPS position can significantly improve the accuracy of the platform levelling including keeping the platform level during course reversals or drape flying during a survey. This can typically improve the quality of the gravity data before any processing corrections. The enhanced platform also reduces the time taken to stabilize the platform at the beginning of a survey line therefore improving the efficiency of the data collection. This paper discusses the method and results of tests of the new GPS aided platform system developed by Dynamic Gravity Systems",

            "abstract": "The USDA-ARS database on soil saturated hydraulic conductivities included around 1000 datasets and was previously analyzed to estimate quartiles of Ksat statistical distributions for each of common 12 textural classes subdivided into two subclasses by soil porosity. Inspection of the database sources showed that samples of different sizes were used in different works. Soil hydraulic conductivity is a scale-dependent property, and can increase by half to one order of magnitude when support area increases one order of magnitude in laboratory conditions. The objective of this work was to reanalyze this database accounting for differences in sizes and to develop pedotransfer relationships for the dominant support area should such area be found. The range of support area from 20 cm2 to 50 cm2 was well represented in the database and was selected to analyze statistical distributions of Ksat for each of 24 abovementioned subclasses. The distributions were close to lognormal, and an excellent dependence of both geometric means and standard deviations on the average clay content of subclasses was established. The new table of Ksat values for textural classes in two porosity ranges provides substantially less variability in estimates. Decoupling scale effects and natural variability allows one to focus on derivation of scaling relationships to obtain Ksat estimates appropriate for the scale of a specific soil hydrology project.",

            "abstract": "Sudden enhancement of the plasma pressure in the near-Earth plasma sheet is one of the common manifestations of the substorms, and is thought to play an important role in relevant disturbances in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. On 1 March 2008 four of the THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) probes observed the sudden enhancement of the plasma pressure around 15:40 UT. The four probes were almost aligned along the Sun-Earth line, which was suitable for investigating spatial-temporal evolution of the near-Earth plasma sheet around the substorm onset. The four probes were located off the equatorial plane, according to a magnetic field model. The plasma pressure suddenly increased at the inner most probe first (at ~7.2 Re), followed by the outer probes (at ~7.5, ~8.3, and ~10.4 Re), that could be seen as a tailward propagation (or retreat) of high-pressure region (HPR). After comparing with results of a global magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation, we found that only the tailward propagation of the HPR could be seen at off-equator. Near the equatorial plane, the HPR propagates earthward from the magnetotail region, then it retreats tailward. In the course of the tailward propagation, the HPR also propagates away from the equatorial plane. As a consequence, the inner most probe observed the pressure enhancement first, followed by the outer probes. The propagation of the HPR in the ZGSM direction is understood to be a combination of the convergence of the plasma flow (the divergence of bulk velocity along the ZGSM axis), and the pressure gradient force.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of Fe3+ between silicate melts and minerals is a key parameter to understand magmatic processes, as it is directly linked to oxygen fugacity (fO2). fO2 is, a priori, not a constant during magmatic processes, and its evolution depends on the compatibility of Fe3+. We have experimentally determined the partition coefficients of Fe3+ between augite, pigeonite, and silicate melt, and use them to constrain the fO2of the martian mantle and of differentiated martian basalts.\nA series of experiments on various martian basaltic compositions were performed under controlled fO2 in one-atmosphere gas-mixing furnaces. Fe3+/Fetotal ratios in silicate melts and pyroxenes were determined using synchrotron Fe K-edge XANES on the 13 IDE beamline at APS (Argonne). Fe3+ mineral/melt partition coefficients (DFe3+) for augite and pigeonite were obtained with a relative uncertainty of 10-15 %. Both are constant over a wide range of oxygen fugacity (FMQ-2.5 to FMQ+2.0). DFe3+ for augite and pigeonite are broadly consistent with previous data by [1], but DFe3+ for augite is significantly higher (by a factor of 2) than the indirect determinations of [2]. Since augites in [2] are extremely poor in iron compared to ours (0.18 wt% vs 13 wt% FeO), this strongly suggests that DFe3+ varies with Mg#, indicating that Fe3+is more compatible than previously thought in terrestrial mantle pyroxenes (3 wt% FeO) as well.\nCrystallization paths for shergottite parental melts have been calculated using the MELTS software, combined with our partition coefficients. fO2 in the residual melts is calculated from the models of [3] and [4]. It stays relatively constant at high temperatures, but increases very strongly during the latest stages of crystallization. These results explain the large range of fO2 determined in enriched shergottites. In order to estimate the fO2 of the martian mantle, only the highest temperature phases in the most primitive martian samples should be used. The most primitive shergottites record a mantle fO2 around FMQ-2.5, consistent with the lowest fO2estimated for surface basalts [5].\n[1] McCanta et al.

Understanding the sources of this sediment is a necessary component of management plans and policies aimed at reducing sediment inputs. Because of the time intensive framework of most sediment-source studies, spatial interpretations are often limited to the study watershed. To address sediment sources on a larger scale, the U.S. Geological Survey- National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program as part of the Midwest Stream Quality Assessment, used fallout radioisotopes (excess lead-210, cesium-137, and beryllium-7) to determine the source ((upland (surface runoff) or channel derived)) of fine-grained (<0.063 mm) bed sediment in the Cornbelt Ecoregion. The study area encompassed parts of 11 states in the Midwestern United States covering 648,239 km2 of the United States. Sampling occurred in July and August of 2013, in conjunction with water chemistry, aquatic-habitat and ecological community assessments. Ninety-nine watersheds were sampled, the majority of which were predominately agricultural, with contributing areas ranging between 6.7 to 5,893 km2. Using the ratio of beryllium-7 to excess lead-210, the percent of upland to channel-derived sediment was estimated. Results indicate that sediment sources vary among the 99 watersheds. Channel sediment is an important source presumably from bank erosion.  Upland sediment was not the dominant source of sediment in many of these agricultural watersheds.  Suspended-sediment samples collected over an 8-week period for 3 watersheds also show that the percent of upland versus channel sediment varies spatially and temporally.",

            "abstract": "Soil carbon (C) dynamics present one of the largest sources of uncertainty in global C cycle models, with tropical forest soils containing some of the largest terrestrial C stocks. Drastic changes in soil C storage and loss are likely to occur if global change alters plant net primary production (NPP) and/or nutrient availability in these ecosystems. We assessed the effects of litter removal and addition, as well as fertilization with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and/or potassium (K), on soil C stocks in a tropical seasonal forest in Panama after ten and sixteen years, respectively. We used a density fractionation scheme to assess manipulation effects on rapidly and slowly cycling pools of C. Soil samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons from 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths in 15- 45x45 m plots with litter removal, 2x litter addition, and control (n=5), and from 32- 40x40 m fertilization plots with factorial additions of N, P, and K. We hypothesized that litter addition would increase all soil C fractions, but that the magnitude of the effect on rapidly-cycling C would be dampened by a fertilization effect.\nResults for the dry season show that the \"free light\" C fraction, or rapidly cycling soil C pool, was significantly different among the three litter treatments, comprising 5.1 ± 0.9 % of total soil mass in the litter addition plots, 2.7 ± 0.3 % in control plots, and 1.0 ± 0.1 % in litter removal plots at the 0-5cm depth (means ± one standard error, p < 0.05). Bulk soil C results are similar to observed changes in the rapidly cycling C pool for the litter addition and removal. Fertilization treatments on average diminished this C pool size relative to control plots, although there was substantial variability among fertilization treatments. In particular, addition of N and P together did not significantly alter rapidly cycling C pool sizes (4.1 ± 1.2 % of total soil mass) relative to controls (3.5 ± 0.4 %), whereas addition of P alone resulted in significantly smaller rapidly cycling C pools (1.8 ± 0.4 %, p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that changes in tropical forest NPP have high potential to alter the storage and cycling of C in C-rich soils, and that secondary fertilization effects are likely.",

Analysis of causative VLF radio atmospherics of 52 LOREs reveals that >76% exhibit detectable precursor radiation just prior to (typically within 4 msec of) the causative lightning return stroke. In contrast, such radiation is detected for <22% of 52 regular recovery early events, and <21% of 142 National Lightning Detection Network recorded discharges (peak current magnitude >50 kA, within 1500 km of the nearest receiver). By comparison with electric field measurements and lightning mapping array data, preliminary breakdown in natural, negative cloud-to-ground flashes is shown to produce VLF precursor radiation similar in most observable respects to those associated with VLF scattering events. It is thereby inferred that strong preliminary breakdown (and fast stepped leaders) are predominant features of discharges capable of producing long lasting D-region disturbances.",

            "abstract": "The primary objectives of the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) and GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) missions are to characterize the mean and time variable components of Earth’s gravity field. The two GRACE satellites and the GOCE satellite provide high accuracy accelerometer data which is useful for a variety of other applications including thermosphere density and wind modeling and the study of variations in Earth’s neutral density. Solar radiation pressure (SRP) modeling is important to these applications. During penumbra transitions, SRP is influenced by the passage of solar radiation through Earth’s lower atmosphere. We have developed a highly physical SRP model to improve the accuracy of SRP force modeling during penumbra transitions. This high fidelity model is called: SRP with Oblateness and Lower Atmospheric Absorption, Refraction, and Scattering, or SOLAARS. SOLAARS uses a finite element approach which models the solar radiation field at each spacecraft location using a finite number of light rays. The spectral composition, angle of incidence, and solar flux associated with each light ray is computed based on physical modeling of atmospheric refraction and wavelength dependent extinction (absorption and scattering) processes. We will present new GRACE and GOCE penumbra SRP modeling results and investigate the influence of recently added modeling of atmospheric extinction processes. Additionally, we will illustrate the influence of atmospheric conditions on penumbra SRP and how selection of these variables can affect agreement of SOLAARS results with accelerometer data.",

            "abstract": "Experimental simulations of earthquake-like conditions reveal a significant decrease in effective steady-state friction during dynamic slip. Unlike static friction, the effective dynamic friction coefficient has a clear dependence on the applied normal stress, typical of lubrication. In the case of melt generation it has been hypothesized that the steady state represents a balance between melt generation, melt extrusion, and fault surface microtopography. We have undertaken an investigation of a pseudotachylyte-bearing fault zone to determine if similar relationships between fault-normal stress and fault zone geometry result from natural earthquake slip.\nThe study area is a single fault strand with ~60 cm of slip within the Gole Larghe Fault Zone, Italy. At the outcrop scale, this strand is distinctly wavy with contractional and extensional bends as well as relatively straight (neutral) sections. In order to quantify the pseudotachylyte geometry and microroughness of fault surfaces we collected cm-scale cores from locations along the fault that we infer to have experienced different fault-normal stress during slip. The internal geometry of the cores was imaged with ~0.03 mm resolution using high-resolution x-ray computed tomography (CT). The pseudotachylyte-bearing fault zone was then segmented from the CT volume by combining manual interpretation with gradient-based edge detection. Finally, the microroughness of the fault zone surfaces (contact between pseudotachylyte and wall rock) was quantified using Fourier spectral analysis.\nBoth the geometry and microroughness of the fault zone vary with inferred fault-normal stress. Regions of low stress have thicker pseudotachylyte (up to 5.080 mm) and are rougher at short wavelengths (0.01 mm). Regions of high stress are thinner (as low as 0.256 mm) and are smoother at short wavelengths. At wavelengths near the grain-scale (1 mm) spectral power is poorly correlated with stress, indicating that the scaling of roughness (beta value) also varies with fault normal stress. We interpret these patterns of roughness as evidence of competing processes of roughening and smoothing associated with melting during earthquake slip.",

Previous studies only estimate landslide susceptibility because enough landslide inventory was usually unavailable. This study collects the spot image of ten events from 1994 to 2009 of WuShe reservoir catchment in central Taiwan. All of landslide inventories were manual interpretation from spot image. The recent and expanded landslide inventory due to the event was identified from the landslide inventory of pre and post event. The recent landslide inventory was used to conduct landslide hazard evaluation.\nThis study follows the landslide hazard analysis framework of CNR-IRPR in Italy, which had demonstrated how the spatial probability, temporal probability and size probability of each slope-unit were calculated. Landslide hazard in WuShe reservoir catchment was obtained following the procedure. The preliminary validated result shows that the prediction of landslide hazard in high landslide hazard region was better, when compared with landslide susceptibility.\nHowever, the reliability of temporal probability and size probability were related to the number of landslide inventories. When no landslide was recorded, or lack of suitable landslide inventory, would lead to the incorrect analysis of landslide hazard. The event based spatial probability was affected by rainfall distribution, but the rainfall distribution of different typhoons were usually highly variable. Next phase of this study would attempt to discuss these issues and develop a suitable framework for landslide hazard analysis in Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) records from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) are rare. Most sediment records are located on the edge of the EEP, while paleocoral records from the central EEP, are intermittent records of ENSO variability. We present a continuous 2000-year lacustrine record of ENSO variability from the center of the EEP. Genovesa crater lake is a hypersaline crater lake located on the arid island of Genovesa in the northern Galapagos archipelago. A deciduous Bursera graveolens forest dominates the island’s vegetation and the lake is rimmed by Rhizophora mangle, which is not precipitation dependent. Rainfall is limited to the brief wet season or El Niño events, making the lake an ideal site to record precipitation and ENSO variability. Variations in sediment grayscale intensity were subjected to wavelet analysis to detect periods of significant ENSO periodicity (4-8-years). Bursera and Rhizophora pollen percentages were used to compare plant productivity with ENSO variability. Sediment grayscale variability and peaks in Bursera percent abundance were consistent with historical records of ENSO. On longer timescales, these proxies suggest that ENSO was relatively reduced within the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). Peaks in Bursera percentages, however, become more pronounced than elsewhere in the record. Overall ENSO activity may have been reduced during the MCA, but large droughts and floods appear to have been a feature of the climate. The Little Ice Age (LIA) has been described as a period of increased ENSO activity and strength. However, ENSO periodicity in our record is weak throughout this period, compared with the period after the LIA (1850 CE to modern). Bursera percentages are lower overall during the LIA (1550-1850 CE) than in the MCA, potentially outlining background arid conditions. New geochemical data from the Galapagos suggests a potential dry La Niña-like period during the LIA (Thompson et al. in review, Conroy et al. in review). A persistent La Niña-like period would reduce Bursera productivity and account for the reduction in a significant ENSO periodicity. Our data highlight the probable variability in ENSO within the EEP over the last 2000 years and indicate that the MCA may be a stronger climatic feature than the LIA in this region.",

Investigation of relationships between a Vermont (USA) eastern hemlock δ¹³C (1849-2010) chronology and local and regional climate variables, as well as a regional sulfur dioxide time series revealed the decoupling of δ¹³C from significant climate drivers such as May-August maximum temperature (r=0.50, p<0.01) and, raise the possibility that this decoupling can be attributed to foliar and soil leaching of calcium due to acidic deposition since the 1960s. Further, investigation of derived photosynthetic isotope discrimination (Δ¹³C) time series showed an overall decreasing trend in Δ¹³C in response to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (ca), but with a slight rise in Δ¹³C in the last decade. Comparison of time series of leaf intercellular CO2 concentration (ci), ci/ca, and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) showed homeostatic maintenance of ci levels against ca until 1965 and rising iWUE. Then, ci increased proportional (1965-2000) and later at the same rate as ca (2001-2010) and iWUE leveled off indicating a potential loss of sensitivity to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This more recent passive response may be an indication of a loss of homeostatic maintenance of stomatal control and/or may be linked to changing climate in the region (e.g., wetter conditions).",

Two-dimensional (2D) digital soil mapping provides a general assessment of soil characteristics across a sampled landscape, but lacks the ability to predict soil properties with depth. The utilization of mass-preserving spline functions enable the extrapolation of soil properties with depth, extending predictive functions to three-dimensions (3D). The present study was completed in the Marshall Gulch (MG) catchment, located in the Santa Catalina Mountains, 30 km northwest of Tucson, Arizona, as part of the Santa Catalina-Jemez Mountains Critical Zone Observatory. Twenty-four soil pits were excavated and described following standard procedures. Mass-preserving splines were used to extrapolate mass carbon (kg C m-2); percent clay, silt, and sand (%); sodium mass flux (kg Na m-2); and pH for 24 sampled soil pits in 1-cm depth increments. Saturated volumetric water content (θs) and volumetric water content at 10 kPa (θ10) were predicted using ROSETTA and established empirical relationships. The described profiles were all sampled to differing depths; to compensate for the unevenness of the profile descriptions, the soil depths were standardized from 0.0 to 1.0 and then split into five equal standard depth sections. A logit-transformation was used to normalize the target variables. Step-wise regressions were calculated using available environmental covariates to predict the properties of each variable across the catchment in each depth section, and interpolated model residuals added back to the predicted layers to generate the final soil maps. Logit-transformed R2 for the predictive functions varied widely, ranging from 0.20 to 0.79, with logit-transformed RMSE ranging from 0.15 to 2.77. The MG catchment was further classified into clusters with similar properties based on the environmental covariates, and representative depth functions for each target variable in each cluster calculated. Mass-preserving splines combined with stepwise regressions are an effective tool for predicting soil physical, chemical, and hydrological properties with depth, enhancing our understanding of the critical zone.",

From sea floor to summit, it’s the tallest mountain in the world. The high elevation, low air and light pollution, as well as dry weather year round make it the best location in the world for astronomy observations. The summit is home to 13 ground based telescope facilities. Like all alpine regions, it is an extremely fragile and unique ecosystem because of the harsh conditions and short growing seasons located at high altitudes. The summit is home to several federal and/or state protected species. It supports 11 species of arthropods found nowhere else on Earth. Most noted of these is the Wēkiu bug, whose habitat has been altered by the infrastructural development on the mountain. Arthropod habitat model development has highlighted gaps in climate information, for example, lack of climate precipitation data, snow data and reliable temperature data. Furthermore, in tropical regions, precipitation is the most variable climate component due to topography and local winds. The telescopes collect weather data for the purpose of knowing when it is dry and clear for astronomical observation. Although existing weather stations associated with the telescopes meet some weather and climate monitoring needs, it cannot address the full range of issues needed due to technological limitation and site design. Precipitation does not occur often and is likely to be in the form of snow or ice. Snow cover data has not been directly recorded despite astronomical recording of other meteorological data that began in the1960s. Therefore, the need to monitor the weather and climate in a long-term and well-calibrated way is critical for management of the ecosystems on the slopes of Maunakea. Long-term weather and climate monitoring stations are the primary building blocks for research partnerships, which encourage collaboration and ultimately lead to improved regional understanding of climate. The purpose of this project is to develop a climate monitoring strategy that will ultimately address the conservation, cultural, historic, and scientific values of high-elevation areas on Maunakea, as well as address needs of surrounding users in land management, agriculture, and sciences.",

Development included modularization for coupling to general circulation and Earth system models (ESMs) and the adoption of co-processor capable atmospheric chemistry solvers. This was done using an Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) interface that operates independently of GEOS-Chem scientific code to permit seamless transition from the GEOS-Chem stand-alone serial CTM to deployment as a coupled ESM module. In this manner, the continual stream of updates contributed by the CTM user community is automatically available for broader applications, which remain state-of-science and directly referenceable to the latest version of the standard GEOS-Chem CTM. These developments are now available as part of the standard version of the GEOS-Chem CTM. The system has been implemented as an atmospheric chemistry module within the NASA GEOS-5 ESM. The coupled GEOS-5/GEOS-Chem system was tested for weak and strong scalability and performance with a tropospheric oxidant-aerosol simulation. Results confirm that the GEOS-Chem chemical operator scales efficiently for any number of processes. Although inclusion of atmospheric chemistry in ESMs is computationally expensive, the excellent scalability of the chemical operator means that the relative cost goes down with increasing number of processes, making fine-scale resolution simulations possible.",

            "abstract": "We report the preliminary design of a fast vertical profiling autonomous underwater vehicle, called Clio, designed to cost-effectively improve the understanding of marine microorganism ecosystem dynamics on a global scale.\nThe insights into biogeochemical cycles to be gained from illuminating the relationships between ocean life and chemistry have led to establishment of the GEOTRACES program. The nutrient and trace element profiles generated by GEOTRACES will provide insight into what is happening biogeochemically, but not how it is happening, i.e., what biochemical pathways are active? Advances in sequencing technology and in situ preservation have made it possible to study the genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins and enzymes), metabolomics (lipids and other metabolites), and metallomics (metals), associated with marine microorganisms; however, these techniques require sample collection. To this end, Clio will carry two to four SUspended Particle Rosette (SUPR) multi-samplers to depths of 6000 m. Clio is being designed specifically to complement the GEOTRACES program—to operate simultaneously and independently of the wire-based sampling protocols developed for GEOTRACES. At each GEOTRACES ocean transect sampling station, Clio will be deployed from the ship, transit vertically to the seafloor, and then ascend to, and stop at up to 32 sampling depths, where it will filter up to 150 l of seawater per sample. Filtered samples for RNA will be administered a dose of preservative (RNALater) in situ.\nClio must efficiently hold station at multiple depths between the surface and 6000 m, but also move rapidly between sampling depths. It must be chemically clean and avoid disturbing the water column while sampling. Clio must be operationally friendly, requiring few personnel to operate, and have minimal impact on shipboard operations. We have selected a positively-buoyant thruster-driven design with a quasi-isopycnal construction. Our simulations indicate the vehicle can complete dives that mirror their GEOTRACES counterparts within the station time alloted. The simulation includes the effects of material/housing compressibility and thermal expansion, and employs a global average T/S profile from the Levitus 1982 climatology.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of spatiotemporal dynamics of heat transport and water flow in terrestrial environments is essential for understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Electrical resistance tomography has been increasingly well used for monitoring subsurface hydrological processes and estimating soil hydraulic properties through coupled hydrogeophysical inversion. However, electrical resistivity depends on a variety of factors such as temperature, which may limit the accuracy of hydrogeophysical inversion. The main objective of this study is to develop a hydrogeophysical inversion framework to enable the incorporation of nonisothermal processes into the hydrogeophysical inversion procedure, and use of this procedure to investigate the effect of hydrological controls on biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial environments.\nWe developed the coupled hydro-thermal-geophysical inversion approach, using the iTOUGH2 framework. In this framework, the heat transport and water flow are simultaneously modeled with TOUGH2 code, which effectively accounts for the multiphase, multi-component and nonisothermal flow in porous media. A flexible approach is used to incorporate petrophysical relationships and uncertainty to link soil moisture and temperature with the electrical resistivity. The developed approach was applied to both synthetic and field case studies. At the DOE subsurface biogeochemistry field site located near Rifle CO, seasonal snowmelt delivers a hydrological pulse to the system, which in turn influences the cycles of nitrogen, carbon and other critical elements. Using the new approach, we carried out numerical inversion of electrical resistance data collected along a 100 m transect at the Rifle site, and compared the results with field investigations of the soil, vadose zone, including the capillary fringe, and groundwater, as well as temperature and tensiometer measurements. Preliminary results show the importance of accounting for nonisothermal conditions to reliably interpret electrical resistance measurements and to determine hydraulic and thermal properties that influence biogeochemical cycles.",

An approach that succeeds at information dissemination may be ineffective or even counterproductive for improving institutional reputation, achieving behavior change, or fostering use-inspired research. Thus, the application of communications research cannot be one-size fits most. One role for the science communications professional is as a “navigator,” matching evidence-based communications practice with the goals and contexts of scientists.\nThe Nature Conservancy’s Science Impact Project establishes a continuing partnership between the organization’s science communication leadership and a select group of Conservancy scientists with strong interest in effective communication. Working closely together over a 30-month program, scientists gain grounding in communications research and practice, while communications professionals gain a thorough understanding of the scientists’ specific communication goals, opportunities, and research-appropriate questions. Program scientists are performing experiments at the intersection of conservation science and communications. Topics include: municipal decision making on green infrastructure, uptake of conservation innovations, and the effect of injecting new voices into frozen debates. Additional opportunities for active collaboration with communications researchers are emerging from the program’s first 3 years.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a powerful landscape scale disturbance agent in tundra ecosystems. Impacts on biophysical properties (e.g. albedo) and biogeochemical function (e.g. carbon flux) underscore the need to better quantify fire-climate linkages in tundra ecosystems as climate change accelerates at northern high latitudes. In this context, a critical question is “How does the functional linkage between climate and fire vary across spatial domains dominated by different vegetation types?”\nWe address this question with BLM-Alaska Fire Service area burned data (http://fire.ak.blm.gov/predsvcs/maps.php) used in conjunction with downscaled historical climate data from the Scenarios Network for Alaska Planning (http://www.snap.uaf.edu/data.php) to develop gradient boosting models of annual area burned in Alaska tundra ecosystems. The sparse historical fire records in the Arctic necessitate explicit quantification of model uncertainty associated with the development of statistical analyses. In this work, model uncertainty is depicted through the construction of separate models depicting fire-climate relationships for regions defined by the graminoid, shrub, and wetland tundra vegetation classes (Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map: http://www.geobotany.uaf.edu/cavm/). Non-linear relationships between annual area burned and climate variables are depicted with partial dependence functions.\nOur results show that vegetation-specific models result in different non-linear relationships between climate and fire. Precipitation variables generally had higher relative influence scores than temperature; however, differences between the magnitude of the scores were greater when models were built with monthly (versus seasonal) explanatory variables. Key threshold values for climate variables are identified. The impact of model uncertainty on forecasts of future fire activity was quantified using output from five different AR5/CMIP5 General Circulation Models. Model uncertainty corresponding to vegetation-specific functional linkages between climate and fire has a magnitude similar to that of GCM-based model uncertainty. Results of this work strongly suggest that future forecasts of fire activity must account for and quantify sources of uncertainty in order to provide useful information.",

            "abstract": "We study the origin and evolution of fine structures in electron distribution functions in the electron diffusion region (EDR) during anti-parallel magnetic reconnection. In the EDR, electron non-gyrotropic motion causes a variety of fine structures in electron distributions. Recently, Ng et al. 2011 and 2012 reported that striations in the electron distribution near the X-line are due to particle reflections. We have advanced the understanding of the formation mechanism of striations near the X-line by means of analytical analysis and particle tracing in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Based on an approximation that nonlinear terms are negligible in the EDR, we derive a formula for the separation of striations, and explain the triangular shape of the distribution. We also show that an electron distribution with striations in the horizontal (p_x) direction evolves within about 8 ion cyclotron oscillations into a fork-like structure exhibiting three branches in the vertical (p_y) direction. We show by theory and PIC simulation that the length of the EDR is proportional to p_s^2, where p_s is the separation of the outer branches. Away from the X-line toward the end of electron outflows, electron distribution functions show arcs, swirls, and rings. The arcs and swirls are caused by partial gyration of accelerated electrons around the normal magnetic field. Near the end of the EDR, rings are formed in electron distributions due to magnetization process of electrons. Predictions of various structures of the EDR electron distributions will enable identifications of EDR crossings at different locations based on satellite measurements.",

Despite their significance, quantitative assessment of snowdrifts’ impact on streamflow, groundwater, soil moisture and evapotranspiration at watershed scale has gone reported. It is not clear if the additional melt from snowdrifts late in the melt season is enough to have any appreciable impact on summer baseflow or if it is mostly lost back to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration loss. Using a linked a snow model (Isnobal) and a distributed hydrologic model (PIHM) in a snow-dominated watershed, we explore how water yield from the snowdrifts have varied hydrologic impacts from year to year. Our analysis suggests that melt water yield from snowdrifts amounts to less than 15% of the total melt from the watershed. However, after snow melt out at a reference snow pillow site, percentage of melt water from snowdrifts can be as large as 70% of the melt yield from the entire watershed. Inter-annual variations of the impacts suggest that fractional melt yield from drifts is generally larger in wetter years.",

            "abstract": "The Plio-Pleistocene period is marked by numerous changes in Earth’s climate and tectonics. The early Pliocene average global surface temperature of ~3° C was warmer than today and the sea level was high around 10-20 m, whereas the continents adjudicated its present day position. In this study we discussed about Indian monsoon variability during the Plio-Pleistocene. Numerous investigations were carried out over the last two decades to understand Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability and its relation to Himalayan tectonics. The ISM is a principal factor to the economy of the south Asian countries playing immense role in changing fauna and flora on land as well as socio-economic conditions of this region. The Arabian Sea is a natural laboratory to carry out paleoclimatic studies on marine sediments. In this study four Ocean Drilling Programme sediment cores were used from the northwestern Arabian Sea, Leg 117, Holes 722B, 731A (Owen Ridge) and 728B, 730A (Oman margin). The planktonic foraminiferal species abundances, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) wt.% and carbonate concentration (CaCO3) proxies were utilised to understand Plio-Pleistocene Indian monsoon variability. The relative abundances of Globigerina bulloides, Globigerinita glutinata and mixed layer species reveal changes in upwelling and mixed layer since the Pliocene. Our results demonstrate that intense upwelling occurred during 5 to ~3.7 Ma, 1.5Ma to Recent and an abrupt change was recorded around 0.1 Ma at all the Holes. The weakening of upwelling occurred from 3.5 Ma to ~1.5 Ma, hence we argue that this is due to Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. Mixed layer species show higher abundances from 2 Ma to 0.8 Ma. The TOC wt.% varies from 7.8% to 0.5% and productive increased many fold during 4 to 2 Ma. The results of TOC and CaCO3 are inversely correlated indicating role of carbonate dissolution.",

            "abstract": "With the imminent release of GPM it is essential for the hydrological user community to improve the spatial resolution of satellite precipitation products (SPPs), also retrospectively of historical time-series. Despite the growing number of applications, to date SPPs have two major weaknesses. Firstly, geosynchronous infrared (IR) SPPs, relying exclusively on cloud elevation/ IR temperature, fail to replicate ground rainfall rates especially for convective rainfall. Secondly, composite SPPs like TRMM include microwave and active radar to overcome this, but the coarse spatial resolution (0.25°) from infrequent orbital sampling often fails to: a) characterize precipitation patterns (especially extremes) in complex topography regions, and b) allow for gauge comparisons with adequate spatial support. This is problematic for satellite-gauge merging and subsequent hydrological modelling applications.\nWe therefore present a new re-calibration and downscaling routine that is applicable to 0.25°/ 3-hrly TRMM 3B42 and Level 3 GPM time-series to generate 1 km estimates. 16 years of instantaneous TRMM radar (TPR) images were evaluated against a unique dataset of over 100 10-min rain gauges from the tropical Andes (Colombia & Ecuador) to develop a spatially distributed error surface. Long-term statistics on occurrence frequency, convective/ stratiform fraction and extreme precipitation probability (Gamma & Generalized Pareto distributions) were computed from TPR at the 1 km scale as well as from TPR and 3B42 at the 0.25° scale. To downscale from 0.25° to 1 km a stochastic generator was used to restrict precipitation occurrence to a fraction of the 1 km pixels within the 0.25° gridcell at every time-step. Regression modelling established a relationship between probability distributions at the 0.25° scale and rainfall amounts were assigned to the retained 1 km pixels by quantile-matching to the gridcell. The approach inherently provides mass conservation of the downscaled pixels at the 0.25° gridcell scale. Validation was performed at 1 km pixel scale with synchronous instantaneous TPR images when available and by pixel-gauge comparison considering original error surfaces. The method is designed to be directly applicable to the standard Level 3 gridded time-series GPM product once this becomes available.",

As the earth warms, local weather may become more variable, less variable, or stay about the same. Daily surface station temperature data compiled by Berkeley Earth spanning the period from 1960 to present is used to examine spatial trends in short-term varaibility by decomposing station data into a longer-term trend, an average seasonal cycle, changes over time in the seasonal cycle, and residual variability. We find statistically significant declines in Nothern Hemisphere winter maximum temperature variability, with much of the observed decline concentrated in the past 15 years in high-latitude areas. Fall variability has also declined over the period examined, but these declines appear to be more modest. Spring and summer variability have no identifiable significant trends globally, though there are a few areas with notable increases. For the most part, weather variability appears to have changed little due to recent warming, with the likely exception of decreased variability in regions and months where snow accumulation is plausible. Potential correlations with changes in snow cover and sea ice extent are examined, and the implications of potential inhomogenities in the source data are explored.",

However, precipitation observations indirectly measured by satellite instruments are not routinely used. Because precipitation is a non-linear microphysics process, when radiances are affected by precipitation, it remains a scientific challenge to connect the observed signals to model physical and dynamic states to make effective corrections to forecasts and analysis. The Goddard cloud-resolving WRF ensemble data assimilation system has been developed with a focus on utilizing satellite observed precipitation information and incorporating microwave and radar techniques, particularly in estimation of precipitation properties. We present the bias correction and the ensemble assimilation algorithms developed for GPM observations, and results from experiments carried out in the GPM field campaign domain and intense observing period. The data impact to 4D dynamical precipitation estimation will be examined by using level-1 observations from multi-sensors at field-of-view resolutions and at varying overpass times during the assimilation window. Data from ground validation campaign are utilized in estimation problem as additional constraint or served as independent verification.",

            "abstract": "Development of natural and enhanced geothermal resources hosted in crystalline, volcanic and plutonic reservoir rocks, or in indurated, metamorphic basement reservoirs has increased over recent years. In these reservoir rocks, permeability is dominated by faults and fractures, with small contributions made by primary permeability. As such the study of how these structures are generated, their properties (e.g. orientation, spatial distribution, aperture, orientation with respect to the stress field), and how they become filled with precipitated minerals is vital to understanding the evolution of these geothermal systems, and is key to their successful development. In particular, fracture sealing is known to decrease the overall permeability of, or create permeability barriers in a geothermal reservoir, limiting its effectiveness as a resource. As such study of this sealing process is vital to discerning the evolution of fractured geothermal systems.\nWe use electron backscatter diffraction combined with cathodoluminescence and energy dispersive X-ray data from calcite and quartz filled veins from high temperature geothermal fields in New Zealand to investigate chemical patterns and microstructures in sealed reservoir fractures. Results indicate that while chemical zonation patterns may appear diverse or complicated, accompanying physical mineral growth and microstructure can either be simple or tell a more convoluted story. Calcite veins explored show little to no deformation and chemical suggesting postkinematic vein growth into free space with no subsequent deformation, while chemical zonation suggests fluid chemistry variation as sealing progressed. Quartz filled veins show crystal orientation of depositing vein crystals is controlled by that of the fracture wall minerals, and that varying chemistry has little to no impact on quartz microstructure.",

            "abstract": "As a wet planet becomes hot, evaporation of the ocean provides a thick steam atmosphere. As the atmosphere thickens, the level at which optical depth is unity (whence radiative emission and absorption dominantly occur) rises into the atmosphere, first for thermal wavelengths and later for solar wavelengths. Consequently, two radiation limits emerge. First, an asymptotic limit on the thermal radiation, as the level at which thermal emission occurs tends towards a fixed temperature, decoupled from surface temperature. Next, a limit the albedo of the planet, as all incoming sunlight is either reflected or absorbed in the atmosphere and almost none reaches the surface. A runaway greenhouse occurs when the product of co-albedo and area-averaged incoming sunlight exceeds the thermal radiation limit. Earth today is perilously close to this [1].\nReturning to the first sentence, we generate a thick atmosphere: the height of optical depth of unity becomes a non-trivial fraction of the planetary radius. Hence the area of the absorbing and emitting surfaces increase. Thermal emission wins slightly, as this occurs higher, increasing thermal emission in all cases. The underlying tendency is for a larger thermal limit for heavier planets due to pressure effects, making these appear more resistant to a runaway. However, atmospheric expansion affects light planets more, making these seem much more resilient. The least resilient planet would be between Mars-size and Venus-size (Figure 1).\nIt would be foolish to regard small planets as habitable. As the atmospheres become large, so does the problem of atmospheric escape. Theoretical considerations show hydrodynamic escape to happen disastrously for a Europa-size planet. The observation is that Mars is too feeble to hold on to any hefty atmosphere, even far from the Sun as it is, is probably relevant too. The take home points for habitable zone nerds are: (1) planet size matters (2) for small planets, atmospheric escape from a \"moist greenhouse\" state, with habitable surface temperatures, is the mortal wound.\n[1] Goldblatt, C., Robinson, T.D., Zahnle, K.J. & Crisp, D., Low simulated radiation limit for runaway greenhouse climates, Nat.

            "abstract": "The Linked Vocabulary API is a specification for publishing RESTful APIs of vocabularies represented in the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) as Linked Data on the web. This work began as part of the Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning Vocabularies (CMSPV) project in response to the need for a standard manner for agencies to publish and consume hierarchical vocabularies on the web. The RESTful architecture of the API provides a simple mechanism for consumption of full vocabularies, single vocabulary terms, related terms, and searches on terms. The Linked Data nature of the API promotes interoperability by exposing vocabulary resources as resolvable URIs that may be referenced from other vocabularies or sources of Linked Data and by allowing the published vocabulary to contain references as links to terms from other vocabularies. The Linked Vocabulary API is formally defined in a Linked Data API specification and may be deployed using standard implementations of the Linked Data API such as the Epimorphics Linked Data API (ELDA). Recent presentations of work done with the Linked Vocabulary API as part of the CMSPV project have resulted in the API receiving growing interest from the broader scientific community. In this contribution we present the Linked Vocabulary API design and deployment process.",

Unfortunately, this type of data might be contaminated by the rotation induced effects such as the centrifugal acceleration and the gravity effects. We analyze these effects based on a set of collocated rotation–translation data of small to moderate earthquakes. Results show these rotation effects could be negligible in small ground motion, but they might have a radical growing in the near-fault/extremely large ground motions. In order to extract more information from near-fault seismogram for improving our understating of seismic faulting and earthquake physics, it requires six-component collocated rotation-translation records to reduce or remove these effects.

            "abstract": "We present a comparison of two methods for developing reconstructions of oceanic scalar property fields from sparse scattered observations. Observed data from deep sea core samples provide valuable information regarding the properties of oceans in the past. However, because the locations of sample sites are distributed on the ocean floor in a sparse and irregular manner, developing a global ocean reconstruction is a difficult task. Our methods include a flow-based and a moving least squares -based approximation method. The flow-based method augments the process of interpolating or approximating scattered scalar data by incorporating known flow information. The scheme exploits this additional knowledge to define a non-Euclidean distance measure between points in the spatial domain. This distance measure is used to create a reconstruction of the desired scalar field on the spatial domain. The resulting reconstruction thus incorporates information from both the scattered samples and the known flow field. The second method does not assume a known flow field, but rather works solely with the observed scattered samples. It is based on a modification of the moving least squares approach, a weighted least squares approximation method that blends local approximations into a global result. The modifications target the selection of data used for these local approximations and the construction of the weighting function. The definition of distance used in the weighting function is crucial for this method, so we use a machine learning approach to determine a set of near-optimal parameters for the weighting. We have implemented both of the reconstruction methods and have tested them using several sparse oceanographic datasets. Based upon these studies, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method and suggest possible ways to combine aspects of both methods in order to achieve an overall high-quality reconstruction.",

Surface meteorological instruments and ground based GPS receivers measured the circulation and precipitable water with high spatial and temporal resolution, and the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model was used to simulate the mesoscale flow at 1 km resolution. A westerly on-shore flow of ~4 m/s over Mayaguez Bay was observed on many days, due to an interaction between thermally driven (3°C /10 km) sea-breeze circulation and an island wake comprised of twin gyres. The thermally driven sea-breeze occurred only when easterly synoptic winds favorably oriented the gyres with respect to the coast. Moisture associated with onshore flow was characterized by GPS measured precipitable water (PW). There is diurnal cycling of PW > 3 cm over the west coast during periods of onshore flow. The WRF model tends to overestimate PW on the west side of the island, suggesting evapotranspiration as the process needing further attention. Fluctuations of PW can affect local rainfall forecasts in times of convective instability.",

Whether or not historical sea-ice retreat has had a marked influence on remote climatic changes remains an open and important question. Here the effects of historical sea-ice loss on the atmosphere are isolated by prescribing Arctic sea ice loss from two different observational datasets to an atmosphere-only model. In addition, we prescribe to the atmosphere-only model sea ice loss patterns simulated by an ensemble of historical simulations with the corresponding coupled model. These simulations allow for the separation of the climate effects of forced (human-induced) sea ice loss and the climate effects of (random) sea ice changes induced by internal variability. We find that all scenarios exhibit a robust, shallow Arctic warming and a tendency for lower Arctic sea level pressure in Autumn and Winter. However, the pattern and magnitude of circulation change outside the Arctic and at upper levels varies widely across simulations. We suggest that midlatitude changes to observed Arctic sea ice loss are dominated by internal variability in the sea ice loss patterns.",

            "abstract": "Living roofs have very different surface energy, water and carbon budgets than conventional roofs. Since roofs cover approximately one third of the planimetric surface area of cities, they are a significant driver of the urban boundary layer. Living roofs have been thought to be beneficial for reducing the urban heat island through increased latent heat exchange, uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide and storage in soil and plant matter, building energy conservation through soil heat storage and latent heat fluxes and reduction in runoff. Here we present evidence of some of these through ongoing observations of surface energy, water and carbon budget estimates for the extensive living roof of the California Academy of Sciences building in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, California. Micrometeorological measurements including the eddy covariance approach are used to estimate CO2, water vapor and both ground and atmospheric heat fluxes. The California Academy’s roof encompasses an area of 18,000 m2. Vegetation surveys were conducted in the spring; beach strawberry (Fragaria chiloensis) and California bentgrass (Agrostis) were found to dominate the project footprint out of the 26 species observed. Eddy covariance measurements are made about one meter above the 10-20 cm tall vegetation on the downwind side of the building. Approximately 50% of data are rejected due to less than 80% of the flux source area being contained in the roof or due to low friction velocity. Nevertheless, we are able to develop robust diurnal ensemble fluxes, and will present data from a nine month period. During summer, the roof acted as a carbon sink of approximately 1.5 gC m-2 d-1. Turbulent heat fluxes were dominated by sensible heat flux with a mean Bowen ratio of approximately 1.5 and daily evapotranspiration rates of about 1.8 mm d-1. The role of seasonality and meteorology on surface microclimate characteristics will also be discussed.",

To understand the implications for the small-scale structure and evolution of Europa, we mosaicked these frames (observations 12ESMOTTLE01 and 02, incidence ≈18°, emission ≈77°) into their regional context (part of observation 11ESREGMAP01, 220 m/pixel, incidence ≈74°, emission ≈23°), despite their very different viewing and lighting conditions. We created a map of geological units based on morphology, structure, and albedo along with stereoscopic images where the frames overlapped. The highly diverse units range from: high albedo sub-parallel ridge and grooved terrain; to variegated-albedo hummocky terrain; to low albedo and relatively smooth terrain. We classified and analyzed the diverse units solely based on the high-resolution image mosaic, prior to comparison to the context image, to obtain an in-depth look at possible surface evolution and underlying formational processes. We infer that some of these units represent different stages and forms of resurfacing, including cryovolcanic and tectonic resurfacing. However, significant morphological variation among units in the region indicates that there are different degrees of resurfacing at work. We have created candidate morphological sequences that provide insight into the conversion of ridged plains to chaotic terrain—generally, a process of subduing formerly sharp features through tectonic modification and/or cryovolcanism. When the map of the high-resolution area is compared to the regional context, features that appear to be one unit at regional resolution are comprised of several distinct units at high resolution, and features that appear to be smooth in the context image are found to show distinct textures. Moreover, in the context image, transitions from ridged units to disrupted units appear to be gradual; however the high-resolution image reveals them to be abrupt, suggesting tectonic control of these boundaries. These discrepancies could have important implications for a future landed exploration.",

Utilizing a combination of analytical approaches including electrochemistry, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chromatography, we have started to unravel the interconnections between sulfur and other key elements, and how microorganisms may be either direct or indirect contributors to these chemical and mineralogical signatures.\nIn microbial mats, we have observed microbial production of significant hydrogen peroxide under UV-stressed conditions. This peroxide interaction with hydrogen sulfide changes the kinetics and the pathways of abiotic sulfur reactions, potentially affecting the overall bioavailability and isotopic fractionations for specific reactions via a change in the linkage between oxygen and sulfur cycling.\nIn systems containing significant iron, we have observed the production of an electroactive form of ferrous iron and sulfide (FeS(aq)) that is of a size that can be described between a dissolved molecular cluster and a small nanoparticle. This FeS(aq) can be a significant fraction of the dissolved iron or sulfide in a system, and is a key part of both the solubility of iron and sulfur and the pathways potentially important for pyritization reactions.\nIn systems where we investigate the links between sulfur and carbon, laboratory and field experiments indicate a wide range of large and more reduced organic compounds are highly reactive towards polysulfide. Utilizing Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry in conjunction with electrochemistry and chromatography, we are seeing a range of key reactions that occur over seconds between polysulifdes and organic compounds found in different organic matrices including Suwannee River natural organic matter and extracts of pine needles.",

            "abstract": "Deformation of the mid-crust is largely controlled by the rheology of quartz. While there is extensive experimental data on quartz rheology, feedbacks between grain-scale microstructure and rheology complicate the interpretation of naturally deformed samples. In this study we investigate the coupled processes of dynamic recrystallization and CPO evolution in a mid-crustal quartz mylonite from the Blue Ridge in Virginia. EBSD maps were constructed for 42 individual quartz microlithons, which represent domains that were originally monocrystalline. Within these microlithons the degree of dynamic recrystallization is highly variable, ranging from 10-100%. Shear strain within individual domains, inferred from empirical relationships between strain and recrystallization fraction, ranges from ~0.5-5.5. We document a systematic inverse relationship between shear strain and the strength of the neoblasts’ CPO. We also show that the neoblasts’ CPO is always inherited from the parent porphyroclast and is not reset by the macroscopic deformation kinematics. Recrystallized grains exhibit minimal internal distortion, indicating the dislocation density is low. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that deformation proceeded first by dislocation creep, and subsequently by another mechanism such as diffusion creep, which involved grain-boundary sliding. The large strains required to equilibrate the microstructure, and hence the rheology, suggest that natural crustal shear zones experience long and transient periods of strain weakening.",

            "abstract": "Southeast Asia has been experiencing major haze events over the past decades. Even though they are due to large-scale biomass burning, recent studies have shown that these events are becoming worse, in terms of both frequency and impact on air pollution. Some of the heaviest events, which used to be associated only with strong El-Nino events (and other phenomenons leading to large-scale tropical drying) are now becoming more frequent over the continent (2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2014).\nDirect emissions from these fires (black carbon and organic carbon aerosols) and indirect pollutants (ozone) play a major role in both the derivation of human health, changes to radiative forcing, and cloud properties. Furthermore, given the meteorology and active convection in the tropics, such pollutants tend to spread widely, entering into the global-scale circulation patterns. Finally, local sources of pollution may contribute to increase the toxicity of the event.\nThe critical component regarding this burning is the rapid conversion of forests, agricultural lands, and associated waste products to other types or uses. As there is a long time record of land surface properties (reflectance, albedo, LAI and NDVI), any observed changes in the fires must be associated with observed changes in the large-scale properties of the land itself.\nTo this end, we use a principal component approach to determine the regions of the continent which are the most variable from 2001 through 2013. We then derive the relationships between these spatial and temporal regions of variability, the AOD (aerosol optical depth), the large-scale reanalysis meteorology, the remotely sensed precipitation, and solar radiation.\nThese different factors are further analyzed in a regime by regime basis. Some of the regimes are expected to be variable but statistically climatological, while the influence of others should be changing. This study is a precursor step to future modeling efforts for deriving bi-directional climate change influences.",

It is therefore essential to utilize language that not only accurately relates the scientific information, but also effectively conveys a message that is congruent with the presenter’s motivation for expressing the data. This is especially relevant for environmental subjects that are surrounded by emotionally charged, political discourses. For example are terms like catastrophe and disaster; while these words may accurately illustrate impartial scientific data, they will likely trigger psychological responses in audiences such as fear or denial that have a detrimental impact on the human decision making process. I propose a set of 5 key principles to assist in communicating data to the general public that both support the transfer of ideas and the presenter’s intended psychological impact. 1) Articulate the underlying intentions that motivate the communication of data in a transparent manner 2) Use language congruent with the presenter’s stated intentions 3) Maintain a neutral, non-judgmental attitude towards the complex human psychological and emotional dynamics present in a target audience 4) Demonstrate acceptance and compassion when analyzing past and present human actions that adversely affect the environment 5) Develop a perspective of non-attachment when proposing future actions and/or consequences of current human behaviors. The application of these 5 principles provides a framework to move from our current understanding of problems and solutions to effective physical action that allows us to gracefully adapt with our ever changing planet.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude steppes were widespread and zonal in the Late Pleistocene and formed a landscape basis for the Mammoth Biome. Now the patches of these steppes survived on steep slopes under southern aspects. These steppes serve as unique information sources about the Late Pleistocene “Mammoth” steppe. Numerous data obtained by palynological, carpological, and DNA analysis of plant remains from feces and stomach contents of Pleistocene herbivore mummies, as well as from buried soils and enclosing deposits show that they are similar to modern steppe plant assemblage in taxa composition. Plant’s nutrient concentrations are of fundamental importance across Pleistocene grass-rich ecosystems because of their role in the support of large herbivores. The average weight of an adult mammoth skeleton (about 0.5 tons) and of a woolly rhinoceros (about 0.2 tons) clearly suggests this. Detailed studies on fossil bone remains showed mineral deficiency in large Pleistocene herbivores. A three-year study of ash and mineral contents of two types of relict steppe vegetation at the Kolyma Lowland, Arctic Siberia has been carried out. Nowadays refugia of similar vegetation are located not far (1 - 15km) from the Yedoma permafrost outcrops were abundant fossil remains are found. Dominant species of the steppe vegetation were sampled. Preliminary studies indicate that the ash-content varied 1.5-2 times in speceies of steppe herbs. The Ca, P, Mg, K element contents was higher for most steppe species than in the local herbaceous vegetation, especially in Ca and P. One of the most important elements of the mineral nutrition, the phosphorus, was always found in higher concentrations in the steppe vegetation than in plants of recently dominant landscapes of the study area. It should be noted that the mineral nutrient content of the modern steppe vegetation of Siberian Arctic is comparable to that of the recent zonal steppe of Transbaikal Region. This study supports the hypothesis that aboveground mineral concentrations of late Pleistocene grass-rich ecosystem were consistently higher than that of the recent common species of Siberian Arctic grassland. The source of mineral nutrients in the Pleistocene high-latitude steppe vegetation served as one of the reasons for the existence and survival of large herbivores in the Mammoth Biome.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas, with wetlands being the main natural source of CH4 to the atmosphere. Ebullition, or bubbling, is one pathway of CH4 emission to the atmosphere from wetland ecosystems. Rates of ebullition vary spatially and temporally and can be impacted by vegetation type, peat density, temperature and pressure. We present three years of ebullition measurements from Sallie’s Fen, a temperate peatland located in Barrington, NH. We observed the continuous and episodic nature of ebullition and how it varied with species composition, specifically sedge dominated and shrub dominated areas, using six acoustic and manual sensors. These sensors recorded continuously from June through October in each year (2011-2013). From these sensors, manual collections of accumulated gas were sampled to measure both the volume of gas and concentration of CH4. To identify differences in ebullition rates due to varying species composition, we installed six additional sensors in June 2013. Measured ebullitive fluxes ranged from 0 to 345 mg/m2/day. Manual measurements in sedge dominated sites had an average flux of 40.8 mg/m2/day for the three year data set compared to an average flux rate of 31.7 mg/m2/day for the shrub dominated sites. Acoustic data shows relationships between water table height and changes in other environmental variables. A subsample of the manual bubble collections at each sensor was also analyzed for 13C-CH4 in order to understand the dominant methanogenic pathway and how this varies with species composition and season.",

            "abstract": "A highly energetic, rapidly changing system provides the opportunity to study the potential for linking flood-tidal deltas and tidal inlets in order to predict possible future inlet scenarios. These subtidal and intertidal sedimentary deposits are formed by flood-tidal currents and modified by ebb-tidal currents and as such can elucidate past and present hydraulic conditions. Further, within the proposed conceptual model the evolution of these features can lend insight into future system and inlet development.\nAn ongoing study documented a feedback mechanism linking the primary flood-tidal delta with the migration of the tidal inlet in the study area on Cape Cod, Massachusetts USA. This was based on field surveys (n = 10) of intertidal bedforms, a tidal current velocity survey, and 2 dimensional analyses of aerial photographs from 1938 to the present (n = 32). Three-dimensional analysis of the flood-tidal delta and inlet was conducted using bathymetry from a 2014 vessel-based survey using Phase-Measuring Sidescan Sonar, coupled with bathymetric Lidar from 2007 and 2010.\nA conceptual model for this and similar systems is being developed. As seen in the study area material entrained in the longshore sediment transport system becomes incorporated into the swash platform. As a result more sediment is introduced into the harbor during flood tides increasing the size of the flood-tidal delta. If the increase in size reduces the hydraulic efficiency of the ebb-tidal flow a feedback mechanism can result. Ebb-tidal flow is restricted, channels become narrower and deeper, and this channelization leads to an increase in shallower areas in the harbor, which further increases sediment transport during flood-tidal flow. If the cycle continues the system becomes too hydraulically inefficient and a correction occurs, that can be gradual or rapid, either of which has implications for system evolution and/or management. This preliminary model was developed from field observations in the study area. Similar systems worldwide will be examined and discussed for suitability as it pertains to this model.",

            "abstract": "Although carbonatites have been produced since the Archean and are preserved in the geologic record, the East African Rift is home to the only active carbonatite volcano, at Ol Doinyo Lengai. It has long been known that the natrocarbonatites become strongly weathered the first time they are exposed to rain. We studied the weathering patterns in the field and have determined the mineralogical transformations via petrography and XRD. Mass transport is assessed by XRF and ICP-MS analyses. Water preferentially dissolves specific minerals in the pristine lava, permeating through earlier layers of flow to form stalactites, which have differing mineralogical composition. These hang both from the host flow and from the bottom of underlying earlier flows. The weathering product is characterized by trona, a hydrated carbonate mineral, as well as the sodium sulfate mineral aphthitalite. Data from XRD analysis of the carbonatite lava confirm transformation of its original minerals, nyerereite and gregoryite, into secondary hydrated carbonate minerals gaylussite and pirssonite (e.g., Zaitsev and Keller, 2006). This transformation is attributed to the instability of the erupted minerals at atmospheric conditions. Data from XRF analysis indicate a 4-fold increase in the amount of sodium present in the stalactite as well as a 8-fold increase in potassium. Trace element analysis by ICP-MS indicates significantly elevated levels of vanadium, copper, and rubidium in the weathering product, whereas strontium, barium, lanthanum, and cesium are left behind in high concentrations in the carbonatite lava. Our results provide further evidence supporting the proposal by Dawson et al. (1987) that calcium carbonate dominated lava flows result from extensive weathering of sodic carbonatite flows.",

            "abstract": "Headwater streams comprise the vast majority of stream network length in watersheds and affect regional water quality. However, the spatial variation of water quality in headwater regions often remains unknown. In this study, we show that spatial processes differentially affect biogeochemical condition and pattern across a multiple scales in a headwater stream network. Synoptic spatial surveys of streamwater chemistry at both fine grain and broad extent coupled with network-based geostatistical analysis, allowed us to quantify spatial patterns over a range of scales from 1st order ephemeral and intermittent streams to 4th and 5th order perennial streams. In addition, synoptic surveys at a fine spatial grain (50 m) in a small watershed (0.41 km2) showed the same range of chemical variation as its larger basin (36 km2) sampled at coarser grain (100 m). Spatial structure was apparent at either a single scale or at multiple nested scales in the larger basin, suggesting separate processes operating simultaneously within the stream network and surrounding terrestrial landscape. We explored the fine-scale patchiness in stream chemical patterns, with particular emphasis on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as an example to illustrate hotspot development due to hydropedological variation in a watershed. Hydropedological variations refer to soil morphological differences that directly relate water table regime, flowpaths, and saturation frequency to soil development. Soils have been digitally mapped using topographic and bedrock-related metrics determined from a LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) and field surveys of bedrock outcropping. Spatial patterns of DOC concentrations were associated with the distribution of soil types and their thresholds to stormflow generation. The hydrologic connection of shallow soils in channel head regions above the stream network where lateral podzols developed appeared to be a source for DOC hotspots in the stream network. Overall, our study highlights the importance of understanding the structural organization within a watershed, particularly hydropedological variation, in assessing controls on the spatial patterns of streamwater chemistry and developing tools for predicting the stream chemical variation in headwater stream networks.",

However, the diversity of microorganisms and metabolic pathways involved in carbon cycling, and the impacts of these processes on other biogeochemical cycles remain poorly understood. Major advances in DNA sequencing have helped forge linkages between the previously disconnected biological and chemical components of these systems. Here, we present data on the use of assembly-based metagenomics to generate hypotheses on microbial carbon degradation and biogeochemical cycling in waterlogged sediments and soils. DNA sequencing from a fresh water aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River in Rifle, CO yielded extensive genome recovery from multiple previously unknown bacterial lineages. Fermentative metabolisms encoded by these genomes drive nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur cycling in this subsurface system. We are also applying a similar approach to identify microbial processes in a freshwater wetland on Lake Erie, OH. Given the increased diversity (increased richness, decreased evenness, and strain variation) of wetland sediment microbial communities, we modified methods for specialized assembly of long taxonomic marker gene amplicons (EMIRGE) to create a biogeographical map of Fungi, Archaea, and Bacteria along depth and hydrological transects. This map reveals that the microbial community associated with the top two depths (>7 cm) is significantly different from bottom depths (7-40 cm). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) molecular weight and the presence of oxidized terminal electron acceptors best predict differences in microbial community structure. Laboratory mesocosms amended with pore-water DOM, in situ soil communities, and variable oxygen conditions link DOM composition and redox to microbial metabolic networks, biogeochemical cycles, and green house gas emission. Organism identities from laboratory studies are linked to field biogeography patterns to inform a physiology-based understanding of wetland biogeochemical processes. This research sheds light on microbial organisms and interdependent metabolic processes impacting cycling of organic matter in freshwater sediments and soils.",

With the use of radiometers onboard earth orbiting satellites, scientists are able to monitor the Earth’s environment and climate system on both short- and long-term temporal scales with near global coverage.\nThe Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) is part of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) broader commitment toward global and long-term observation of the Earth’s environment. GCOM consists of two polar orbiting satellite series, GCOM-W (Water) and GCOM-C (Climate), with 1-year overlap between them for inter-calibration.\nAMSR2 onboard GCOM-W1 is a microwave radiometer system that measures dual polarized radiances at 6.9, 7.3, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz. It is a sun-synchronous orbiter that acquires microwave radiances by conically scanning the Earth’s surface at a nominal earth incidence angle of 55 degrees that results in a wide swath of 1450 km.\nAs a part of Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) GCOM-W1 product development and validation project will provide NOAA’s users access to critical geophysical products derived from AMSR-2. These products, which are detailed in NOAA’s JPSS Level 1 Requirements Document Supplement, include: microwave brightness temperature, total precipitable water, cloud liquid water, precipitation type/rate, sea surface temperature, and Sea Surface Wind Speed.\nPhase-1 of the AMSR-2 project at NOAA included inter-calibration of AMSR-2 measured brightness temperatures with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager as the reference radiometer. The second phase of the project utilized the calibrated brightness temperatures in a robust Bayesian network to retrieve more accurate geophysical parameters over the ocean surface. It can handle retrievals even with missing channels and can be implemented in operational environment. One year worth of data (2013) was used to create profiles of AMSR-2 brightness temperatures and the corresponding geophysical parameters. The retrieved parameters were then validated with other models and satellite products to make sure they meet the requirements.",

            "abstract": "Coal surface mining is a significant landscape disturbance in the United States. Since 1977, the reclamation of mined lands has been regulated by the Surface Mine Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA). Prior to the act, many coalfields were left un-reclaimed or partially reclaimed, with highly irregular topology and drainage networks. Under the act, the reverse is often true; adherence to SMCRA often leads to the homogenization of surfaces and channel networks. While both pre and post-SMCRA landscapes are highly altered, they exhibit strongly dissimilar characteristics. We examine pre-SMCRA, post-SMCRA and unmined watersheds at 3 spatial scales in order to compare the geomorphic differences between reclamation strategies. In particular, we attempt to separate anthropogenic factors from pre-existing, natural factors via comparisons to unmined watersheds. Our study design incorporates a 3 scale top-down analysis of 21 independent watersheds (7 of each treatment type). Each watershed has an area of approximately 1km2. All watersheds share similar geography, climate and geology. At the landscape scale, characteristics are derived from 0.762m (2.5ft) resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At the channel network scale, DEMs, as well as remote sensing data (including the National Wetlands Inventory database) are used. Finally, the reach scale incorporates longitudinal and cross-section surveys (using a total station) as well as a particle size distribution. At each scale, attributes are parameterized for statistical comparison. Post-SMCRA sites are characterized by a general reduction of watershed surface slopes (11.9% median) compared to pre-SMCRA (19.3%) and unmined (19.8%) sites. Both pre and post-SMCRA channel networks are characterized by significant surface impoundments (in the form of remnant headwall trenches on pre-SMCRA sites and engineered retention basins on post-SMCRA sites). Pre-SMCRA outlet reaches have significantly steeper bed slopes (2.79% mean) than both post-SMCRA (1.72% mean) and unmined (1.67% mean) reaches (1-way ANOVA p=0.0488 n=19). Our results demonstrate the differential alterations resulting from these reclamation strategies, which may lead to alteration of long-term geomorphic processes. Further investigations of hydrology and sediment transport are needed.",

            "abstract": "Fog deposition has been shown to be a significant water input into many arid ecosystems. However, deposition of fog onto foliage depends on many factors. Previously, characterizing fog droplet size distributions was labor intensive, but currently we can characterize changes in fog droplet composition in the 2-50 µm in 2 µm intervals in real time. Evaluating how droplet size and ambient micrometeorological conditions affect deposition rates will allowing tremendous new insight into fog formation and deposition processes. Previous work has characterized fog deposition as it alters with wind speed in natural systems, but extensively testing how droplet size, wind speed, angle of interception all co-vary would be impossible in a natural setting. We utilized a wind tunnel with artificial fog generating nebulizers to simulate fog events across micrometeorological conditions. Using a weighing lysimeter, we were able to quantify the differential rates of deposition on different theoretical leaf types as droplet size and micrometeorological conditions vary. We hope to inform fog collector designs with this information to ensure we are accurately quantifying the fluxes of fog-derived water into these systems.",

            "abstract": "One of the fundamental questions in space science is: How is the Earth system, which is enclosed within a shielding magnetic field, influenced by the space environment? In a broader context: How important is an intrinsic magnetic field to the evolution of a planet’s atmosphere (and the development of life or of a spacefaring society)? The space science community has addressed focused aspects of this question first and only recently has begun to take an integrated view of the problem by using models to “connect the dots” between the Sun and the Earth. We are also developing new capabilities to investigate the coupling from the lower atmosphere (troposphere and stratosphere). Despite these advances, we have yet to discover how big a difference the lower atmosphere makes in the response of the upper atmosphere to geomagnetic disturbances. Furthermore addressing the larger issues (i.e., how lack of symmetry between the hemispheres causes new features to emerge and drives changes in the global system dynamics) are beyond current capabilities. There are a number of fundamental issues that need to be resolved to make further progress but the primary challenge is to remove the spatial and temporal ambiguity of measurements and to do so in an affordable way. In this paper we review the questions and formulate an integrated, observation- and model-based approach. Our primary focus is on high latitudes and, in particular, on the difference between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres both in terms of drivers and response. To address that issue we are developing a Multi-Element Geospace Investigation (MEGI) consisting of ground-, air- and space-based instruments. International collaboration is a key element as is the ability to seamlessly connect scientists and information (data and model results as well as analysis products). Our posited architecture will be discussed as will our plans to submit this concept as an NSF MREFC proposal.",

Mesquite (which includes some 45 species) is an invasive deciduous tree which is known to have an array of negative impacts on ecosystems and rural livelihoods in arid and semi-arid regions around the world, dominating millions of hectares of land in Asia, Africa, Australia and the Americas. In Ethiopia, Prosopis juliflora (the only reported mesquite) is the most pervasive plant invader, threatening local livelihoods and the country's unique biodiversity. Due to its rapid spread and persistence, P. juliflora has been ranked as one of the leading threats to traditional land use, exceeded only by drought and conflict. This project utilized NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS) data and species distribution modeling to map current infestations of P. juliflora in the Afar region of northeastern Ethiopia, and forecast its suitable habitat across the entire country. This project provided a time and cost-effective strategy for conducting risk assessments of invasive mesquite and subsequent monitoring and mitigation efforts by land managers and local communities.",

            "abstract": "Biological carbon sequestration by reforestation and afforestation is being promoted as an opportunity to help mitigate global warming and climate change. The scientific basis to support such forestry activities is shifting to include many biophysical dimensions beyond carbon storage. In this talk I address two questions: 1) Where can forests help slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere while also providing beneficial biophysical feedbacks? and (2) How many extra resources, including water and nutrients, may be needed to achieve this carbon storage and climate benefit? By comparing the biophysical forcings and climatic impact of vegetation replacement across North America using satellite-derived albedo, land surface temperature (LST), and evapotranspiration (ET) between adjacent vegetation types, we show that a carbon-centric accounting is, in most cases, insufficient for climate mitigation policies. Where afforestation or reforestation occurs, deciduous broadleaf trees are likely to produce stronger cooling benefits than evergreen needleleaf trees provide in temperate ecosystems. Our analyses also suggest that forestry activities will have the most climatic benefits at locations where background albedo prior to landscape change is low, snow cover is minimal, cloud cover is high, and soil water availability is ample.",

            "abstract": "Mean per-cell rates of catabolic activity, energy flux, and biomass turnover are orders of magnitude slower in subseafloor sediment than in the surface world. Despite extreme scarcity of electron donors, competing metabolic pathways co-occur for hundreds of meters deep in subseafloor sediment deposited over millions of years. Our study of an example site (ODP Site 1226) indicates that the energy yields of these competing reactions are pinned to a thermodynamic minimum (Wang et al., 2010). The simplest explanation of this long-term co-existence is thermodynamic cooperation, where microorganisms utilize different but co-existing pathways that remove each other’s reaction products.\nOur Site 1226 results indicate that the energy flux to subseafloor sedimentary microbes is extremely low. Comparison to biomass turnover rates at other sites suggests that most of this flux may be used for building biomolecules from existing components (e.g., amino acids in the surrounding sediment), rather than for de novo biosynthesis from inorganic chemicals.\nGiven these discoveries, ocean drilling provides a tremendous opportunity to address several mysteries of microbial survival and natural selection under extreme energy limitation. Some of these mysteries are centered on microbial communities. To what extent do counted cells in subseafloor sediment constitute a deep microbial necrosphere? How do different kinds of microbes interact to sustain their mean activity at low average rates for millions of years? Other mysteries relate to individual cells. How slowly can a cell metabolize? How long can a cell survive at such low rates of activity? What properties allow microbes to be sustained by low fluxes of energy? In what ways do subseafloor organisms balance the benefit(s) of maximizing energy recovery with the need to minimize biochemical cost(s) of energy recovery?\n",

            "abstract": "In far northern Queensland (FNQ) there are only sporadic coral and speleothem precipitation proxy records, and only one annually resolved, terrestrial record of rainfall that predates 1850 CE. Black kauri pine, Agathis atropurpurea, is a large conifer present in isolated stands near 1000 masl in the wet tropical dividing range of FNQ. Little is known about its phenology or responses to climate, although its presence near the elevational limit of the dividing range may hinder its ability to respond to increased temperature or decreased precipitation through elevational migration. We hypothesize that in this energy-limited forest, increased (decreased) solar radiation leads to increased (decreased) ring widths, and higher (lower) evapotranspiration rates produce increases (decreases) in the oxygen isotopic composition (δ18O) of the a-cellulose component of wood. To test this hypothesis, we collected over 60 cores from 21 large (dbh = 56 to 186 cm) A. atropurpurea trees from Spurgeon Peak National Park. The resulting tree-ring chronology extends from 2013 to 1438 CE and shows high average mean sensitivity (0.642) although expressed population signal drops off at 1650 CE as sample depth decreases. Comparison of the most recent 100 years of ring widths and direct climate observations show a significant positive relationship (r2 = 0.4, p < 0.01) to PDSI in December through March, coinciding with the austral rainy season associated with onset of the northern Australian Monsoon. Annualized δ18Oxygen (a-cellulose) maxima for 1983-2013 show strong and significant spatial positive relationships to Tmax and Pacific seasurface temperatures. Work to refine the interpretation of the data is onoing, but the resulting dataset may enable extension of the terrestrial climate record of north Queensland two centuries beyond current tree-ring proxies and historical observations.",

            "abstract": "Charcoal plays a significant role in the long-term carbon cycle and its use as a soil amendment is becoming a viable carbon sequestration strategy (biochar). One challenge in this research area has been comparing results between studies in part due to the diversity of lab and field production conditions. Although the highest treatment temperature (HTT) is often used to describe pyrolysis conditions, several studies have shown that length of time at the highest temperature can also cause changes to the physicochemical qualities of charcoal and ignoring this effect may introduce inter-comparison problems. Addressing this issue becomes especially important in the discussion of optimizing biochar for soil remediation and carbon sequestration, and in discussions of charcoal use in reconstructing past fire regimes, as increasing time at temperature may cause changes in charcoal properties similar to the changes caused by increasing HTT. Here we introduce a formal definition of charring intensity (CI) to more accurately characterize pyrolysis, and we document variation in this property with pyrolysis temperature and reaction duration. We found two types of responses to CI: either a linear or a threshold relationship. We show that a threshold exists where %C, %N and δ15N begin exhibiting large changes, and this CI threshold co-occurred with an increase in charcoal aromaticity. Mass yield decreased linearly with charring intensity and carbon isotopes did not change from original biomass values in our controlled laboratory experiments. Analysis of these data shows that pyrolysis parameters should be defined in the literature as a combination of temperature and duration conditions, and that biomass that has undergone pyrolysis may be influencing soil organic nitrogen. Additionally, the lack of alteration in carbon isotopes across our matrix supports the efficacy of using pyrolyzed material for archaeological reconstructions.",

            "abstract": "Much of our understanding of the climatic controls on tree species distributions is based on contemporary observational datasets. For example, forest inventory analysis (FIA) and other spatial datasets are used to build correlative models of climate suitability for plant taxa for use in environmental niche models. More complex dynamic models rely on species interactions, physiological processes, and competition, among other processes, that are also parameterized against contemporary data. However, as much as a quarter of the forested region in the upper Midwestern United States may be considered novel relative to pre-settlement baselines (Goring et al. submitted). Hence, modern surveys or even long-term datasets may represent only a portion of the ecological or climate space taxa might occupy. Using gridded datasets of pre-settlement vegetation for the northeastern United States from Town Propritor Suveys and the Public Land Survey, we examine the effects of European land-use conversion – logging, agricultural conversion and re-establishment – on climate-vegetation relationships.\nWe show that in regions where land-use change is climatically biased, such as conversion to agriculture along the prairie-forest boundary, impacts on the realized climatic niches for various tree taxa can be significant. Improving predicted distributions of taxa is critical for planning and mitigating the effects of widespread shifts in forest composition resulting from climate change. Using pre-settlement data can improve our understanding of the potential niches occupied by major forest taxa, improving the predictive abilities of environmental niche and mechanistic models.",

We examine the spatial distribution of these interventions in relation to population density and to trends in precipitation and in greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI.\nWe classify three categories of environmental change using the spatial distribution of re-greening, its relation to precipitation, and population density: (A) regions at the northern grassland/shrubland edge of the Sahel, where NDVI varies interannually with precipitation, (B) densely populated cropland regions of the Sahel where significant trends in precipitation and NDVI decouple at interannual time scale, and (C) regions at the southern savanna edge of the Sahel, where NDVI has increased independent of precipitation.\nExamination of the number of projects implemented from 1979 to 2001 in the three respective areas brings to the fore a diversity of relationships between greening, precipitation, number of development projects, and population density over the western Sahel. The most interesting of these characterizations is category B, covering the cropland areas where population density and \"re-greening\" are higher than normal, particularly where agricultural projects are present. These areas coincide with emerging hotspots of \"re-greening\" in northern Burkina Faso and southern central Niger known from case-study literature. In examining the impact of efforts to rejuvenate the Sahelian environment and livelihoods in the aftermath of the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s against the backdrop of a varying and uncertain climate, our findings support the transition from desertification to \"re-greening\" discourses in the context of adaptation to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Active-source Love waves recorded by the multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASLW) technique were recently analyzed in two site characterization projects. Between 2010 and 2011, the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funded GEOVision to conduct geophysical investigations at 189 seismographic stations—185 in California and 4 in the Central Eastern U.S. (CEUS). The original project plan was to utilize active and passive Rayleigh wave-based techniques to obtain shear-wave velocity (VS) profiles to a minimum depth of 30 m and the time-averaged VS of the upper 30 meters (VS30). Early in the investigation it became evident that Rayleigh wave techniques, such as multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASRW), were not effective at characterizing all sites. Shear-wave seismic refraction and MASLW techniques were therefore applied. The MASLW technique was deployed at a total of 38 sites, in addition to other methods, and used as the primary technique to characterize 22 sites, 5 of which were also characterized using Rayleigh wave techniques. In 2012, the Electric Power Research Institute funded characterization of 33 CEUS station sites. Based on experience from the ARRA investigation, both MASRW and MASLW data were acquired by GEOVision at 24 CEUS sites—the remaining 9 sites and 2 overlapping sites were characterized by University of Texas, Austin. Of the 24 sites characterized by GEOVision, 16 were characterized using MASLW data, 4 using both MASLW and MASRW data and 4 using MASRW data. Love wave techniques were often found to perform better, or at least yield phase velocity data that could be more readily modeled using the fundamental mode assumption, at shallow rock sites, sites with steep velocity gradients, and, sites with a thin, low velocity, surficial soil layer overlying stiffer sediments. These types of velocity structure often excite dominant higher modes in Rayleigh wave data, but not in Love wave data. At such sites, it may be possible to model Rayleigh wave data using multi- or effective-mode techniques; however, in many cases extraction of adequate Rayleigh wave dispersion data for modeling was difficult. These results imply that field procedures should include careful scrutiny of Rayleigh wave-based dispersion data in order to collect Love wave data when warranted.",

            "abstract": "The intracontinental subduction zone between India and Asia is termed the Main Himalayan thrust. Beneath the range front and Lesser Himalaya the subduction interface is locked and only ruptures during great earthquakes. However beneath the High Himalaya and southern Tibet a rheologic transition from brittle to ductile deformation along the subduction zone has been defined based on microseismicity, geodesy, and thermal modelling. Geodetic data suggests that the crust above the transition zone strains to accommodate much of India-Asia interseismic convergence as southern Tibet creeps toward the locked portion of the Main Himalayan thrust. We combine regional geology with stream profile analysis, thermal modelling, geodesy, and microseismicity to understand spatial and temporal characteristics of the intracontinental subduction in this region of the Himalaya. This continuous flux of material against the locked portion of the subduction zone stores elastic strain which drives great earthquakes that rupture the plate boundary from southern Tibet to the range front. While the brittle-ductile transition zone stores a significant amount of interseismic strain it has also been a locus of permanent shortening and crustal thickening as shown by the presence of the Dolpo and Manaslu folds in Nepal and Kakhtang thrust in Bhutan, which were all active in the Middle Miocene. The forelimb of the Dolpo fold, a 400 km long 50 km half wavelength gentle fold, coincides with a 200 km x 50 km swath of oversteepened river channels indicative of rapid rock uplift suggesting the fold is currently being uplifted and shortened. The Dolpo fold experienced persistent shortening and crustal thickening despite being located adjacent to, and active concurrently with the Gurla Mandhata core complex indicating simultaneous N-S shortening and E-W extension implying a constrictional train field since the Middle Miocene. We interpret the Dolpo fold to reflect an active antiformal duplex along the Main Himalayan thrust in which shear zones stack ductile lower-middle crust and propagate into the seismogenic upper crust becoming nucleation sites for microseismicity. We predict the position of the duplex to be controlled not by a footwall ramp but rather by the transition from ductile to brittle rheology along the Main Himalayan thrust.",

            "abstract": "Storm time response of the middle latitude ionosphere goes through different phases of positive and negative storms for different events. Storm Enhanced Densities (SEDs) are particularly difficult to self-consistently categorize with physical models. The area of enhanced density is surrounded by steep density gradients and appears to progress rapidly through mid-latitudes and into the polar regions. The goal of this study is to improve our scientific understanding of the plasma height variations associated with SEDs, specifically to determine the relative role of the various drivers including neutral wind, composition, and electric fields.\nA new Ionosphere-Plasmasphere-Electrodynamics (IPE) model used in this study has been developed by collaboration between CU CIRES, NOAA/SWPC, NOAA/GSD and NCAR/HAO. The main objectives are to improve our specification of ionosphere and plasmasphere in response to external forcing from both above and below, and to couple to whole atmosphere models for understanding the interaction between the terrestrial weather to space weather. The model describes the time dependent, three-dimensional, global density of nine ion species, electron density, temperatures of electron and ions in the ionosphere and plasmasphere. The parallel plasma transport is based on the Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) Model [Richards et al., 1990]. A realistic model of Earth’s magnetic field is implemented by using the APEX coordinate system [Richmond, 1995]. Global, seamless plasma transport perpendicular to the magnetic field has been included all the way from the equator to the poles. The electrodynamics solver based on the TIEGCM [Richmond and Maute, 2014] calculates the global electric field self-consistently.\nThis presentation focuses on an impact of IGRF on the variations of plasma gradients associated with SEDs. In particular, difference between IGRF and dipole coordinate system is quantified. Furthermore, the relative roles of the various storm time drivers including wind, composition and electric field is examined.",

            "abstract": "Episodes of flat-slab subduction along the western margin of the Americas may have lead to the formation of intra-continental basins and seas, as well as mountain belts and continental plateaux. Here, we explore some of the consequences of a flat slab morphology, linking dynamic topography and stress patterns in continents to slab and mantle dynamics. Using a 2-D cylindrical code, we develop general models and apply them to the North and South America plates. The results are primarily controlled by the coupling along the slab-continent interface (due to geometry and viscosity), the viscosity of the mantle wedge, and the buoyancy of the subducted lithosphere. All models predict broad subsidence, large deviatoric stresses, and horizontal compression above the tip of the flat slab and the deep slab hinge. In models where the slab lays horizontally for hundreds of kilometers, overriding plate compression focuses on both ends of the flat segment, where normal-dip subduction exerts a direct downward pull. In between, a broad low-stress region gets uplifted proportionally to the amount of coupling between the slab and the continent. Anomalously buoyant seafloor enhances this effect but is not required. The downward bending of the flat slab extremities causes its upper part to undergo extension and the lower part to compress. These results have potential for explaining the existence of relatively undeformed, uplifted regions surrounded by mountain belts, such as in the western U.S. and parts of the Andes. Adequately modeling topography and stress in the unusual setting of southwestern Mexico requires a low-viscosity subduction interface and mantle wedge. Our results are only partially controlled by the buoyancy of the subducting plate, suggesting that the viscosity and the morphology of the slab are important, and that the often-used low resolution and \"Stokeslet\" models may be missing substantial effects.",

            "abstract": "Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) provide a context for studying a range of magma ascent, emplacement and extrusion scenarios. LIPs are intraplate magmatic events, of mainly mafic magma, > 0.1 Mkm3, and often above 1 Mkm3, in both continental and oceanic settings, and are typically characterized by a short duration magmatic pulse or multiple short pulses over a maximum of a few 10s of Ma. Continental LIPs can have significant volumes of associated silicic magmatism and also carbonatites and kimberlites.\nAspects to consider are how LIP magma ascends into the lithosphere from an underlying asthenospheric source(s) (e.g. mantle plume), the patterns for the subsequent distribution of magma within the lithosphere (mantle and crust), and links to surface volcanism. Lithosphere-entry scenarios include ascent: (a) from a widely distributed asthenospheric source; (b) from a localized source region, e.g. above the plume center; (c) along zones of triple-junction rifting; (d) along translithospheric fracture zones, and (d) from buoyant plume material that has moved sideways along the base of the lithosphere (e.g. sublithospheric channelling).\nUpon ascent, magma is distributed vertically and laterally within the crust as dykes and sills, with the involvement of staging magma chambers. Most dramatically, giant radiating and circumferential dyke swarms can have a radii of >1000 km and >250 km, respectively, centered on the plume. Extrusive magmatism can be fissure- or edifice-fed, and individual flows can extend for 100s to perhaps even a 1000 km. As a consequence of lateral flow in dykes, lava flows and sills can be emplaced at great distances from the plume center; laterally propagating dykes that intersect a sedimentary basin can continue into the basin as sills, and local lava flows can be formed when the upper edge of a dyke intersects the paleosurface. The main locus of magmatism can shift during a LIP event, due to plate movement over an underlying plume. Picrites and high-Mg magmas are preferentially concentrated above the plume-center region.",

However, benthic food structure is not fully understood, due to varied sources of particulate organic matter (POM) and the high diversity of benthic invertebrates. We provide the first demonstration of the application of compound-specific amino acid isotope analysis to study the dietary sources and trophic structure for this Arctic marginal sea. About 20 stations in Chukchi Sea were sampled during cruises in August of 2012 and 2013. At each station, phytoplankton, POM and benthic fauna were collected, processed and analyzed using GC-C-IRMS (gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry). Among benthic fauna, dominant species included the following taxonomic groups: Ophiuroidea, Amphipoda, Polychaeta, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, and Cnidaria. The benthic fauna showed similar patterns of individual amino acid δ13C, with glycine the most enriched in 13C and leucine the most depleted in 13C. Specific amino acids including phenylalanine showed spatial variability in δ13C and δ15N values within the sampled area, indicating contributions of different dietary sources including phytoplankton, sea ice algae, benthic algae and terrestrial organic materials. δ15N values of individual amino acids such as the difference between glutamic acid and phenylalanine, i.e. Δ15Nglu-phe (δ15Nglu – δ15Nphe), were also used to identify trophic levels of benthic invertebrates relative to estimates available from bulk δ15N values. These data will ultimately be used to evaluate the spatial variability of organic carbon sources and trophic level interactions of dominant benthic species in the Chukchi Sea.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies apply remote sensing observations spanning 30+ years to derive estimates of Earth's boreal surface albedo feedback of ~0.6 W m-2 K-1, larger than those simulated by nearly all CMIP models. Other modeling studies demonstrate that the strength of albedo feedback within the seasonal cycle is correlated with the longer-term climate change feedback, and furthermore that some models accurately capture the seasonal cycle of albedo feedback in comparison with observations, indicating that these models may provide realistic estimates of the climate change albedo feedback. A fundamental question for reconciling these two perspectives is: What length of time and magnitude of environmental change are needed to derive a meaningful estimate of the climate change feedback? To this end, we apply the CMIP5 archive to explore variability in the strength of surface albedo feedback on timescales of 30-100 years. We find that the variance in feedback drops substantially when the analysis is filtered to periods of global mean surface temperature change exceeding about 0.5 K, regardless of the length of time of the analysis. This result suggests that temperature change, more so than time duration, governs the likelihood of any particular time period providing a reasonable proxy of the system's century-scale or equilibrium feedback strength. Furthermore, because global (northern hemisphere) surface temperature has increased about 0.55 (0.81) K from 1979 to present-day, satellite-derived estimates of the multidecadal feedback strength may provide a good indication of the system's inherent climate change feedback strength. Moreover, we find that CMIP5 models do not show a robust decline in the strength of global mean surface albedo feedback by 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario, despite widespread losses of snow and sea-ice.",

In general, the sensor calibrator involves three integrated electrodes (pH, dissolved H2 and H2S) and a temperature sensor, all of which are installed in a cell with a volume of ~ 1 ml. A PEEK check valve cartridge is installed at the inlet end of the cell to guide the flow path during the measurement and calibration processes. Two PEEK tubes are connected at outlet end of the cell for drawing out hydrothermal fluid and delivering pH buffer fluids. During its measurement operation, the pump draws in hydrothermal fluid, which then passes through the check valve directly into the sensing cell. When in calibration mode, the pump delivers pH buffers into the cell, while automatically closing the check valve to the outside environment.\nThis probe has two advantages compared to our previous unit used during KNOX18RR MAR cruise in 2008 and MARS cabled observatory deployment in 2012. First, in the former design, a 5 cm solenoid valve was equipped with the probe. This enlarged size prevented its application in specific point or small area. In this version, the probe has only a dimension of 1.6 cm for an easy access to hydrothermal biological environments. Secondly, the maximum temperature condition of the earlier system was limited by the solenoid valve precluding operation in excess of 50 ºC. The new design avoids this problem, which improves its temperature tolerance. The upper limit of temperature condition is now up to 100oC, therefore enabling broader application in hydrothermal diffuse flow system on the seafloor.\nDuring SVC cruise (AT26-12) in the Gulf of Mexico this year, the MpHC was successfully tested with Alvin dives at the depth up to 2600 m for measuring pH with in-situ calibration in seafloor cold seep environment. The measurement and calibration were also conducted in hydrothermal diffuse flow at temperature condition exceeding 70 ºC with Alvin dives during a recent cruise AT26-17 in ASHES vent field and Main Endeavour Field on Juan de Fuca Ridge. Data from these seagoing deployments will be presented, with emphasis on both technical and scientific aplications.",

            "abstract": "Landslides are a major natural disaster in Taiwan relevant to the human life. After the catastrophic Xiaolin landslide during Typhoon Morakot in August 2009 caused around 400 casualties, the deep-seated landslide has become a serious issue. This study explored the potential deep-seated landslide in Hekeng watershed extracted from SPOT-5 imageries. The empirical topographic correction was applied to minimize effect of the mountain shaded area due to the difference of sun elevation and terrain angle. Consequently the multi-temporal environmental indices, i.e., modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (mNDVI) and modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) were corrected. Seasonal vegetation cover and surface moisture change were analyzed incorporate with a slope which obtain from DEM data. The result showed that the distribution of potential deep-seated landslide vulnerable area mainly located at headstream watershed. It could be explained that the headstream watershed has less human interference, therefore the environmental indices interpreted those area as deep soil layer and dense vegetation coverage. However, the upstream canal could suffer from the long-term erosion and possibly cause slope toe collapse. In addition, the western watershed is the afforestation zone whereas the eastern watershed is natural forest zone with higher development ratio. The upslope forest management of eastern and western watershed should be discussed variously.",

            "abstract": "Authigenic U concentrations have been used as an indicator of redox state in marine sediments. Soluble U(VI) in porewaters is reduced to insoluble U(IV) under suboxic conditions setting up a diffusion gradient through which U in bottom waters is supplied to reducing sediments. Researchers have used sedimentary redox enrichment of U as a tool to identify past redox changes, which may be caused by changes in organic carbon rain rates and/or bottom water oxygen levels. Differentiating between these two explanations is important, as the former is tied to the use of authigenic U as a paleoproductivity proxy.\nWe examined sediments from 4 sediment cores retrieved from two different localities in the Panama Basin in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Two cores were retrieved from the northern Panama basin at the Cocos Ridge, (4JC at 5° 44.7’N 85° 45.5’ W, 1730 m depth; 8JC at 6° 14.0’N 86° 2.6’ W, 1993 m depth), and two were retrieved from the south at the Carnegie Ridge, (11JC at 0° 41.6’S 85° 20.0’ W, 2452 m depth; 17JC at 0° 10.8’S 85° 52.0’ W, 2846 m depth). Using 230Th systematics and seismic profiling at each of the sites, we’ve identified significant sediment winnowing (4JC and 11JC) and focusing (8JC and 17JC). At all sites, we believe that changes in age-model-derived sand (i.e., >63µm) mass accumulation rates (MAR) best represent changes in rain rates. Glacial rain rates are higher than those in the Holocene by a factor of 2-3 at both sites. Peak Mn levels (>1%), the brown-to-green color transition (which likely represents the oxic/post-oxic boundary), and peak U concentrations all appear in the same order with increasing depth down core. At the Carnegie sites, where MARs are greater than those at the Cocos sites, increases in authigenic U (up to 4 ppm) occur during the mid- to late Holocene at depths of 10-15 cm. At the Cocos sites, increases in authigenic U (up to 12 ppm) occur lower in the sediment column (25-30 cm) during the late glacial. The decrease in sediment MAR (and, likely, productivity) between the last glacial and the Holocene has most likely driven the syndiagenetic enrichment of U at these sites by diffusion of bottom water U to slightly beyond the oxic/post-oxic boundary. Hence, changing bottom water oxygen levels are not a requirement to explain authigenic U concentrations in eastern equatorial Pacific sediments.",

In many cases, the impacts of the drought on the agricultural productivity has been severe, as farmers have struggled to maintain the crop water requirements with limited resources available from surface water deliveries and groundwater pumping. In this study, we aim to identify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity in the Walker River Basin. In order to develop a better understand of the regional agricultural economic impacts and potential mitigation strategies, we quantify the value of surface water along with supplemental groundwater pumping. Specifically, we analyze changes in potential crop production (both quantity and revenue) and the associated conjunctive use of available surface water and groundwater in both dry and warm climates.",

            "abstract": "Hydrological disaster relief expenditure accounts for as much as 70 percent of total expenditure of disasters occurring in Korea. Since the response to and recovery of disasters are normally based on previous experiences, there have been limitations when dealing with ever-increasing localized heavy rainfall with short range in the era of climate change. Therefore, it became necessary to establish a system that can respond to a disaster in advance through the analysis and prediction of hydrometeorological information.\nBecause a wide range of big data is essential, it cannot be done by a single agency only. That is why the three hydrometeorology-related agencies cooperated to establish a pilot (trial) system at Soemjingang basin in 2013. The three governmental agencies include the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in charge of disaster prevention and public safety, the National Geographic Information Institute (NGII under Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport) in charge of geographical data, and the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) in charge of weather information.\nThis pilot system was designed to be able to respond to disasters in advance through providing a damage prediction information for flash flood to public officers for safety part using high resolution precipitation prediction data provided by the KMA and high precision geographic data by NGII. To produce precipitation prediction data with high resolution, the KMA conducted downscaling from 25km×25km global model to 3km×3km local model and is running the local model twice a day.\nTo maximize the utility of weather prediction information, the KMA is providing the prediction information for 7 days with 1 hour interval at Soemjingang basin to monitor and predict not only flood but also drought.\nAs no prediction is complete without a description of its uncertainty, it is planned to continuously develop the skills to improve the uncertainty of the prediction on weather and its impact. I will introduce more the flow chart to produce and provide the weather prediction information in AGU fall meeting.",

            "abstract": "Offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas can be significantly and adversely affected by sea ice. In the event of an oil spill, sea ice complicates the tracking of ice/oil trajectories and can hinder cleanup operations. There is a need for a sea ice dynamics model that can accurately simulate ice pack deformation and failure to improve the ability to track ice/oil trajectories and support oil response operations.\nA discrete element method (DEM) model, where each ice floe is represented by discrete elements that are initially bonded (frozen) together will be used to address the difficulty continuum modeling approaches have with representing discrete phenomena in sea ice, such as the formation of leads and ridges. Each discrete element in the DEM is a rigid body driven by environmental forcing (wind, current and Coriolis forces) and interaction forces with other discrete elements (compression, shear, tension, bond rupture and regrowth).\nWe introduce a new DEM model ``Siku'', currently under development, to simulate ice drift of an ice floe on a spherical Earth. We will present initial free-drift results. Siku is focused on improving sea ice interaction mechanics and providing an accurate geometrical representation needed for basin scale and regional simulations. Upon completion, Siku will be an open source GNU GPL licensed user friendly program with embedded python capability for setting up simulations “scenarios” and coupling with other models to provide forcing fields. We use a unique quaternion representation for position and orientation of polygon sea-ice elements that use a second order integration scheme of sea-ice element motion on the Earth’s sphere that does not depend on the location of the element and, hence, avoids numerical problems near the pole.",

            "abstract": "Wave-current dynamics in wave focal zones in exposed coastal inlets and river mouths are still poorly understood. This is in part due to lack of observations, which are complicated due to the presence of energetic waves, strong (tidal) currents, dynamic seabed morphology, and often busy ship traffic. Conventional (fixed) instruments, such as buoys and bottom-mounted current or pressure sensors, are difficult to maintain in such areas, and the spatial variability of the wave field is difficult to capture with single point measurements, or even arrays of fixed measurements. In addition to the observational difficulties, the effects of e.g. current shear, wave blocking, statistical inhomogeneity [see Smit & Janssen, 2013, J. Phys. Ocean., 43, pp 1741-1758], and nonlinearity [see Janssen & Herbers, 2009, J. Phys Ocean., 39, pp 1948-1964] on wave statistics are not fully understood, not accounted for in operational stochastic wave models, and – as a consequence – often ignored. In this paper, we consider new observational data of waves approaching the Mouth of the Columbia River undergoing bottom refraction and strong wave-current interaction. The data were collected during the 2013 ONR RIVET experiment using an array of free drifting wave-current buoys. The Lagrangian instruments capture the spatial variability of the wave field in the inlet and, by deploying them in large ensembles, resolve the (inhomogeneous and nonlinear) wave statistics in the focal zone. We discuss the use of free-drifting instruments to measure wave statistics in a coastal wave focal zone, consider the observed effects of wave inhomogeneity, and show that non-Gaussian effects are important and affect extreme wave occurrences in the Mouth of the Columbia River.",

            "abstract": "Abundant kinetic processes occur in the separatrix layer (SL) that separates the reconnection inflow and exhaust. Electron behavior in the SL, such as violation of the frozen-in condition and enhancement of non-gyrotropy, are distinct from those in the inflow and exhaust, but may be closely related to similar features in the electron diffusion region (EDR). Here we report distinct types of electron distribution functions (EDFs) in the SL within the ion diffusion region at various reconnection evolution stages from 2D PIC simulation and Cluster observation results. In the inflow-side of the SL, the EDFs exhibit a temperature anisotropy as in the inflow region, and pronounced field-aligned electron beams propagate towards the X-line with higher energies than the main inflow population. Electrons with high perpendicular velocities are only found in the outflow-side of the SL at early times, while at later times, electrons in the inflow-side of the SL also acquire high perpendicular energies. In the outflow side of the SL, apart from the separatrix, a long narrow belt-shaped region of enhanced non-gyrotropy extends from the EDR edge to beyond the ion diffusion region. The region of enhanced non-gyrotropy marks the boundary for how far away from the mid-plane accelerated electrons may propagate along reconnected field lines. Between the separatrix and the region of enhanced non-gyrotropy, EDFs are similar to those in the inflow-side of the SL. EDFs in the outflow-side of the non-gyrotropy region show signatures of electrons with high perpendicular energies from the EDR, and are more isotropic than those in inflow-side of the non-gyrotropy region. The distinct features in EDFs provide guidance to infer satellite locations with respect to the separatrix and to study electron heating across the separatrix.",

            "abstract": "Reliable three component magnetic borehole data allow us to constrain the paleomagnetic history in the subsurface, as it can be used to determine the direction of remnant magnetization of drilled layers and aid with the reorientation of drill core samples. The declination of magnetization, which cannot be determined from azimuthally unoriented core samples, is especially important because it yields direct information about the orientation of a tectonic plate at the time of magnetization.\nDuring IODP Expedition 351 in the Amami Sankaku Basin 600 m of sediment between 600 mbsf and 1200 mbsf were investigated with the Göttinger Borehole Magnetometer (GBM) in order to constrain the rotational history of the Philippine Sea Plate. This contributes supplementary information to constrain the initiatial tectonic configuration following subduction initiation in the Izu-Bonin Mariana System and the subsequent plate motions.\nIn a preliminary processing of the data, the magnetic field vector along the borehole was calculated by using the data of the GBMs orientational sensors to rotate the magnetic field vector from the tool’s reference frame into the geographic reference frame. This provides an initial assessment of the magnetic properties of the environmental structures by comparing the dataset to the magnetic field produced by the natural remnant magnetization and to the induced magnetic flux density influenced by the susceptibility of the drilled layers. Additionally this aids with the evaluation of the data quality and allows an assessment of the future processing strategy to find the magnetization vector.",

            "abstract": "Many tropical countries are now working on developing their strategies for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, including activities that result in conservation or enhancement of forest carbon stocks and sustainable management of forests to effectively decrease atmospheric carbon emissions (i.e. REDD+). A new international REDD+ agreement is at the heart of recent negotiations of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). REDD+ mechanisms could provide an opportunity to not only diminish an important source of emissions, but also to promote large-scale conservation of tropical forests and establish incentives and opportunities to alleviate poverty. Most tropical countries still lack basic information for developing and implementing their forest carbon stock assessments, including the extent of forest area and the rate at which forests are being cleared and/or degraded, and the carbon amounts associated with these losses. These same countries also need support to conduct integrated assessments of the most promising approaches for reducing emissions, and in identifying those policy options that hold the greatest potential while minimizing potential negative impacts of REDD+ policies. The WHRC SERVIR project in East Africa is helping to provide these data sets to countries via best practice tools and methods to support cost effective forest carbon monitoring solutions and more informed decision making processes under REDD+. We will present the results of our capacity building activites in the region and planned future efforts being coordinated with the NASA-SERVIR Hub in Kenya to support to REDD+ decision support.",

            "abstract": "The spatial variability of precipitation has a great influence on the quantity and quality of runoff water generated from hydrological processes. In practice, point rainfall measurements (e.g., rain gauges) are often used to represent areal rainfall in catchments. The spatial rainfall variability is difficult to be precisely captured even with many rain gauges. Thus the rainfall uncertainty due to spatial variability should be taken into account in order to provide reliable rainfall-driven process modelling results. This study investigates the uncertainty of areal rainfall estimation due to rainfall spatial variability if point measurements are applied.\nThe areal rainfall is usually estimated as a weighted sum of data from available point measurements. The expected error of areal rainfall estimates is 0 if the estimation is an unbiased one. The variance of the error between the real and estimated areal rainfall is evaluated to indicate the uncertainty of areal rainfall estimates. This error variance can be expressed as a function of variograms, which was originally applied in geostatistics to characterize a spatial variable. The variogram can be evaluated using measurements from a dense rain gauge network.\nThe areal rainfall errors are evaluated in two areas with distinct climate regimes and rainfall patterns: Greater Lyon area in France and Melbourne area in Australia. The variograms of the two areas are derived based on 6-minute rainfall time series data from 2010 to 2013 and are then used to estimate uncertainties of areal rainfall represented by different numbers of point measurements in synthetic catchments of various sizes. The error variance of areal rainfall using one point measurement in the centre of a 1-km2 catchment is 0.22 (mm/h)2 in Lyon. When the point measurement is placed at one corner of the same-size catchment, the error variance becomes 0.82 (mm/h)2 also in Lyon. Results for Melbourne were similar but presented larger uncertainty. Results indicated that the errors of areal rainfall intensities become more significant as the size of the catchment increases and can be decreased with more rain gauges placed in a catchment. The quantified areal rainfall uncertainty benefits further uncertainty analysis in rainfall-driven process modelling.",

However, large spatial coverage and short timescale notwithstanding, low spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture data has been frequently treated as major research problem in many studies, which suggested statistical or deterministic downscaling method as a solution to obtain targeted spatial resolutions. This study suggests a methodology to downscale 10 km and 25 km daily L3 volumetric soil moisture datasets from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) in 2013 in Northeast Asia using Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the presented methodology, hydrometeorological variables observed from satellite remote sensing which have physically significant relationship with soil moisture are chosen as predictor variables to estimate soil moisture in finer resolution. Separate downscaling algorithms optimized for seasonal conditions are applied to achieve more accurate results of downscaled soil moisture. A comparative analysis between in-situ and downscaled soil moisture is also conducted for quantitatively assessing its accuracy. Further application can be carried out in hydrological modeling or prediction of extreme weather phenomena in fine spatial resolution based on the results of this study.",

This ongoing study conducted in semi-arid juniper woodlands in central Oregon aims to investigate how different ecologic and hydrologic components respond to the removal of overstory vegetation (i.e. juniper). The main objective is to characterize and compare ecohydrologic interactions occurring in treated (juniper removed) and untreated watersheds. Monitoring transects were established to determine vegetation-soil texture-soil water content relationships by aspect in both watersheds. Also, previously installed piezometers, soil moisture stations, and weather instrumentation were used to estimate precipitation-soil moisture-subsurface flow interactions in each watershed. Preliminary results suggest similarities in soil volumetric water content and vegetation composition when compared to aspect. Seasonal precipitation triggered an increase in soil water content at the deepest soil profile measured (80cm). This soil response and subsequent shallow groundwater level rise observed in selected piezometers seem to indicate a direct connectivity between precipitation, soil, and groundwater. These results were more evident in the treated watershed when compared to the untreated. Results from this study add to the understanding of hydrologic connectivity in semiarid watersheds.",

            "abstract": "The SST and SST gradient over the East China Sea (ECS) and the Northern South China Sea have large interannual variability in boreal winter and spring, especially in March and April. We investigated these SST and SST gradient anomalies and found the important role of these anomalies in the linkage between Asian winter and summer monsoon variability by using observational datasets during 1979-2012. The interannual variability of SST over the ECS in April shows significant warming trend. Of great interest is that the SST anomalies are confined around the ECS and not significantly related to the broad scale Pacific and Indian Ocean SST anomalies. These anomalies appear from boreal winter. The warmer SST anomalies in recent decades are well associated with the weakening of the northeasterly flow along the southern China, East Asian winter monsoon. It reduces the surface wind speed and tends to produce the warmer SST and less SST gradient during boreal winter by decreasing of evaporation and upwelling. These anomalies are maintained and enhanced until the climatological wind direction change in early summer. These warmer SST and less SST gradient anomalies lead to enhanced Meiyu rainfall over the southeastern part of China. This suggests that the increasing rainfall trend over the southern part of China in June indicated by Kajikawa et al (2012) can be explained by the weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon through the SST anomalies over the ECS.",

The purpose of this paper is to determine the potential in using microwave brightness temperature and emissivity data to monitor previous droughts and predict future ones. It is known that there is a relationship between the amount of moisture in the Earth’s surface and the microwave emissivity value of that area. Using microwave radiation at various frequencies, satellites sensors such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System(AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) have been collecting data to formulate the emissivity around the globe for the last few decades. Each satellite has gathered data at multiple frequencies and for this study, we focus on the lower frequencies because of their higher sensitivity to surface properties. These lower frequencies tend to be more valid because the signal is emitted from deeper layers in the surface. The Emissivity Microwave Polarization Difference Index (EMPDI) from this data is used and seasonal effects are eliminated by subtracting out the averages of each month. The global EMPDI values for an entire month are then placed in contrast with an independent indicator such as precipitation. Moreover, a drought severity test is performed using techniques that previously were deployed on precipitation data to investigate the potential of using microwave observations in drought monitoring, directly.",

West Virginia (WV) is a rural state. The majority of its residents live in communities of fewer than 2,500 people. Based on the features of the population being served and their unique strengths, this presentation focuses on a regional model for teacher professional development that addresses agricultural and energy vulnerabilities and adaptations to climate change in WV.\nThe professional development model outlined shows how to guide teachers to use a problem-based learning approach to introduce climate data and analysis techniques within a scenario context that is locally meaningful. This strategy engages student interest by focusing on regional and community concerns. Climate science standards are emphasized in the Next Generation Science Standards, but WV has not provided its teachers with appropriate instructional resources to meet those standards. The authors addressed this need by offering a series of climate science education workshops followed by online webinars offered to WV science educators free of charge with funding by the West Virginia Space Grant Consortium. The authors report on findings from this series of professional development workshops conducted in partnership with the West Virginia Science Teachers Association. The goal was to enhance grades 5-12 teaching and learning about climate change through problem-based learning.\nPrior to offering the climate workshops, all WV science educators were asked to complete a short questionnaire. As Figure 1 shows, over 40% of the teacher respondents reported being confident in teaching climate science content. For comparison post workshops surveys measure teacher confidence in climate science instruction after the professional development sessions. In summary, this report describes how this professional approach can serve as a regional model to address the need for climate science literacy throughout Appalachia.",

            "abstract": "Airborne and Landsat remote sensing are promising technologies for measuring the response of agricultural crops to variations in several agricultural inputs and environmental conditions. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is surface soil moisture, a key component of the soil water balance, which addresses water and energy exchanges at the surface/atmosphere interface and affects vegetation health. Its estimation using the spectral reflectance of agricultural fields could be of value to agricultural management decisions. While top soil moisture can be estimated using radiometric information from aircraft or satellites and data mining techniques, comparison of results from two different aerial platforms might be complicated because of the differences in spatial scales (high resolution of approximately 0.15m versus coarser resolutions of 30m). This paper presents a combined modeling and scale-based approach to evaluate the impact of spatial scaling in the estimation of surface soil moisture content derived from remote sensing data. Data from Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI and AggieAirTM aerial imagery are utilized. AggieAirTM is an airborne remote sensing platform developed by Utah State University that includes an autonomous Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) which captures radiometric information at visual, near-infrared, and thermal wavebands at spatial resolutions of 0.15 m or smaller for the optical cameras and about 0.6 m or smaller for the thermal infrared camera. Top soil moisture maps for AggieAir and Landsat are developed and statistically compared at different scales to determine the impact in terms of quantitative predictive capability and feasibility of applicability of results in improving in field management.",

The use of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy of photosynthesis at the ecosystem scale (Gross Primary Production, GPP) is a critical emerging technology. Satellite measurements of SIF were found to be significantly correlated with GPP, and several ground campaigns suggested that SIF could improve the GPP estimation. However, the robustness of using SIF as a proxy for GPP under different climate conditions, growth stages and vegetation types has not been explored. Here we presented the first-ever high-frequency (every 5 minutes) measurement of SIF in a temperate deciduous forest across the growing season of 2013. Concurrently, we estimated GPP with the eddy covariance method. We found a strong linear relationship between daily mean SIF and GPP (r2=0.725), and between SIF and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (r2=0.705). The seasonal patterns of ground and satellite-derived SIF matched well. These results suggest strong evidence that SIF is a good proxy for direct measurements of canopy photosynthesis.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that the climate history of many millennia is recorded by the stable isotope ratios of ice from polar ice sheets. Indeed the use of stable isotope ratios as a proxy for past temperature has been considered a gold standard in establishing regional climate change near proxy locations. It is also known that environmental factors other than temperature can significantly influence the isotopic ratios of ice. Recognizing that multiple factors are at play introduces some ambiguity in simple interpretations, but also suggests the records are underutilized if interpretations focus solely on temperature. As a case in point, we consider isotope records from Greenland snow. To disentangle the various processes that may influence these isotope ratios (condensation temperature, atmospheric circulation, post deposition vapor-snow exchange, cloud microphysics), both an adequate model and the relevant data are required. Advances in measurement technologies now allow many of the appropriate data to be collected, and models can be developed to capture some of the additional processes that are now observed. The mechanistic approach offered by the model allows a quantitative explanation of post deposition change in snow isotopic composition and shows that variability in the isotope ratio of vapor over ice sheets is an important control. Boundary layer conditions and the frequency of synoptic-scale storms emerge as critical factors influencing vapor isotope ratios and therefore are potentially reconstructable from the ice record. We show that many of the variations over the last glacial cycle accredited to local temperature are accompanied with changes in the frequency of storms and changes in the structure of the boundary layer over the ice sheet. Since these mechanisms correlate with temperature, our findings provide a fundamental basis for why the isotope record is a robustly traces the climate history, whose quantitative interpretation need not be limited to temperature alone.",

            "abstract": "South Africa is host to the largest single known platinum group metal supply in the world. The Bushveld Igneous Complex, spanning 300x400 kilometers, hosts hundreds of years’ worth of platinum, chromite, vanadium, and other ore. Its wealth of these metals is tied directly to the large layered igneous intrusion that formed roughly 2061 million years ago. The extraction of platinum is vital to the industrial world – as these metals are widely used in the automotive industry, dental restorations, computer technology, in addition to many other applications. In collaboration with the Africa Array geophysics field school and the Penn State Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP), we surveyed the Modikwa mine located along the border of the provinces of Mpumalanga and Limpopo in South Africa. The following techniques were applied to survey the area of interest: seismic refraction and reflection, gravity, magnetics, electrical resistivity, and electromagnetics. The data collected were used to determine the depth to bedrock and to identify potential mining hazards from dykes and faults in the bedrock. Several areas were studied and with the combination of the above-mentioned methods several possible hazards were identified. One broad, major dyke that was located in a prior aeromagnetic survey and several previously undetected, parallel, minor dykes were identified in the region. The overburden thickness was determined to be ̴4-5 meters in some regions, and as thin as several centimeters in others. This section of rock and soil lies above an area where platinum will likely be mined in the future. The removal of overburden can be accomplished by using power shovels or scrapers; while remaining material can be contained with the use of galvanized steel culverts. Additionally, a number of joints were located that may have allowed water to accumulate underground. The models created from the data permit us to estimate which hazards could be present in different parts of the land surveyed. These results are important information that will help determine how deep to mine while also avoiding hazards that could result in serious injuries to personnel or cause costly damages to equipment.",

These experiences are very important precepts for the world people who live in earthquake and tsunami countries. We are collecting the testimonies of tsunami survivors to clarify successful evacuation process and to make clear the characteristic physical behaviors of tsunami near coast. We research 2 tsunami events, 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and 2010 Mentawai slow earthquake tsunami. Many video and photographs were taken by people at some places in 2004 Indian ocean tsunami disaster; nevertheless these were few restricted points. We didn't know the tsunami behavior in another place. In this study, we tried to collect extensive information about tsunami behavior not only in many places but also wide time range after the strong shake. In Mentawai case, the earthquake occurred in night, so there are no impressive photos. To collect detail information about evacuation process from tsunamis, we contrived the interview method. This method contains making pictures of tsunami experience from the scene of victims’ stories. In 2004 Aceh case, all survivors didn't know tsunami phenomena. Because there were no big earthquakes with tsunami for one hundred years in Sumatra region, public people had no knowledge about tsunami. This situation was highly improved in 2010 Mentawai case. TV programs and NGO or governmental public education programs about tsunami evacuation are widespread in Indonesia. Many people know about fundamental knowledge of earthquake and tsunami disasters. We made drill book based on victim’s stories and painted impressive scene of 2 events. We used the drill book in disaster education event in school committee of west Java. About 80 % students and teachers evaluated that the contents of the drill book are useful for correct understanding.",

As part of MATERHORN, field campaigns were conducted at Dugway, UT, USA in Autumn 2012 and Spring 2013. A subset of the campaigns included dense observations along the East Slope of Granite Peak (40.096° N, -113.253° W), as well as additional observations on the opposing west facing slope. East Slope observations included five multi-sonic anemometer eddy covariance towers (two with full energy budget stations), eleven small energy budget stations, fifteen automated weather stations, a distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system, hot-film anemometry, infrared camera surface temperature observations and up to three Doppler lidars. West Slope operations were less intense with three main towers, two of which included sonic anemometry and one, which included full surface energy balance observations. For this presentation, our analysis will focus on characterizing and contrasting the response of mean wind circulations and thermodynamics variables, as well as turbulence quantities during the evening transitions on both the East Slope and West Slope when solar irradiation differences of the slope surfaces is extremely large.",

Here we present an analytical model that ties H2 production to seafloor spreading rates and the cooling of oceanic lithosphere. If the assumptions underpinning our simplistic model are largely correct, we estimate that global H2 production by the serpentinization of peridoitite within oceanic-lithosphere may be as large as ~9.7x1012 moles H2/year, which is within one or two orders of magnitude of any previous estimates. The model, however, also predicts where globally H2 production should be greatest as well as how far from the axis of a mid-oceanic ridge H2 production should remain significant. We could not rigorously test our model due to sparse and varied measurements of H2 globally however the model suggests a number of systematic relationships and testable predications for future field-based studies. To demonstrate the potential validity and implications our results, we evaluate where all the free-H2 predicted by the model may go given the limited amount known about the H2 budget within the oceans.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of our study is to identify and quantify global-scale risks which can be caused by future climate change. In particular, we focus on the global-scale risks which have critical impacts to human environments. Use of impact functions is one of the common way to quantify global-scale risks. Output of impact function is climate impacts (e.g. economic damage by temperature increasing) and input can be global temperature increasing and/or socioeconomic condition (e.g. GDP). As the first step of study, we referred to AR5 WG II report (AR5, hereafter) and comprehensive inventories of climate change risks developed by Strategic R&D Area Project of the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (ICA-RUS project). Then we extracted information which can be used to develop impact function from them. By following SPM/AR5, we focused on 11 sectors and extracted quantitative description on climate impacts from the AR5 and paper/reports cited in AR5. As a result, we identified about 40 risk items to focus as global-scale risks by climate change. Using the collected information, we tentatively made impact function on sea level rise and so on. In addition, we also extracted the impact functions used in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). The literature survey on IAM suggested the risk items considered in IAMs are limited. For instance, although FUND model provides detailed impact functions compared with most of other IAMs, its impact functions deal with only several sectors (e.g. agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, sea level rise, human health, energy demand and water resources). The survey on impact functions in IAMs also suggested impact function for abrupt climate change (so-called Tipping Element) is premature. Moreover, as example for quantifying health risk by our calculation, we also present the result on global-scale projection of the health burden attributable to childhood undernutrition (Ishida et al., 2014, ERL).",

The different treatments consist of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, enhanced nitrate deposition, as well as higher temperatures and precipitation rates. A representative portion of the above ground vegetation from each plot is harvested. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different climate conditions on the phosphorus content and phosphorus cycling in terrestrial plants. Since phosphorus only has one stable isotope, the δ18O signature in phosphate is used as a proxy to investigate phosphorus cycling. Although this technique has been successful in determining phosphorous cycling in aquatic systems, only a few studies have used this approach for terrestrial ecosystems. We analyzed the δ18O of the most abundant grass from each of the plots and treatments. The δ18O values of each sample are compared to elemental budgets of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous for correlation as well as soil enzyme activities. and the combination of measures are assessed as indicators for phosphorus limitation in each respective treatment site and provide a better understanding of phosphorus cycling in annual grasslands and the potential effects of climate change on phosphorus cycling.",

TWINS (Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers) provides ENA (Energetic Neutral Atom) images on a nearly continuous basis over a broad energy range (1-100 keV/amu). CIMI (Comprehensive Inner-Magnetosphere Ionosphere) model combines the ability to simulate ring\ncurrent dynamics solving for particle distributions and corresponding ENA fluxes with the ability to calculate radiation belt particle fluxes and inner plasma sheet electron precipitation. For each storm, the TWINS Storm Catalog provides 1-hour-samples ENA images, corresponding deconvolved 2D equatorial ion number flux and pitch angle anisotropy, and the energy spectrum and pitch angle distribution at the position of the peak of the number flux. Also included for direct comparison are results from CIMI simulations for the same quantities. The catalog is available to all interested parties.\nIt will be shown how users of the Catalog will have the opportunity to perform a number of studies related to the dynamics of the ring current during geomagnetic storms. For example, the storms cataloged to date show trends in changes of the energy spectrum from high energy tails deficient in ions as compared to a Maxwellian, to a high energy tail and finally approaching a Maxwellian. Likewise, pitch angle distributions are shown to evolve from having more perpendicular than parallel ions to a nearly isotropic distribution. It is also possible to investigate differences in ring current behavior for CIR and ICME driven storms.\nIt is to be noted that in this context, opportunities for results from the measurements and simulations on a finer time scale, for spectra as a function of equatorial position, and similarly for pitch angle distributions are available by request.",

            "abstract": "The Philippine Sea Plate is thought to have undergone a 90° clockwise rotation during the last 55 million years. However, evidences for such an argument are rather circumstantial. For instance, paleomagnetic measurements for the large rotation are derived largely from Halmahera, Indonesia which is quite close to the plate boundary. It is thus possible that this region may have undergone local deformation separate from the main parts of the Philippine Sea Plate. In this study, we examine the global seismic tomography images of the mantle beneath the Philippine Sea Plate and the marine magnetic field anomaly data at the sea surface from the West Philippine Basin to see whether they agree with the presumed motion of the Philippine Sea Plate. Our comparison between the plate reconstruction and global tomography suggests that the rotation of Philippine Sea Plate may not have been continuous but instead experienced a temporal break at around 32 Ma. The exact nature of this pause is uncertain, but it may be related to a sudden change in the configuration of subduction systems. A detail comparison with recent results from IODP Legs 350 and 351 is therefore necessary, including a search for a change in the depositional style of basin sediment. We also examined the detailed the shape of magnetic anomalies (such as skewness) and compare them with the previous model by allowing the magnetization to have direction corresponding to that during the opening of the West Philippine Basin. At this moment, it is too early to tell if the sudden change at around 32 Ma or other inferred breaks can be seen in the magnetic profiles as well.",

In the WM type, precipitation rate was high (low) along the Japan Sea side (the Pacific Ocean side) of Japan. The latitude effect was recognized in δ18O in precipitation around Japan. The d-excess (= δD – 8 × δ18O) in precipitation and evaporation were more than 15‰ around Japan. Simulated water vapor evaporated from the Japan Sea was predominant all over Japan, except for the southwestern islands of Japan. A portion of this moisture moved eastward to the Pacific Ocean; however, the moisture did not contribute to the total amount of precipitation along the Pacific Ocean side of Japan because of the small amount of precipitation there. In contrast, precipitation rate was high across Japan in the EC type. The δ18O in precipitation showed the latitude effect and the amount effect around Japan. The d-excess in precipitation and evaporation were below 15‰ around Japan, except for the East China Sea. Simulated water vapor evaporated from the Pacific Ocean was predominant all over Japan. Along the Japan Sea side of Japan, δ18O was 2‰ higher and d-excess was 9‰ higher in the WM type than in the EC type. We found the linkage between the isotopic composition and the precipitation origins in winter along the Japan Sea side of Japan. Such information is required for a variety of paleo-climate and hydrology studies.",

            "abstract": "Water resources managers attempt to operate reservoir and hydropower systems to maximize system objectives, subject to a host of physical and policy constraints, and in light of uncertainty about future conditions. Optimization models are widely used to advise the decision making process. An important aspect of such models is how uncertainties related to future hydrologic and economic conditions are represented, and the extent to which different uncertainty representations affect the quality of recommended decisions. This study explores the consequences of different uncertainty representations in stochastic optimization models of hydropower systems by comparing simulated system performance using different stochastic optimization models. An important question is whether the added computational burden from greater uncertainty resolution (which can be prohibitive for operational models in many cases) actually improves model recommendations. This is particularly relevant as more complex, ensemble forecasts are incorporated into short- and mid-term planning models. Another important consideration is how watershed hydrology (both seasonal and episodic characteristics), system size, economic context, and the temporal resolution of the model influence how uncertainty should be represented. These topics are explored through several US examples including a sampling stochastic dynamic programming (SSDP) model of a small single-reservoir system on the Kennebec River in Maine, and a stochastic programming model of the large multi-reservoir Federal Columbia River system in the Pacific Northwest. These studies highlight the importance of flexible model frameworks which allow exploration of different representations of a system and of uncertainties before locking operational decision support system development into a specific representation.",

Grazing is the main kind of human activities on the alpine grassland. To investigate the relationship of the grazing activities and grassland degradation will help the understanding of the effects of human impacts. A GPS tracing experiment was designed to tracing the activities of the Yaks. The spatial distribution of the grazing pressure was simulated under Geographic Information System. The biomass distribution and grazing pressure was compared to judge the distribution of overgrazing. The main research results are: (1) The tracing experiment could record the track of the Yaks very well, and it could be a good tool for the quantification research of grazing pressure. (2) The grazing activities have good relationship with vegetation, residents and landform. The worse vegetation is, the grazing time is longer and the radius is bigger. The closer to the residents, the grazing intensive is higher. The grazing route is influenced by the landform. Usually the herds would like to choose the least cost way. And the grazing intensive is higher in sunny slope. (3) The grazing probability is higher while the elevation is lower and the vegetation is better. The numbers of livestock of different villages determine the spatial distribution of the grazing pressure but it has very big\nheterogeneity\nin the same village. It seems the forage is enough in the research area since the available biomass is about 1190058t and the total demand is only 603700t. But because of the heterogeneity of the grazing pressure, there are still overgrazing in some villages. The area of overgrazing is 6 percent in the winter rangeland and 11 percent in summer rangeland.\nIt is important to take care of the spatial heterogeneity of the grazing pressure and grass production in the management of the grassland ecosystem. It should improve the calculation method of the stock capacity to avoid the overrating of it. To arrange the livestock reasonably is the guarantee of the sustainable development in this region.",

            "abstract": "Blue water withdrawals in the United States since 1950 show a remarkable pattern. After doubling between 1950 and 1980, water use slightly declined in spite of a doubling in GDP, 30 percent population growth and a 70 percent increase in per capita GDP since 1980. We relate this remarkable pattern to the changing long-term structural changes of the U.S. economy as it became a service economy, experiencing a decrease in relative share of manufacturing and a secular decline in agriculture. Drawing on Leontief (1970)’s seminal analysis, we decompose the U.S. water use in terms of scale, composition and technology. We find that about 1/3 of water saving can be attributed to shifting final demand by domestic and foreign buyers for U.S. products; slightly more than a 1/3 relates to the changing input output structure that characterizes U.S. production, and less than 1/3 is to be attributed to water productivity gains related to improvements in technology. In addition, our estimates indicate that the vast majority of the water productivity gains due to technological improvements stem from gains in water/KWh in electricity generation. Finally, while globalization and the growing water content of net imports increased for the U.S. since 1950, they by no means overturn the increased water saving due to changing sectoral composition of the U.S. economy.",

Whereas WDS is in process of aggregating and harmonizing the metadata collections of its membership, it is clear that additional benefits can be obtained by supplementing such traditional metadata sources with information about members, authors, and the coverages of the data, as well as metrics such as citation indices, quality indicators, and usability.\nMoreover, the relationships between the actors and systems that populate this metadata landscape can be seen as a knowledge network that describes a subset of global scientific endeavor. Such a knowledge network is useful in many ways, supporting both machine-based and human requests for contextual information related to a specific data set, institution, author, topic, or other entities in the network. Specific use cases that can be realized include decision and policy support for funding agencies, identification of collaborators, ranking of data sources, availability of data for specific coverages, and many more.\nThe paper defines the scope of and conceptual background to such a knowledge network, discusses some initial work done by WDS to establish the network, and proposes an implementation model for rapid operationalization. In this model, established interests such as DataCite, ORCID, and CrossRef have well-defined roles, and the standards, services, and registries required to build a community-maintained, scalable knowledge network is presented. We conclude with a short discussion on feasibility and sustainability of global data infrastructure, the role of the WDS Knowledge Network in this infrastructure, and the necessary conditions for success.",

The increasing SLR rate poses a severe threat to the low-lying land surface and the shallow groundwater system in the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, resulting in saltwater intrusion and groundwater induced flooding. A three-dimensional groundwater flow and salinity transport model is implemented to investigate and evaluate the extent of floods due to rising water table as well as saltwater intrusion. The SEAWAT model is chosen to solve the variable-density groundwater flow and salinity transport governing equations and simulate the regional-scale spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater level and chloride concentration. The horizontal resolution of the model is 50 m, and the vertical domain includes both the Surficial Aquifer and the Floridan Aquifer. The numerical model is calibrated based on the observed hydraulic head and chloride concentration. The potential impacts of sea level rise on saltwater intrusion and groundwater induced flooding are assessed under various sea level rise scenarios. Based on the simulation results, the potential landward movement of saltwater and freshwater fringe is projected. The existing water supply wells are examined overlaid with the projected salinity distribution map. The projected Surficial Aquifer water tables are overlaid with data of high resolution land surface elevation, land use and land cover, and infrastructure to assess the potential impacts of sea level rise. This study provides useful tools for decision making on ecosystem management, water supply planning, and facility management.",

            "abstract": "Indium is an increasingly important metal in semiconductors and electronics, and its use is growing rapidly as a semiconductive coating (as indium tin oxide) for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and flat panel displays. It also has uses in important energy technologies such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic cells. Despite its rapid increase in use, very little is known about the environmental behavior of indium, and concerns are being raised over the potential health effects of this emerging metal contaminant.\nOne source of indium to the environment is acid mine drainage from the mining of lead, zinc, and copper sulfides. In our previous studies of a stream in Colorado influenced by acid mine drainage from lead and zinc mining activities, indium concentrations were found to be 10,000 times those found in uncontaminated rivers. However, the speciation and mobility of indium could not be reliably modeled because sorption constants to environmental sorbents have not been determined. In this study, we generate sorption constants for indium to ferrihydrite in the laboratory over a range of pHs, sorbent to sorbate ratios, and ionic strengths. Ferrihydrite is one of the most important sorbents in natural systems, and sorption to amorphous iron oxides such as ferrihydrite is thought to be one of the main removal mechanisms of metals from the dissolved phase in aqueous environments. Because of its relatively low solubility, we also find that indium hydroxide precipitation can dominate indium’s partitioning at micromolar concentrations of indium. This precipitation may be important in describing indium’s behavior in our study stream in Colorado, where modeling sorption to iron-oxides does not explain the complete removal of indium from the dissolved phase when the pH of the system is artificially raised to above 8. This study contributes much-needed data about indium’s aqueous behavior, in order to better understand its fate, transport, and impacts in the environment.",

Ice plant invasion is facilitated by the plant's ability to compete for water. More frequent drought due to climate change could enhance the invasive potential of ice plant due to its succulent properties and potential to access and compete for water under drought conditions. However, ice plant spread may be slowed due to water stress under drought despite a potential competitive advantage. We test the alternative hypotheses that invasive potential increases or decreases during times of drought by analyzing ice plant spread during past droughts at Bodega Bay, California using analysis of aerial photographs taken over the last two decades. The results of this analysis may reveal how ice plant may behave in future drought years and provide useful information for invasive species management.",

These faults juxtapose the Oaxaca terrane against the Mixteca and Juarez terranes, respectively. The Oaxaca Fault also forms the eastern boundary of the Cenozoic Tehuacan depression. Several gravity profiles across these faults and the Oaxaca terrane (including the Tehuacan Valley) enables us to establish the upper crustal structure of this region. Accordingly, the Oaxaca terrane is downward displaced to the east in two steps. First the Santa Lucia Fault puts into contact the granulitic basamental rocks with Phanerozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Finally, the Gavilan Fault puts into contact the Oaxaca terrane basement (Oaxaca Complex) into contact with the volcano-sedimentary infill of the valley. This gravity study reveals that the Oaxaca Fault system gives rise to a series of east tilted basamental blocks (Oaxaca Complex?). A structural high at the western Tehuacan depression accomadates the east dipping faults (Santa Lucia and Gavilan faults) and the west dipping faults of the Oaxaca Fault System. To the west of this high structural we have the depper depocenters. The Oaxaca Complex, the Caltepec and Santa Lucia faults continue northwestwards beneath Phanerozoic rocks. The faults are regional tectonic structures. They seem to continue northwards below the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

            "abstract": "Monitoring changes in mass over scales of several meters to hundreds of meters or more has many applications to characterization of the Critical Zone, including assessing changes in soil moisture, erosion or deposition of sediment, and melting or accumulation of snow or ice. A technique has been developed to monitor average changes in mass on those scales using continuous high-resolution measurements of displacement made with a vertical extensometer (called a DELTA extensometer). An increase of mass above the extensometer causes the soil to contract, which causes the extensometer to function similar to a weighing lysimeter.\nDELTA extensometers have been deployed at field sites near Clemson, South Carolina, and in northern Texas. The extensometers in South Carolina are in saprolite derived from biotite gneiss, whereas the ones in Texas are in clayey silt underlying playas. The instruments are in the vadose zone at depths of 3m to 6m. Signals from co-located extensometers are remarkably similar, demonstrating reproducibility of the technique. The extensometers respond to loading from a person or vehicle, and this load is used to estimate the Young’s modulus of soil enveloping the extensometer. Displacement during small to moderate rainfalls is typically linear with the accumulated rain (~0.2 micron/mm of rain, for example). The displacement levels out during large rainfalls, potentially due to the onset of overland flow that would limit the water load during precipitation. This suggests that the onset of overland flow could be evaluated using this technique. Seasonal temperature fluctuations at the soil surface can penetrate to the depths of the extensometers causing displacement from thermal expansion and contraction. Thermal effects account for approximately 100 μm of displacement over an annual cycle at one instrument. It appears that much of the thermal signal can be removed by data analysis. Pore pressure changes in the vicinity of the extensometer can also affect displacement and we are currently measuring pressures in an effort to identify this component of the signal. At one of the Texas sites, a series of step-like compressions totally 100 microns accompanied several rainfalls as water accumulated and filled the playa.",

Here we address the finite-amplitude behavior of a slope eddy after formation as a cut-off meander over the Charleston Bump, including its structure, propagation, and emergent submesoscale interior and neighboring substructure, as simulated in very high resolution simulations (dx=150m) of the Gulf Stream along the U.S. seaboard. A very rich submesoscale structure is revealed inside the slope eddy. Meander-induced frontogenesis sharpens the gradients and triggers submesoscale barotropic shear instability on the rim of the eddy. The small scale meandering perturbations become rolled up vortices which are advected back in the interior of the slope eddy. The slope eddy also locally creates a strong southward flow against the shelf leading to boundary generation of centrifugal instability. To illustrate and quantify the impact of a slope eddy in trapping material, generating cross-shelf exchanges and in mixing tracer properties, virtual Lagrangian particles are deployed in the model solutions. We discuss in particular diabatic mixing by the submesoscale processes.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the depth extent of mantle thermal aging beneath ocean basins, we project 3D Voigt averaged S-velocity variations from an ensemble of global tomographic models onto a 1º x 1º degree age-based regionalization and average each major ocean basin (Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian) in equal increments of the square-root of crustal age. By comparing the age averaged S-wave profiles, we estimate convergence depths, the minimum depths where age variations become statistically insignificant. Following Jordan & Paulson (JGR, doi:10.1002/jgrb.50263, 2013), we estimate aleatory variability in the S-wave profiles, correct for vertical smearing bias, and estimate epistemic uncertainties over the model ensemble. We can assert with 90% confidence that the age-correlated variations in Voigt-averaged S velocities persist to depths greater than 170 km. Given the strong evidence that the G discontinuity (~70 km) approximates the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath ocean basins, we conclude that the upper part of the oceanic asthenosphere participates in the cooling that forms the kinematic plates. Age-averaged profiles show significant differences among the ocean basins. To quantify this, we fit age-dependent vertical travel times through the uppermost mantle of the models with an idealized Earth model having a strict square-root of age velocity structure in the ocean basins, suitably filtered to mimic tomographic smoothing. Good fits can be obtained for the Atlantic and Indian ocean basins out to 170 My, although the travel-time slopes for the former are steeper than the latter, implying more rapid cooling in the Atlantic. The Pacific basin shows significant deviations from simple conductive cooling for ages greater than about 50 My, in general agreement with previously published surface-wave models, indicating perturbations associated with small-scale convective processes. We conclude that large-scale flow advects small-scale heterogeneities due to convection along with the plates, allowing the upper asthenosphere to continue cooling with lithospheric age. The observed thermal aging of oceanic asthenosphere appears to be inconsistent the LAB hypothesis, which states that lithospheric plates are decoupled from deeper mantle flow by a plate-scale shear zone in the upper asthenosphere.",

            "abstract": "The eddy covariance method for estimating fluxes of trace gases, energy and momentum in the constant flux layer above a plant canopy fundamentally relies on accurate measurements of the vertical wind speed. This wind speed is typically measured using a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer. These anemometers incorporate designs with transducer sets that are aligned either orthogonally or non-orthogonally. Previous studies comparing the two designs suggest differences in measured 3D wind speed components, in particular vertical wind speed, from the non-orthogonal transducer relative to the orthogonal design. These differences, attributed to additional flow distortion caused by the non-orthogonal transducer arrangement, directly affect fluxes of trace gases, energy and momentum. A field experiment is being conducted over a rain-fed soybean field at the AmeriFlux site (US-Ne3) near Mead, Nebraska. In this study, ultrasonic anemometers featuring orthogonal transducer sets (ATI Vx Probe) and non-orthogonal transducer sets (Gill R3-100) collect high frequency wind vector and sonic temperature data. Sensible heat and momentum fluxes and other key sonic performance data are evaluated based on environmental parameters including wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and angle of attack. Preliminary field experiment results are presented.",

            "abstract": "Estimating basin-mean precipitation in complex terrain is difficult due to uncertainty in precipitation gauges’ topographical representativeness relative to the basin and undercatch. Inadequate distribution with elevation and spatial density can lead to large estimation errors in basin-mean precipitation. Streamflow offers additional information about the water balance of the basin with which to estimate precipitation.\nWe applied a methodology for inferring basin-mean precipitation from streamflow using Bayes’ Theorem, and adapted this approach to snow-dominated basins in the Sierra Nevada of California. We developed and coupled a temperature-index snow model to the FUSE conceptual rainfall-runoff model. We used the BATEA (Bayesian Total Error Analysis) calibration and inference environment, which seeks to robustly calibrate hydrologic models by using streamflow to estimate representativeness errors in the observed precipitation inputs and infer the correct basin-average precipitation.\nWe inferred 1981-2006 annual average precipitation rates across a cluster of basins in and around the high country of Yosemite National Park, and compared the rates to those from approaches based on climatological precipitation patterns (PRISM). The inferred spatial patterns of precipitation showed reasonable match to PRISM, though some deviations were identified.\nWe also investigated the precision and robustness of this approach for estimating mean annual precipitation rates. While this approach clearly identified differences in precipitation rates between basins in different climatic zones, uncertainties between +/-100 and +/-200 mm/yr were associated with the inferred precipitation rates. These were shown to be related to uncertainties in hydrologic model structure, potential evapotranspiration rates and soil storage capacities. Future work will investigate the extent to which observations of snow water content can constrain uncertainty in inferred precipitation rates.",

            "abstract": "First order structures such as the North and East Anatolian faults accomodate extrusion of Anatolia to the west; their activity and kinematics are well constrained. Less well understood is the degree to which the plate has deformed internally along secondary strike-slip faults such as the Central Anatolian fault zone (CAFZ). Original interpretations of the CAFZ characterize it as an active left-lateral ‘tectonic escape’ structure, stretching for 700 km in a NE direction across the Anatolian plate. Here, we provide new structural, geomorphic and geochronologic data for several key faults within the southern and central parts of the CAFZ which suggests Quaternary left-lateral motion has been overstated. We propose a revised model for its evolution during the Quaternary.\nOur neotectonic mapping along the Ecemiş fault, the southernmost part of the CAFZ, documents 65.8 ± 3 m of left-lateral displacement of an alluvial fan with a 36Cl exposure age of 133.2 ± 11 ka, and an unfaulted fluvial terrace (47.7 ± 2.8 ka). We estimate a left lateral slip rate of 0.80 ± 0.17 mm a-1 during the Late- Pleistocene, lower than rates of 3 mm a-1 originally proposed for the fault zone. To the north, the Erciyes fault is characterized by a linear array of monogenetic vents aligned perpendicular to the maximum horizontal extension. Ar/Ar dating show that the syn-eruptive stress of field on the fault was ESE-WNW extension from 0.58 ± 0.13 to 0.21 ± 0.18 Ma with no record of strike slip displacement. We also find a greater component of extension along the central part of the CAFZ, in the Erciyes basin. We’ve mapped and re-characterized Erkilet and Gesi faults within the northern Erciyes basin as predominantly extensional, contrary to previous kinematic interpretations which required significant strike-slip motion. Our results are consistent with recent GPS studies which show active ESE-WNW extension, which we propose as the driver of faulting since 2.73 ± 0.08 Ma.\nOriginal estimates of left-lateral displacement on the CAFZ have been overstated and slip-rates and kinematics derived in this study are not typical of an ‘escape tectonic’ structure. We characterize the CAFZ as one of an array of several weakly active, highly segmented transtensional fault systems in Central and Eastern Anatolia which have re-activated along older structures.",

We studied over 150 piston- and vibro- core samples from 20 small lakes in this region, and found out many sedimentary evidences of tsunami events. Only three small lakes, Tadasu-Ike, Kaniga-Ike and Kamoda- Ike have over 5000 yaers sedimentary record. Tadasu-Ike and Kaniga-Ike have kept ten and several times tsunami events, on the other hand only one event preserved in though 6500 years sediments of Kamoda- Ike.\nThese three small lakes have characteristic sedimentary conditions. Abrupt change of sedimentation rate was recorded 1-2 times through 5000-7000 years their history. This change was thought to reflect subsidence of the surrounding area. Co-seismic subsidence and gradual uplift during inter-seismic period are well known in this region.

            "abstract": "Understanding the basic elements of a topographic map (i.e. contour lines and intervals) is just a small part of learning how to use this abstract representational system as a resource in geologic mapping. Interpretation of a topographic map and matching its features with real-world structures requires that the system is utilized for visualizing the shapes of these structures and their spatial orientation. To enrich students’ skills in visualizing topography from topographic maps a spatial training activity has been developed that uses 3D objects of various shapes and sizes, a sighting tool, a plastic basin, water, and transparencies. In the first part of the activity, the student is asked to draw a topographic map of one of the 3D objects. Next, the student places the object into a plastic tub in which water is added to specified intervals of height. The shoreline at each interval is used to reference the location of the contour line the student draws on a plastic inkjet transparency directly above the object. A key part of this activity is the use of a sighting tool by the student to assist in keeping the pencil mark directly above the shoreline. It (1) ensures the accurate positioning of the contour line and (2) gives the learner experience with using a sight before going out into the field. Finally, after the student finishes drawing the contour lines onto the transparency, the student can compare and contrast the two maps in order to discover where improvements in their visualization of the contours can be made. The teacher and/or peers can also make suggestions on ways to improve. A number of objects with various shapes and sizes are used in this exercise to produce contour lines representing the different types of topography the student may encounter while field mapping. The intended outcome from using this visualization training activity is improvement in performance of visualizing topography as the student moves between the topographic representation and corresponding topography in the field.",

These relationships are shown to hold on long (climatologic) time scales because of the tight coupling that exists between precipitation, atmospheric radiation, moisture convergence and advection. The slope of the complementary relationship is shown to be dependent the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship between saturation specific humidity and temperature, with important implications for the continental hydrologic cycle in a warming climate, e.g., one consequence of this dependence is that the complementary relationship may be expected to become more asymmetric with warming, as higher values of the slope imply a larger change in potential evaporation for a given change in evapotranspiration. In addition, the transparent physics of the prototype permits diagnosis of the sensitivity of the Budyko and complementary relationships to various atmospheric and land surface processes. Here, the impacts of anthropogenic influences, including large-scale irrigation and global warming, are assessed.",

            "abstract": "Sediment movement along the main stem of a watershed is strongly affected by the sediment supply and the channel morphology. Anthropogenic interventions tend to alter the hydraulic conveyance and consequently modify the sediment regime of the main stem. This connection between channel hydraulics and sediment transport is often overlooked in hydrologic models where simplified methods are used for flow and sediment routing. In this study, we adopt a hydrologic-hydraulic modeling approach to quantify the fluvial sediment transport along the main stem of a watershed during a storm event. The hydrologic model CUENCAS is implemented to estimate the sub-hourly hydrographs of the major tributaries of the watershed. The simulated hydrographs are used as boundary conditions for the depth-averaged two-dimensional hydraulic model FESMWS to simulate the propagation of the flood wave along the main stem. The corresponding sub-hourly, unsteady non-equilibrium sediment transport along the main stem is also simulated with FESWMS. This procedure is applied to a highly managed agricultural watershed of Iowa. The study site has a catchment area of 70 Km2 with soils that are silty clay loams. The land-use is mostly row crop, but in the past decade a large portion of the watershed was converted to native prairie. The main stem is a meandering stream with a length of 15 Km and ten major tributaries contribute to its flow. Several sections of the main stem have been heavily channelized and straightened since the 1930s. Different grain size distributions and sediment boundary conditions are investigated to discern the effects of land-use changes and channelization on the sediment regime along the main stem. The simulations are able to capture the typical hysteresis between flow and sediment transport. The results indicate that the in-stream sediment transport rate is in general higher in the channelized sections and depends, to a certain extent, on the degree of straightening.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of the surface properties of Antarctica is very important to study the change of environment and climate in the polar region. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used to study Antarctic surface properties because it is independent of sun altitude and atmospheric conditions. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) observes surface topography and deformation, by calculating the phase differences between two or more SAR images obtained over same area. InSAR technique can be used for height mapping in stable areas with a few meter accuracy. However, the InSAR-derived height map can have errors if the phase differences due to surface deformation or change of the scattering center by microwave penetration into snow are misinterpreted as the elevation. In this study, we generated the height maps around Terra Nova Bay in East Antarctica from 13 COSMO-SkyMed one-day tandem InSAR pairs obtained from December 2010 to January 2012. By analyzing the height maps averaged over the 13 interferograms and its standard deviation (STD) map, we could classify the surface types into glacier, mountains and basin areas covered with snow. The mountain areas showed very small STD because its surface property is unchanged with time, except for the small STD values caused by the errors from the unwrapping processing, satellite orbit or atmospheric phase distortion. Over the basin areas, however, the STD of the height was much larger than the mountain area due to the variation of scattering center either from the change in surface property such as snowfall and sublimation or by the surface displacement of snow mass that are too slow. A year-long constant motion of such slow-creeping snow body was positively identified by its linear relationship between the misinterpreted elevation and the baseline perpendicular component of InSAR pair. Analysis of time-series coherence maps and amplitude maps have also contributed to clarify the surface properties and its changes due to various environmental factors such as snow fall, wind, sublimation, and the freezing-thawing processes in this Antarctic land surface.\nAcknowledgement – This research was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea through NRF-2013R1A1A2008062 and NRF-2013M1A3A3A02041853.",

            "abstract": "Radar mapping of the surface of Venus shows areas of high reflectivity (low emissivity) in the Venusian highlands at altitudes between 2.5-4.75 kilometers. The origin of the radar anomalies found in the highlands remains unclear. Previous theoretical studies suggest increased surface roughness or materials with higher dielectric constants as well as surface-atmospheric interactions.\nThis work intends to experimentally constrain the source of the radar anomalies on Venus. Primarily, the suggested explanations for these radar-bright regions involve a reaction between volatiles in the atmosphere and rocks/minerals on the surface. Thus, possible materials that could potentially cause the high reflectivities on the surface of Venus are investigated and their behavior tested under simulated Venusian atmospheric and surface conditions, with special emphasis on the combined effect of pressure and temperature, and chemical composition.\nStability experiments were conducted in the Venus simulation chamber at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center. Several minerals thought to exist on Venus were tested including bismuthinite (Bi2S3), tellurobismuthite (Bi2Te3), tellurium (Te), coloradoite (HgTe), and pyrite (FeS2). One gram of each sample was heated in the chamber to average Venusian surface conditions, and separately to highland conditions (460°C and 90 bar, 380°C and 55 bar, respectively) under a simulated Venusian atmosphere of 96.5% CO2, 3.5% N2 and 150 ppm SO2. After each run, the samples were weighed and then analyzed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD).\nOngoing experiments show several minerals are of potential interest due to their stability at highland conditions where the anomalies are observed. These minerals would exhibit a higher dielectric value than the surrounding basalts, creating a higher radar reflectivity in those regions and potentially being the source of the Venusian radar anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Climate networks have been studied for understanding complex relationships between different spatial locations such as community structures and teleconnections. Analysis of time-evolving climate networks reveals changes that occur in those relationships over time and can provide insights for discovering new and complex climate phenomena. We have recently developed a novel data mining technique to discover anomalous relationships from dynamic climate networks. The algorithms efficiently identifies anomalous changes in relationships that cause significant structural changes in the climate network from one time instance to the next. Using this technique we investigated the presence of anomalies in precipitation networks that were constructed based on monthly averages of precipitation recorded at .5 degree resolution during the time period 1982 to 2002. The precipitation network consisted of 10-nearest neighbor graphs for every month's data. Preliminary results on this data set indicate that we were able to discover several anomalies that have been verified to be related to or as the outcome of well known climate phenomena. For instance, one such set of anomalies corresponds to transition from January 1994 (normal conditions) to January 1995 (El-Nino conditions) and include events like worst droughts of the 20th century in Australian Plains, very high rainfall in southeast Asian islands, and drought-like conditions in Peru, Chile, and eastern equatorial Africa during that time period. We plan to further apply our technique to networks constructed out of different climate variables such as sea-level pressure, surface air temperature, wind velocity, 500 geo-potential height etc. at different resolutions. Using this method we hope to develop deeper insights regarding the interactions of multiple climate variables globally over time, which might lead to discovery of previously unknown climate phenomena involving heterogeneous data sources.",

The more recent past can give us better insights on the possible range of precipitation changes in the coming years and needs to be investigated. A two-meter long sediment core acquired in a 300 m deep basin on the shelf off the eastern coast of northern Luzon Philippines was used to reconstruct changes in precipitation in the past millennia. Geochemical data generated using an XRF core scanner and grain size measured using a laser particle analyser were used as precipitation proxies. Trends of Ti and Al/Ti revealed an overall decreasing precipitation throughout the millennia. The period AD 1700 to 1800 is indicated to have experienced the lowest precipitation within the past millennia. This decrease in precipitation is also indicated by a decrease in silt fraction. Historical records list severe droughts leading to famine and crisis in the country. This period of lowest precipitation fall within a La Nina-dominated period shifting to an El Nino-dominated condition and is coincident with a negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phase.",

            "abstract": "A dramatic expansion of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling for natural gas in unconventional reserves is underway. This expansion is fueling considerable public concern, however, that extracted natural gas, reservoir brines and associated fracking fluids may infiltrate to and contaminate shallower (< 500m depth) groundwater reservoirs, thereby posing a health threat. Attributing methane found in shallow groundwater to either deep thermogenic ‘fracking’ operations or locally-derived shallow microbial sources utilizes geochemical methods including alkane wetness and stable carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of short chain (C1-C5) hydrocarbons. Compared to shallow microbial gas, thermogenic gas is wetter and falls within a different range of δ13C and δD values. What is not clear, however, is how the transport of natural gas through water saturated geological media may affect its compositional and stable isotope values. What is needed is a means to differentiate potential flow paths of natural gas including ‘fast paths’ along preexisting fractures and drill casings vs. ‘slow paths’ through low permeability rocks. In this study we attempt quantify transport-related effects using experimental 1-dimensional two-phase column experiments and analytical solutions to multi-phase gas injection equations. Two-phase experimental results for an injection of natural gas into a water saturated column packed with crushed illite show that the natural gas becomes enriched in methane compared to ethane and propane during transport. Carbon isotope measurements are ongoing. Results from the multi-phase gas injection equations that include methane isotopologue solubility and diffusion effects predict the development of a ‘bank’ of methane depleted in 13C relative to 12C at the front of a plume of fugitive natural gas. These results, therefore, suggest that transport of natural gas through water saturated geological media may complicate attribution methods needed to distinguish thermogenic and microbial methane.",

These panels help reduce the cost of receiving energy from power plants that lose a lot of energy in transportation. These power plants provide energy by burning gas or coal producing emissions that add to the growing problem of pollution and global warming. In 2010 the Castro Valley Unified School District decided to add solar panels to Canyon Middle School, Castro Valley High School, and Castro Valley Adult School. We researched whether the solar panels reached their projected amount of energy (74%) for the sites where the panels were placed. The solar panels at all three sites were found to exceed these projected amounts. The solar panels at each site produce a little over 74% for the each school.",

            "abstract": "The climate of the glacial North Atlantic was punctuated by catastrophic discharges of icebergs (Heinrich events), as well as by more mysterious, abrupt warming events associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillations. These events are suspected to be related to changes in AMOC and its influence on heat transport and the regional and global heat budget. Investigation of these rapid oscillations is often limited by the resolution of sediment records. High accumulation rates at our study site (33.69°N, 57.58°W, 4583m water depth) on the Bermuda Rise allow improved resolution by one to two orders of magnitude.\nCores CDH19 (38.81m) and CDH13 (36.70m), were recovered during KNR191, the initial deployment of the RV Knorr's long coring system developed at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with support from the NSF. These cores contain high quality sediment sections that allow high resolution studies extending through the last glacial cycle at a key location for monitoring past oceanographic and climatic variability. Here we present detailed multi-proxy data from Bermuda Rise sediments reflecting deep ocean chemistry and dynamics of the last glaciation, and combine them with published data to produce a continuous, high resolution record spanning the last 70,000 years.\nCaCO3 burial fluxes, foraminifera stable isotopes, and sedimentary uranium-series disequilibria (including seawater-derived 231Pa /230Th), display coherent, complementary variability throughout the last glaciation. Glacial values in each proxy are consistent with reduced ventilation and overturning compared to the Holocene, with intervals that indicate substantial millennial reductions in each, and others when they briefly approach Holocene levels. In multiple instances, particularly spanning interstadials eight through twelve (IS8-IS12) our results are consistent with an abrupt, subcentennial acceleration in the export of excess 231Pa from the North Atlantic during stadial-interstadial transitions, accompanied by increases in CaCO3 preservation and greater ventilation by low-nutrient deep waters, followed by a more gradual decline in those indicators as glacial conditions were reestablished in the basin. This pattern is consistent with a strong link between AMOC and millennial climate change throughout the last glaciation.",

VAVUQ is able to read Excel, Matlab, ASCII, and binary files and it produces a log of the results in txt format. Next, each capability of the code is discussed through an example: The first example is the code verification of a sediment transport code, developed with the Finite Volume Method, with MES. Second example is a solution verification of a code for groundwater flow, developed with the Boundary Element Method, via MES. Third example is a solution verification of a mixed order, Compact Difference Method code of heat transfer via MMS. Fourth example is a solution verification of a 2-D, Finite Difference Method code of floodplain analysis via Complete Richardson Extrapolation. In turn, application of VAVUQ in quantitative model skill assessment studies (validation) of environmental codes is given through two examples: validation of a two-phase flow computational modeling of air entrainment in a free surface flow versus lab measurements and heat transfer modeling in the earth surface versus field measurement. At the end, we discuss practical considerations and common pitfalls in interpretation of V&V results.",

A number of high-impact, environmental remote sensing disciplines such as hurricane observation, mega-city air quality, wild fire detection and monitoring, and monitoring of coastal oceans would benefit dramatically from enabling the downlinking of sensor data at higher spatial and spectral resolutions. The enabling technologies of multi-Gbps Ka-Band communication, flexible high speed on-board processing, and multi-Terabit SSRs are currently available with high technological maturity enabling high data volume mission requirements to be met with minimal mission constraints while utilizing a limited set of ground sites from NASA’s Near Earth Network (NEN) or TDRSS.

            "abstract": "Satellite observations show that sea-level rise (SLR) is not uniform, in particular in the Pacific Ocean. During the last 20 years, the tropical western Pacific has been rising at a rate of ~9 mm/year (three times faster than the global rate of ~3 mm/year). Conversely, sea-level over the eastern tropical Pacific has slightly decreased. These spatially varying trends have been generally attributed to decadal fluctuations in atmospheric circulation associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). However, controversy remains over whether the accelerated SLR over the tropical western Pacific is man-made. We explore this issue using the large ensemble of historical simulations performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM-LE). The simulated sea-surface height (SSH) trends exhibit large spread among the 30 ensemble members. A large fraction (40%) of the spread is explained by two modes associated the PDO. Using CESM-LE we develop a methodology to estimate SSH trends associated with observed trends in atmospheric circulation. The resulting circulation-adjusted SSH trends exhibit spatial patterns in remarkable agreement with the satellite-derived sea-level trends (pattern correlation = 0.8). Furthermore, the observed atmospheric circulation trends are within the range of unforced trends simulated by CESM-LE. Together, these results suggest that the accelerated SLR in the western northern tropical Pacific is likely the response to unforced multi-decadal variability in the Walker circulation and the Aleutian Low.",

On average, the total number of eddies detected from AVHRR SST during 1982-2012 is ~300, and the number of anticyclonic eddies are ~14% more than that of cyclonic eddies. A significant decrease is found in the number of eddies in AVHRR SST for the past three decades, which is primarily due to the abrupt decreases in 1985 and 2007. By contrast, the model simulation, which has slightly finer resolution relative to the observation, shows substantially less eddies (~33%) as compared to the satellite observation. Moreover, in the model, the number of eddies holds steady, showing no significant decrease in recent decades.",

The National Climate Indicators System is a set of physical, ecological, and societal indicators that communicate key aspects of the physical climate, climate impacts, vulnerabilities, and preparedness for the purpose of informing both decision makers and the public with scientifically valid information.\nThe Indicators System will address questions important to multiple audiences including (but not limited to) nonscientists (e.g., Congress, U.S. citizens, students), resource managers, and state and municipal planners in a conceptually unified framework. The physical, ecological, and societal indicators will be scalable, to provide information for indicators at national, state, regional, and local scales. The pilot system is a test of the Indicators System for evaluation purposes to assess the readiness of indicators and usability of the system.\n The National Climate Indicator System has developed a pilot given the recommendations of over 150+ scientists and practitioners and 14 multidisciplinary teams, including, for example, greenhouse gases, forests, grasslands, water, human health, oceans and coasts, and energy. The pilot system of indicators includes approximately 20 indicators that are already developed, scientifically vetted, and implementable immediately. Specifically, the pilot indicators include a small set of global climate context indicators, which provide context for the national or regional indicators, as well as a set of nationally important U.S. natural system and human sector indicators. The purpose of the pilot is to work with stakeholder communities to evaluate the system and the individual indicators using a robust portfolio of evaluation studies, which provides a data driven approach to further develop and improve the National Climate Indicators System.",

            "abstract": "Serpentinization in ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems, such as Lost City, produces relatively cool and alkaline fluids that support diverse ecosystems. To simulate serpentinization in such systems, we conducted single-pass, flow-through experiments on dunite cores cut out of a sample from Jackson County, North Carolina. Experimental seawater prepared using laboratory-grade reagents and standards was pumped through a core at 150ºC and 150 bar pore-fluid outlet pressure at a flow rate of 0.01 ml/min. An additional experiment will be conducted at 200ºC. At 150ºC, permeability decreased by 2.3 times with reaction progress over the course of the 36 day experiment. Fluid-rock reaction generally produced CO2, H2, CH4, and CO concentrations of 100 µmol/kg, up to 40 µmol/kg, 2 µmol/kg, and less than 1 µmol/kg, respectively. Outlet fluid chemistry was relatively stable, except for initial peaks in Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, and Si. pH of outlet fluids increased with reaction progress, but it was always lower (6.9-7.4) than the initial seawater (7.8). X-ray computed tomography scans were/will be collected for both pre- and post-experimental cores. The combination of flow-through experiments on solid, intact rock cores cut out of natural samples and X-ray tomography permits visualization and quantification of mineralogical changes and flow path evolution during serpentinization. This approach further permits physical and chemical processes to be documented on a fine scale to better understand feedbacks between chemical reactions and flow fields, with implications for ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "The decreasing surface albedo caused by continously vanishing sea ice over the Arctic plays a very important role in Arctic warming amplification. However, the quantification of the change of radiative forcing at top of atmosphere (TOA) introduced by the decreasing sea ice albedo and its generated feedback to the climate remain uncertain. Two recent representative studies showed a large difference with each other: Flanner et al. (2011) used a method of synthesis of surface albedo and radiative kernels and found that the change of sea ice radiative forcing (ΔSIRF) in Northern Hemisphere (NH) from 1979 to 2008 was 0.22 (0.15 – 0.32) W m–2, and the corresponding sea ice albedo feedback (SIAF) over NH was 0.28 (0.19 – 0.41) W m-2 K-1; while Pistone et al. (2014) directly used the observed planetary albedo to estimate the NH ΔSIRF and SIAF from 1979 to 2011 and draw a NH ΔSIRF of 0.43 ± 0.07 W m–2, which was nearly twice as larger as Flanner’s result, and the estimated global SIAF was 0.31 ± 0.04 W m-2 K-1. Motivated by reconciling the difference between these two studies and obtaining a more accurate qualification of the NH ΔSIRF, we used a newly released satellite-retrieved surface albedo product CLARA-A1 and made an attempt in two steps: Firstly, based on synthesising the surface albedo and raditive kernels, we calcualted the ΔSIRF from 1982 to 2009 was 0.20 ± 0.05 W m-2, and the NH SIAF was 0.25 W m-2 K-1; After comparing with TOA observed radiative flux, we found it’s quite likely the kernel methods yield an underestimation for the all-sky ΔSIRF. Then, we tried to use TOA observed broadband radiative flux to adjust the estimation with kernels. After an adjustment, the NH all-sky ΔSIRF was 0.34 ± 0.09 W m-2, and the corresponding SIAF was 0.43 W m-2 K-1 over NH and 0.31 W m-2 K-1 over the entire globe.",

            "abstract": "Spectral analysis of observational data by Pelletier (2002) indicates that the geomagnetic field has a variance spectrum which follows a 1/f power law and that a return period of geomagnetic reversals similar to that observed is a direct consequence of such a power law spectrum. A stochastic model of the earth's interior is proposed in which the number of assumptions is kept to a minimum, i.e. specific heat, thermal conductivity, radiogenic heating and density are constant. Despite this simplicity, complex behaviour occurs as a consequence of further assumptions: that Rayleigh-Bernard convection cells form spontanously and at random in the outer liquid core as heat builds up from radioactive sources, that each of these cells spontaneously generates its own magnetic field by a MHD dynamo effect, that each cell melts the solid mantle immediately above it because of the extra heat being convected outward from the hot core and that in this way each convection cell propagates upwards through the otherwise solid mantle at a speed determined by the solution of the Stefan problem for a liquid-solid boundary. The upward-moving, liquid-in-solid convection cells formed in this way are proposed as the primary mechanism by which the core is cooled. The totality of convection cell MHD dynamo fields is proposed as the origin of the geomagnetic field which will have a 1/f spectrum and experience reversals similar to those observed. Because cooling is a stochastic process, there will be times when the earth is heating faster than it is cooling and vice versa. Hence there will be times when the volume and surface of the earth are expanding and new crust is formed and there will be other times when the surface is contracting and the crust, being too large for the smaller surface, is forced to ramp up, wrinkle and subduct in order to be accomodated by the smaller area.

            "abstract": "The Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) and Afar uniquely capture the final stages of transition from continental rifting in the broader East African Rift System to incipient seafloor spreading above a mantle hotspot. Studies of the region increasingly point to magmatism as a controlling factor on continental extension. However, the character and depth extent of these melt products remain contentious. Radial anisotropy derived from surface waves provides a unique diagnostic constraint on the presence of oriented melt pockets versus broader oriented anisotropic fabrics. This study investigates the thermal and radially anisotropic structure beneath the broader MER and Afar to resolve the magmatic character of the region and ultimately to understand the role of magmatism in present day rift development. We utilize 104 stations from 4 collocated arrays in the MER/Afar region to constrain radial anisotropy within the upper mantle via the inversion of Love- and Rayleigh-wave observations between 25 and 100 s period. We employ a multi-channel cross-correlation algorithm to obtain inter-station phase and amplitude information. The multi-channel phase observations are inverted for dynamic phase velocity across the array, which are then corrected for focusing and multipathing using the amplitude observations via Helmholtz tomography. We jointly invert Love- and Rayleigh-wave structural phase velocity measurements employing crustal constraints from co-located active source experiments to obtain estimates of Vsv and Vsh between 50 - 170 km depth. Preliminary results readily reveal the distinct shear velocity structure beneath the MER and Afar. Within the MER, shear velocity structure suggests pronounced low velocities accompanied by strong anisotropy between 80 – 140 km depth beneath the western Ethiopian plateau and rift valley. Within Afar, shear velocity structure is more varied with the slowest velocities found at shallow depths (less than 70 km depth), accompanied by weak anisotropy. The pronounced changes in the depth extent of slow velocities and strength of anisotropy interpreted to be associated with asthenosphere may reflect variations in the distribution and magnitude of temperature anomalies/melt between continental rifting in the MER and incipient, hot-spot influenced seafloor spreading in Afar.",

            "abstract": "Field observations from the spring of 2008 on the Louisiana shelf were used to elucidate the mechanisms of wave energy dissipation over a muddy seafloor. After a period of high discharge from the Atchafalaya River acoustic measurements showed the presence of 20 cm thick mobile fluid mud layers during and after wave events. While total wave energy dissipation (D) was greatest during the high energy periods, these periods had relatively low normalized attenuation rates (Κ = Dissipation/Energy Flux). During declining wave energy conditions, as the fluid mud layer settled, the attenuation process became more efficient with high Κ  and low D. The transition from high D and low Κ to high Κ and low D was caused by a transition from turbulent to laminar flow in the fluid mud layer as measured by a Pulse-coherent Doppler profiler. Measurements of the oscillatory boundary layer velocity profile in the fluid mud layer during laminar flow reveal a very thick wave boundary layer with curvature filling the entire fluid mud layer, suggesting a kinematic viscosity two to three orders of magnitude greater than clear water. This high viscosity is also consistent with a high wave attenuation rates measured by across shelf energy flux differences. The transition to turbulence was forced by instabilities on the lutocline, with wavelengths consistent with the dispersion relation for this two layer system. The measurements also provide new insight into the dynamics of wave supported turbidity flows during the transition from a laminar to turbulent fluid mud layer.",

            "abstract": "The seafloor is broadly divided into two regions (Emerson et al., 1985): one where sedimentary microbial respiration is high and oxygen (O2) penetrates only millimeters to centimeters into the sediment (Revsbech et al., 1980), and another where sedimentary respiration is low and O2 penetrates much deeper (Murray& Grundmanis, 1980; D’Hondt et al., 2011; Røy et al, 2012; Orcutt et al., 2013). Active anaerobic microbial communities persist for hundreds of meters or more in subseafloor sediment of the high-respiration region. In the low-respiration region, the existence of microbial communities is previously unknown throughout most of the sedimentary sequence (Morita & Zobell, 1955; D’Hondt et al., 2009; Røy et al., 2012). Here we show that microbial cells and aerobic respiration persist through the entire sediment sequence (to depths of at least 75 m below seafloor) throughout the vast expanse of the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre. This sediment and underlying basalt may be continuously exposed to O2 for its entire history (up to 120 myrs at our sites). Redfield stoichiometry of dissolved O2 and nitrate indicates that net sedimentary O2 reduction is coupled to oxidation of marine organic matter. Oxygen and aerobic communities may occur throughout the entire sediment sequence in 15-44% of the Pacific and 9-37% of the global ocean. This result has major implications for the nature and distribution of subseafloor life. It may ultimately affect the chemical evolution of Earth’s mantle and subduction-related volcanic systems.\n",

When corrected for low-pressure crystal fractionation to 8 wt.% MgO, Fe3+/∑Fe(8)ratios of ocean island basalts (OIB) from Samoa, Loihi, and Pitcairn extend to higher values than normal MORB (0.16±0.01) and, with one exeption, overlap with the range observed in back arc basin basalts (0.16 to 0.21 at Samoa, 0.17 to 0.19 at Loihi, and 0.19 to 0.27 at Pitcairn). Plume-affected samples are among the most oxidized MORBs (~0.168 at Azores and ~0.175 at Galapagos).\nBasalt Fe3+/∑Fe ratios provide one proxy for the oxygen fugacity (fO2) of the mantle from which they derive. The higher oxidation state of Fe in OIB relative to MORB may reflect higher fO2 in the source mantle of OIB relative to MORB, and may further explain major element systematics in OIBs as well as their more calc-alkaline nature. We also report that Fe3+/∑Fe(8) ratios correlate with isotopic ratios, such as 87Sr/86Sr, which may trace recycled continental crust (Samoa: R=0.57, n=8; Galapagos: R = 0.94, n=8). Strikingly, these positive correlations are opposite to those observed in MORB away from plumes, where Fe3+/∑Fe(8) ratios correlate negatively with indicies of enrichment (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr, R = -0.71, n=31 and Ba/La, R = -0.72, n=19, Cottrell and Kelley, Science, 2013 and unpub.). Yet, these new OIB data support conclusions drawn from MORB: redox heterogeneities reflect large-scale geodynamic processes acting over long time periods and are not overprinted by melting and differentiation (C&K, Science, 2013). We infer that a variety of procesess, including recycling of surface-derived materials, generate redox heterogeneities in the mantle that persist and influence OIB petrogenesis.",

            "abstract": "The bottomside of the F region at the magnetic equator becomes turbulent at night, and the turbulent region appears as a coherent backscattering in radar observations. The bottomside turbulent region is known to develop near the center of the postsunset vortex which represents the vortical plasma motion at premidnight in the time and altitude frame. However, our investigation of the plasma motion during the last solar maximum using the incoherent scatter radar observations at Jicamarca in Peru shows the development of the bottomside turbulent region at the upper part of the postsunset vortex. This observation indicates that the vertical shear in the zonal plasma motion associated with the postsunset vortex may not be the cause of the turbulence in the bottomside. Because the postsunset vortex is associated with the prereversal enhancement (PRE) in the vertical plasma motion, presumably PRE is more important factor for the creation of the turbulence than the shear is. We further analyze the radar data acquired since 1996 and investigate the relationship between the postsunset vortex and bottomside turbulence. Our study extends to the investigation of the similarity of the turbulences in the bottomside and bubbles.",

            "abstract": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor series is slated to continue the highly calibrated data stream initiated with Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). A number of geophysical products, termed Environmental Data Records (EDRs), are being produced from VIIRS data, including Vegetation Index (VI) EDR. VIIRS VI EDR is a daily, 375 m resolution product and includes the “Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA)” Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the “Top-of-Canopy (TOC)” Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The TOC NDVI is being added to the product. In this study, we cross-compared VI EDR from the first VIIRS sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite platform with the Aqua MODIS counterparts in global scale with the aim of developing a thorough understanding of radiometric compatibility between the two VI datasets.\nVIIRS VI products from April 2014 through June 2014 were obtained along with MODIS daily products. They were all reprojected and spatially-aggregated into a 4 km sinusoidal grid while screening for cloud and aerosol contaminations using quality flags. We then masked VIIRS-MODIS observation pairs for near-identical observation geometry: (1) view zenith angle (VZA) < 7.5 degrees, (2) 20 degrees < VZA < 27.5 degrees, (3) 40 degrees < VZA < 47.5 degrees, and (4) 55 degrees < VZA < 62.5 degrees. Their mean differences (MDs) were computed for each VZA bin and for all bins at once for quantitative evaluation.\nVIIRS and MODIS TOA NDVI had a very small overall MD of 0.005 NDVI units, whereas TOC EVI had a fairly large overall MD of -0.04 EVI units. These systematic differences were consistent across the 2-month period examined in this study. TOC NDVI, on the other hand, had largely fluctuating MD across this period, ranging from 0.005 to 0.01 NDVI units, an indication of inconsistent atmospheric correction or cloud mask results. With respect to VZA, inconsistent MDs were always obtained for the 55-62.5 degree VZA bin for all the three indices. Overall, VIIRS and MODIS VI products are subject to systematic differences, which are however consistent for VZ < 50 degrees. Future studies should examine the performance of VIIRS atmospheric corrections and compatibility of VIIRS and MODIS observations at large VZA.",

            "abstract": "The physical properties of the asthenosphere (e.g., seismic velocity, viscosity, electrical conductivity) have been attributed to either mineral properties at relevant temperature, pressure, and water content or to the presence of a low melt fraction. We resort to the geochemical studies of MORB to unravel the composition of the asthenosphere. It is important to determine to what extent the geochemical variations in axial MORB do represent a homogeneous mantle composition and variations in the physical conditions of magma generation and transport; or alternatively, they represent mixing of melts from a heterogeneous upper mantle. Lavas from intra-transform faults and off-axis seamounts share a common mantle source with axial MORB, but experience less differentiation and homogenization. Therefore they provide better estimates for the end-member volatile budget of the heterogeneous upper mantle.\nWe present major, trace, and volatile element data (H2O, CO2, Cl, F, S) as well as Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions [1, 2] of basaltic glasses (MgO > 6.0 wt%) from the NEPR seamounts, Quebrada-Discovery-Gofar transform fault system, and Macquarie Island. The samples range from incompatible trace element (ITE) depleted (DMORB: Th/La<0.035) to enriched (EMORB: Th/La>0.07) spanning the entire range of EPR MORB. The isotopic composition of the samples correlates with the degree of trace element enrichment indicating long-lived mantle heterogeneity.\nOnce shallow-level processes (degassing, crystallization, and crustal assimilation) have been considered, we conducted a two-component (DMORB- and EMORB-) mantle melting-mixing model. Our model reproduces the major, trace and volatile element contents and isotopic composition of our samples and suggests that (1) 90% of the upper mantle is highly depleted in ITE (DMORB source) with only 10% of an enriched component (EMORB source), (2) the EMORB source is peridotitic rather than pyroxenitic, and (3) NMORB do not represent an actual mantle source, but the product of magma mixing between D- and E-MORB. Finally we use the volatile to trace element ratios of our samples to estimate the volatile element budget of the end-member components of the upper mantle.\n[1] Niu, Y. et al.

The simulation is initialized from the North American Regional Reanalysis data set on the scale of the North American continent. The observed Goshen County tornadic supercell evolves in the simulation from the regional slope flow embedded an a favorable synoptic environment. A supercell and tornado were produced by the simulation in the approximate location and precise time that observations were made of the event by the Vortex 2 team. This was withoiut additional assimilation of high resolution observations beyond the standard data contributing to the 1500 UTC 35 km NARR analysis 7 hours prior to the observed tornado. The simulation can be and is compared directly to Vortex 2 Doppler observations. The process of orogenic storm organization driven by the interaction of topography and the large scale environment is discussed. It is hypothesized that the unusually high predictability of the timing and location as well as the system structure and attendant weather including tornado activity was the result of a highly predictable diurnal slope flow environment that constrained and so reduced the uncertainty of the simulation outcome.",

            "abstract": "It is observed that subduction zone mantle wedge is not uniform even in　the direction along the overlying island-arc that is perpendicular to the subducting direction. The hot fi ngers model is a hypothetical model specifying the three dimensional structural variation within the mangle wedge; it assumes that there is a fi ngers-like stripe pattern of mechanical and thermodynamical properties within the wedge. Those non-uniformity appears over the arc crust as nonuniform distribution of volcanic eruptions. Indeed, quaternary volcanoes in the NE Japan arc could be grouped into ten volcano clusters striking transverse to the arc. These have an average width of \u0018 50 km, and are separated by parallel gaps 30-75 km wide. Moreover, the structure of the mantle wedge and arc crust beneath the NE Japan arc and the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc, respectively, suggest that the third dimension, lying along the strike of the arc, is necessary to understand the actual production of magmas in subduction zones. To explore the physical and mathematical mechanism of formation of the hot fingers pattern, we develop a model of mantle convection in the mantle wedge. Our model incorporates the melting mechanism of the mantle rocks, which affect temperature and velocity of mantle. Our model produces a spatiotemporal pattern in those variables. The obtained results are compared with the spatiotemporal patterns observed in the NE Japan arc.",

            "abstract": "Although water vapor disturbance has been long term recognized as the major error source in differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (d-InSAR) techniques for the ground deformation monitoring and topography reconstruction, it provides opportunities to extract the atmospheric water-vapor information from satellite SAR imageries that can be further used to support studies on earth energy budget, climate, the hydrological cycle, and meteorological forecasting, etc. The water vapor contribution in interferometric phases is normally referred as the atmospheric delay dominated by water vapor rather than condensed water (e.g. cloud). D-InSAR can produce maps of the column water vapor amounts (equivalent to integrated water vapor (IWV) or Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) in other literatures) that are important parameters quantitatively describe the total amount of water vapor overlying a point on the earth surface. Similar products have been operationally produced in multi-spectrum remote sensing, e.g. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with a spatial resolution in 500 m to 1km; Whereas, the PWV products derived by d-InSAR have remarkably high spatial resolution that can capture fine scale of water vapor variations in space as small as tens of meters or even less.\nIn recent years, some efforts have been made to derive the water vapor products from interferogram and analyze the corresponding products quality, such as studies comparing integrated water vapor derived from interferometric phases to other measurements (e.g. MERIS, MODIS, GNSS), studies on deriving absolute water vapor products from d-InSAR, and studies on integrating d-InSAR water vapor products in meteorological numerical forecast.\nIn this study, considering these limitation factors and based on previous studies, we discuss the accuracy and statistics of the water vapor products from satellite SAR, including (1) Accuracy of the differential water vapor products; (2) Sources of calibration data set and their corresponding accuracy; and (3) Accuracy of the derived absolute water vapor products. Overall, we work on the strategy definition that bring the d-InSAR-derived water vapor products to be practically generated association with their accuracy information and available to wide research communities.",

            "abstract": "The mechanisms controlling the source locations and initiation process of microseisms are still a subject of considerable debate. Here, we investigate the characteristics and evolution of microseisms generated by Typhoon Megi (Oct 13-23, 2010) using records on both land and offshore stations to investigate the ocean-land coupling process. The typhoon Megi was the strongest typhoon in 2010, being classified as Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. We tracked Typhoon Megi through spectrogram analysis of seismic records at 49 seismic stations in Southeastern China over spatial dimension of about 950 km. The evolution of the microseismic energy was found to be strongly correlated with the spatial proximity of Megi to the recording stations and coastlines. We further analyzed spatial and temporal variations of microseismic energy in three frequency bands of single frequency (SF, 0.05-0.1 Hz), long period double frequency (LPDF, 0.1-0.18 Hz), and short period double frequency (SPDF, 0.18-0.4 Hz), respectively, for which different physical mechanisms have been proposed. Our analysis reveals the following preliminary results: (1) Temporal variations in LPDF and SF are well correlated, implying that LPDF might be excited primarily by the interaction between incoming ocean swells directly induced by the typhoon and the reflected waves by the coastal topography in shallow waters. (2) When the typhoon changed track from the westward to northward direction between Oct 19 and 20, the SPDF signals strengthened while both the SF and LPDF signals weakened, suggesting that SPDF might be generated by the intensified wave-wave interaction around the typhoon “eyes” when the typhoon turned. We further obtained the directivity of the energy source and found two main source regions: one near the typhoon center and another near the coastal region with shallow water depth. The coupling between ocean wave and seafloor depends on bathymetry, coupling coefficient, and the recorded microseismic signals depend also on path effect, local noises, etc. We are currently comparing observations with numerical models that include the coupling coefficients and path attenuation of seismic waves in order to better understand the mechanisms controlling the spatial-temporal evolution of microseisms.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol absorption is a key issue in proper calculation of aerosol radiative forcing. Especially in the tropics with the dominance of natural biogenic aerosol and brown carbon, the so called anomalous absorption is of particular interest. A special experiment was designed to study the wavelength dependence of aerosol absorption for PM2.5 as well as for PM10 particles in the wet season in Central Amazonia. Aerosol analysis occurred from May to August 2014, in the ZF2 ecological reservation, situated at about 55 km North of Manaus in very pristine conditions Two 7 wavelengths AE33 Aethalometers were deployed measuring in parallel, but with a PM2.5 and PM10 inlets. Two MAAP (Multiangle Aerosol Absorption Photometer) were operated in parallel with the AE33 exactly at the same PM2.5 and PM10 inlets. Organic and elemental carbon was analyzed using collection with quartz filters and analysis using a Sunset OC/EC analyzer. Aerosol light scattering for 3 wavelengths was measured using Air Photon and TSI Nephelometers. Aerosol size distribution was measured with one TSI SMPS and a GRIMM OPC to have the size range from 10 nm to 10 micrometers. Particles were measured under dry conditions using diffusion dryers. Aerosol optical depth and absorption was also measured with an AERONET sunphotometer operated close to the site.\nAs the experiment was run in the wet season, very low equivalent black carbon (EBC) were measured, with average concentrations around 50 ng/m³ during May, increasing to 130 ng/m³ in June and July. The measurements adjusted for similar wavelengths shows excellent agreement between the MAAP and AE33 for both inlets (PM2.5 and PM10). It was not possible statistically infer absorption from the coarse mode biogenic particles, since the absorption was completely dominated by fine mode particles. AERONET measurements shows very low values of AOD, at 0.17 at 500 nm and 0.13 at 870 nm, with very low absorption AOD values at 0.00086 at 676 nm and 0.0068 at 872 nm. Single scattering albedo values will be calculated.",

            "abstract": "This study quantifies the flow resistance of mountain streams with gravel bed and remarkable bed forms. The motivation is to follow the previous ideas (Robert, A. 1990) that the bed surface can be divided into micro-scale and macro-scale roughness, respectively. We processed the field data of longitudinal bed profiles of the Longxi River, Sichuan Province, China, using the Hilbert-Huang Transformation Method (HHT). Each longitudinal profile was decomposed into a set of curves with different frequencies of spatial fluctuation. The spectrogram was accordingly obtained. We supposed that a certain high and low frequency curves correspond to the micro- and macro-roughness of stream bed, respectively. We specified the characteristic height and length with the spectrogram, which represent the macro bed form accounting for bed form roughness. We then estimated the bed form roughness as being proportional to the ratio of the height to length multiplied by the height(Yang et al,2005). We also assumed the parameter, Sp, defined as the sinuosity of the highest frequency curve as the measure of the micro-scale roughness. We then took into account the effect of bed material sizes through using the product of d50/R and Sp, where d50 is the sediment median size and R is the hydraulic radius. The macro- and micro-scale roughness parameters were merged together nonlinearly to evaluate the flow resistance caused by the interplaying friction and form drag forces. Validation results show that the square of the determinant coefficient can reach as high as 0.84 in the case of the Longxi River. Future studies will focus on the verification against more field data as well as the combination of skin friction and form drag.\nKey words: flow resistance; roughness; HHT; spectrogram; form drag\nRobert, A.

            "abstract": "Copahue is a stratovolcano located along the rim of the Caviahue Caldera near the Chile-Argentina border in the Andes Mountain Range. There are several small towns located in proximity of the volcano with the two largest being Banos Copahue and Caviahue. During its eruptive history, it has produced numerous lava flows, pyroclastic flows, ash deposits, and lahars. This isolated region has steep topography and little vegetation, rendering it poorly monitored. The need to model volcanic hazard risk has been reinforced by recent volcanic activity that intermittently released several ash plumes from December 2012 through May 2013. Exposure to volcanic ash is currently the main threat for the surrounding populations as the volcano becomes more active. The goal of this project was to study Copahue and determine areas that have the highest potential of being affected in the event of an eruption. Remote sensing techniques were used to examine and identify volcanic activity and areas vulnerable to experiencing volcanic hazards including volcanic ash, SO2 gas, lava flow, pyroclastic density currents and lahars. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI), Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), ISS ISERV Pathfinder, and Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) products were used to analyze volcanic hazards. These datasets were used to create a historic lava flow map of the Copahue volcano by identifying historic lava flows, tephra, and lahars both visually and spectrally. Additionally, a volcanic risk and hazard map for the surrounding area was created by modeling the possible extent of ash fallout, lahars, lava flow, and pyroclastic density currents (PDC) for future eruptions. These model results were then used to identify areas that should be prioritized for disaster relief and evacuation orders.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic upper mantle beneath the northwestern Pacific has large-scale lateral heterogeneity that is impossible to attribute to just an age-dependency of the thermal structure based on a cooling of homogeneous mantle with age. This surprising fact was revealed from seafloor magnetotelluric (MT) data collected in three areas, northwest (Area A) and southeast (Area B) of the Shatsky Rise, and off the Bonin Trench (Area C), through the Normal Oceanic Mantle Project and the Stagnant Slab Project. One-dimensional structures of electrical conductivity representing each area show significant difference in the thickness of the upper resistive layer that may be interpreted as cool lithosphere. The thickness of the layer that is more resistive than 0.01 S m-1 is ~80 km for Area A, ~110 km for Area B, and ~180 km for Area C. The conductivity below the resistive layer is similar to ~0.03 S m-1 for Areas A and C but a slightly higher than it for Area B. The thermal structures for the lithospheric age representing the areas (130, 140, and 147 Ma for Areas A, B, and C, respectively) predicted from a simple plate cooling model are almost identical and thus cannot reproduce such variations in electrical conductivity. Then, in this study, thermal and compositional states of the mantle beneath the three areas were investigated to discuss the cause of the variations. Combination of five model parameters, electrical conductivity of crust, mantle potential temperature, thickness of thermally conductive plate, and H2O and CO2 contents in the asthenospheric mantle were searched by forward modeling and the χ2 misfit between the MT responses observed and predicted were assessed with 95% acceptable level. The possibility of partial melting was taken into account by comparing to the solidus of peridotite that is reduced by H2O and CO2. We assumed that the mantle conductivity may be represented by the mixture of hydrous olivine and hydrous carbonated melt. The results suggest a possible influence of a mantle up-welling associated with the formation of the Shatsky Rise to the mantle beneath Areas A and B although these areas are away from the bathymetric anomaly.",

Using the newly available data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) allows EOG to extend this record beyond the life of the DMSP-OLS sensors, and create vastly improved products due to the increased spatial resolution and dynamic range of the DNB over the OLS sensor. Creation of high quality nighttime lights composites requires filtering of data degraded by th presence of clouds, heavy aerosols, or other atmospheric conditions that alter the sharpness and brightness of the nighttime light signal. The VIIRS Cloud-Mask (VCM) product is currently being used to define cloud-impacted regions in the creation of VIIRS DNB nighttime lights composites. Artifacts in the VCM, however, allow for some known cloud-impacted regions to be included in the nighttime lights composites, and conversely some known cloud-free regions to be excluded from the nighttime lights composites. This study investigates alternative methods to define regions of the nighttime DNB imagery that are impacted by atmospheric conditions. The first method filters the DNB using a spectral sharpness index. The second method examines shape of peaks in the DNB imagery to assess atmospheric impacts on the nighttime light signal. These two methods are compared against using the VCM for creation of nighttime lights composites using the VIIRS DNB.",

The Mg/Ca ratio and stable oxygen isotope geochemistry of this species are used to reconstruct thermocline hydrography (cf. Spero et al, 2003). Live culture experiments using this species are not common owing to the difficulty in collecting and maintaining these species in the laboratory. The existing calibration data for this species consists of two temperature points that were combined with data from live culture experiments on a related species, N. incompta (formerly N. pachyderma dextral) (Von Langen et al, 2004). We extended the temperature calibration for this species (from 16 – 19°C to 12 – 22°C) and developed a pH calibration (pH 7.85 – 8.4). Specimens were collected via plankton net from the Southern California Bight and cultured at the Wrigley Marine Science Center, Santa Catalina Island during the summer of 2013-2014. We use isotopically labeled seawater (43Ca, 87Sr, and 138Ba) to identify discrete portions of calcite that grew in culture. We use laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) for trace element analysis and obtain paired stable isotope analyses on chambers that grew entirely in culture. The calcite-labeling technique we employ here can be applied to other marine calcifiers grown in culture and/or future culture work with foraminifers.",

            "abstract": "In a Maxwellian space plasma model, the onset of spacecraft charging at geosynchronous altitudes is due to the ambient electron, ambient ions, and secondary electrons. By using current balance, one can show that the onset of spacecraft charging depends not on the ambient electron density but instead on the critical temperature of the ambient electrons. If the ambient plasma deviates significantly from equilibrium, a non-Maxwellian electron distribution results. For a kappa distribution, the onset of spacecraft charging remains independent of ambient electron density. However, for double Maxwellian distributions, the densities do have a role in the onset of spacecraft charging. For a dielectric spacecraft in sunlight, the trapping of photoelectrons on the sunlit side enhances the local electron density. Using the coordinated environmental satellite data from the Los Alamos National Laboratory geosynchronous satellites, we have obtained results that confirm that the observed spacecraft potential is independent of the ambient electron density during eclipse and that in sunlight charging the low-energy population around the sunlit side of the spacecraft is enhanced by photoelectrons trapped inside the potential barrier.",

Two native tree species, Populus sibirica and Ulmus pumila L., have been planted under different irrigation regimes (control, control+2L, control +4L and control +8L) since 2008. To investigate the responses of different tree species to different treatment and the effect of plantation on water balance, intensive field experiments have been carried out in 2013-2014 in Mongolia.\nThe objectives of our study are 1) to investigate whether different irrigation regimes changed the physiological characteristics of tree species, 2) to quantify transpirations and water balance under different irrigation regimes, and 3) to compare the water-use-efficiencies among species and irrigation regimes.\nWe used Granier type thermal dissipation sensor, portable photosynthesis analyzer (Li-Cor 6400) and species and site specific allometric equations for transpiration, photosynthetic characteristics and net primary production, respectively. Our preliminary results show that the transpiration rates of P. sibirica increased with the increase of irrigation amount. For examples, the average water consumption of P. sibirica was 1.87kg/tree under control+2L irrigation and 2.97kg/tree at controal+4L irrigation. However, the transpiration rates of U. pumila were not different among different irrigation regimes; the average transpiration of U. pumila at control+2L was 1.1kg/tree compared to 0.89kg/tree at control+4L. But, photosynthetic characteristic showed similar results, which no apparent response under high irrigation regimes. The water use and carbon assimilation of P. sibirica responded to the water irrigation, however, U. pumila did not show any significant response to added water. Our results show different species respond differently to irrigation regimes, and this would lead to different effects on water balance. Therefore, species consideration is necessary for the restoration of desert area.",

The NCAR Trace Organic Gas Analyzer (TOGA) measured VOCs on board the NSF GV aircraft during both of these experiments. Complementary VOC measurements were made by the UM AWAS on board the GV during CONTRAST. The relatively rapid TOGA measurements (30 second data every 2 minutes) coupled with the very high sensitivity of the instrument allows for tracking signatures of pollution in an otherwise near pristine environment (CONTRAST, TORERO) and for mapping out gradients in the VOC distributions in the northern and southern hemispheres. Because of the wide range of solubilities and reactivities the suite of measured VOCs encompasses, these species provide critical information on the transport and chemical and/or physical processing during and following convective events (CONTRAST). In this study, we use the CAM-Chem 3D chemistry climate model driven with MERRA meteorological fields to provide context to our observational data. The model has a detailed representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.

            "abstract": "The major ecological controls on methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes in northern wetland systems are well known, yet estimates of source/sink magnitudes are often incongruous with measured rates. This mismatch persists because holistic flux datasets are rare, preventing ‘whole picture’ determinations of flux controls. To combat this, we measured net CO2 and CH4 fluxes from September 2012-2013 within a peatland in northern Lapland, Finland. In addition, we performed in situ manipulations and in vitro soil incubations to quantify anaerobic methane oxidation and methanogenic rates as they related to alternative electron acceptor availability. Average annual fluxes varied substantially between different depressions within the wetland, a pattern that persisted through all seasons. Season was a strong predictor of both CO2 and CH4 flux rates, yet CH4 rates were not related to melt-season 10cm or 30cm soil temperatures, and only poorly predicted with air temperatures. We found evidence for both autumnal and spring thaw CH4 bursts, collectively accounting for 26% of annual CH4 flux, although the autumnal burst was more than 5 fold larger than the spring burst. CH4 ebullition measured throughout the growing season augmented the CH4 source load by a factor of 1.5, and was linked with fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within the wetland. Surprisingly, CH4 flux rates were insensitive to Fe(III) and humic acid soil amendments, both of which amplified CO2 fluxes. Using in vitro incubations, we determined anaerobic methane oxidation and methanogenesis rates. Measured anaerobic oxidation rates showed potential consumption of between 6-39% of the methane produced, contributing approximately 1% of total carbon dioxide flux. Treatments of nitrate, sulfate and ferric iron showed that nitrate suppressed methanogenesis, but were not associated with anaerobic oxidation rates.",

We carried out a large-scale kinetic simulation of the magnetosphere for each of the storms examined, using time-dependent global electric and magnetic fields obtained from a global magnetohydrodynamic simulation of each storm events. Oxygen ions were launched from the ionosphere, and protons from the solar wind for several hours prior to storm onset and well into the recovery phase of each storm.\nFor each storm, we delineate the response of the MHD simulation to solar wind driving, the geoeffective access of solar wind and ionospheric ions to the inner magnetosphere, and the characteristics of these ions, including density, pressure, temperature, and temperature anisotropy. We also delineate the physical processes responsible for ion acceleration during each storm event by examining the evolution of entropy for each ion species during each storm.",

            "abstract": "Azores is located in the middle North Atlantic Ocean, between the latitudes 37º-40ºN and longitudes 25º-31º W and are divided into three geographical groups (Western, Central and Eastern Group). Since February 2012 until January 2014, it was install rain water collectors in Terceira and São Miguel Islands to collect monthly meteoric water. GNIP data was incorporated for the long term study. The main goal of the study was to determine spatial and temporal isotopic variations of meteoric water and long-term changes of isotopic composition related with climate change. Determination of environmental isotopes can be a valuable tool to understand the interconnections among climate, hydrology and water resources at local scale for further studies.\nAzores Local Meteoric Water line can be defined as δ2H = 6.84δ18O + 7.51 (R2 = 0.85). The δ18O annually average value in Azores is in accordance with the world-wide distribution based on the GNIP data set.\nCurrent monthly distribution patterns of δ18O and δH concentrations in meteoric water shows a close relation among surface air temperature and amount precipitation. The slope of the linear fit between δ18O concentration in precipitation and temperature is 0.27‰/ºC for South station (Terceira Island). Data show a depletion of isotopic composition of precipitation that coincides with the seasonal occurrence of the frequent crossing of low pressure systems associated with the polar front. The highest values of d-excess are related with storms and are possible to identify different values between North and South stations related with the amount of precipitation, orography and the relative humidity. Short sampling interval during the wet season shows a large variation in isotopic composition of precipitation.\nLong term sampling reveals an increase of δ18O concentration values in precipitation that coincides with the temperature increase at the same period. The decreases of d-excess values suggest a drop in the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. Although, the annual average of precipitation shows a relative increase over the last decade δD monthly average concentration exhibits the largest variation during the year. The result can be related with climate change suggested by the IPCC scenarios.",

Satellite ocean color imagery captures the energetic pattern of phytoplankton associated with the mesoscale and submesoscale features. The model presents the similar pattern of submesoscale variability in the phytoplankton field in early spring, but in fall, this submesoscale pattern is weak because the mesoscale variability is dominant. In winter, the energetic submesoscale variability plays a strong nitrate injection into the euphotic layer, and the distribution of phytoplankton is patchy with the finer-scale horizontal advection and the response time of growth.

            "abstract": "The geosciences lag behind the ecologic and atmospheric sciences in addressing the major scientific and societal ethical issues facing the inhabitants of planet Earth. Regardless, major emerging ethical issues at the interface of the earth system with society demand geoscientist engagement. These include climate change, extinction and biodiversity decline, transformation of terrestrial landscapes and related impacts on ocean ecosystems, and the consequential resonance of these changes on human health, economic and environmental justice, and political stability. The societal factors driving these issues derive from a world view founded on speciesism (human dominion), utilitarian use of resources, unquestioned population and economic growth, and human difficulty in perceiving deep time and large spatial scale. Accommodation of the supernatural, mythical, and political realms with science has led to widespread conflation of scientific consensus with opinion, driving denial of both climate change and evolution.\nFuture success in rationally addressing these ethical conundrums requires geoscientist engagement across the social, political, economic, ethical, philosophical, and historical realms of inquiry. Geoscientists must be well-versed in earth system science principles and the major geologic concepts relevant to understanding anthropogenic change including deep time, the fossil record of evolution, and changes across multiple spatial and temporal scales that transcend human experience. They must also: 1) confront the global population issue, using the archaeological and historical record of its recent rapidly accelerated growth, especially as it impacts resource consumption and earth system function, 2) forcefully address the effects of agriculture on the atmosphere, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, disease, urbanization, and political instability, 3) apply the synthetic principles of conservation biology, including ecosystem science, geoecology, and major advances in understanding the cognitive abilities and social dimensions of non-human animals to address ethical issues involving humanity’s impact on the Earth’s biota, and 4) work to end the accommodation of belief systems with science that invariably leads to denialism and historical confabulation.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how pore- to hillslope-scale processes combine to control nutrient export at larger scales is a fundamental challenge in today’s agroecosystems as the carbon and contamination footprints of production agriculture come under increasing scrutiny. At the Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) Long-Term Agricultural Research (LTAR) station near Pullman, WA we are using in-field observations to track how local-scale hydrological routing and biogeochemical processing interact to control landscape-scale water and nutrient exports. Previous research at the CAF has shown that conservative tracers and reactive nutrient quantities (NO3-,and DOC concentrations, DOM quality) in landscape-scale drainage can be explained by straightforward mixing of waters from variably contributing areas. Nitrate stable isotope composition in subsurface drain effluent indicate that most leached nitrate originates from reduced nitrogen fertilizer applied to the CAF in the autumn, which undergoes nitrification and subsequent leaching. This occurs over a timespan of weeks to months. However, water samples from contributing areas exhibit nitrate d15N and d18O significantly greater than subsurface drain effluent at all locations, and time-series consistent with the occurrence of denitrification at some locations. Possible explanations include pore-scale processing of nitrogen that does not affect the other tracers (like EC, DOM quality, and DOC concentration), and landscape-scale transport pathways that bypass our field instruments. Through this work we are contributing to a broader understand of how global change and local factors and management practices interact to affect the fate of fertilizer N, which is a cross-cutting research theme of the national LTAR network.",

By considering these factors simultaneously, the actual phenomenon of rainfall event can be explained better than univariate model. Recently, applications of multivariate analysis for hydrological data such as extreme rainfall, drought and flood events are increasing rapidly. Theoretically, sample size on 2-dimension sample space needs n-square sample size if univariate frequency analysis needs n sample size. Main object of this study is to estimate of appropriate sample size of bivariate frequency analysis (especially using copula model) for rainfall data. Hourly recorded data (1961~2010) of Seoul weather station from Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) is applied for frequency analysis and three copula models (Clayton, Frank, Gumbel) are used. Parameter estimation is performed by using pseudo-likelihood estimation and estimated mean square error (MSE) on various sample size by peaks over threshold (POT) concept. As a result, estimated thresholds of rainfall depth are 65.4 mm for Clayton, 74.2 mm for Frank, and 76.9 mm for Gumbel, respectively",

            "abstract": "Canopy wakes have been shown, in controlled wind tunnel experiments, to significantly affect the fluxes of momentum, heat and other scalars at the land and water surface over distances of ∼O(1 km), see Markfort et al. (EFM, 2013). However, there are currently no measurements of the velocity field downwind of a full-scale forest canopy. Point-based anemometer measurements of wake turbulence provide limited insight into the extent and details of the wake structure, whereas scanning Doppler wind LiDARs can provide information on how the wake evolves in space and varies over time.\nFor the first time, we present measurements of the velocity field in the wake of a tall patch of forest canopy. The patch consists of two uniform rows of 40-meter tall deciduous, plane trees, which border either side of the Allée de Dorigny, near the EPFL campus. The canopy is approximately 250 m long, and it is approximately 40 m wide, along the direction of the wind. A challenge faced while making field measurements is that the wind rarely intersects a canopy normal to the edge. The resulting wake flow may be deflected relative to the mean inflow. Using multiple LiDARs, we measure the evolution of the wake due to an oblique wind blowing over the canopy. One LiDAR is positioned directly downwind of the canopy to measure the flow along the mean wind direction and the other is positioned near the canopy to evaluate the transversal component of the wind and how it varies with downwind distance from the canopy. Preliminary results show that the open trunk space near the base of the canopy results in a surface jet that can be detected just downwind of the canopy and farther downwind dissipates as it mixes with the wake flow above. A time-varying recirculation zone can be detected by the periodic reversal of the velocity near the surface, downwind of the canopy. The implications of canopy wakes for measurement and modeling of surface fluxes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Water use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of carbon assimilation (A) to water loss via transpiration, is the key physiological parameter that explicitly links water and carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Most studies examining the influence of climatic factors on forest-WUE have focused on site-specific and water-limited ecosystems. Much less is known about the dynamics of WUE across different forest ecosystems, along gradients of climate and soil nutrients. This study explores the variation in WUE at twelve different forested Ameriflux sites across North America spanning a wide range of forest types and climate conditions. We were interested in answering the following questions: 1) Are patterns of WUE at the tree level similar to those for whole ecosystems? 2) Is there a consistent relationship between foliar nitrogen (N) and WUE at the two different scales? 3) To what extent does species diversity explain forest ecosystem functioning and resilience to drought? Finally, 4) Can changes in GPP, ET and WUE across the studied climate gradient be estimated using remotely derived water indices, such as NDWI? We address these questions through a combination of techniques applied at the leaf to landscape level, including foliar δ13C, δ18O and N, eddy covariance and remote sensing data. At each site, we used foliar δ13C to infer intrinsic WUE (iWUE=A/gs) for the two dominant tree species, while foliar N and δ18O provided insights about the species-specific physiological mechanisms underlying variation in iWUE. Furthermore, we used flux data to derive ET and WUEe (i.e., ecosystem WUE= GPP/ET). Variations in iWUE and WUEe in relation to foliar N, climate parameters and water stress index (PSDI) are considered across sites. Moreover, differences in GPP, ET and WUEe are explored in relation to forest ecosystem type, species richness and Shannon’s diversity index. Finally we examine the degree to which changes in WUE are related to NDVI and NDWI.",

The simulations are performed inside a narrow magnetic flux tube that models a coronal hole extending from the solar surface into the solar corona to about 40+ solar radii. The simulations describe broad-spectrum, non-compressive turbulence in an inhomogeneous background, including the outflow velocity, without approximating the nonlinear terms in the governing equations. The turbulence is driven by injecting random velocity fluctuations at the photosphere, which are observationally constrained to emulate photospheric motions on the solar surface. These motions in turn drive Alfvenic fluctuations that propagate out into the solar-corona producing non-WKB reflections in the inhomogeneous background and triggering a turbulence cascade from the interaction between outward and inward (reflected) propagating fluctuations. Several diagnostics are used to probe various turbulence properties such as turbulent power spectra, correlation times and lengths, energy dissipation rates, as well as other turbulence characteristics. These simulations are uniquely positioned to investigate and make physics-based predictions of the kind of measurements that are expected from SPP. We will discuss the results in the context of the upcoming measurements by both missions.",

            "abstract": "The grain size of the streambed surface is an integral part of the transport system because it represents the grains immediately available for transport. If the rate and size of grains entrained from the bed surface differ from that delivered to the bed surface, the bed surface grain size will change. Although this balance is intuitively clear, its implications can surprise. The relative mobility of different sizes in a mixture change as transport rates increase. At small transport rates, smaller sizes are more mobile. As transport rate increases, the transport grain size approaches that of the bed. This presents a dilemma when using flumes to simulate surface sorting and transport. When sediment is fed into a flume, the same sediment is typically used regardless of feed rate. The transport grain size remains constant at all rates, which does not match the pattern observed in the field. This operational constraint means that sediment supply is coarser than transport capacity in feed flumes, increasingly so as transport rates diminish. This imbalance drives a coarsening of the stream bed as less mobile coarse grains concentrate on the surface as the system approaches steady-state. If sediment is recirculated in a flume, sediment supply and entrainment are perfectly matched. Surface coarsening is not imposed, but does occur via kinematic sieving. The coarsening of the transport (and supply) accommodates the rate-dependent change in mobility such that the bed surface grain size does not change with transport rate. Streambed armoring depends on both the rate and grain size of sediment supply – their implications do not seem to be fully appreciated. A coarsened bed surface does not indicate sorting of the bed surface during waning flows – it can persist with active sediment supply and transport. Neither sediment feed nor sediment recirculating flumes accurately mimic natural conditions but instead represent end members that bracket the dynamics of natural streams. Transient conditions of flow, bed sorting, and transport can be simulated if a surface-based transport formula is used. Simple conclusions connecting bed sediment sorting and flow are subject to unresolved detailed interactions and have the capacity to surprise.",

            "abstract": "The global volcanic carbon flux to the surface of Earth is a fundamental parameter in understanding the global carbon cycle that includes deep carbon as well as the degassing history of the mantle. The flux has been estimated before (e.g., Marty and Tolstikhin, 1998). Recent progress has significantly revised some of the parameters used in the estimation, e.g., the oceanic 3He flux has been re-evaluated (Bianchi et al., 2010) to be only about half of the earlier widely-used estimate, and numerous subaerial volcanic degassing data are now available. In this report, a new attempt is made to assess the global carbon flux and budget.\nRather than dividing the carbon flux by categories of MORB, Plumes and Arcs, we estimate the global carbon flux by considering oceanic and subaerial volcanism. The oceanic 3He flux is 527±102 mol/yr (Bianchi et al., 2010). Most of the flux is from spreading ridges with only minor contributions from submarine oceanic hotspots or arc volcanism. Hence, the mean CO2/3He ratio in MORB is applied to estimate oceanic flux of CO2. The subaerial CO2 flux is based on evaluation of different arc segments and is messier to compute. Literature estimates use estimated SO2 flux in the last tens of years combined with estimated CO2/SO2 degassing ratios (Hilton et al., 2002; Fischer, 2008). Assuming that the last tens of years are representative of recent geological times in terms of volcanic degassing, the estimated global CO2 flux still depends critically on a couple of arcs that are main contributors of the subaerial volcanic CO2 flux, and those seem to have been rather loosely constrained before. Using recently available data (although there are still holes), we derive a new global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux. By combining with oceanic volcanic CO2 flux, we obtain at a new global flux. The significance of the new estimate to the global volatile budget will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "A Trial for Improvement in Reproducibility of Spatial Distribution of Afterslip in Geodetic Data InversionAfterslips of plate boundary earthquakes in subduction zones sometimes show doughnut-shaped slip distribution. For example, little afterslip occurred in the coseismic slip area of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake of magnitude (M) 8.0 while large slip occurred in its surrounding area (ex. Miyazaki et al., 2004). However, it is difficult to resolve such heterogeneous distribution for M7 class earthquakes especially in offshore region. We demonstrated the reproducibility of spatial distribution of afterslip following a M7 class earthquake through numerical experiments to estimate slip distribution on the plate interface beneath the Hyuga-nada offshore region, southwest Japan (Nakata et al., 2013). We calculated synthetic displacement data from the result of numerical simulation conducted for the afterslip following a M 6.8 earthquake, for existing global navigation satellite system stations on land and planned ocean floor pressure gauge network stations. The spatial distribution of fault slip is estimated using a Kalman filter-based inversion. The slip distribution estimated by using ocean floor stations demonstrates that the heterogeneity of plate coupling, which roughly corresponds to the coseismic area of the M 6.8 earthquake with a radius of 10 km. The estimated slip amount in the coseismic area is nearly half of the peak one around it, although no slip is the true answer. This discrepancy is caused by the smoothness constraint in the inversion. To improve the reproducibility of the slip distribution, it is necessary to introduce different type of constraints. Based on a Bayesian approach, we introduce an evaluation function that can treat both discontinuity and smoothness in slip distribution.",

Recent studies have found that isoprene SOA formation via the uptake of isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX) under low NOx conditions appears to be largely affected by anthropogenic emissions and are not well understood. Here we investigate the effects of anthropogenic emissions on isoprene SOA formation through airborne measurements above the southeastern US, which is an ideal location for this study since this area is characterized by high emissions of both anthropogenic and isoprene sources. An Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) was deployed aboard the NOAA WP-3D aircraft during the Southeast Nexus (SENEX) field campaign to characterize the non-refractory chemical composition of submicron aerosol. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis was performed on the organic aerosol (OA) mass spectra to identify patterns of organic components and various OA factors were resolved. Low-volatility Oxygenated Organic Aerosol (LV-OOA) constituted a major fraction of OA. Isoprene-derived OA was also identified in certain flights and correlated well with sulfate. This result is consistent with our recent finding from ground-based measurements in Centreville during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign that isoprene-derived OA is directly modulated by the abundance of sulfate. The vertical distribution of isoprene-derived OA will be discussed along with the timescale of the effect of sulfate on isoprene OA formation.",

            "abstract": "Developing and implementing solutions to environmental challenges, such as climate change, depend upon the cultivation of STEM knowledge and skills among today’s youth. Furthermore, STEM instruction enhances learning by providing tools to investigate and analyze environmental issues, making the issue real and tangible to students. That said, educators engaged in the climate literacy movement are aware that possession of knowledge about Earth’s climate and the causes and consequences of climate change is not sufficient to empower individuals to contribute to solutions that promote a sustainable future. By framing the issue of climate change in the context of energy, by utilizing STEM instructional strategies and by showcasing scientists and others working on solutions to address climate change, the Climate Leadership and Energy Awareness Program (Climate LEAP) at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill is cultivating a network of youth who are not only informed about society’s use of energy and the implication for Earth’s climate but also empowered to be part of the solution as society shifts to a low carbon economy.\nDuring this year-long science enrichment program, 9th-12thgraders learn about our fossil fuel based economy, meet scientists who are working to expand the use of renewable energy sources, and develop communication and leadership skills. Experienced educators with UNC’s Institute for the Environment, the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center and the Alliance for Climate Education partner with scientists to implement Climate LEAP.\nIn addition to increasing knowledge of climate science and of the solutions proposed to address climate change, program participants are invited to engage members of their community through implementation of a solutions-oriented community outreach project. Now in its fifth year, 168 students have completed Climate LEAP, with approximately 2/3 completing at least one community outreach project. A survey of program alumni indicated that 90% of respondents were motivated by the program to make at least one behavior change to conserve energy in their daily life.\nThis session will include a description of the program evaluation plan, which includes assessment of student learning..",

            "abstract": "The question of “who” is present in extreme environments is one of the major questions surrounding geobiological research. Techniques such as high-throughput sequencing and single cell genomics are illuminating previously unseen organisms that exist in low abundance. Commonly referred to as the “rare biosphere”, the contribution of these low abundance organisms and the effect that they have on traditional diversity estimates is poorly understood. Here, we present a study that critically examines the effect that sequencing depth has on the Chao1 alpha diversity estimator and the Sørensen similarity index. This is achieved through (1) a theoretical analysis of simulated community distributions and (2) a comparison between subsurface Sanger-sequenced clone libraries and high-throughput amplicon sequences generated from a 1.3 km deep fracture (Be326_Bh2). The screening of single cells, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics are then used to assess the authenticity and contribution of rare members identified in the deeply sequenced amplicon datasets of Be326_Bh2. In particular, a “rare” (<1% relative abundance in 16S rDNA V6 amplicon libraries) member of Ignavibacteria that has been identified and sequenced through single cell genomics is molecularly tracked over the course of a 3-year sampling campaign in Be326_Bh2 while other “rare” members prove to be merely sequencing artifacts. Ultimately, these results help us better understand the limitations of methods used to calculate diversity in long-tail environments like the terrestrial deep subsurface and the role that the rare biosphere plays in Be326_Bh2.",

            "abstract": "Recent theoretical development in transit time theory now allow the effects of different controls on the variability of passive tracer transport through a watershed (or any control volume) to be distinguished. The effects of variable fluxes in and out of the system, including the water balance partitioning, are accounted for explicitly. A new integral form of this theory expresses the way flow paths preferentially sample older or younger water in a convenient and physically meaningful form as a pdf of water in storage ranked by age. Variability of this pdf in time accounts for the effect of shifts in the flow pathways contributing to discharge and ET fluxes. This framework has demonstrated considerable success in reproducing the timeseries of streamflow chloride dynamics in a 28-year dataset from Plynlimon, Wales.\nHere a deeper analysis of those results will be presented, along with analyses of synthetic datasets, to examine key features of this approach. Results that connect to process understanding or have implications for applications in less data-rich watersheds are highlighted. The results show this approach can account for the 1/f fractal filtering of the observed stream chemistry by reproducing both the brief, large deviations associated with large storms and wet antecedent conditions, and the long, persistent memory of past inputs associated with baseflow release from groundwater. The fidelity of the model was further improved by allowing the sampling of age-ranked storage to shift towards younger water when catchment storage was high, and towards older water when it was low, suggesting that the shifting transport pathways associated with overland and macropore flow initiation are captured by this approach. Errors in input concentration timeseries tended to have large, persistent effects that could skew model calibration or the interpretation of results. The time-varying age distribution of catchment evapotranspiration can also be constrained by the stream chloride data due to the sensitivity of modeled evapoconcentration to assumptions about age sampling. Seasonal variations in water balance had a significant effect on the modulation of the amplitude of the seasonal discharge concentrations, with implications for the use of seasonal amplitude to infer mean transit times.",

In this paper we report on an effort to synthesize estimates of shortwave, longwave and spectral surface radiative fluxes by fusing observations from numerous satellite platforms that include MODIS observations.

Either significant ion populations and their influence must be excluded from the simulation or multiple ion populations must be combined into a single fluid.\nIn this study, a multi-fluid adaption of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (MFLFM) model that is capable of including numerous separate fluids is used to: (1) evaluate how different outflowing ion populations propagate in the magnetosphere and enter the tail, (2) determine their resulting magnetospheric distribution, and (3) calculate their relative impacts on SWMI coupling. The outflow flux for each population is regulated using causally driven models based on empirical data. These models include specifications for transversely accelerated O+ originating from the cusp and nightside auroral region, H+ polar wind outflow and the plasmasphere. The outflow distributions and hemispheric outflow flux resulting from these models, and their resulting composition in the magnetosphere are validated using satellite data. The effects of each individual ion source on dayside reconnection, electrodynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and magnetotail processes are evaluated. Among other effects, we find that ionospheric ions that are entrained directly into the warm plasma cloak are more effective at reducing the dayside reconnection potential than ions that are transported further downtail and are convected Earthwards in the plasma sheet.",

            "abstract": "Urban areas are host to numerous sources of environmental pollution, including industry, traffic, and past land uses. To document this pollution within Vigo County, Indiana, we collected several short cores from ponds and wetlands throughout the county, including cores from the old industrial park in Terre Haute, nature parks, a lake impacted by acid mine drainage, and a newly restored wetland to investigate heavy metal burial in these aquatic ecosystems. One core was collected from a holding pond that was constructed in the 1950’s on the former International Paper (IP) site where corrugated packing products were produced for nearly a century. One of the nature parks (Dobbs Nature Park) was established in 1976, while the other sits on a former Brownfield site and was only recently opened to the public (Maple Avenue Nature Park). Scott Lake is adjacent to an abandoned coal mine, and continues to receive acidic drainage. Wabashiki Fish and Wildlife Area is flooded seasonally by the Wabash River. Prior land uses for the Wabashiki include agriculture and illegal dumping. All of these sites, except IP are designated fishing areas. Based on water chemistry and diatom assemblages, these ponds have acceptable water quality; however, some are becoming increasingly more eutrophic. Preliminary results from the IP and Maple Avenue Nature Park sediment cores indicate elevated heavy metal concentrations above background levels and at concentrations high enough to impact benthic organisms based on NOAA Sediment Quality Guidelines. Diatoms from the IP core suggest a transition from low productivity at the base to nutrient-rich conditions in more recent sediments, and several diatom specimens have observable deformities (typically an indicator of heavy metals). The base of the IP core also has metal concentrations that are 5 times greater than the top of the core. In many cases, sediments from the Maple Avenue Nature Park pond have metal concentrations higher than the surrounding soils. The sediments in these ponds appear to be acting as sinks for heavy metals. Unfortunately, there are no regulatory guidelines for sediments even though elevated metal concentrations can impact environmental quality and ultimately human health via the food chain. Ongoing work includes continued analysis of sediment samples for heavy metals.",

These interactions can happen casually, but there are a number of programatic aspects that foster the interaction so that they can be as fruitful as possible during the short period. These include: specific “ice-breaker” activities, practicing “elevator speeches”, embedded lecture questions, question cards, discussion questions, interactive lab activities, structured lab groups, and use of social media. We are continuing to develop new ways to foster profession interaction during these short courses. Along with enhancing their own learning, the inclusion of these strategies provides both the participants and the instructors with models of good pedagogical tools and builds community among the students. Our specific implementation of these strategies and evidence of success will be presented.",

Debate churns about whether expansion of these crops caused conversion of carbon-rich natural ecosystems or instead replaced other crops on existing fields. Here we describe a novel trajectory-based methodology for analyzing satellite-derived land cover products that enables integration of all available and intermediate-year data to improve consistency across data sources, time, and geographic boundaries. Using this approach, we track crop-specific expansion pathways across the conterminous U.S., 2008-2012, and identify the types, amount, and locations of all land converted to and from cropland.\nWe find total cropland area increased by a net of 3 million acres over the study period, with gross land conversion to cropland 2.5 times greater than net expansion. Grasslands were the source of 77% of all new cropland, and we estimate 1.6 million acres (22%) were virgin grasslands that had not been previously planted or plowed. Corn was the most common crop planted directly on new land, as well as the largest indirect contributor to change through its displacement of other crops. Results identify holes in federal policies including improper enforcement of the Renewable Fuels Standard and insufficient coverage of recent Farm Bill provisions, suggesting current implementations of federal policies are likely insufficient to protect remaining grassland habitat.",

During that period, while the science challenges have evolved, the technological advancements have been moving at breakneck speed. Therefore we have the constant challenge of providing cutting edge research experiences to undergraduate students, where the students may not have had exposure beyond their own discipline. The CSU-CHILL REU provides students experience in current research topics. Students publish in leading conferences every year, and produce high quality research.\nThis paper will provide examples of how the interface between technology and science has evolved over years, where some cross training has become easy, while some other challenges still remain.\nThis REU focuses on small groups, so that we can establish one-on-one connections between mentors and students, and instead of just involving students in cutting edge research, we have them actively create it. Students are not merely assigned a small part of a larger project, but often lead their own project. We consider mentors to be supporting their student’s research, and not the other way around. This has led to some very interesting research projects that have contributed to science, and to society at large.\nIn this presentation we will discuss some of the specific challenges that we have encountered when running an interdisciplinary REU program, as well as some of the secondary support activities that we do that extend far beyond the student's participation in the REU.",

            "abstract": "The prediction skills of climate model simulations in the western tropical Pacific (WTP) and East Asian region are assessed using the retrospective forecasts of seven state-of-the-art coupled models and their multi-model ensemble (MME) for boreal summers (June-August) during the period 1983-2005, along with corresponding observed and reanalyzed data. The prediction of summer rainfall anomalies in East Asia is difficult, while the WTP has a strong correlation between model prediction and observation. We focus on developing a new approach to further enhance the seasonal prediction skill for summer rainfall in East Asia and investigate the influence of convective activity in the WTP on East Asian summer rainfall. By analyzing the characteristics of the WTP convection, two distinct patterns associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) developing and decaying modes are identified. Based on the multiple linear regression method, the East Asia Rainfall Index (EARI) is developed by using the interannual variability of the normalized Maritime continent-WTP indices (MPIs), as potentially useful predictors for rainfall prediction over East Asia, obtained from the above two main patterns. For East Asian summer rainfall, the EARI has superior performance to the East Asia summer monsoon index (EASMI) or each MP index (MPI). Therefore, the regressed rainfall from EARI also shows a strong relationship with the observed East Asian summer rainfall pattern. In addition, we evaluate the prediction skill of the East Asia reconstructed rainfall obtained by statistical-empirical approach using the cross-validated EARI from the individual models and their MME. The results show that the rainfalls reconstructed from simulations capture the general features of observed precipitation in East Asia quite well. This study convincingly demonstrates that rainfall prediction skill is considerably improved by using the statistical-empirical method compared to the dynamical models.\n Acknowledgements\nThis work was carried out with the support of the Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development under Grant Project No. PJ009953, Republic of Korea.",

            "abstract": "Annual, monoculture cropping systems have become the standard agricultural model in the Midwestern US. Unintended consequences of these systems include surface and groundwater pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity, and soil erosion. Diverse agroforestry (DA) systems dominated by fruit and nut trees/shrubs have been proposed as an agricultural model for the Midwestern US that can restore ecosystem services while simultaneously providing economically viable and industrially relevant staple food crops. A DA system including six species of fruit and nut crops was established on long-time conventional agricultural land at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2012, with the conventional corn-soybean rotation (CSR) as a control. Initial field measurements of the nitrogen and water cycles during the first two years of transition have indicated a significant decrease in N losses and modification of the seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) pattern. While these early results suggest that the land use transition from CSR to DA can have positive biogeochemical consequences, models must be utilized to make long-term biogeochemical projections in agroforestry systems.\nInitial field measurements of plant phenology, net N2O flux, nitrate leaching, soil respiration, and soil moisture were used to parameterize the DA system within the DayCENT biogeochemical model as the “savanna” ecosystem type. The model was validated with an independent subset of field measurements and then run to project biogeochemical cycling in the DA system for 25 years past establishment. Model results show that N losses via N2O emission or nitrate leaching reach a minimum within the first 5 years and then maintain this tight cycle into the future. While early ET field measurements revealed similar magnitudes between the DA and CSR systems, modeled ET continued to increase for the DA system throughout the projected time since the trees would continue to grow larger. These modeling results illustrate the potential long-term biogeochemical impacts that can be generated by a land-use transition to a diverse agroforestry system in the Midwest.",

            "abstract": "[Abstract] Lakes play a crucial role in the global water cycle and balance, are sensitive to global warming, and are vital for human water supply. There clearly is a pressing need to understand temporal and spatial variations in lake water storage globally, especially in the lake-rich Arctic/Sub-Arctic regions. An accurate systematic lake inventory, however, is unavailable at global scales. Owing to its broad spatial coverage and repeat-pass monitoring capability, satellite remote sensing is the only feasible approach to inventory global lake dynamics. Global lake mapping at high resolutions is a rather challenging task. Since lakes are abundant in small-size classes and their seasonality varies from region to region, a huge number of high-resolution satellite images need to be acquired in “appropriate” seasons. The appropriate seasons refer to the period in a typical year when lakes are relatively stable, and are determined spatially using precipitation and temperature datasets. Thousands of cloud-free Landsat images at 30 m resolution have been acquired during lake-stable seasons. Satellite lake mapping succeeds at different levels from place to place and from season to season. A set of highly replicable automated lake mapping methods and tools have been developed to tackle various situations across the entire Earth and to handle such a large volume of satellite data. The current goal is to produce a circa 2000 high-resolution global lake database in a systematic way. Millions of lakes larger than 0.5 ha have been inventoried. The product is currently examined in an intensive quality control and quality assurance process. Over six million lakes in pan-Arctic (45 deg N and above) are captured in the database and have been validated for release.",

            "abstract": "The increasing resolution of seismic tomography studies as well as techniques that are sensitive to sharp, localized velocity changes indicate that melt is present in diverse tectonic settings in the upper mantle. Unresolved questions are the quantification of seismic velocities and attenuation to melt fraction, and the dynamic stability of this melt. Properties of partially molten rocks are generally sensitive to melt geometry. The melt geometry can be observed in experiments, but the experimental observations have to be extrapolated to mantle grain sizes. High resolution images of experimentally observed melt geometries (Garapic et al., 2013) indicate that the broad attenuation peak observed by forced torsional oscillation experiments (Jackson et al., 2004, Faul et al., 2004) are due to melt ‘squirt’. Characterization of the inferred melt geometry in rocks recovered from mid-ocean ridges and peridotite massifs suggest that the experimental observations are applicable to the upper mantle. The data from the earlier seismic property experiments will be reprocessed with improved apparatus calibration and fitting strategies to provide a ‘global’ fit to the melt-bearing data as a function of grain size and melt fraction. This should allow quantification of the amount of melt imaged in seismic studies and therefore enable more accurate geodynamical models for example of arcs and backarcs, for which the highest resolution tomographic images exist. It should also provide more quantitative constraints on the amount of melt required to generate receiver functions and SS-bounces that suggest the presence of melt in the asthenosphere.",

            "abstract": "Two extreme snowfall events associated with extratropical cyclones interacting with the Himalaya Mountains are simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. These two events exemplify contrasting large-scale conditions typically observed in the winter and early spring. One event in January 1999 was characterized by a strong zonally oriented subtropical jet flowing directly over the mountains, with the cyclone becoming terrain-locked in the western-Himalayan “notch”. Another event in March 2006 featured a deep longwave trough on the jet, facilitating cyclogenesis further south, with two successive cyclones passing along the entire Himalayan ridge. These features of the events are captured by the simulations, so that snowfall is confined to the western Himalaya in the January simulation, while a near-continuous band of accumulated snowfall along the Himalayan ridge forms in the March simulation. Satellite rainfall estimates (TRMM) and interpolated rain-gauge measurements (APHRODITE) largely validate these precipitation distributions, but highlight some possible shortcomings of the model when simulating such events. Snowfall rate throughout both simulations is largely determined by cross-barrier moisture flux, which is generally greatest wherever the cyclonic winds are convergent against the mountains at each time. However, the March 2006 simulation evolves in an environment with greater moisture transport towards the mountains than in the January 1999 event. Hence greater precipitation rates and more solid snowbands are generated in the March than in the January simulation. However, due to the terrain-locking of the cyclone in the January event, individual locations receive more persistent snowfall, so that the greatest accumulations are similar (about 150 mm) between the two events, although these accumulations are much more widespread in the March event.",

This is a new collaborative study which will continue the best practices achieved from other projects such as the EU-FP7 PRE-EARTHQUAKE and the ongoing ISSI project LAICa. The test region covers the entire Greece which is of the highest seismicity all over western Eurasia, while closer attention will be given to the Corinth Rift (Central Greece) which is an asymmetric half-graben of high seismicity opening rapidly with geodetic extension rates up to about 15mmyr−1. Ground-based observations will mainly include seismicity, magnetometers and radon measurements while space observations will include the ones that may provide thermal anomalies, GPS and TEC. The strategy will include the development of a system operating in real-time basis with strong tools and protocols for the collection, archiving and evaluation of the different types of data. The software part of the system may incorporate three basic interfaces implemented via open source technology: (1) The up-streaming software interface for the collection and archiving of data; (2) The backend real-time software interface incorporating all the available models; (3) The frontend WEBGIS software interface that will allow for data representation and mapping. The establishment of some certain rules for issuing non-public seismic alerts is needed. Therefore, in this paper we will also discuss the significance of the proposed work for the issues of earthquake forecasting/prediction statements and what critical new observations and measurements should be pursued to enable models to be falsifiable, following established scientific methodologies.",

            "abstract": "Collisions of hot oxygen atoms with background atmospheric gases constitute an important mechanism of escape of light atomic and molecular species to space, as well as contribute to deviation from thermal equilibrium in the upper martian atmosphere. In this study, we used newly available quantum-mechanical cross sections1 to carry out a state-to-state analysis of one such process: a reactive collision of hot oxygen atoms with thermal molecular hydrogen gas. Dissociative recombination of O2+ molecular ions and secondary collisions of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) produced in charge-exchange between solar wind ions and atmospheric gases2 were considered as the sources of hot oxygen atoms. The resulting kinetic energy distributions of the product OH and H2 molecules were constructed and corresponding escape rates for several solar wind conditions were calculated. The produced molecules favor higher excited rotational and vibrational quantum states that significantly differ from thermal distributions, offering a chance for detection. In the final part of this study, we analyzed the influence of increased production of energetic oxygen atoms on the molecular production rates and escape due to the encounter of Mars with Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). The results of this study are directly applicable to ongoing efforts to better understand the evolution of Mars' atmosphere and the MAVEN mission.\n1 M. Gacesa and V. Kharchenko, Geophys. Res.

            "abstract": "The temporal variation in microbial communities inhabiting the anoxic, sediment-covered basaltic ocean basement is largely uncharacterized due to the inaccessible nature of the environment and difficulties associated with collection of samples from low-biomass microbial habitats. Here, a deep sea instrumented platform was employed on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the summer of 2013 to collect 46 samples of basement fluids from the most recent generation of borehole observatories (U1362A and B), which feature multiple sampling horizons at a single location and fluid delivery lines manufactured using stainless steel or inert polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) parts. Included were three time-series deployments of the GEOmicrobe sled meant to resolve the fine-scale (i.e. hourly) temporal variation within in situ crustal microbial communities. Illumina technology was used to sequence small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene fragments from sediment, seawater, and subseafloor fluids. Similar to has been reported previously, basic differences in the three environments was observed. Fluid samples from depth horizons extending 30, 70, and ~200 meters sub-basement revealed differences in the observed microbial communities, indicating potential depth-specific zonation of microorganisms in the basaltic basement fluids. Extensive overlap between microorganisms collected from a single depth horizon but using two fluid delivery lines manufactured with different materials was observed, though some differences were also noted. Several archaeal (e.g. THSCG, MCG, MBGE, Archaeoglobus) and bacterial (e.g. Nitrospiraceae, OP8, KB1) lineages detected in previous years of basement fluid sampling nearby were found here, which further supports the notion that these microorganisms are stable residents of anoxic basaltic subseafloor fluids. Direct cell enumeration of samples collected from U1362A and U1362B revealed an elevated biomass compared to samples at these locations from previous years, demonstrating that high-quality borehole fluid samples may range up to ~45,000 cells x ml-1. This analysis helps to constrain subseafloor biomass estimates, reveals its variability in both short and long temporal scales, and provides a glimpse of the variability in microbial community structure that spans from hours to years.",

            "abstract": "Since Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) has been launched in 1997 as the first satellite mission dedicated to measuring precipitation, the spatiotemporal gaps of precipitation observation have been filled significantly. On February 27th, 2014, Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) satellite has been launched as a core observatory of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), an international multi-satellite mission aiming to provide the global three hourly map of rainfall and snowfall. In addition to Ku-band, Ka-band radar is newly equipped, and their combination is expected to introduce higher precision than the precipitation measurement of TRMM/PR. In this study, the GPM level-2 orbit products are evaluated comparing to various precipitation observations which include TRMM/PR, in-situ data, and ground radar. In the preliminary validation over intercross orbits of DPR and TRMM, Ku-band measurements in both satellites shows very close spatial pattern and intensity, and the DPR is capable to capture broader range of precipitation intensity than of the TRMM. Furthermore, we suggest a validation strategy based on ‘objective classification’ of background atmospheric mechanisms. The Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) and auxiliary datasets (e.g., tropical cyclone best track) is used to objectively determine the types of precipitation. Uncertainty of abovementioned precipitation products is quantified as their relative differences and characterized for different precipitation mechanism. Also, it is discussed how the uncertainty affects the synthesis of TRMM and GPM for a long-term satellite precipitation observation records which is internally consistent.",

            "abstract": "Northern temperate forests are expected to show: (1) strong carbon sink strength, particularly in regrowing forests managed for timber production; (2) positive responses of productivity to moderate increases in temperature, in particular to spring warming; (3) strong N limitation such that N additions through fertilization or deposition result in increased productivity and C uptake; (4) a low but uniform rate of methane uptake due to methanotroph activity in the soil. Data is synthesized here from eddy covariance measures of CO2 and methane flux in conjunction with large plot measurements and stand-level experimental studies to address each of these predictions – with strong evidence found AGAINST each of them. Eddy covariance measurements from 2010-2012 in a selection-managed forest measured 13-16 years following a partial stand harvest indicate a net CO2 source of from ~1-4 Mg C ha-1 y-1, in large part due to consistently high respiration rates. By far the largest carbon loss occurred in 2010, a year in which spring leaf flush by the dominant tree species Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia corresponded with seasonally exceptional temperatures of 31-33°C, and a corresponding decline in leaf-level photosynthesis and leaf area index of the dominant (but not other) tree species. Analyses of spatial variation in forest productivity and direct experimental additions of N and P suggest that the forest is not N limited, but rather co-limited by P and cations (especially Ca and Mg). In contrast to the strong observed CO2 source, the study site is a strong sink for methane, sufficiently strong that predicted climate forcing effects due to methane uptake more than offset those due to CO2 losses. Chamber studies indicate that methane uptake is not uniform, but rather that local depressions and lower slopes can show high methane emissions consistent with hypoxia effects. Current studies are examining methods of enhancing forest climate mitigation through management to address non-N nutrient limitations through use of pyrolyzed forestry mill waste material (“biochar”) as a soil amendment, and by silvicultural methods to enhance local tree species diversity, including species with more southern distributions (“passive silvicultural assisted migration”).",

The Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation Project (PINEMAP) represents an effort to understand the future of 20 million acres of planted pine forests managed by private landowners in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal states.\nDecades of productivity research on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) has led to a widespread practice of mid-rotation fertilization of loblolly plantations, supplying additional nutrients as stands approach canopy closure. It remains an open question what the effects of fertilization of pine forests in this region will be in the face of periodic or persistent droughts, in terms of forest water use and its implications to other water uses downstream.\nTherefore, we will review key results from past ecophysiological research on the responses of loblolly pine to fertilization, elevated CO2 and water availability, as well as a recent PINEMAP field trial of fertilization and drought imposed through rainfall displacement over two growing seasons. Despite high rainfall in 2013 (1224 mm compared an average 1120 mm) and a lack of leaf area response, transpiration decreased in response to fertilization and through rainfall displacement. Treatment differences were greatest in the growing season of 2013, when transpiration was on average 13.6, 20.2 and 28.7% lower in the rainfall displacement, fertilization and combined treatment than the control (46 mm/month), respectively. We will conclude by reviewing the important lessons from this research for regional models of future forests in this region in terms of LAI, transpiration, growth and water use efficiency.",

A common way to assess the consequences of impervious cover and grey infrastructure is by measuring runoff hydrographs. This focus on the watershed outlet masks the spatial variation of hydrologic process alterations across the urban environment in response to localized landscape characteristics. We attempt to represent this spatial variation in the urban environment using the statistically and spatially distributed i-Tree Hydro model, a scoping level urban forest effects water balance model. i-Tree Hydro has undergone expansion and modification to include the effect of green infrastructure processes, road network attributes, and urban pipe system leakages. These additions to the model are intended to increase the understanding of the altered urban hydrologic cycle by examining the effects of the location of these structures on the water balance. Specifically, the effect of these additional structures and functions on the spatially varying properties of interception, soil moisture and runoff generation. Differences in predicted properties and optimized parameter sets between the two models are examined and related to the recent landscape modifications.

            "abstract": "Emplacement mechanisms of clastic dikes, which are discordant and tabular bodies comprised of weakly to strongly lithified clastic detritus, have been a matter of considerable interest over the last 20 years. Clastic dikes are generally classified into neptunian and injected dikes. Using the magnetic fabrics (AMS), we attempt to classify the clastic dikes in the late Cretaceous Dadaepo Basin, SE Korea, and interpret their emplacement mechanisms. The neptunian dikes exhibit a typical oblate sedimentary fabric which makes a sharp contrast with the injected dikes. The fabrics of the injected dikes are greatly influenced by current conditions (flow directions, rheological properties, and rates) and transportation types (imbrication or rolling) of filling materials. Based on the AMS fabrics, they are classified into four types. (1) Type-VP is formed by grain imbrication in low- to moderate-energy vertical flow of a Newtonian fluid and characterized by a bilateral symmetry of fabrics across the dike. (2) Type-VT results from grain rolling in vertical high-energy flow and is characterized by subvertical k2 and subhorizontal k1 axes on the dike plane. (3) Type-HP is formed by grain imbrication in horizontal low- to moderate-energy flow, resulting in subvertical k3 and subhorizontal k1 and k2 axes. (4) Type-HT is formed by grain rolling in horizontal high-energy flow, resulting in streaked k2-k3 on the dike plane and horizontally clustered k1 axes. The AMS fabrics of each type can be a significant indicator for flow direction. The observed AMS fabric of low-energy current immediately above the source layer indicates that fluidized clastic materials in the lower part of injected dike can flow laterally by lateral propagation of new or pre-existing fractures due to a dominant horizontal pressure gradient. Based on abundant AMS fabrics of high-energy current, coexistence of paleoseismic structures, and tectonic setting of the basin, earthquake-induced liquefaction is the most plausible trigger for the dike formation. Systematic attitudes of the injected dikes also indicate their potential as a powerful tool for reconstructing paleostress field.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic plate boundary shear zones commonly initiate along preexisting weaknesses oriented obliquely to the direction of relative plate motion. Slip on multiple fault sets with diverse orientations and slip directions is required to accommodate the three dimensional strain of such plate margins. However, little is known about how this is accomplished by faults that rupture in individual earthquakes and specifically whether permutations in stress state are required to drive slip on multiple fault sets. The 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah (EMC) earthquake ruptured a complex network of high- and low-angle faults that record systematic, incremental changes in kinematics with fault orientation. Here we show that stress inversions of coseismic surface rupture and aftershock focal mechanisms define two coaxial, but permuted stress states. The maximum and intermediate principal stress axes are close in magnitude, but switch orientations due to topography- and density-controlled gradients in lithostatic load. Both states of nearly uniaxial stress permitted a wide variety of fault orientations to slip at once, accomplishing three-dimensional strain in a single earthquake sequence. Stress at seismogenic depth significantly exceeded the minimum failure strength of optimally oriented faults demonstrating the interlocking nature of the complex fault network. Rupture initiated on a keystone fault that required the greatest differential stress for failure and spontaneously propagated to faults with more favorable orientations. We conclude that tectonically generated stress within plate boundary shear zones is likely to be heterogeneous, with high-stress regions associated with interlocking fault networks that have longer recurrence intervals and generate earthquakes significantly larger than would be expected from any one isolated, constituent fault. High differential stress and dynamically reduced friction facilitates seismogenic slip on faults with low slip tendency such as on the low-angle normal faults of the EMC rupture.",

            "abstract": "Much of our society, including our agriculture, our dependence on natural resources, and our infrastructure, is built on the assumption that individual weather events and average conditions may vary from year to year, but over the long term the climate of a given region can be predicted based on past climate “normals”. This assumption is no longer valid; today, human-induced climate change is altering average conditions as well as the risk of many types of weather extremes.\nObserved trends and projected future changes in mean climate and in the frequency and severity of temperature extremes, heat waves, heavy precipitation events, coastal flooding, and storms are clearly documented in the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment, as well as by a host of other regional impact assessments. While future projections are inherently uncertain, these assessments make one fact clear: future planning for any sector or region affected by climate change that fails to take into account long-term trends will end up with the wrong answer.\nThis concept of non-stationarity, that future climate will differ from that experienced in the past, challenges regional planners, water managers, city managers and engineers to incorporate future climate change into present-day planning. From the perspective of scientists, translating climate projections into information that can be used by stakeholders and decision-makers presents a challenge of equal magnitude.\nHere, I draw on my experience working with the agriculture, ecosystem, energy, health, infrastructure, insurance, and water sectors to propose a framework for, and highlight some of the main challenges inherent to, incorporating climate information into practical, on-the-ground planning at the local to regional scale. This approach, which we have developed through working with a range of cities, states, and regions including Austin, Cambridge, California, Chicago, Delaware, the Northeast, and most recently Washington DC, is based on identifying known vulnerabilities within the systems of interest, and developing appropriate information compatible with existing planning mechanisms to ensure the relevance and utility of the climate information for increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate risks.",

            "abstract": "Anaerobic conditions common in peatlands lead microbes to reduce alternative electron acceptors for respiration in the order of their energetic yield: nitrate, manganese, ferric iron (Fe[III]), sulfate, and CO2. Many studies of peatland respiration report high CO2 fluxes that cannot be completely explained by measured pathways of microbial metabolism: it appears that an unquantified pool of electron acceptors is driving respiration and the efflux of CO2. The notion that undetected iron reduction may be an important contributing factor to these fluxes has been proposed, but has yet to be addressed. Among the possible causes for this anomaly is the widespread use of colorimetric assays for iron quantitation and speciation. Peat porewater contains high concentrations of dissolved humic and fulvic acids that occlude Fe(III), blocking colorimetric complex formation, potentially leading to an underestimate of Fe(III) in these challenging analytical matrices.\nWe evaluated a novel ionic liquid extraction method in a variety of temperate peatland porewater samples and compared these results to data acquired simultaneously using colorimetric methods. We found a >50% average improvement in accuracy for total iron quantitation using ionic liquid extraction. Moreover, ionic liquid extraction of peat porewater consistently recovered Fe(III) whereas colorimetric methods detected 50-100% less, suggesting that DOM bound Fe(III) is not reliably detected using colorimetric assays in these systems and may represent a previously unidentified pool of electron acceptors in peat porewater.",

            "abstract": "Urban sprawl in many western U.S. cities has expanded development onto alluvial fans. In the case of metropolitan Phoenix, AZ (MPA), urban sprawl has led to an exponential outward growth into surrounding mountainous areas and onto alluvial fans. Building on alluvial fans places humans at greater risk to flooding and debris flow hazards. Recent research has shown debris flows often supply large quantities of material to many alluvial fans in MPA. However, the risk of debris flows to built environments is relatively unknown. We use a 2D debris flow modeling approach, aided by high-resolution airborne LiDAR and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) topographic data, to examine debris flow behavior in a densely populated portion of the MPA to assess the risk and vulnerability of debris flow damage to the built infrastructure. A calibrated 2D debris flow model is developed for a \"known\" recent debris flow at an undeveloped site in MPA. The calibrated model and two other model scenarios are applied to a populated area with historical evidence of debris flow activity. Results from the modeled scenarios show evidence of debris flow damage to houses built on the alluvial fan. Debris flow inundation is also evident on streets on the fan. We use housing values and building damage to estimate the costs assocaited with various modeled debris flow scenarios.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) onboard the Mars Express spacecraft possesses an ionospheric mode, which is used for local and remote sounding measurements of the Martian topside ionosphere. Ideally, the sounding pulse transmitted by MARSIS gives a vertical reflection from the horizontally stratified ionosphere, down to the ionospheric peak. In practice, this is usually the case, however oblique reflections are also detected. These oblique reflections are often found in regions where the remanent crustal magnetic field is nearly vertical and the sources of reflections are often at a higher apparent altitude than the surrounding ionosphere for the same electron density level. There are recurring observations of such ionospheric upwellings during repeated passes of Mars Express above certain regions over time periods of tens of days. An increased ionospheric scale height seems to create these plasma bulges. A possible cause is a localized heating of the neutral atmosphere due to the entrance of solar wind plasma through the magnetic cusps. We test this explanation by using in situ measurements of electron energy distributions made by the Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA-3) onboard Mars Express. The statistical study considers dayside oblique echoes (solar zenith angle ≤ 90°) with spacecraft altitude ≤1100 km, for orbits with sufficient MARSIS data coverage and corresponding to a criterion of repetitive passes above a given region. We keep only oblique echoes which are no further below than 10 km in apparent altitude compared to the surrounding ionosphere (most of the cases), to ensure the echoes most likely come from near the vertical direction, at the time of closest approach. Finally we take the oblique echoes with simultaneous ASPERA-3 data, with short time intervals (up to 2 minutes) before and after the time of closest approach. This leaves 761 oblique echoes. The intervals are then manually checked for the fraction of electron spectra having features typical of the magnetosheath and magnetic pileup region, such as differential energy flux intensity at energies >50 eV. The results are a classification of the oblique echoes into: solar wind only, no solar wind and mixing of both, which we can use to characterize the generation of ionospheric bulges.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotope values of biogenic silica are increasingly used as proxies of paleoenvironmental conditions. Numerous studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between the diatom silica and the temperature/oxygen isotope value of the formation water; however, some studies have indicated that early diagenesis of biogenic silica may alter the oxygen isotope values by several permil. Quantification of the maturation process has proven difficult since the mechanisms that drive post-mortem changes in the silica oxygen isotope values have not been well characterized. New silica maturation data from marine diatoms, Stephanopyxis turris, cultured in a controlled laboratory experiment demonstrate rapid post-mortem decline in silica reactivity. A decrease in relative abundance of surface silanol groups coincides with a decrease in the surface charge density (excess proton concentration) of freshly harvested frustules. Over a maturation period of 20 days at 85ºC, S. turris samples in a 0.7 M NaCl solution at a pH of 8.0 demonstrate a rapid decrease in the surface charge density from -380 µmoles/g to -16 µmoles/g (Figure 1). FTIR analyses reveal a decrease in the abundance of silanol groups (Si-OH) in the diatom frustules occurs over the same time period. It is important to note that the surface charge density and silanol relative abundance appear to have an asymptotic change through time, indicating that further alteration/reactivity is greatly reduced. Preliminary data indicate that post-mortem increases in the oxygen isotope values of diatom silica observed here and in other studies are coincident with a reduction in the surface charge density and silanol abundance. These experiments demonstrate that rapid post-mortem alteration of biogenic silica is occurring and provide a possible mechanism for alteration of oxygen isotope values in biogenic silica.",

These methods generally ignore the nonlinear chemistry associated with the pollution formation or require unaffordable computational time. Here we use the adjoint of GEOS-Chem CTM at 0.25x0.3125 degree resolution to examine the sources contributing to the PM2.5 pollution over North China in winter 2013. We improved the model sulfate simulation by implementing the aqueous-phase oxidation of S(IV) by nitrogen dioxide. The adjoint results provide detailed source information at the model underlying grid resolution including source types and sectors. We show that PM2.5 pollution over Beijing and Baoding (Hebei) in winter was largely contributed by the large-scale residential and industrial burnings, and ammonia (NH3) emissions from agriculture activities. Nearly half of pollution was transported from outside of the city domains, and accumulated over 2-3 days. We also show under the current emission conditions, the PM2.5 concentrations over North China are more sensitive to NH3 emissions than NOx and SO2 emissions.",

            "abstract": "The Qaidam Basin (QB) is an inter-mountane basin in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (QTP), and various palaeoenvironmental reconstructions have been undertaken assuming that the sediments contain continuous and high-resolution records. The climate is hyper-arid today, and is one of the most arid places in the world. The Chaerhan salt lake is the depo-center for the QB during the Quaternary. The Shell Bar, located in this lake with million of ARTICULATED Corbicula shells living in freshwater, had been previously interpreted to be shorelines representing high lake stand, with 14C ages of 30-40 ka BP. Our new interpretation proposes that it appears to have been formed by an active stream or a small river that flowed into the Chaerhan playa after a lake regressed from the basin floor. The river incised a channel into the lacustrine muds of that former lake, and the accumulation of Corbicula shells and the thin salt crust layer on top provided resistance to the wind erosion that have deflated the surrounding lake sediments, leaving it in topographical relief. At present the channel rises up to 2-3 m above the playa. Our OSL dating results shows that it has an age of about 100 ka. Since the Chaerhan playa is the depositional center of the inland QB during the Quaternary, this implies that the area has experienced considerable deflation since ca. 100 ka. When looking at the chronological data published so far in the basin, we found similar ages of 100 ka for the surface sediments, which indicate that the basin in general has experienced dramatic wind erosion.\nDifferent opinions exist towards the dust source of the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) which is located to the east of the QB. It has been argued that the QB contributed little dust to the CLP, as the dust generated in the QB could not reach the CLP. However, some others proposed the opposite. Our geochemistry data show that the similarities of major-element analysis for samples from the QB (both lacustrine and loess), Qinghai Lake (loess), and the Chinese Loess Plateau (loess) indicate that the QB is an important dust source for the loess in Qinghai Lake and the Chinese Loess Plateau. Our numerical modeling showed that dust could be transported from the QB to the Loess Plateau during the glacial periods. Field observation also supports our new model of the geomorphic process in the enclosed basin.",

To expose undergraduate students to similar experiences, our team has developed six classroom modules that utilize large, long-term, and sensor-based, datasets for science courses designed to: 1) Improve quantitative skills and reasoning; 2) Develop scientific discourse and argumentation; and 3) Increase student engagement in science. A team of ten interdisciplinary faculty from both private and public research universities and undergraduate institutions have developed flexible modules suitable for a variety of undergraduate courses. These modules meet a series of pedagogical goals that include: 1) Developing skills required to manipulate large datasets at different scales to conduct inquiry-based investigations; 2) Developing students’ reasoning about statistical variation; and 3) Fostering desirable conceptions about the nature of environmental science. Six modules on the following topics are being piloted during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 academic years prior to broad dissemination: 1) Temporal stream discharge evaluation using USGS data; 2) Temporal stream nutrient loads and eutrophication risk using USGS and MCM-LTER data; 3) Climate change using NOAA weather and Vostok ice core data; 4) Lake ice-off dates using GLEON data; 5) Thermal dynamics in lakes using GLEON data; and 6) Lake metabolism dynamics using GLEON data.\nTo assess achievement of the pedagogical goals, we will use pre/post questionnaires and video-recordings of students working on modules. Questionnaires will contain modified items from the Experimental Design Ability Test (Sirum & Humberg 2011), the Views on the Nature of Science questionnaire (Lederman et al. 2001), and a validated instrument to measure students’ ideas about variation (Watson et al. 2003). Information gained from these assessments and recordings will allow us to determine whether our modules are effective at engaging students and increasing their quantitative skills. Feedback will also be used by the faculty to revise the modules before they are posted online for widespread dissemination in 2016. This project is funded by an NSF TUES grant.",

            "abstract": "Surface-level particulate matter (PM2.5) strongly impacts air quality and, other than surface-level ozone, is known for being the most destructive pollutant to both a person's lungs and overall health. Because of its small size, PM2.5 is able to travel deep enough into a person’s lungs to cause significant damage. PM2.5 monitoring is executed primarily through ground monitors, but the readings are limited to only the specific area where the ground monitors are located. Satellite data can sample a larger area, and therefore provides a more comprehensive reading. This study utilized multiple measurements of aerosol data including MODIS, airborne in-situ and LIDAR readings collected by the DISCOVER-AQ team, and ground monitoring stations in the Houston, Texas area. Comparing measurements from these sources produced a more robust understanding of near-surface air pollution. Analyzing measurements from the aircraft and from ground-based monitoring sites can help in evaluating future ground-level pollution measurements from space. Increased accuracy when monitoring can help officials assess and forecast air quality. Efficient air quality forecasts will help the general public take the necessary health precautions, such as avoiding prolonged outdoor activity, when PM2.5 levels are high.",

            "abstract": "Western Kyushu Island is a region of Japan frequently impacted by typhoon landfalls. This region is relatively tectonically stable with few active faults and therefore known for far fewer great earthquakes when compared to the Nankai Trough region. Only a few studies have examined the history of tsunamis impacting the region. Hence, studies from western Kyushu provide a unique opportunity to study tsunami deposits in a broader geographic context in order to delineate regional typhoon impacts. This study presents results from both modern analogue from Typhoon Neoguri in 2014 and legendary Kamikaze Typhoons from 13th century.\nThe initial coring was conducted in 2010. Total of 9 sediment cores were collected from two natural freshwater lakes along the western coast of Kyushu: Lake Daija (32.248°N, 129.985°E) and Lake Kawahara (32.624°N, 129.831°E). In order to further understand the characteristics of typhoon deposits, we collected 4 additional sediment cores from Kawahara in July of 2014, approximately one week after landfall of Typhoon Neoguri. We use a multi-proxy approach to identify event deposits. These approaches include loss on ignition, X-Ray fluorescence, X-radiograph, grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and SEM/EDS analyses. Initial results yielded commonalities between the two lakes. Linear interpolation of the most prominent event deposits within multiple cores, presenting highs in Sr and Ca intensities, constrain the dates of deposits of interest to the late 13th century—consistent with the Mongol invasions. Here we present preliminary geochemical results from Lake Kawahara, which further constrain the typhoon deposits, and use this as a reference event for comparison to tsunami deposits found in other regions.",

Consistent with other Martian meteorites, apatite grains in Martian meteorite NWA 6234 are dominantly Cl-apatite suggesting that the parental magma to NWA 6234 may have been rich in Cl. Here we experimentally investigate the effect of chlorine on liquidus depression and near liquidus crystallization of a synthetic composition of NWA 6234 and compare these results with previous experimental results on the effect of chlorine on near-liquidus crystallization.\nPrevious experimental results using two different starting synthetic Martian basalt compositions showed that the change of liquidus temperature is dependent on the bulk composition of the basalt. The effect of Cl on liquidus depression is greater for lower SiO2, higher Al2O3 magmas than higher SiO2, lower Al2O3 magmas, possibly due to an affinity for Cl to complex with network-modifying cations. The bulk composition for this study has an intermediate Al2O3 content; therefore, we can further constrain the effect of the bulk composition on the influence of chlorine on near-liquidus crystallization.\nHigh pressure and temperature crystallization experiments were performed at 10 Kbar (1 GPa) on a synthetic basalt, of the bulk composition of NWA 6234, with 0 - 4 wt% Cl added to the sample as AgCl. The preliminary results are consistent with previous notions that with increasing wt. % Cl in the melt the crystallization temperature decreases. Importantly, our results have a liquidus depression ∆T (oC) from added chlorine that is intermediate between the two previous results. This is consistent with the difference in bulk composition, i.e., this work has an intermediate Al-composition. This suggests that the addition of Cl to the Martian mantle may lower the solidus temperature and potentially aid in the petrogenesis of aluminous basalts.",

            "abstract": "The continental margins of the eastern United States formed in the Early Jurassic after the breakup of supercontinent Pangea. The relationship between the timing of this rift episode and the occurrence of offshore magmatism, which is expressed in the East Coast Magnetic Anomaly, is still unknown. The possible influence of magmatism and existing lithospheric structure on the rifting processes along margin of the eastern U.S. was one of the motivations to conduct a large-scale community seismic experiment in the Eastern North America (ENAM) GeoPRISMS focus site. In addition, there is also a clear need for better high-resolution seismic data with shallow penetration on this margin to better understand the geological setting of submarine landslides.\nThe ENAM community seismic experiment is a project in which a team of scientists will gather both active-source and earthquake seismic data in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras on a 500 km wide section of the margin offshore North Carolina and Virginia. The timing of data acquisition in 2014 and 2015 facilitates leveraging of other geophysical data acquisition programs such as Earthscope’s Transportable Array and the USGS marine seismic investigation of the continental shelf. In April of 2014, 30 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers were deployed on the shelf, slope and abyssal plain of the study site. These instruments will record earthquakes for one year, which will help future seismic imaging of the deeper lithosphere beneath the margin. In September and October of 2014, regional marine seismic reflection and refraction data will be gathered with the seismic vessel R/V Marcus Langseth, and airgun shots will also be recorded on land to provide data coverage across the shoreline. Last, in the summer of 2015, a land explosion seismic refraction study will provide constraints on the crustal structure in the adjacent coastal plain of North Carolina and Virginia. All seismic data will be distributed to the community through IRIS/DMC and the LDEO/UTIG Seismic data center. Two workshops are planned for 2015, where new users get an opportunity to engage in basic processing and analysis of the new data set.",

            "abstract": "Little is known about the detailed vertical and horizontal structure of the Tropical Cyclone (TC) outflow layer owing to lack of in-situ observations in this region over the years. We hypothesize that TC outflow structure change due either to external environmental interactions or internal dynamical changes are related to TC intensity changes, making the outflow layer an important region of study for improvement of TC predictability. Dropsonde profiles through TC outflow layers were obtained during the Hurricane and Severe Storms Sentinel (HS3) experiment (2012-2014) and the Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI) experiment (2014). Using mini-dropsondes deployed with the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS) from a NASA Global Hawk and eXpendable Digital Dropsondes (XDDs) deployed with the High Definition Sounding System (HDSS) from a NASA WB-57F, new insights into the vertical structure of the TC outflow layer have been obtained.\nAtmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) show that ‘far-field’ outflow jet dropsondes in Hurricane Leslie (2012) were obtained during a period of jet development and deformation in response the ‘pincer effect’ of an upper trough to the east and an upper cold low to west of Leslie. We speculate that the resulting deformation of the outflow layer and associated jet feature may have been responsible for limiting further development of Leslie. AMVs in Hurricane Nadine (2012) and pre-TC Gabrielle (2013) showed that outflow jets sampled by dropsondes developed over time scales of several hours. Wind profile observations in outflow jet ‘roots’ near ‘convective bursts’ showed that they were weaker and thicker near the convection and became thinner and stronger downstream as the ‘far-field’ region was sampled.\nAll dropsonde profiles showed that the outflow layer contained numerous thin isothermal layers and layers of enhanced vertical wind shear. These numerous thin unstable layers were characterized by a super-critical Richardson number in excess of ¼. The outflow layer therefore appears to contain multiple transient thin unstable layers generating turbulence that may play a role in the dynamics of the outflow layer and its impact on TC predictability.",

            "abstract": "The topic of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has garnered extensive interest over the past few decades. Many initial studies of SGD focused on karstic aquifers or small sandy systems. SGD associated with large river deltas has often been overlooked; though the limited number of studies that exist suggest it is important. This oversight is important, as large rivers are one of the primary pathways by which water and dissolved materials flow from the continents to the oceans. Deltas are also important loci for nutrient regeneration, carbon sequestration and authigenic mineral formation; and exchanges between salt and freshwater in these systems could be of geochemical importance globally. This talk will examine the topic of deltaic SGD, its regional and global implications, and use case studies from ongoing work in the Mississippi River Delta (MRD). Recent results indicate that SGD in the MRD averages 1,000 m3 s-1, and can reach 5,000 m3 s-1; making this system one the 25 largest pathways for water transport in North America. Flow appears to be driven by the stage differential between the Mississippi River and its surrounding wetlands, and likely passes through paleochannels and other buried semi-permeable bodies. This process may be amplified by a network of levees that inflate river stages, particularly during floods. Given the increases in flood control structures that may be built to cope with changing climates, deltaic SGD may become more important during the Anthropocene.",

            "abstract": "Using the self-organizing map (SOM) analysis of the 200-hPa geopotential obtained from ECMWF-Interim data, we have classified teleconnection patterns over the Northern Hemisphere during boreal summer. One of the patterns, which is referred to as SOM5 here, shows a dramatic increase in their frequencies after the late 1990s. The spatial pattern of SOM5 is characterized by zonal wavenumber five with anomalous high-pressure cores over central Asia, Northeast Asia, northeastern Pacific, the eastern US, and the Greenland. While the structure in the mid-latitudes resemble the circumglobal teleconnection pattern (CGT), unlike the typical CGT, the center of the action includes the Greenland.\nTo investigate the temporal evolution of the atmospheric circulation associated with SOM5, we perform the time-lagged composites relative to those days when the daily 200-hPa geopotential field most closely resembles SOM5. From -10 days to 0 days, there is a wave train that propagates from the central tropical Pacific to the Greenland . This is followed by an establishment of quasi-stationary centers in the midlatitudes and over the Greenland. The high pressure centers coincide with temperature extremes. There are also precipitation extremes associated with this pattern. These findings suggest that this CGT-like teleconnection is associated with extreme summer weather in the midlatitudes, and that changes in the forcing from the tropical central Pacific Ocean may have triggered more frequent extreme weather events since the late 1990s.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that short-lived strong electric fields produced by natural lightning activities in tropospheric altitudes can significantly affect the upper atmosphere. This effect is directly evidenced by the production of transient luminous events (TLEs), such as sprites, jets, and elves. It has also been demonstrated that thunderstorms can modify ionospheric densities on a longer time scale, during which TLEs may or may not occur [e.g., Cheng and Cummer, GRL, 32, L08804, 2005; Han and Cummer, JGR, 115, A09323, 2010; Shao et al., Nat. Geosci., doi: 10.1038/NGEO1668, 2012]. In particular, according to Shao et al. [2012], the electron density at 75-80 km altitudes may be reduced by about 2-3 orders of magnitude. In this talk, we study the modification of the ionospheric density profile by small electrostatic fields that may exist in the upper atmosphere during a thunderstorm. A simplified ion chemistry model described by Liu [JGR, 117, A03308, 2012] has been used to conduct this study. The model is based on the one developed by Lehtinen and Inan [GRL, 34, L08804, 2007], which is in turn an improved version of the GPI model discussed in Glukhov et al. [JGR, 97, 16971, 1992]. According to this model, the charged particles can be grouped into five species: electrons, light negative ions, cluster negative ions, light positive ions, and cluster positive ions. In this chemistry model, the three-body electron attachment is the only process whose rate constant depends on the electric field, when it is below about one third of the conventional breakdown threshold field. We have compared various sources of the three-body attachment rate constant. The result shows that the rate constant increases linearly with the reduced electric field in the range of 0 to 0.1 Td, while decreases exponentially from 0.1 Td to about one third of the conventional breakdown threshold field. With this dependence, our modeling results indicate that under the steady-state condition, the nighttime electron density profile can be reduced by about 40% or enhanced by a factor of about 6 when the electric field varies in the aforementioned range.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic ash contains 1-10% FeO by weight and can be a significant contributor of Fe to the surface ocean. It is possible that Fe fertilization by volcanic ash has contributed to marine productivity in the past. The Late Cretaceous Eagle Ford Group (Cenomanian/Turonian) contains abundant volcanic ash beds interbedded with black argillaceous limestones and calcareous mudstones, providing opportunities for observation of the influence of ash on productivity and basin chemistry in the Western Interior Seaway. In particular, we hypothesize that volcanic ash from nearby arc volcanoes stimulated productivity by providing reactive iron to the surface ocean that was otherwise nutrient-limited by poor ventilation in a stratified water column. Enhanced productivity likewise reinforced basinal anoxia. To test our hypothesis, we examined the Swenson #1 core (151 feet) from McMullen County, south Texas, which contains 51 visualized ash beds with varying thickness. High resolution x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (5 mm), x-ray fluorescence microscopy (100 µm) and scanning electron microscopy were performed to examine burial of Fe, trace elements delivered to the sediment by sinking organic matter (Cu and Ba), and paleoredox proxies (Mo and Cr) below, in, and above ash beds.\nAsh beds and beds containing admixed ash contain much more Fe than interbedded black shales, with nearly all Fe present in pyrite intergrown with or partially replacing altered ash grains, suggesting that ash transported reactive Fe to otherwise Fe-poor settings. Concentrations of Cu, Ba, Mo, and Cr were significantly greater in beds with admixed ash than in underlying beds. This suggests that input of ash increased marine productivity (Cu and Ba), which in turn enhanced oxygen demand and promoted euxinia (Mo and Cr). We conclude that Fe-bearing volcanic ash fertilized the southern Cenomanian/Turonian Western Interior Seaway, episodically forcing or enhancing euxinia both before and after OAE2.",

Significant warming is a robust feature over the global land as a response to Ant and GHG forcings, and the warming rate from the latter forcing is two to three times that of ALL forcing results over the past 60 years. AA produces remarkable cooling over the global land surface, whereas LU leads to slight cooling in most arid and semiarid areas. GHG- and Ant-driven increases of precipitation are found in most land areas, especially in arid and semiarid regions. AA and LU produce substantial variation of precipitation over various areas, and current uncertainties are relatively great in AA and LU forcing runs. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is used to analyze temporal scales of annual temperature and precipitation. The results show that interdecadal and multidecadal variations of temperature and precipitation are attributable to combined natural and anthropogenic forcings in most arid and semiarid regions, where AA dominates variations of both temperature and precipitation on multidecadal timescales. Both GHG and LU have positive effects on multidecadal changes of precipitation over arid and semiarid regions globally. However, the latter significantly prevents multidecadal changes of temperature over arid and semiarid regions of Australia.\n ",

With this increase in population have come changes to the land surface, as forest and farmland has been converted to residential and commercial purposes, causing changes in the surface roughness, temperature, and land-atmosphere fluxes. There is also a semi-permanent upwelling center in the spring and summer outside the Delaware Bay mouth that significantly changes the structure of the sea surface temperature both inside and outside the Bay. Through a series of high resolution modeling and observational studies, we have determined that in cases of strong synoptic forcing, the impact of the land-surface on the boundary layer properties can be advected offshore, creating a false coastline and modifying the location and timing of the sea breeze circulation. In cases of weak synoptic forcing, the influence of the upwelling and the tidal circulation of the Delaware Bay waters can greatly change the location, strength, and penetration of the sea breeze. Understanding the importance of local variability in the surface-atmosphere interactions on the sea breeze can lead to improved prediction of sea breeze onset, penetration, and duration which is important for monitoring air quality and developing offshore wind power production.",

This provides an immense database that enables us to derive statistical relationships, which are parameterized by MLT, Mlat, solar zenith angle and geomagnetic activity. These relationships allow us to derive continuous global conductance distributions.",

            "abstract": "Ted Irving’s last two published papers neatly encapsulate his seminal contributions to the delineation of ever-important apparent polar wander (APW) paths. His final (210th) paper [Creer & Irving, 2012 Earth Sciences History] describes in detail how Ken Creer and he when still graduate students at Cambridge started to generate and assemble paleomagnetic data for the first APW path, for then only the UK; the paper was published 60 years ago and happened to be Ted’s first [Creer, Irving & Runcorn, 1954 JGE]. Only 10 years later, there was already a lengthy reference list of paleomagnetic results available from most continents that had been compiled in pole lists he published in GJRAS from 1960 to 1965 and included in an appendix in his landmark book “Paleomagnetism” [Irving, 1964 Wiley] in support of wide ranging discussions of continental drift and related topics in chapters like ‘Paleolatitudes and paleomeridians.’ A subsequent innovation was calculating running means of poles indexed to a numerical geologic time scale [Irving, 1977 Nature], which with independent tectonic reconstructions as already for Gondwana allowed constructions of more detailed composite APW paths. His 1977 paper also coined Pangea B for an earlier albeit contentious configuration for the supercontinent that refuses to go away. Gliding over much work on APW tracks and hairpins in the Precambrian, we come to Ted’s penultimate (209th) paper [Kent & Irving, 2010 JGR] in which individual poles from short-lived large igneous provinces were grouped and most sedimentary poles, many rather venerable, excluded as likely to be biased by variable degrees of inclination error. The leaner composite APW path helped to resurrect the Baja BC scenario of Cordilleran terrane motions virtually stopped in the 1980s by APW path techniques that relied on a few key but alas often badly skewed poles. The new composite APW path also revealed several major features, such as a huge polar shift of 30° in 15 Myr in the Late Jurassic, which had been missed in seemingly more robust (certainly more populated) APW paths to date. This prompts the suggestion that a threshold criterion for pole selection might be whether a result was publishable by today’s standards, which could provide motivation for the generation of new data for better resolved APW paths as a legacy to Ted.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the cloud vertical distribution is important for understanding the role of clouds on earth’s radiation budget and climate change. Since high-level cirrus clouds with low emission temperatures and small optical depths can provide a positive feedback to a climate system and low-level stratus clouds with high emission temperatures and large optical depths can provide a negative feedback effect, the retrieval of multilayer cloud properties using satellite observations, like Terra and Aqua MODIS, is critically important for a variety of cloud and climate applications. For the objective of the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), new algorithms have been developed using Terra and Aqua MODIS data to allow separate retrievals of cirrus and stratus cloud properties when the two dominant cloud types are simultaneously present in a multilayer system. In this paper, we will present an overview of the new CERES Edition-4 multilayer cloud property datasets derived from Terra as well as Aqua. Assessment of the new CERES multilayer cloud datasets will include high-level cirrus and low-level stratus cloud heights, pressures, and temperatures as well as their optical depths, emissivities, and microphysical properties.",

            "abstract": "To better understand the Earth’s lower mantle (LM), thermodynamic properties (TDPs) of LM minerals should be illustrated clearly. We have so far reported the TDPs of Fe (and Al)-bearing MgO, MgSiO3 bridgmanite (Br) and post bridgmanite [1-5] by using the internally consistent LSDA+U method and the lattice dynamics method. In this work, two spin states, the high (HS) and low spin (LS) state, and several possible distribution configurations are considered in the LM pressure range. For Fe incorporated in Br, only Fe3+ at the Si site undergoes a HS to LS transition. However, this is suppressed by Al incorporation, because Al3+ prefers the Si site and attracts HS Fe3+ at the adjacent Mg site forming Fe3+-Al3+ pair. Br with geophysically relevant 6.25 mol% Fe2+ or Fe3+-Al3+ pair is found vibrationally stable. Incorporation of these elements increases the Br volume a little but gives marginal effects on the TDPs.\nSimulated densities, adiabatic bulk moduli, and bulk sound velocities of possible LM mineral aggregations show that a composition close to pyrolite with (Mg,Fe3+)(Si,Al3+)O3 Br is accountable for the reference Earth model, while Fe2+-bearing Br instead gives unignorable disagreements in deeper part. Neither Si-richer nor Si-poorer composition improves the disagreements. This indicates that Fe in LM bridgmanite should predominantly be ferric acquiring the HS state, and pyrolitic composition with (Mg,Fe3+)(Si,Al3+)O3 Br is a reasonable LM model.\n",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric ozone plays important roles in the Earth’s weather and climate systems due to its physiochemical properties and a wide range of spectral absorption. Because of complicated chemical equations and expensive computational cost, NWP community has introduced a linear photochemistry parameterization (LPP) that Cariolle and Déqué suggested in 1986 with an insight of ozone-temperature relationships, to weather forecasting system. In this study, we simulated stratospheric ozone using recent LPP coefficients in a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, the KIAPS-GM (Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems - Global Model), and evaluated model results with observations.\nThe KIAPS-GM uses three dimensional hydrostatic dynamical core based on the High-Order Method Modeling Environment (HOMME) in cubed sphere with a horizontal resolution of ne30np4 and 70 vertical layers up to 85km. LPP scheme was fully implemented into the KIAPS-GM including the ozone tracer advection. Prognostic ozone was estimated through interaction with local ozone field, temperature field, and radiation field as those physics fields were updated while climatological ozone (Fortuin and Kelder, 1998) was constantly fed into radiation fields in every month. ERA-interim ozone and meteorological data (Dee et al., 2011) were used as initial data. Simulation period was year 2008 when larger ozone hole events occurred than usual. We compared interactive ozone case with climatological ozone case. For the sensitivity studies to initial ozone fields and LPP coefficients, ERA-interim hourly and monthly ozone data were used; and LPP coefficients such as Cariolle and Teyssadre (2007) and Monge-Sanz et al. (2011) were interpolated into instantaneous pressure levels, respectively. Preliminary results show that the ozone concentration in interactive ozone case is higher than climatological one in the lower stratosphere and troposphere while the former is lower than the latter in the upper atmosphere. It leads to the cooler in the upper atmosphere but the warmer in the lower stratosphere and troposphere. We analyzed the discrepancies between our simulation results and observations such as ozone sonde data, SBUV-2 (Solar Backscattering UV radiometer) and MLS (Microwave Lim Sounder).",

            "abstract": "In comparing the existing ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) with the observed records of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, it is becoming clear that the results of the equations may vary significantly according to which definition of distance is applied. The problems arising from the definition of distance, such as the hanging wall effect, are also becoming more evident. Based on these observations, we proposed a new distance measurement called median distance (MED) defined as the shortest distance from an observation point to the straight line extended from the midpoint of the fault plane in the along-strike direction, accounting for the characteristics that the main strong motion generation areas (SMGAs) are often configured to be placed at the central part of an earthquake source fault. We have confirmed that by using MED the geometric issues such as the hanging wall effect will be resolved to some extent.\nFurthermore, based on the strong motion recordings from 35 Japanese earthquakes with moment magnitudes of 5.6 to 9.1, we developed a new GMPE of acceleration response spectra (GMRotI50) using MED. We corrected the data to be at the bedrock with a shear-wave velocity of 1500 m/s by using an empirical evaluation equation of spectral amplification factor proposed by Si et al. (2013). We confirmed that there are no obvious distance-saturation at close distances based on the records from the 1995 Mw 6.9 Kobe earthquake and 2008 Mw 6.9 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake. We then used a simple equation of log GMRotI50 = b - log Xmed - k Xmed as the first-stage regression model. In the second stage, we made regression analyses for the dependence of the coefficient b on moment magnitude, earthquake type (crustal, intra-plate, or inter-plate), and focal depth. We used a bilinear equation with respect to moment magnitude, thus our GMPE can be applied to Mw 9 megathrust earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The cycling of methane in marine sediments has been actively studied for the past several decades, but less attention has been paid to the cycling of CO2 produced in methanogenic sediments. The National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 01 cored 10 sites with the Joides Resolution drillship in the Krishna-Godavari basin, located on the southeastern margin of India. A comprehensive suite of pore water solute concentrations and isotope ratios were analyzed to investigate the distribution and concentration of gas hydrate along the margin, in situ diagenetic and metabolic reactions, fluid migration and flow pathways, and fluid and gas sources. This represents one of the most comprehensive pore water geochemical datasets collected at a continental margin to date, and provides the necessary tracers to better understand the processes and sinks controlling CO2 in margin sediments.\nOur results show that the CO2 produced through net microbial methanogenesis is effectively neutralized through silicate weathering throughout the sediment column drilled at each site (~100-300 m), buffering the pH of the sedimentary pore water and generating excess alkalinity through the same reaction sequence as continental silicate weathering. Most of the excess alkalinity produced through silicate weathering in the Krishna-Godavari basin is sequestered in Ca- and Fe-carbonates as a result of ubiquitous calcium release from weathering detrital silicates and Fe-reduction within the methanogenic sediments. Formation of secondary hydrous silicates (e.g. smectite) related to incongruent primary silicate dissolution acts as a significant sink for pore water Mg, K, Li, Rb, and B. The consumption of methane through anaerobic oxidation of methane, sequestration of methane in gas hydrate, and sequestration of dissolved inorganic carbon in authigenic carbonates keeps methanogenesis as a thermodynamically feasible catabolic pathway. Our results combined with previous indications of silicate weathering in anoxic sediments in the Sea of Okhotsk, suggest that silicate weathering coupled to microbial methanogenesis should be occurring in continental margins worldwide, providing a net sink of atmospheric CO2 over geologic timescales.",

The examined data sources are: remote sensing datasets (MODIS, CryoLand), weather forecasting model outputs (OpenWeatherMap, forecast.io), ground observation networks (CUAHSI HIS, GSOD, GHCN, and selected national networks), and user-contributed snow reports on social networks (cross-country and backcountry skiing trip reports). For adding each type of dataset, an interface and an adapter is created. Each adapter supports queries by area, time range, or combination of area and time range. The combined dataset is published as an online snow cover mapping service. This web service lowers the learning curve that is required to view, access, and analyze snow depth maps and snow time-series. All data published by this service are licensed as open data; encouraging the re-use of the data in customized applications in climatology, hydrology, sports and other disciplines. The initial version of the interactive snow map is on the website snow.hydrodata.org. This website supports the view by time and view by site. In view by time, the spatial distribution of snow for a selected area and time period is shown. In view by site, the time-series charts of snow depth at a selected location is displayed. All snow extent and snow depth map layers and time series are accessible and discoverable through internationally approved protocols including WMS, WFS, WCS, WaterOneFlow and WaterML. Therefore they can also be easily added to GIS software or 3rd-party web map applications. The central hypothesis driving this research is that the integration of user contributed data and/or social-network derived snow data together with other open access data sources will result in more accurate and higher resolution – and hence more useful snow cover maps than satellite data or government agency produced data by itself.",

These large volumes make it difficult to aggregate or summarize their climatology and climate trends. It is especially cumbersome to supply the full derivation (provenance) of these aggregate calculations. We present a lightweight and resilient software platform, Gridderama that simplifies the calculation of climatology by exploiting the \"Data-Cube\" topology often present in earth observing satellite records. By using the large array storage (LAS) paradigm, Gridderama allows the analyst to more easily produce a series of aggregate climate data products at progressively coarser spatial and temporal resolutions. Furthermore, provenance tracking and extensive visualization capabilities allow the analyst to track down and correct for data problems such as missing data and outliers that may impact the scientific results.\nWe have developed and applied Gridderama to calculate a trend analysis of 55 Terabytes of AIRS Level 1b infrared radiances, and show statistically significant trending in the greenhouse gas absorption bands as observed by AIRS over the 2003-2012 decade. We will extend this calculation to show regional changes in CO2 concentration from AIRS over the 2003-2012 decade by using a neural network retrieval algorithm.",

Key questions revolve around how the coupling between dynamics and thermodynamic processes and potential changes in the role of melt ponds contribute to an accelerated seasonal ice retreat. To address these issues, 44 autonomous platforms were deployed in four arrays in the Beaufort Sea in March, 2014, with an additional array deployed in August in the Chukchi Sea to monitor the evolution of ice conditions during the seasonal sea ice retreat. Each “5-dice” array included four or five co-sited ice mass balance buoys (IMB) and wave buoys with digital cameras, and one automatic weather station (AWS) at the array center. The sensors on these buoys, combined with satellite imagery monitoring the large-scale evolution of the ice cover, provide a near-complete history of the processes involved in the seasonal melt of sea ice. We present a preliminary analysis of the contributions of several key processes to the seasonal ice decay. The evolution of surface ponding was observed at several sites with differing ice types and surface morphologies. The records of surface melt and ice thickness demonstrate a key role of ice type in driving the evolution of the ice cover. Analysis of the surface forcing and estimates of solar energy partitioning between the surface and upper ocean is compared to the surface and basal mass balance from the IMBs. The role of ice divergence and deformation in driving sea ice decay – in particular its role in accelerating thermodynamic melt processes - is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Successful monitoring of rice crops and estimation of its yields in Mekong delta provide vital information to government agencies, rice production stakeholders and insurance companies in making their decisions and plans to establish solutions to protect rice smallholders from the risks involved. Remote sensing-based information promises a cost-effective way to observe rice crop growth in the largest rice producing region of Vietnam. For an extensive rice cultivation region as the Mekong delta, the use of divergence statistic to extract information from long-term or hypertemporal optical remote sensing NDVI profile to map rice cropping patterns has shown a high degree of success. The result map provides accurate information on where rice grew, when it was seeded and harvested, how many time it was cultivated every year. In addition, by using 8-day MODIS TERRA surface reflectance in Soil-Leaf-Canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model, 70 percent variation of seasonal rice LAI values was able to capture, making it useful to be assimilated into a rice crop growth simulation model (ORYZA 2000) to estimate the regional rice production in the season of 2008-2009. Tested results from 56 rice fields located in different rice cropping patterns showed that yields estimated using ORYZA2000 can explain 83 percent variation of field measured yields. However, simulated yields by ORYZA 2000 were used to overestimate by the model since some of model parameters could not be recalibrated due to the lack of field experiment data. This suggest that in the future, in order to gain a better results of rice crop monitoring and yield estimation, apart from improving the estimation of MODIS –derived LAIs by using SLC, calibrating crop growth simulation’s parameter have to be taken into account.",

            "abstract": "In nature soil biophysical and biogeochemical processes are coupled spatially and temporally. However due to constrain of both understanding of complexity of process interactions and computing ability, it still remains a challenge to represent fully coupled system of soil hydrological-thermal dynamics and biogeochemical processes in land surface models (LSMs). In the Community Land Model (CLM), the land component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), soil C-N processes are not only implemented sequentially but also asynchronously coupled to thermal and hydrological processes. PFLOTRAN is an open source, state-of-the-art massively parallel 3-D subsurface flow and reactive transport code. In this study, we extend the subsurface hydrological-thermal process coupling between CLM and PFLOTRAN to include explicitly synchronized soil biogeochemical processes. The resulting coupled CLM-PFLOTRAN model is a LSM capable of resolving 3-D soil hydrological-thermal-biogeochemical processes.\nThe classic CLM-CN reaction networks, degassing-dissolving of C-N relevant greenhouse gases between soil solution and air, soil N absorption and transportation processes are implemented in PFLOTRAN’s reactive-transport framework. We compare soil C stock estimates from CLM alone and coupled CLM-PFLOTRAN simulations at the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment-Arctic field sites at the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), AK. Both simulations are compared against available soil C dataset to assess importance of representing this synchronization in LSMs. Contributions of various factors to spatial variance of simulated variations from the two modeling approaches are evaluated across this polygonal coastal tundra landscape. Results indicate that two modeling approaches could produce very contrasting results, especially in the N-limit ecosystem. The developed CLM-PFLOTRAN framework will be used for regional evaluation of climate change caused ecosystem process responses and their feedbacks to climate system.\nKey word: Soil C stocks, soil biogeochemistry, soil thermal-hydrology, synchronization, CLM-CN model, PFLOTRAN model, polygonal coastal tundra",

            "abstract": "An array of porewater wells at two locations on Hawaiian reefs have been utilized to obtain interstitial pore fluid from various depths in permeable sandy sediments. The total alkalinity (AT) and pH (total scale) were measured for each sample (depths 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40, and 60 cm) as well as calcium, magnesium, and strontium concentrations. Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations co-vary and appear to be directly related to AT and pH. The ratio of the change in calcium and magnesium (ΔCa, ΔMg) between the overlying water column and the porewater indicates that an 18 mol % Mg-calcite phase is dissolving within the sediment column. This could represent the dissolution of coralline algae such as Porolithon or Lithothamnion both of which produce ~18% Mg-calcite skeletons and are present on Hawaiian reefs. The small changes in Mg concentrations from dissolution/precipitation of high Mg-calcites is typically difficult to measure against the high background matrix of seawater and to our knowledge these data represent some of the first magnesium concentrations measured in permeable sediments.\nSaturation state (Ω) for Mg-calcites was calculated using both sets of stoichiometric solubility products (K) widely accepted in the literature. Depending on the K used, most of the porewater was undersaturated with respect to the high Mg calcites (>12%). Saturation states were determined using an ion activity product (IAP) calculated from the measured values of calcium and magnesium. This produces a more accurate Ω than assuming calcium and magnesium concentrations based on salinity, as is typically done in surface waters. As surface water becomes more corrosive to carbonate minerals due to enhanced ocean acidification through the next century, it is expected that dissolution of both biogenic high Mg-calcites and abiotic Mg-calcite cements will increase, potentially destabilizing reef framework and altering the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in these environments.",

            "abstract": "We analyze natural background concentrations and determine threshold values of chemical species (NO3-N, Cl, As, Pb, Cr) for groundwater using Groundwater Quality Monitoring Network (GQMN) data operated by Korea Ministry of Environment (ME). GQMN data are divided into two groups, A and B. Group A consists of samples collected in aquifers where anthropogenic inputs are forced to be excluded by aquifer typology. Group B consists of samples in aquifers where purely anthropogenic chemicals (e.g., pesticide, PAC) are introduced at the downgradient. Group A is used to derive nationwide natural background concentrations for groundwater in specific aquifer geology under concern, which represents a reference system. Group B is used for deriving site-specific background concentrations for groundwater. For both groups of data, the samples with anthropogenic inputs are forced to be excluded, thus background concentrations are derived based on a pre-selection method accordingly. We determine threshold values according to EU GroundWater Daughter Directive(GWDD 2006/11/EC). For As, Pb, and Cr and some other trace elements, survival analyses are used for estimating background concentrations due to non-detect data. The results show that high concentration values of NO3-N and Cr are related to high natural background concentrations due to rock-water interactions for Group A. In particular, NO3-N concentrations vary with depth, which are consistent with natural attenuation processes. For Group B, some anthropogenic chemical species such as BTEX are observed and site-specific background concentrations of those elements are non-zero, which is apparently not naturally occurred at all. Natural background concentrations and threshold values derived from Group A can be used for setting up reference values for managing groundwater quality on a level of either domestic or drinking water stands. Meanwhile results from Group B provide a useful guidance for managing groundwater quality in contaminated sites for setting up reasonable environmental quality standards such as remediation standards or toxicological values. This study is groundwork for establishing practical reference values in groundwater equality management in Korea",

A stretched cubed-sphere High Resolution Atmosphere Model (HiRAM) is constructed using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) finite-volume dynamical core. The horizontal grid spacing in the stretched cubed-sphere is smoothly transformed from the center of highest-resolution region to the center of coarsest-resolution region.\nThree 30-yr AMIP type simulations were performed in this study; one C384 uniformed cubed-sphere grid, and two stretched cubed-sphere grid with stretching factor 2.5. Two stretched-grid experiments further set the center of highest-resolution region in Taiwan (C384R2.5TW) and Oklahoma City (C384R2.5OKC), respectively. The horizontal resolution in this C384R2.5 stretched grid ranges from 10km to 65km. Three climate simulations were compared against re-analysis data to understand the effect of horizontal resolution on both the simulated global climate and regional features.\nThe global mean climatology in stretched-grid AMIP simulations shows no unrealistic drift comparing to the uniform-grid simulation and observation. Regional orographic precipitation is better simulated in the high-resolution region. High resolution also shows improvement in typhoon/hurricane simulation. In western Pacific basin, high resolution improves simulated typhoon intensity. For weak and moderate typhoons, there is no strong trend with enhancing resolution. But for strong typhoon, there is high correlation between enhancing resolution with typhoon intensity. By comparing simulations with IBTrACS （International Best Track Archieve for Climate Stewardship） in different basins, HiRAM demonstrates the reduction of simulated typhoon/hurricane numbers with enhancement of horizontal resolution.",

            "abstract": "Green infrastructure (GI) may be the most practical approach for reducing contaminated runoff, providing ecosystem services, mitigating food deserts and creating community open spaces in urban areas. This project was funded by the USEPA’s People-Prosperity-Planet (P3) program and was a partnership between a team of DePaul University undergraduates (the P3 team) and high school interns (Green Teens) and staff from the Gary Comer Youth Center (GCYC). GCYC is located in a low-income African-American community on Chicago’s south side characterized by high crime, abandoned buildings, lack of green space and a food desert. The overaching project goal was to develop a network of Green Teens qualified to conduct soil quality assessment using USDA-NRCS protocols in order to let them develop GI plans to minimize storm water runoff and contaminant loadings, improve community and environmental health, and provide more equitable access to green space. Working with a USDA-ARS soil scientist from Washington State University, the P3 team conducted soil quality assessment on 116 soil samples collected among four abandoned residential lots owned by GCYC. Analytes included infiltration, bulk density, texture, pH, conductivity, aggregate stability, available nutrients, and total and bioavailable (PBET) lead. Soil pH on all lots is greater than 8.0, are low in organic matter, have little microbial respiration activity, are enriched in available phosphorus, and have average total lead values ranging from 24-2,700 mg/kg. PBET lead was less than 40% on most lots. Regardless, these soils will need to be remediated by adding carbon-rich materials such as biosolids prior to GI installation. Students enrolled in a landscape design course at DePaul developed 3-D models representing potential GI designs for one of the vacant lots that include strategies for immobilizing heavy metals, reducing runoff, and which are tied into an educational module for neighborhood school children.",

To explore the associated mechanisms and uncertainties, a regionally adapted dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS) was implemented for the Bolivian case, and forced with two contrasting CMIP5 RCP8.5 climate change projections. The CNRM-CM5 projects an rainfall increase of about 5% in lowland Bolivia, while IPSL-CM5A-LR projects a decrease of about 17-26%. Changes in carbon stocks and fluxes were evaluated, factoring out the individual contributions of atmospheric carbon dioxide ([CO2]), temperature and precipitation. Special attention was paid to the effect of rising temperatures on photosynthesis, respiration, and the atmospheric demand for transpiration.\nImpacts ranged from a strong increment to a severe loss of vegetation carbon (Cv), depending on differences in climate projections, as well as the physiological response to rising [CO2], see figure. The simulated loss Cv was primarily driven by a reduction in gross primary productivity, and secondarily by enhanced emissions from fires and autotrophic respiration. In the wet forest, less precipitation and higher temperatures equally reduced Cv, while in the dry forest, the impact of precipitation was dominating. The temperature-related reduction of Cv was mainly due to a decrease in photosynthesis, and only to lesser extent because of more autotrophic respiration and less stomatal conductance as a response to an increasing atmospheric demand. Tropical dry forests were simulated to virtually disappear, regardless of the fertilizing effect of rising [CO2], suggesting a higher risk for dry forest loss along the drier southern fringe of the Amazon. Implications for climate change adaptation and mitigation measures are discussed.",

A collateral effect of groundwater extraction is ground subsidence. The subsidence can be induced by alterations in the pore fluid pressures in an aquifer without the need for alterations to ground water levels. This paper examines the ground subsidence created by the uniform extraction of fluids from a flat disc-shaped extraction region located within fluid-saturated poroelastic domain, which results in the reduction in the pore water pressure within the flat disc-shaped region. In particular, attention is focused on the influence of the fluid extraction on a surficial layer that is elastic and can be modelled as a thick plate-type stratum. The influence of the fluid extraction over a flat circular region is modelled as a distribution of centers of dilatation. It is shown that the elastostatic model can be used to provide convenient estimates for the influences of the fluid extraction process on subsidence.",

            "abstract": "Development of local groundwater resources in coastal areas is influenced by freshwater recharge and discharge, topography, geologic structure, and changes in sea level. For the coastal San Diego area, a density-dependent cross-sectional groundwater flow model was constructed to examine the aquifer and flow characteristics. The model domain represents generalized conditions along an east-west transect that is described by data from two multiple-depth monitoring-well sites; the domain extends into the Pacific Ocean to the 120 meter (m) bathymetric contour. Vertically, the model was discretized into four zones that represent geologic formations; each zone was assigned a horizontal permeability based on aquifer testing. Temporally, the model was divided into two stress periods. The first stress period simulates pre-development conditions, with an instantaneous sea-level rise of 120 m starting 6,000 years ago. This is a simplified representation of transient conditions since the last glacial maximum. The second stress period simulates 60 years of groundwater development, which is represented in terms of net fresh water flow through the domain. Near the coast, observed water-quality data indicate (1) brackish-to-hypersaline groundwater at shallow depths, (2) fresh continental recharge at intermediate depths, and (3) seawater intrusion at depths greater than 300 m. In order to simulate these general groundwater conditions, vertical anisotropy of the upper permeability zone was increased, freshwater discharge was constrained to the seafloor (no discharge along the coast), and groundwater development was simulated as exceeding freshwater recharge (additional water is provided by depletion of freshwater reserves). This numerical testing identifies specific factors that influence current conditions and provides an initial assessment of resource management alternatives for the San Diego coastal aquifer.",

            "abstract": "Cropping practices, soil & vadose characteristics and water table topography determine how water and nitrogen move from cultivated soils to shallow aquifers. Understanding how these factors interact across space and over time is thus critical to understanding potential effectiveness and timing of crop management changes to reduce nitrogen loading to groundwater. We focus on a strath terrace mantled with 20-100 cm of loess-derived clay loam overlying 5-10 meters of generally unconsolidated gravel in central Montana. Here, a shallow aquifer in the gravel is perched on a relatively impermeable underlying shale. The landform is isolated from mountain front stream recharge, such that all groundwater recharge is derived from infiltration of precipitation through soils on the terrace. Ninety-three percent of the terrace is cultivated with a typical cropping system on a three-year rotation of winter wheat, spring wheat or barley, and fallow (no crops grown to conserve soil water). Each cropping phase represents a different regime of evapotranspiration, recharge, fertilizer application, nitrogen mineralization, and nitrate leaching to groundwater. Discharge from the aquifer feeds springs at the gravel/shale contact exposed at the edges of the terrace. We monitored five to ten ground and surface water locations for three years to calibrate a finite difference model and quantify the flux of water and solutes from the terrace aquifer. A sensitivity analysis of the model allows for hypothesis testing about the relative importance of cropping practice versus soil & vadose characteristics as drivers of nitrate leaching. We assess model performance by comparing model simulations with seasonal variation of solute concentrations, groundwater residence times derived from 3H-3He, and nitrogen gas losses implied by increasing nitrate d18O and d15N along flowpaths. We are developing the model within a broader participatory research effort with local farmers to develop shared understanding of the effectiveness of alternative cropping practices and timing of those effects on local groundwater nitrate concentrations.",

As result of tropical weathering and dissolution of the silicates that constitute the peridotites, extensive evidences of chemical weathering are observed (dolines, enlarged fractures, epikarst). In particular the South of the Grande Terre, called « Plaine des lacs » presents a landscape but also hydraulic behaviour similar to karstic aquifers, with numerous dolines generally observed as ponds. A morphometric study of these depressions is proposed based on field observations and on automatic mapping from the DEM obtained with LIDAR technology. From SIG calculations followed by manual cleaning, a 8601 dataset of dolines is defined on a 128 km2 area, whose area varies from 1 m2 to 2 km2 area. A statistical analysis is applied on the morphometric parameters of dolines and other factors as amount of precipitation or the distance to characteristic mophologic features (ridges, rivers). Fractal and alignment analysis are presented to detect the potential relationship between dolines, the phenomena involved in their formation and evolution. The role of chemical weathering, and of mechanical erosion are discussed as well as the condition required for doline formation. A comparison with limestone karsitification is drawn.",

It has been hypothesized that the SW1 is generated by a nonlinear interaction between the zonal wave-number one stationary planetary wave in the northern hemisphere stratosphere and the zonal wave-number two migrating diurnal tide while the DW1 is believed to be a manifestation of the trapped (1-1) mode which can propagate vertically in the polar regions.\nUsing observations from the South Pole meteor radar system we have determined the unambiguous structure of both the DW1 and SW1 in the meridional wind field over a period of 10 years from 2001 to 2011. These observations show a clear repeatable annual structure in the amplitude and phase of the DW1 and SW1. The amplitudes grow in the spring and maximize around the summer solstice and then decay into the fall. The phase structure for both tidal components moves toward later local time from spring into summer and then earlier local times from summer towards fall, indicating a systematic and repeatable change in the vertical wavelength of these features. Over course of a decade this general trend has persisted, however there is evidence of interannual variability in both fields, but far more prominent in the SW1 field. Analysis of these waves components, their interannual variability and an interpretation of the interannual variability will be presented.",

Thus, over the past several years 150+ scientists and practitioners representing a range of expertise from the climate system to natural systems to human sectors have developed a set of indicator recommendations that could be used as a first step to establishing such an indicator system. These recommendations have been implemented into a pilot system, with the goal of working with stakeholder communities to evaluate the understandability of individual indicators and learn how users are combining indicators for their own understanding or decision needs through this multiple Federal agency decision support platform.\nThis prototype system provides the perfect test bed for evaluating the translation of scientific data – observations, remote sensing, and citizen science data -- and data products, such as indicators, for decision-making audiences. Often translation of scientific information into decision support products is developed and improved given intuition and feedback. Though this can be useful in many cases, more rigorous testing using social science methodologies would provide greater assurance that the data products are useful for the intended audiences. I will present some initial research using surveys to assess the understandability of indicators and whether that understanding is influenced by one’s attitude toward climate change. Such information is critical to assess whether products developed for scientists by scientists have been appropriately translated for non-scientists, thus assuring that the data will have some value for the intended audience. Such survey information will provide a data driven approach to further develop and improve the National Climate Indicators System and could be applied to improve other decision support systems.",

            "abstract": "Jakobshavn Isbræ is the fastest marine-terminating outlet glacier on the Greenland Ice Sheet and has experienced speed up, thinning and increased mass discharge primarily due to ocean-ice interactions at the terminus, over the last two decades. Approximately 60% of the total driving stress within the main ice stream is compensated by resistance due to lateral shear. We have observed the presence of water-filled crevasses, which fill in local depressions and drain seasonally, resulting in meltwater filtration directly into the shear margins. Injection of meltwater into the shear margins can result in shear weakening with implications for observed changes within the ice stream, in addition to, potentially enhancing mass flux into the main trough. Shear weakening, due to infiltrated meltwater, can increase sliding due to basal lubrication or reduce ice stiffness due to cryo-hydrologic warming. In this study, LandSat-7 ETM+ and LandSat-8 OLI images at 15m spatial resolutions are used to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of saturated crevasses during the ablation seasons from 2000 through 2013. Changes in the delineated area of water-filled crevasses are compared to variability in ice surface velocity fields during the analysis period as a first-order assessment on the potential impact these features may have on marginal ice dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an eastward-propagating, planetary-scale envelope of organized convective activity in the tropical atmosphere. Of particular research interest is the dynamic and thermodynamic configurations typically associated with initiation of MJO convection. In light of recent results indicating a build up of lower-tropospheric moisture due to advection over the Western Indian Ocean preceding initiation of MJO convection, here we propose an approach for detecting the typical local change of atmospheric states prior to initiation of the MJO. Permutation entropy (PE), a measure of randomness capable of detecting dynamical changes in a temporal process, is used to characterize the complex time evolution of kinematic and thermodynamic fields in the lower troposphere of selected tropical locations. PE computed within a ~10-day window is compared with phase indices of MJO convective activity to identify the typical dynamical configuration of states and changes which occur throughout the MJO life cycle. In preliminary results, the lower-tropospheric moisture field over the Western Indian Ocean is found to be well organized prior to initiation, transitioning to a disorganized state as MJO convection becomes fully developed. The lower-tropospheric perturbation kinetic energy, on the other hand, is found to exhibit systematic disorganization prior to MJO initiation followed by increased organization during the development of MJO circulation. These results indicate that low-level wind and moisture signals in this region could indeed offer some precursory sign of MJO genesis. It is noted that the complexity measure provided by permutation entropy is independent of signal amplitudes, so that it could be possible to detect these systematic dynamical changes operationally even during a quiescent regime prior to MJO initiation.",

            "abstract": "The 2006 eruption from Raoul Island occurred apparently in response to local tectonic swarm activity, but without any precursory indication of volcanic unrest within the hydrothermal system on the island. The eruption released some 200 T of SO2, implicating the involvement of a deep magmatic vapor input into the system during/prior to the event. In the absence of any recognized juvenile material in the eruption products, previous explanations for this eruptive event focused on this vapor being a driving force for the eruption.\nIn 2004, at least 80 T/d of CO2 was escaping from the hydrothermal system, but mainly through areas that did not correspond to the 2006 eruption vents. The lack of a pre-eruptive hydrothermal system response related to the seismic event in 2006 can be explained by the presence of a hydrothermal mineralogic seal in the vent area of the volcano. Evidence for the existence of such a seal was found in eruption deposits in the form of massive fracture fillings of aragonite, calcite and anhydrite. Fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures in these phases range from ca. 140 °C to 220 °C which, for pure water indicate boiling point depths of between 40 and 230 m assuming a cold hydrostatic pressure constraint. Elevated pressures behind this seal are consistent with the occurrence of CO2 clathrates in some inclusion fluids, indicating CO2 concentrations approaching 1 molal in the parent fluids.\nReactive transport modeling of magmatic volatile inputs into what is effectively a seawater-dominated hydrothermal system provide valuable insights into seal formation. Carbonate mineral phases ultimately come to saturation along this flow path, but we suggest that focused deposition of the observed massive carbonate seal is facilitated by near-surface boiling of these CO2-enriched altered seawaters, leading to large degrees of supersaturation which are required for the formation of aragonite. As the seal grew and permeability declined, pore pressures increased until a state of critical stress was achieved. The eruption of 2006 was probably triggered by further deep release of magmatic volatiles brought about by intense shaking of the local tectonic swarm event, and the addition of these gases further increased pore pressures, and ultimately led to the failure of the already critically stressed seal.",

However, reliably quantifying the CO2 fluxes on sub-continental scales is challenging. Using the GEOS-Chem four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation system, we assess the potentially utility of combining GOSAT XCO2 data with CO2 profile retrievals from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), which provides estimates of free tropospheric CO2. In our previous inversion analyses of the TES data we identified regional biases in the data that resulted in unrealistic strong sinks of CO2, particularly for North and South America. Here we examine the use of different approaches of filtering the data, based in the retrieval parameters, to remove the biases, and we assess their impact on the inferred flux estimates. We also quantify the benefit of assimilating surface flask observations of CO2 together with the GOSAT and TES data.",

Equilibrium enables paleotemeperature estimates and inferences regarding past carbon cycling. Kinetic isotope effects/vital effects make such interpretations tenuous.\nWe present a series of experiments on the kinetics of CO2- H2O isotopic equilibration. We observe a simple asymptotic approach of δ18OCO2 to equilibrium values. However, Δ47 values exhibit systematic excursions from a smooth trajectory towards equilibrium. These excursions help illuminate relative reaction rates for different isotopologues in the interconversion reactions among dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species and between CO2 and H2O. The use of Δ47 measurements reveals the conditions under which isotopic equilibrium vs. disequilibrium among DIC species prevails. This is relevant to systems with rapid rates of organismal uptake of DIC (e.g., photosynthesis in corals) and release of DIC (e.g., respiration in many genera of calcifiers).",

            "abstract": "We are measuring total mercury (HgT) and monomethylmercury (CH3Hg+ or MMHg) in pore water, surface water, and sediment cores from two salt marsh pond systems on the south shore of Cape Cod, MA to characterize the distribution of mercury species and to identify features that influence mercury speciation and transport. Sage Lot Pond is relatively undisturbed and has low nitrogen loading (12 kg ha-1 y-1). It is part of the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Reserve and is surrounded by undeveloped wooded uplands. In contrast, Great Pond is highly impacted. Nitrogen loading to the site is elevated (600 kg ha-1 y-1) and the marsh is adjacent to a large residential area. In both systems, a 1 to 2 m organic-rich peat layer overlies the permeable sand aquifer. Groundwater in this region is typically oxic, where pore water within salt marsh peat is suboxic to anoxic. We hypothesize that redox gradients at the transition from the root zone to peat and at the peat-sand interface may provide habitat for MMHg-producing anaerobic bacteria. Preliminary results from a 2-m nearshore depth profile at Sage Lot Pond indicate HgT in groundwater within the sand aquifer occurred primarily in the > 0.2 µm fraction, with unfiltered concentrations exceeding 100 pM. Filtered (< 0.2 µm) HgT in groundwater was substantially lower (~ 5 pM). In contrast, HgT concentrations in filtered and unfiltered pore water within the peat layer were similar and ranged from about 2 to 3 pM. Complexation between mercury and dissolved organic carbon may account for the elevated fraction of filtered HgT in peat pore water. Although MMHg in both groundwater and pore water remained around 1 pM throughout our depth profile, we observed an increase in sediment MMHg (0.3 to 1.6 µg/kg) at the peat-sand interface. MMHg comprised ~50% of the HgT concentration in pore water suggesting mercury in the salt marsh peat is biologically available.",

This has already been demonstrated by a number of existing networks, such as the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER), the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), the Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Network (DOE-ARM), and the multitude of Flux Networks around the world, including AmeriFlux and FLUXNET. The great success of these networks has encouraged the development of new, up-and-coming, networks such as the Long Term Agricultural Network (LTAR) and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), to name a few.\nNEON is responsible for making observations of terrestrial, aquatic, and organismal ecology at 106 sites in 20 different eco-climatic domains across the North American continent. NEON will provide data on key local biogeochemical, meteorological, climate, remote sensing, and chemical variables, as well as their associated biotic responses, in an effort to inform climate change, land-use change, and invasive species.  Great care has been taken to ensure that NEON is being built to complement and expand upon the knowledge that has been gained from these other long-term observing networks. This talk will highlight the measurements that NEON will be making and how they will inform ecology, meteorology, climate change, and hydrology in the coming 30 years of operations.",

            "abstract": "Radiative energy from active fire has been found to correlate well with the amount of fuel consumed during the lifetime of a fire event. Fire radiative power (FRP) detected by sensors onboard MODIS satellites may therefore provide direct estimates of CO2 emissions related to biomass burning. Less known is the ability of satellite data to detect active fire from predominantly smoldering burns in boreal peatlands. Boreal peatlands store a large amount of soil carbon that is likely to become increasingly vulnerable to wildfire as climate change lowers water tables and exposes C-rich peat to burning. In this study, we investigate the utility of fire radiative energy (FRE) to estimate fuel consumption associated with wildfire in 2004 in boreal peatlands in Alaska. FRE values are generally estimated from FRP retrieved at detected active fire locations and times by summing the FRP values multiplied by the time difference between acquisitions. One central issue in deriving reliable FRE estimates by such approach is the requirement for sufficient sampling of the FRP to capture spatiotemporal variability in the fire. Our preliminary analysis confirms that the detection of active fire in peatlands are indeed not spatially exhaustive and temporally continuous. Thus we are further investigating the fusion of instantaneous FRP from MODIS active fire detection with the MODIS burned area product to derive FRE estimates across the burned area. We are following a previously tested strategy for such fusion for temporal integration of instantaneous FRP to derive FRE and spatial extrapolation of FRE over the burned area. The FRE estimates are then related to ground-measured peatland burn depths across different wildfire locations. The results of this study will ultimately indicate the utility of MODIS fire products for providing reliable biomass burned estimates in boreal peatlands.",

            "abstract": "The recent success in using Synchrotron X-ray Computed Microtomography (SXCMT) for the quantification of nanoparticle concentrations within real, three-dimensional pore networks [1] has opened up new opportunities for collecting experimental data of pore-scale flow and transport processes. One opportunity is coupling SXCMT with nanoparticle/soil transport experiments to provide unique insights into how pore-scale processes influence transport at larger scales. Understanding these processes is a key step in accurately upscaling micron-scale phenomena to the continuum-scale.\nUpscaling phenomena from the micron-scale to the continuum-scale typically involves the assumption that the pore space is well mixed. Using this ‘well mixed assumption’ it is implicitly assumed that the distribution of nanoparticles within the pore does not affect its retention by soil grains. This assumption enables the use of volume-averaged parameters in calculating transport and retention rates. However, in some scenarios, the well mixed assumption will likely be violated by processes such as deposition and diffusion. These processes can alter the distribution of the nanoparticles in the pore space and impact retention behaviour, leading to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.\nThis work investigates the well mixed assumption by employing SXCMT to experimentally examine pore-scale mixing of silver nanoparticles during transport through sand packed columns. Silver nanoparticles were flushed through three different sands to examine the impact of grain distribution and nanoparticle retention rates on mixing: uniform silica (low retention), well graded silica sand (low retention) and uniform iron oxide coated silica sand (high retention). The SXCMT data identified diffusion-limited retention as responsible for violations of the well mixed assumption. A mathematical description of the diffusion-limited retention process was created and compared to the experimental data at the pore and column-scale. The mathematical description accurately predicted trends observed within the SXCMT-datasets such as concentration gradients away from grain surfaces and also accurately predicted total retention of nanoparticles at the column scale.\n1.

            "abstract": "Basaltic shield volcanoes are a common feature on Earth and mostly occur within oceans, forming volcanic islands (e.g. Hawaii (USA), Galapagos (Ecuador), and recently Niijima (Japan)). As the volcano grows it will reach and emerge from the water surface and continue to grow above it. The deformation affecting the volcanic edifice may be influenced by the presence of the water level. We investigate how the presence of an ocean affects the state of stress within a volcanic edifice and thus magma propagation and fault formation.\nUsing COMSOL Multiphysics, axisymmetric elastic models of a volcanic edifice overlying an elastic lithosphere were created. The volcanic edifice (height of ~6000 m and radius of ~ 60 km) was built either instantaneously or iteratively by adding new layers of equivalent volume on top of each other. In the later process, the resulting stress and geometry from the one step is transferred to the next as initial conditions. Thus each new layer overlies a deformed and stressed model. The water load was modeled with a boundary condition at the surface of the model. In the case of an instantaneous volcano different water level were studied, for an iteratively growing volcano the water level was set up to 4000 m. We compared the deformation of the volcanic edifice and lithosphere and the stress orientation and magnitude in half-space and flexural models with the presence or not of an ocean.\nThe preliminary results show 1- major differences in the resulting state of stress between an instantaneous and an iteratively built volcanic edifice, similar to the results of [Galgana et al., 2011] and [McGovern and Solomon, 1993], respectively; 2- the presence of an ocean decreases the amount of flexural response, which decreases the magnitude of differential stress within the models; and 3- stress orientation within the volcano and lithosphere in also influence of an ocean. Those results provide new insights on the state of stress and deformation of oceanic basaltic volcanic edifices.\nGalgana, G. A., P. J. McGovern, and E. B. Grosfils (2011), J. Geophys.

These emissions do not only affect air quality and climate locally, but also on continental to hemispheric scales through long-range transport. It is estimated that about 350 Million hectares of land burn globally every year of which 54 % are in Africa. The northern sub-Saharan African (NSSA) region (0 – 20N, 20W – 55E) is known to show one of the highest biomass burning rates (in terms of per unit land area) among all regions of the world. This is due to the high concentration and frequency of fires in this region. In this presentation, we discuss results obtained from NASA’s Global Modeling Initiative Chemistry and Transport Model (GMI-CTM), driven by specified meteorological fields accounting for both transport and photochemical contributions, and an off-line Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) that calculates the radiative fluxes across the tropopause, to quantify the impact on air quality and climate triggered by biomass burning over the NSSA region.",

Measurements of the ocean's interior, however, remain sparse and irregular, thus the dynamical inference of subsurface flows is necessary to interpret surface measurements. The most common (and accurate) approach is to incorporate surface measurements into a data-assimilating forward ocean model, but this approach is expensive and slow, and thus completely impractical for time-critical needs, such as offering guidance to ship-based observational campaigns. Two recently-developed approaches have made use of the apparent partial consistency of upper ocean dynamics with quasigeostrophic flows that take into account surface buoyancy gradients (i.e. the \"surface quasigeostrophic\" (SQG) model) to \"reconstruct\" the interior flow from knowledge of surface height and buoyancy.",

New opportunities have recently become available with the advent of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) mission equipped with high resolution of 0.33-0.4 arcsec in space and 1 km/s in velocity, together with the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope of 0.2 arcsec spatial resolution. We report the first result of joint IRIS-Hinode observations of a spectacular prominence eruption occurring on 2014-May-09. IRIS detected a maximum redshift of 450 km/s, which, combined with the plane-of-sky speed of 800 km/s, gives a large velocity vector of 920 km/s at 30 degrees from the sky plane. This direction agrees with the source location at 30 degrees behind the limb observed by STEREO-A and indicates a nearly vertical ejection. We found two branches of redshifts separated by 200 km/s appearing in all strong lines at chromospheric to transition-region temperatures, including Mg II k/h, C II, and Si IV, suggesting a hollow, rather than solid, cone in the velocity space of the ejected material. Opposite blue- and redshifts on the two sides of the prominence exhibit corkscrew variations both in space and time, suggestive of unwinding rotations of a left-handed helical flux rope. Some erupted material returns as nearly streamline flows, exhibiting distinctly narrow line widths (~10 km/s), about 50% of those of the nearby coronal rain at the apexes of coronal loops, where the rain material is initially formed out of cooling condensation. We estimate the mass and kinetic energy of the ejected and returning material and compare them with those of the associated CME. We will discuss the implications of these observations for CME initiation mechanisms.",

Based on 226Ra data, the subterranean discharge (in 107 m3 d-1) was estimated to be 0.24~0.51 in the spring, 0.56~1.16 in the summer, 0.38~0.79 in the fall, and 0.22~0.45 in the winter. This was equivalent to 6-16% of the concomitant river discharge. The net spatially integrated material fluxes from the STE into the estuary were equivalent up to 51-89% of the concomitant riverine fluxes for DIC and TA, around 10-25% for DSi and DIN, and negligible for SRP. Paradoxically, the mixing lines along the salinity gradient revealed no apparent additions of these species. These additions are not revealed because the STE is a relatively small spatially-averaged source that spreads throughout the estuary in contrast to the major point sources of the river and the ocean for the estuary. Thus, despite apparent conservative mixing of DIC, DIN, and DSi, subterranean exports of these species into estuaries must be taken into account in evaluating geochemical impacts of estuarine exports on shelf waters.",

Monsoon carrying rain coming from the southwest of the country also contributes to the annual total rainfall that causes different hazards. Such is shallow landslide mainly triggered by high saturation of soil due to continuous downpour which could take up from hours to days. Recent event like this happened in Zambales province September of 2013 where torrential rain occurred for 24 hours amounting to half a month of rain. Rainfall intensity measured by the nearest weather station averaged to 21 mm/hr from 10 pm of 22 until 10 am the following day. The monsoon rains was intensified by the presence of Typhoon Usagi positioned north and heading northwest of the country. A number of landslides due to this happened in 3 different municipalities; Subic, San Marcelino and Castillejos. The disaster have taken 30 lives from the province. Monitoring these areas for the entire country is but a big challenge in all aspect of disaster preparedness and management. The approach of this paper is utilizing the available forecast of rainfall amount to monitor highly hazardous area during the rainy seasons and forecasting possible landslide that could happen. A simple water budget model following the equation Perct=Pt-R/Ot-∆STt-AETt (where as the terms are Percolation, Runoff, Change in Storage, and Actual Evapotraspiration) was implemented in quantifying all the water budget component. Computations are in Python scripted grid system utilizing the widely used GIS forms for easy transfer of data and faster calculation. Results of successive runs will let percolation and change in water storage as indicators of possible landslide.. This approach needs three primary sets of data; weather data, topographic data, and soil parameters. This research uses 5 m resolution DEM (IfSAR) to define the topography. Soil parameters are from fieldworks conducted. Weather data are from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. The model is calibrated from stream gauges downsteam corresponding to the calculated runoff. Reliability of the results are as good as the data and is limited by the availability of such, though continuous enhancement of the method is expected as implementation progresses.",

            "abstract": "We examined responses of suspended sediment (SS) transports after 50% intense thinning in a 17 ha forested headwater catchment using nested 4 to 10 ha gauging stations. Strip thinning of 13- to 45-yr Japanese cedar (Cryptomeriajaponica) and cypress (Chamaecyparisobtusa) was conducted by cable dragging to skid trails in the entire watershed including nested sub-catchments. The skid trails density varied from 0 to 134 m/ha, followed by 4 m/ha. Peak SS yields monitored by turbidity sensor at the catchment outlet was 10-folds greater after the first year of thinning by comparing the pre-thinning conditions, while these values became 2-folds in the third year after thinning. This changes of peak SS concentrations suggested that recovery of vegetation cover on disturbed soil reduced peak concentrations of SS. We also confirmed changes in SS yields and recovery using paired-catchment analysis. Integrated SS yields including periods during thinning operation from August to October, 2011 varied from 0.03 to 0.06 kg. Integrated SS yields in the catchment outlet (0.05 kg) were corresponded to 5.0 kg/ha in SS yields. Organic matter content of integrated SS samples in one sub-catchment was low (0%), while the other catchments contained 0.08 and 0.13% of organic matter. 210Pbex activity in the sub-catchment (181 Bq/kg) with low organic matter content was the highest among the other nested catchments from 36 to 59 Bq/kg. Because mean 210Pbex activity from < 10 cm soil surface depth along hillslopes transects was 124 ± 83 Bq/kg, soil surface erosion from < 10 cm depth on the soil surface can be contributed to fine sediment supplies for the sub-catchments with high 210Pbex activity. In contrast, 210Pbex activity on the skid trails was low, because soil disturbance became deep with > 10 cm. Therefore, fine sediment with low 210Pbex activity on the skid trails can be transported to the catchment outlet. These characteristics were also confirmed by 137Cs activity with various potential sources. We further show how nested catchments responded in terms of radionuclides tracers during the recovery processes from the first to the third years after intense thinning. Nested observations permit us understanding for spatial and temporal variability of soil disturbance and recovery processes from intense forest thinning.",

A multi-hole airdata probe was recently integrated into the Tempest UAS airframe and verification flights were made in spring 2013 to collect in-situ wind measurements behind gust fronts produced by supercell thunderstorms in northeast Colorado. Using instantaneous aircraft attitude estimates from the autopilot, the in-situ measurements were converted to inertial wind estimates, and estimates of uncertainty in the wind measurements was examined. To date, the limited deployments of the Tempest UAS have primarily focused on addressing the engineering and regulatory requirements to conduct supercell research, and the Tempest UAS team of engineers and meteorologists is preparing for deployments with the focus on collecting targeted data for meteorological exploration and hypothesis testing. We describe the recent expansion of the operations area and altitude ceiling of the Tempest UAS, engineering issues for accurate inertial wind estimates, new concepts of operation that include the simultaneous deployment of multiple aircraft with mobile ground stations, and a brief description of our current effort to develop a capability for the Tempest UAS to perform autonomous path planning to maximize energy harvesting from the local wind field for increased endurance.",

            "abstract": "The relative chain-length distribution and carbon-isotope composition of n-alkanes extracted from sedimentary rocks are important geochemical tools for investigating past terrestrial ecosystems. Alkanes preserved in ancient sediments are assumed to be contemporaneous, derived from the same ecosystem, and integrated from the biomass present on the landscape at the time of deposition. Further, there is an underlying assumption that ancient plants exhibited the same metabolic and physiological responses to climate conditions that are observed for modern plants. Interpretations of alkane abundances and isotopic signatures are complicated by the strong influence of phylogenetic affiliation and ecological factors, such as canopy structure. A better understanding of how ecosystem and taxa influence alkane properties, including homologue abundance patterns and leaf-lipid carbon isotope fractionation would help strengthen paleoecological interpretations based on these widely employed plant biomarkers.\nIn this study, we analyze the alkane chain-length distribution and carbon-isotope composition of phytoleim and alkanes (d13Cleaf and d13Clipid) extracted from a selection of Cretaceous and Paleocene fossil leaves from the Guaduas and Cerrejon Formations of Colombia. These data were compared with data for the same families in a modern analogue biome. Photosynthetic and biosynthetic fractionation (∆leaf and elipid) values determined from the fossil material indicate carbon metabolism patterns were similar to modern plants. Fossil data were incorporated in a biomass-weighted mixing model to represent the expected lipid complement of sediment arising from this ecosystem and compared with alkane measurements from the rock matrix. Modeled and observed isotopic and abundance patterns match well for alkane homologs most abundant in plants (i.e., n-C27 to n-C33). The model illustrates the importance of understanding biases in litter flux and taphonomic pressures inherent in the fossil lipid record, and it highlights the influence of community composition and forest structure on sedimentary lipids.",

            "abstract": "Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a key indicator of terrestrial ecosystem functions and global carbon balance. However, accurately estimating GPP is still one of the major challenges in global change study. Compared with other prognostic models, remote-sensing-based light-use efficiency (LUE) modes are considered to have the most potential to characterize the spatial-temporal dynamics of GPP. However, the environmental regulations on LUE, especially from water stress, have relatively large uncertainties, which reversely constrained the applications of LUE models. Here, we used MODIS and global flux tower data to investigate the moisture stress on LUE for different biomes on daily, 8-day and monthly scales. Three groups of moisture stress indicators were adopted in our study, including atmosphere (i.e. precipitation and daytime vapor pressure deficit (VPD)), soil (i.e. soil water content (SWC) and scaled SWC (SWCs) by field capacity and wilting point) , and plant indicators (i.e. land surface wetness index (LSWI) and the ratio of latent heat to the sum of latent and sensible heat (L/(L+H)). We applied a series of steps to eliminate the effects of high/low temperature and diffuse radiation effects on observed LUE. Our analysis showed that there were great variations in moisture stress effects on LUE between and within biomes. Generally, the moisture stress effects on LUE are ranked as plant indicator (i.e. L/(L+H) & LSWI) > atmosphere indicator (i.e. VPD) > soil indicator (i.e. SWC/SWCs). Precipitation has the poorest relationship with observed LUE and doesn't show any significant lag effects. For deep-root biomes (e.g. forest), LUE shows higher sensitivity in VPD than SWC; but for short-root biomes (e.g. grass), LUE is more sensitive to SWC than VPD. Most indicators (except SWC/SWCs) are more effective in affecting LUE at the daily/8-day scale than at the monthly scale probably because the observed LUE becomes more stable as temporal scale increases. SWC do not show close relationship with LUE, suggesting that the current measured SWC in the top-soil layer may not be sufficient to capture the moisture effects on LUE for biomes with different root distributions. Our study highlights the complexity of moisture stress on observed LUE, and provides useful guidance for developing more reliable LUE models to estimate GPP.",

The goal of this research is to use radio wave transmission to simulate scintillation under controlled conditions in order examine the performance of different GPS receivers and their ability to suppress the scintillation. The information gained from the VHF (Very High Frequency) transmitter would serve as a diagnostic tool to better understand the environmental conditions that are causing these irregularities. This system could then be used as a baseline design to be upgraded by NASA engineers to 1.2 GHz – 1.5 GHz for testing out the performance of different GPS receivers.

            "abstract": "Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with online chemistry (WRF-Chem), the impact of Middle East dust aerosols on the Indian summer monsoon rainfall was studied. Eight numerical experiments were conducted to take into account uncertainties related to dust-absorbing properties, various assumptions used in calculating aerosol optical depth (AOD), and various radiation schemes. In order to obtain reasonable dust emission, model-simulated AOD and radiation forcing at the top of the atmosphere were compared with multiple satellite- and surface-based observations. Consistent with observations, modeled results show heavy dust loadings in the Arabian Peninsula and Pakistan, which can be transported through long distance to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Peninsula. By heating the atmosphere in the lower troposphere over the Iranian Plateau, these dust aerosols result in strengthened Indian summer monsoon circulations, which in turn transport more water vapor to the Indian Peninsula. The model shows that northern India becomes wetter during the monsoon season in dust cases than non-dust cases. Further observational analyses show an increasing trend in AOD over the Arabian Peninsula, which corresponds to an increasing trend of rainfall in northern India during summer monsoon seasons from 2000 to 2013. These observed trends of AOD and rainfall are consistent with the model-simulated positive relationship between Middle East dust and Indian summer monsoon rainfall. Our results highlight long-term (decadal) impacts of Middle East dust aerosols on the Indian summer rainfall.",

            "abstract": "New geologic mapping and high-precision 40Ar/39Ar geochronology within the Taos Plateau in northern New Mexico indicate a period of vigorous volcanic activity between ~5.5 and ~1 Ma. Over 50 visible volcanic centers formed during this time together with an unresolved number of vents, fissures, and volcanic centers buried by intercalated volcanic rock and sedimentary basin fill. Defining the volcanic stratigraphy is essential for models of regional groundwater flow and for understanding the geologic evolution of the Pliocene to Recent Rio Grande rift. A spectacular stratigraphic section of volcanic rock related to Rio Grande rifting is visible from the High Bridge, just a few miles outside of Taos, NM, where a 240 m canyon is incised through the basal, middle, and upper Servilleta basalt flow packages (Dungan et al., 1984). Fresh basalt from a vertical transect of the canyon near the High Bridge were analyzed by 40Ar/39Ar methods on ~3 mm3 rock fragments using an ARGUS VI mass spectrometer and the resulting 40Ar/39Ar ages define a precise emplacement chronology of the entire stratigraphic section. The basal flow package records ages of 4.78 ± 0.03 Ma (relative to FCT sanidine = 28.204 Ma; all errors 2 sigma) at river level, 4.77 ± 0.03 Ma at mid flow, and 4.50 ± 0.04 Ma at the top of the flow. The middle flow package records ages of 4.11 ± 0.03 Ma at the base of the flow, 4.08 ± 0.04 Ma mid flow, and 4.02 ± 0.06 Ma at the top of the flow. The upper basalt package records ages of 3.69 ± 0.06 Ma at the base of the flow and 3.59 ± 0.08 Ma at the top of the flow. These data support rapid effusion of voluminous lava flows on time scales of 100-200 ka. Two reddish paleosols separating the Servilleta packages each developed during a 400 ka period of volcanic quiescence. First order calculations using exposed lava thicknesses in the gorge and areal exposures suggest each flow package represents emplacement of ~200 km3 of basalt. Because no exposed vent of appropriate age has been identified that could produce such basalt volumes, the Servilleta basalts probably erputed from buried vents and/or fissures, possibly oriented along the northwest trending fault systems defining the Rio Grande rift graben.",

            "abstract": "The fraction of hydrogen-bearing species embedded in planetary regolith can be determined from the ratio between measured epithermal neutron leakage flux and the flux measured from similar dry regolith. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft is equipped with the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND) instrument to measure embedded hydrogen in the Moon’s polar regions and elsewhere. We have investigated the relative contribution of lunar and non-lunar (spacecraft-sourced) neutrons by modeling maps of the measured count rate from three of the LEND detector systems using linear combinations of maps compiled from the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer (LPNS) and the LEND detectors, demonstrating that the two systems are compatible and enabling reference signal to be inferred to enable detecting hydrogen and hydrogen-bearing volatiles. The pole-to-equator contrast ratio in epithermal neutrons indicates that the average concentration of hydrogen in the Moon’s polar regolith above 80° north or south latitude is ~110 ppmw, or 0.10±0.01 wt% water-equivalent hydrogen. Above 88° north or south, the concentration increases to ~140 ppmw, or 0.13±0.02 wt% water-equivalent hydrogen. Nearly identical suppression of neutron flux at both the north and south poles, despite differences in topography and distribution of permanently-shadowed regions, supports the contention that hydrogen is broadly distributed in the polar regions and increasingly concentrated approaching the poles. Similarity in the degree of neutron suppression in low-energy and high-energy epithermal neutrons suggests that the hydrogen fraction is relatively uniform with depth down to ~1 m; the neutron leakage flux is insensitive to greater depth.",

These events generated both local and far field tsunami inundations with runup ranging from a few meters to around 40 m in the coastal impact regions. With a majority of the coastal population at risk, there is need for a sophisticated outlook towards catastrophe risk estimation and a quick mitigation response. At the same time tools and information are needed to aid advanced tsunami hazard prediction. There is an increased need for insurers, reinsurers and Federal hazard management agencies to quantify coastal inundations and vulnerability of coastal habitat to tsunami inundations. A novel tool is developed to model local and far-field tsunami generation, propagation and inundation to estimate tsunami hazards. The tool is a combination of the NOAA MOST propagation database and an efficient and fast GPU (Graphical Processing Unit)-based non-linear shallow water wave model solver. The tsunamigenic seismic sources are mapped on to the NOAA unit source distribution along subduction zones in the ocean basin. Slip models are defined for tsunamigenic seismic sources through a slip distribution on the unit sources while maintaining limits of fault areas. A GPU based finite volume solver is used to simulate non-linear shallow water wave propagation, inundation and runup. Deformation on the unit sources provide initial conditions for modeling local impacts, while the wave history from propagation database provides boundary conditions for far field impacts. The modeling suite provides good agreement with basins for basin wide tsunami propagation to validate local and far field tsunami inundations.",

            "abstract": "To understand the dominant mechanisms controlling the delivery of sediment in the near field of river plumes, a numerical study is carried out using Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) with an idealized river mouth domain. The domain is designed to be sufficiently simple such that it can be described by several nondimensional parameters but sufficiently complex to capture the key features of a given river mouth. Motivated by a recent multi-institutional study at the mouth of Columbia River, we first apply the idealized model similar to the Columbia River month during the month of May 2013 when the field observation was conducted. Field observation shows interesting asymmetry of near bed turbidity with significantly higher turbidity observed during flood, which follows the landward migrating front. Numerical model predicts a significantly higher turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) following the landward-migrating front during flood, consistent with the location where high turbidity is observed. Preliminary analysis shows that the predicted high near bed TKE level is associated with the stratified two-layer flow established during flood. The two-layer system establishes high flow shear at the interface and enhances TKE in the lower layer. During ebb, the flow becomes much less stratified with a very low gradient Richardson number, and the TKE distribution more or less follows the classic logarithmic law. More thorough analysis including simulations with different composition of sediment resuspended from the plume nearfield and/or supplied by the river outflow will be discussed.",

We are currently in the first solar maximum with social media, which enables the technological roots to connect users, citizen scientists, and professionals around a shared global, rare interest. We will introduce the project which has been in a prototype mode since 2012 and recently relaunched with a new mobile and web presence and active campaigns. We will showcase the interdisciplinary advancements which include a more educated public, disaster warning system applications, and improved real-time ground truth data including photographs and observations of the Northern Lights. We will preview new data which validates the proof of concept for significant improvements in real-time space weather nowcasting. Our aim is to provide better real-time notifications of the visibility of the Northern Lights to the interested public via the combination of noisy crowd-sourced ground truth with noisy satellite-based predictions. The latter data are available now but are often delivered with significant jargon and uncertainty, thus reliable, timely interpretation of such forecasts by the public are problematic. The former data show real-time characteristic significant rises (in tweets for instance) that correlate with other non-real-time indices of auroral activity (like the Kp index). We will discuss the source of 'noise' in each data source. Using citizen science as a platform to provide a basis for deeper understanding is one goal; secondly we want to improve understanding of and appreciation for the dynamics and beauty of the Northern Lights by the public and scientists alike.",

These emphases on the role of climate seasonality come at a time of discernible climate change. Previously, we have shown that the interannual variability in the arrival, intensity, and duration of seasonal rainfall have increased over the past century in parts of the tropics where rainfall seasonality is already pronounced. Here, we analyze globally an index that captures the combined effects of rainfall and temperature seasonality by borrowing methods from statistical and information theories. We differentiate between regions which are similar in the seasonality of rainfall or temperature, but are desynchronized in terms of atmospheric supply and demand (e.g., Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climates). For these regions, we describe how the climate seasonality and the synchronicity of rainfall and temperature have shifted over time, along with changes in their interannual variability. We also demonstrate correlations to regional vegetation distributions and intra-annual patterns of vegetation productivity, thereby placing such trends and changes in interannual variability in an ecohydrologically meaningful context.",

            "abstract": "As debris flows course down a steep hillside they entrain bed materials such as loose sediments. The entrainment of materials not only increases the size of the debris flows but the mobility as well. The mechanics underlying the particle entrainment and the associated increased mobility are not well-understood. Existing models for the entrainment process include those that explicitly consider stress ratios, the angle of inclination, and the particle fluxes relative to those achieved under steady conditions. Others include an explicit consideration of the physics of the granular state: the visco-elastic nature of particle flows and, alternatively, the role of macroscopic force chains. Understanding how well these different approaches account for entrainment and deposition rates is important for accurate debris flow modeling, both in terms of the rate of growth and also in terms of the increased mobility associated with the entrainment.\nWe investigate how total and instantaneous entrainment and deposition vary with macroscopic stresses and particle-scale interactions for different particle sizes and different fluid contents using laboratory experiments in an instrumented experimental laboratory debris flow flume. The flume has separate, independent water supplies for the bed and “supply” (parent debris flow), and the bed is instrumented with pore pressure sensors and a basal stress transducer. We monitor flow velocities, local structure, and instantaneous entrainment and deposition rates using a high speed camera. We have found that systems with a mixture of particle sizes are less erosive and more depositional than systems of one particle size under otherwise the same conditions. For both mixtures and single-sized particle systems, we have observed a relatively linear relationship between total erosion and the slope angle for dry flows. Increasing fluid content typically increases entrainment. Measurements of instantaneous entrainment indicate similar dependencies on particle size and fluid content and further reveal an interdependence between local flow velocities and entrainment rates. We present the details of these results and comment how they may be applied to models for the relationship between mobility and bed entrainment.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, many examples of physical logging have been carried out in deep boreholes. The loggings are direct in-situ measurements of rock physical properties under the ground. They provide significant basic data for the geological, geophysical and geotechnical investigations, e.g., tectonic history, seismic wave propagation, and ground motion prediction. Since about 1980's, Natl. Res. Inst. for Earth Sci. and Disast. Prev. (NIED) dug deep boreholes (from 200m to 3000m depth) in sedimentary basin of Kanto distinct, Japan, for purposes of installing seismographs and hydrological instruments, and in-situ stress and pore pressure measurements. At that time, downhole physical loggings were conducted in the boreholes: spontaneous potential, electrical resistance, elastic wave velocity, formation density, neutron porosity, total gamma ray, caliper, temperature loggings. In many cases, digital data values were provided every 2m or 1m or 0.1m. In other cases, we read printed graphs of logging plots and got digital data values. Data from about 30 boreholes are compiled. Especially, particular change of logging data at the depth of an interface between a shallow part (soft sedimentary rock) and a base rock (equivalent to hard pre-Neogene rock) is examined. In this presentation, the correlations among physical properties of rock (especially, formation density, elastic wave velocity and electrical resistance) are introduced and the relation to the lithology is discussed.\nFormation density, elastic wave velocity and electric resistance data indicate the data are divide in two groups that are higher or lower than 2.5g/cm3: the one correspond to a shallow part and the other correspond to a base rock part. In each group, the elastic wave velocity and electric resistance increase with increase of formation density. However the rates of increases in the shallow part are smaller than in the base rock part. The shallow part has lower degree of solidification and higher porosity than that in the base rock part. It appears differences in the degree of solidification and/or porosity are related to differences in the increasing rates. The present data show that the physical logging data are effective information to explore where the base rock is and what properties of the base rock are different from those in the shallow part.",

            "abstract": "Velocity ring instabilities are a common naturally occuring magnetospheric phenomenon that can also be generated by man made ionospheric experiments. These instabilities are known to generate lower-hybrid waves, which generally cannot propagte out of the source region. However, nonlinear wave physics can convert these linearly driven electrostatic lower-hybrid waves into electromagnetic waves that can escape the source region. These nonlinearly generated waves can be an important source of VLF turbulence that controls the trapped electron lifetime in the radiation belts. We develop numerical solutions to the wave-kinetic equation in a periodic box including the effects of nonlinear (NL) scattering (nonlinear Landau damping) of Lower-hybrid waves giving the evolution of the wave-spectra in wavenumber space. Simultaneously we solve the particle diffusion equation of both the background plasma particles and the ring ions, due to both linear and nonlinear Landau resonances. At initial times for cold ring ions, an electrostatic beam mode is excited, while the kinetic mode is stable. As the instability progresses the ring ions heat, the beam mode is stabilized, and the kinetic mode destabilizes. When the amplitude of the waves becomes sufficient the lower-hybrid waves are scattered (by either nearly unmagnetized ions or magnetized electrons) into electromagnetic magnetosonic waves [Ganguli et al 2010]. The effect of NL scattering is to limit the amplitude of the waves, slowing down the quasilinear relaxation time and ultimately allowing more energy from the ring to be liberated into waves [Mithaiwala et al. 2011]. The effects of convection out of the instability region are modeled, additionally limiting the amplitude of the waves, allowing further energy to be liberated from the ring [Scales et al., 2012]. Results are compared to recent 3D PIC simulations [Winske and Duaghton 2012].",

            "abstract": "The Amazon basin consists of structurally diverse tropical forest ecosystems resulting from unique functional responses to seasonal rainfall and radiation drivers, as well as fire and land use pressures. Dry season intensity and duration increase from the tropical wet rainforests at the equator to cerrado at the south, with transitional forests (dry forest, semi-deciduous forests, and cerradão) and the arc of deforestation between the two large biomes. Little known of this distinctive transitional forest composition and functional types, yet this zone is disappearing rapidly due to anthropological pressure and warming events.\nWe hypothesize that these gradients in light, moisture, land use pressures, and forest functional types should be expressed in distinct canopy-level seasonal responses observable in satellite time series data. Yet, recent studies have raised concerns of concurrent seasonal sun geometry influences that confound the interpretation of satellite-derived greenness and suggest that observed tropical forest seasonality are optical artifacts of shifting sun- sensor view geometries.\nIn this study we investigated forest seasonal variations and greenness dynamics across the transition zone, with 10+ years (2003-2013) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from the MCD43A1 product, for a fixed sun angle and fully corrected for sun- sensor view geometries. EVI values were extracted across two latitudinal transects across the Amazon transition zone sampling the eastern and central regions of the basin.\nWe found a clear pattern of shifting forest greenness seasonality resulting from earlier onsets of the dry season from south to the north, irrespective of, and asynchronous with the solstice to equinox sun-earth geometry. From this seasonal profiles dry season greening in the wet forests and browning in the southern tropical dry forests could be observed. In many of the transitional forests, a mixed seasonal response to light and moisture controls was observed, partly due to mixed tree functional types. This work offers an improved understanding of forest vegetation dynamics and phenology along the forest–ecotone-savanna, important information for predicting climate change and anthropogenic impacts at the Amazon basin.",

            "abstract": "Currently the explosive 2, 4, 6- trinitrotoluene (TNT) is used as a main ingredient in munitions; however the compound has failed to meet sensitivity requirements. The replacement compound being tested is 2, 4-dinitroanisole (DNAN). DNAN is less sensitive to shock, high temperatures, and has good detonation characteristics. However, DNAN is more soluble than TNT, which can influence transport and fate behavior and thus bioavailability and exposure potential. DNAN has been shown to have some human and environmental toxicity. The objective of this study was to investigate the environmental fate of DNAN in soil, with a specific focus on sorption processes. Batch experiments were conducted using 11 soils collected from military installations located across the United States. The soils were characterized for pH, specific surface area, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and organic carbon content. Adsorption kinetic data determined at room temperature were fitted using the first order kinetic equation. Adsorption isotherms were fitted with linear and Freundlich isotherm equations. The magnitudes of the linear adsorption coefficients ranged from 0.6 to 6 cm3/g. Results indicated that the adsorption of DNAN is strongly dependent on the amount of organic carbon present in the soil.",

            "abstract": "The literature of hydrologic modelling shows that in daily simulation of the rainfall-runoff relationship, the simulated hydrograph response to some rainfall events happens one day earlier than the observed one. This one-day offset issue results in significant residuals between the simulated and observed hydrographs and adversely impacts the model performance metrics that are based on the aggregation of daily residuals. Based on the analysis of sub-daily rainfall and runoff data sets in this study, the one-day offset issue appears to be inevitable when the same time interval, e.g. the calendar day, is used to measure daily rainfall and runoff data sets. This is an error introduced through data aggregation and needs to be properly addressed before calculating the model performance metrics. Otherwise, the metrics would not represent the modelling quality and could mislead the automatic calibration of the model. In this study, an algorithm is developed to scan the simulated hydrograph against the observed one, automatically detect all one-day offset incidents and shift the simulated hydrograph of those incidents one day forward before calculating the performance metrics. This algorithm is employed in the automatic calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool that is set up for the Rouge River watershed in Southern Ontario, Canada. Results show that with the proposed algorithm, the automatic calibration to maximize the daily Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) identifies a solution that accurately estimates the magnitude of peak flow rates and the shape of rising and falling limbs of the observed hydrographs. But, without the proposed algorithm, the same automatic calibration finds a solution that systematically underestimates the peak flow rates in order to perfectly match the timing of simulated and observed peak flows.",

            "abstract": "Barchan dunes are naturally occurring three-dimensional topographic features that have been observed on the surface of several planets. They occur both in aeolian and in subaqueous environments. Barchans typically form in fields having a broad distribution in dune size and migration rates. This results in variable bedform spacing and eventually dynamic bedform-bedform interactions that involve morphodynamic processes (e.g. collision, merging, splitting). These processes are controlled by complex feedback mechanisms mutually linking three key elements: fluid flow, sediment transport and bed morphology. The aim of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the fluid-flow mechanisms responsible for the formation, migration and interaction of these dunes. To this end, we study the three-dimensional flow generated by the interactions between fixed barchan-dune models arranged in tandem in collision and ejection scenarios via experiments in an optically-accessible flow environment using planar particle-image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the flow field. These measurements are complemented by targeted large-eddy simulations (LES) meant to provide a three-dimensional view of the flow processes for these fixed dune arrangements.",

            "abstract": "Satellite measurements of forest albedo are directly used in climate models, and could be used in models of the C and N cycles if we more fully understood the mechanism causing a strong correlation of forest albedo with canopy N and C assimilation. One attractive mechanism posits that tree species have evolved convergent leaf and canopy traits. While the leaf traits of tree species are known to drive variability in canopy N and C assimilation, linking tree species to variability in albedo is challenging because of the difficulty in measuring important canopy traits like leaf angle. To refine techniques for measuring leaf angle, and test the hypothesis that high albedo in the central Appalachians could be linked to the abundance of species with canopy traits of more horizontal leaf angles, we conducted four tests with ground-based, drone, and hemispherical photographs. First, we used a leveled camera on a steep slope to repeatedly, and directly measure the leaf angle of over 400 leaves within the canopies of oak, maple, and beech trees. Across all 21 repetitions (3 times a day on 7 dates between May and July), we observed consistent species differences in mean leaf angle (MLA), with maple always being the most horizontal (MLA = 14-18°) and oak the most vertical (MLA = 19-28°). Second, we again found highly significant species differences in MLA when we used a hexacopter drone with a camera on a self-leveling gimbal to make over 1020 direct measurements of leaf angle from six tree species in three broadleaf deciduous forest plots. Third, to measure MLA of a whole multi-species canopy, we compared a species abundance-weighted plot average of the drone-measured MLA values with an indirect, ground-based hemispherical photograph method. The strong agreement of these direct and indirect plot-level methods finally led us to compare a broader set of 61 plot-level hemispherical photo MLA measurements with canopy albedo measured by AVIRIS in broadleaf deciduous forests. In this last test, we found strong support (R2 = 0.42, p < 0.0001) for the hypothesis that more horizontal MLA causes higher albedo. This final result, coupled with the observed strong species differences in MLA, lends support to the idea that the high albedo in the Central Appalachians may be linked to high abundances of tree species with canopy traits of horizontal MLA.",

These tail distributions typically show a power law with a rollover at higher energies. The power law behavior of these suprathermal tails has been studied during so-called quiet times of the solar wind (no significant wave activity) as well as during active periods of the solar cycle. Several studies reported different results for this power law index, ranging from -9 to -1. In this study we used data from the PLASTIC and IMPACT instruments on STEREO spacecraft A in 2008 during a pronounced solar minimum. We investigate the temporal and spatial evolution of these tails at interplanetary structures such as shocks, stream interfaces, magnetic clouds, Alfvénic turbulence, and quiet times. We focus on He+ data to investigate ion acceleration, the formation of suprathermal tails and their association with Alfvénic turbulence. The results of this study show that in shocks and stream interfaces, the spectral index varies dramatically in space and time. Both pre-existing energetic ion populations as well as elevated Alfvénic turbulence impact the spectral slope. Quiet times, which may represent thermalized plasma, tend to show spectral slopes which are closer to -5.",

Heterogeneous chemistry and microphysics of these clouds play a pivotal role in the formation of the ozone hole.\nWe constrain the radiative impact of these clouds utilizing observations from the space-borne lidar CALIPSO and the state of the art radiative transfer model LBLDIS.\nIn addition to spatial and vertical distribution of PSCs, CALIPSO also provides their composition which is used in LBLDIS to calculate their radiative impact.\nThis analysis focuses on the Antarctic winter season of 2008. Here, CALIPSO shows a distinct maximum in integrated optical depth of PSCs east of the Antarctic peninsula which is present throughout the entire winter season. Under clear-sky conditions PSCs can warm the lower stratosphere by several K/day in this region. However, the radiative impact of PSCs is greatly reduced in the presence of underlying tropospheric clouds. With tropospheric cloud parameters provided by CALIPSO we calculate the radiative impact of PSCs for several tropospheric cloud conditions to constrain the potential impact of PSCs on stratospheric temperatures.\nWe find that high tropospheric clouds reduce the heating effect of PSCs and eventually PSCs have a cooling effect on lower stratospheric temperatures. We investigate how the radiative impact of PSCs changes throughout the winter with changing tropospheric conditions and how these locally forced temperature fluctuations impact the formation of PSCs.",

            "abstract": "Over the decade 2002-12, the percentage of students from underrepresented minorities (URM) graduating with geoscience degrees has increased by 50%. In 2012, of the nearly 6,000 geoscience Bachelor’s degrees, 8% were awarded to students from URM. But that same year across all of STEM, 18% of Bachelors went to these students, and URM made up 30% of the US population overall. Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) play an important role in increasing the diversity of geoscience graduates where there are appropriate degree programs or pathways to programs. To better understand opportunities at these institutions, the InTeGrate project collected information on degree programs at MSIs.\nA summer 2013 survey of websites for three types of MSIs confirmed that, while stand-alone Geology, Geoscience, or Environmental Science departments are present, there are a larger number of degree programs that include elements of geoscience or related disciplines (geography, GIS, etc.) offered in interdisciplinary departments (e.g. Natural Sciences and Math) or cognate science departments (Physics, Engineering, etc.). Approximately one-third of Hispanic Serving Institutions and Tribal Colleges and one-fifth of Historically Black Colleges and Universities offer at least one degree that includes elements of geoscience. The most common programs were Geology and Environmental Science (94 and 88 degrees respectively), but 21 other types of program were also found.\nTo better profile the nature of these programs, 11 interviews were conducted focusing on strategies for attracting, supporting, and preparing minority students for the workforce. In conjunction with the February 2014 Broadening Access to the Earth and Environmental Sciences workshop, an additional 6 MSI profiles were obtained as well as 22 profiles from non-MSIs. Several common strategies emerge:\nProactive marketing and outreach to local high schools and two-year colleges\nCommunity building, mentoring and advising, academic support, and funding support\nResearch experiences, internships, alumni or industry interactions, and real-world project\nThese findings align with the literature on supporting students from underrepresented groups.

            "abstract": "Convective flow in a porous medium plays an important role in numerous geophysical and industrial processes, and has recently been investigated in the context of geological CO2 sequestration. Previous studies of vigorous porous convection at high Rayleigh number Ra have focused on homogeneous porous media, whereas natural porous media are often highly heterogeneous. In particular, many geological porous formations are interspersed with thin, roughly horizontal, low-permeability layers. In order to gain understanding of the interaction of low-permeability layering with convective flow, and to develop simple parameterized models of the underlying physical processes, we have performed a numerical study of high-Ra convection in a two-dimensional porous medium that contains a thin, horizontal, low-permeability interior layer. The medium is heated at the lower boundary and cooled at the upper, which sets up statistically steady convective flow throughout the domain. This archetypal system is readily applicable to compositional convection, owing to an assumption of thermal equilibrium between solid and liquid phase in the medium. We show that, in the limit that both the dimensionless thickness h and permeability Π of the low-permeability layer are small, the flow is described solely by the impedance of the layer Ω= h/Π and by Ra. As Ω → 0 (i.e. h → 0), the system reduces to a homogeneous medium. We observe two notable features as Ω is increased: the dominant horizontal lengthscale of the flow increases; and, surprisingly, the heat flux through the cell, as measured by the Nusselt number Nu, can increase. For larger values of Ω, Nu always decreases. We explore the dependence of the flow on Ra, and develop simple theoretical models to describe some of the observed features of the relationship Nu(Ω). The theoretical models have implications for the simulation of convective dissolution of CO2 at reservoir scales, as heterogeneities can be much smaller than the grid scale and therefore must be parameterized.",

            "abstract": "Uptake of CO2 from surface water via mineral carbonation in peridotite can be engineered to achieve negative CO2 emissions. Reaction with peridotite, e.g., CO2 + olivine (A), serpentine (B) and brucite (C), forms inert, non-toxic, solid carbonates such as magnesite. Experimental studies show that A can be 80% complete in a few hours with 30 micron powders and elevated P(CO2) [1,2,3]. B is slower, but in natural systems the rate of B+C is significant [4].\nMethods for capture of dilute CO2 via mineral carbonation [4,5,6,7] are not well known, though CO2 storage via mineral carbonation has been discussed for decades [8,9]. Where crushed peridotite is available, as in mine tailings, increased air or water flow could enhance CO2 uptake at a reasonable cost [4,5].\nHere we focus on enhancing subsurface CO2 uptake from surface water flowing in fractured peridotite, in systems driven by thermal convection such as geothermal power plants. Return of depleted water to the surface would draw down CO2 from the air [6,7]. CO2 uptake from water, rate limited by flow in input and output wells, could exceed 1000 tons CO2/yr [7]. If well costs minus power sales were $0.1M to $1M and each system lasts 10 years this costs < $10 to $100 per ton CO2. As for other CCS methods, upscaling requires infrastructure resembling the oil industry. Uptake of 1 Gt CO2/yr at 1000 t/well/yr requires 1M wells, comparable to the number of producing oil and gas wells in the USA.\nSubsurface CO2 uptake could first be applied in coastal, sub-seafloor peridotite with onshore drilling. Sub-seafloor peridotite is extensive off Oman, New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea, with smaller amounts off Spain, Morocco, USA, etc. This would be a regional contribution, used in parallel with other methods elsewhere.\nTo achieve larger scale is conceivable. There is a giant mass of seafloor peridotite along slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. Could robotic drills enhance CO2 uptake at a reasonable cost, while fabric chimneys transport CO2-depleted water to the sea surface?

Recent flashfloods and flashflood-induced landslides took nearly 100 lives and destroyed or damaged nearly 2000 homes in 12 villages within Guzargah-e-Nur district of Baghlan province in northeastern Afghanistan. With available satellite imagery, flood-water inundation estimation can be accomplished remotely, thereby providing a means to reduce the impact of such flood events by improving shared situational awareness during major flood events. Satellite orbital considerations, weather, cost, data licensing restrictions, and other issues can often complicate the acquisition of appropriately timed imagery. Given the need for tools to supplement imagery where not available, complement imagery when it is available, and bridge the gap between imagery based flood mapping and traditional hydrodynamic modeling approaches, we have developed a topographic floodplain model (FLDPLN), which has been used to identify and map river valley floodplains with elevation data ranging from 90-m SRTM to 1-m LiDAR. Floodplain “depth to flood” (DTF) databases generated by FLDPLN are completely seamless and modular. FLDPLN has been applied in Afghanistan to flood-prone areas along the northern and southern flanks of the Hindu Kush mountain range to generate a continuum of 1-m increment flood-event models up to 10 m in depth. Elevation data used in this application of FLDPLN included high-resolution, drone-acquired LiDAR (~1 m) and IFSAR (5 m; INTERMAP). Validation of the model has been accomplished using the best available satellite-derived flood inundation maps, such as those issued by Unitar’s Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT). Results provide a quantitative approach to evaluating the potential risk to urban/village infrastructure as well as to irrigation systems, agricultural fields and archaeological sites.",

            "abstract": "The rapid increase in atmospheric and surface ocean CO2 concentrations has the potential to drastically alter the metabolic processes particularly in nearshore ecosystems. However, much of what is known about carbonate chemistry is based on observations and analysis of surface waters of the open ocean where spatial and temporal variability is far less dynamic than in nearshore coral reef ecosystems. Carbon system dynamics data from four consecutive years has been examined in the coastal and nearshore waters of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. This data has been collected for the purpose of improving our understanding of the carbon system dynamics in this unique and pristine environment. The data collected includes continuous CTD data and discrete bottle samples, as well as continuous underway measurements. In addition to standard hydrographic profile data, water column alkalinity and pH have been measured on discrete water samples, and continuous underway measurements of pCO2 and pH have been obtained. This data is used to investigate the impact of NWHI coral reef ecosystems on the carbon system in and surrounding the archipelago. The data demonstrates that a significant “island mass effect” with respect to the oceanographic carbon system exists around the islands within the archipelago. In addition, spatial and temporal variability of several oceanographic features that exhibit a radial, latitudinal, or longitudinal gradient in the nearshore waters of the NWHI islands, islets, and atolls will be described. Finally, a shallow pH maximum coincident with the shallow oxygen maximum is observed, which suggests an open ocean feature substantially influenced by turbulence surrounding the islands within the monument. The data analysis and coral reef ecosystem monitoring will aid in developing a long-term plan to assist in the sustainability of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.",

            "abstract": "During its first two years of exploration, Curiosity rover provided strong evidence of water activity at Gale Crater on Mars. While liquid water is not commonly present on the surface of Mars, large depressions such as Gale Crater hold evidence that water was collected in impact craters on Mars in the distant past. Specific features such as alluvial fans, inverted riverbeds, moat areas, and sedimentary formations, demonstrate strong water activity on low elevation regions of Mars. While surface water (gradually) disappeared as the climate and atmosphere of Mars changed, important water deposits formed underground, either as sub-surface ice shelves, or in the form of hydrated minerals, as demonstrated by MER and MSL. Although the presence of water ice under the ancient lake bed at the foothills of Mount Sharp is still to be determined, the area explored so far by Curiosity exhibits erosion features that can help describe the history of water activity along billions of years, e.g., river streams, lacustrine sedimentation, and later cycles of evaporation, frosting and sublimation.\nThis presentation features a comparative study of water erosion processes at Gale Crater on Mars and Death Valley (DV) on Earth, from ancient water flows and lacustrine environments, through evaporation, dryness, and cyclic frosting and sublimation. Groundwater deposits in Death Valley offer best opportunities to study the process of minerals hydration, as well as landforms related to underground water percolation and evaporation, similar to those discovered by Curiosity at Yellowknife Bay. Furthermore, sedimentary processes in lacustrine proximal settings similar to those argued for Mount Sharp, or seen at Gale Crater’s floor, have been studied in several locations of DV. These include, but are not limited to, younger dry lake beds of former lakes Manly and Panamint, carved badland formations of Furnace Creek Lake (Zabriskie Point) and older Tertiary lacustrine and fanglomeratic deposits exposed in cratered terrains (i.e., Ubehebe Volcanic Field). All of the above involve depositional and erosional landforms (gullies, alluvial fans, bottom slope debris deposits, layers of hydrated minerals), which can be used as natural research laboratory for sedimentary and erosion processes and as analog models for Gale Crater.",

            "abstract": "We started to develop a new algorithm for real-time tsunami forecast based on offshore tsunami observations with 150 cabled ocean-bottom pressure gauges of the Seafloor Observation Network for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (S-net), under construction along the Japan Trench (Kanazawa et al., 2012, JpGU; Uehira et al., 2012, AGU). The most important concept on the new algorithm is involving any type and/or form uncertainties in the tsunami forecast, which cannot be dealt with any of standard linear/nonlinear least square approaches. We first construct a tsunami scenario bank (TSB). It contains offshore tsunami waveforms at the 150 stations and maximum coastal tsunami heights, calculated using nonlinear long-wave theory with runup boundary condition from any possible tsunami sources (fault models) that affect target coastal regions. From TSB, then we quickly explore a range of several suitable tsunami scenarios, that can explain offshore observations. At the same time, maximum possible tsunami heights along the target coastlines, coupled with selected scenarios, are predicted. In the near future, it is possible to forecast real-time tsunami inundation by adding its component in TSB under the same strategy.\nIn this study, we focus on near-field tsunami occurring off the Pacific coast of Tohoku and Hokkaido. Provisionally, we generate 1848 tsunami scenarios, prepared for a research project of nationwide Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment for Japan (Hirata et al., 2014, AOGS), to construct TSB. For a given pseudo \"observed waveforms\", the developing algorithm rapidly picks up an allowable range of tsunami scenarios from TSB. In this procedure, we use multiple indexes such as correlation coefficient, sum of squared residual, as well as geometric mean and geometric standard deviation in ratios of scenarios to observations. Use of multiple indexes rather than any single index as linear inversion does reinforce to obtain robust tsunami forecast.",

            "abstract": "We characterize the temporal evolution of the flow regime of urbanizing basins. By urbanizing basins, we mean basins that have experienced urban growth during their observation period. To represent the flow regime, we use flow duration curves (FDCs). We compute the FDCs using a stochastic model of daily streamflow for urban basins. In this case, the model aids in discerning the influence of key factors (e.g., climate, land use change, stormwater managenment conditions, and the slow and fast properties of the hydrologic response) on streamflow. To implement the model, we first divide the complete observation period of a given urban basin into intervals of equal duration, e.g. 5 years. Subsequently, we apply the model to each interval and this is how we capture the influence of land use changes and climatic fluctuations on the flow regime. We apply this modeling framework to 14 urbanizing basins in the Baltimore-Washington DC region. Results from this application indicate consistent changes in the temporal evolution of the altered flow regimes, which can largely be explained by the progressive redistribution with urban growth of water from slow subsurface runoff and evapotranspiration to fast urban runoff. We also use the modeling framework to determine indicators of ecohydrological alteration for urbanizing basins. The application of these indicators to our study area suggests that the flow regime is sensitive to alterations up to a certain level of urbanization after which sensitivity seems to level off. The flow regime also seems to be relatively more resistant to alterations for both the smaller and larger levels of urbanization considered. In the future, we would like to extend the application of the proposed modeling framework to other metropolitan areas.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have substantially improved our understanding of water, sediment and materials exports by arctic rivers. Seasonality of exports, particularly during the spring freshet, is better quantified, as are the inland sources of water and sediment discharge and the source and chemical character of other material exports, including carbon and nutrients. Measurements on small rivers discharging directly to the Arctic Ocean and lacking complex deltas can accurately quantify local inputs to coastal regions. However, the majority of hydrologic inputs to the Arctic Ocean derive from 6 major Eurasian and North American rivers. Water, sediment, and chemical exports from these rivers are typically measured above head of tide, far inland, and commonly above large river deltas. These deltas settle particles and provide favorable environments for deposition, storage, and biogeochemical consumption, production, and transformation of aquatic carbon and nutrients. Consequently, basin exports measured above river deltas likely misrepresent actual delivery to coastal regions. In addition to accumulating sediment, observed and modeled arctic delta effects include enrichment of the organic content of suspended solids, increased dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC; DON) concentration, decreased inorganic nutrient concentration, and settling and likely increased bioavailability of particle associated contaminants, such as mercury. Increased DOC concentration in the Mackenzie River delta has also been associated with a change in DOC quality, with increased potential for biodegradation of DOC and decreased potential for photodegradation of DOC from head of tide to within the delta. For the most part, assessments of differences between head of tide basin exports and coastal delivery tend to be qualitative rather than quantitative, largely because of difficulties quantifying tidally affected flow. This points to the need to resolve data gaps, improve quantitative assessments, and advance our understanding of arctic river inputs to coastal environments. We use examples from the Yukon and Mackenzie River deltas in USA and Canada to illustrate those needs.",

            "abstract": "In subduction systems, sediments are deformed under complicated loading conditions in time and space. Although quantification of in situ stress and pore pressure at depth is crucial for understanding the absolute strength and the range of slip behaviors along megathrust faults, direct measurements of these quantities are very limited. Our recent work has used empirical relations between sonic velocity, porosity, and stress defined through a suite of laboratory deformation experiments on sediment cores to estimate in situ stress from seismic survey data along the megathrust plate boundary in the Nankai Trough [Kitajima and Saffer, 2012]. Here, we extend this analysis to examine the effects of loading path and lithology in detail, and to quantify in-situ pore pressure and stress state throughout the subduction complex - including the underthrust section, the accretionary prism, and overlying Kumano basin.\nTo first order, different loading paths do not affect the relationship between P-wave velocity and porosity for a given sediment, but they do affect the relationship between porosity and effective mean stress: at the same effective mean stress, sediments are more compacted with increasing differential stress. The relations between P-wave velocity, porosity, and effective mean stress are also different for different lithologies. In particular, the empirical relations defined by our laboratory experiments are markedly different for sands and mudstones. Based on an estimation of in situ stress and pore pressure for a range of possible scenarios with different lithologies and loading paths, we suggest that the Kumano basin is loaded in a uniaxial stress condition, whereas the prism and underthrust section are most likely loaded along a near critical stress condition with lateral compression.",

Nearly all of our students attend non-competitive-entry public schools in NYC or the neighborhoods around the Observatory. Over 80% are from under-served minority populations. Most receive Title I/III assistance. About 60% are young women. During the past 10 years, nearly all of our participants have gone on to 4-year colleges. About half are declaring science and engineering majors. Our students receive scholarship support at rates several times higher than their graduating peers, including 5 Gates Millennium scholars over the past 5 years.

Accelerated eutrophication threatens our drinking water sources. Many believe that the use of nutrients (e.g., road salts, fertilizers, etc.) near these sources may have negative impacts on animal and plant populations and water quality although it is unclear how to best balance broad community needs. The Jefferson Project is a joint effort between RPI, IBM and the Fund for Lake George aimed at creating an instrumented water ecosystem along with an appropriate cyberinfrastructure that can serve as a global model for ecosystem monitoring, exploration, understanding, and prediction. One goal is to help communities understand the potential impacts of actions such as road salting strategies so that they can make appropriate informed recommendations that serve broad community needs. Our semantic eScience team is creating a semantic infrastructure to support data integration and analysis to help trained scientists as well as the general public to better understand the lake today, and explore potential future scenarios. We are leveraging our RPI Tetherless World Semantic Web methodology that provides an agile process for describing use cases, identification of appropriate background ontologies and technologies, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nIBM is providing a state-of-the-art sensor network infrastructure along with a collection of tools to share, maintain, analyze and visualize the network data. In the context of this sensor infrastructure, we will discuss our semantic approach's contributions in three knowledge representation and reasoning areas: (a) human interventions on the deployment and maintenance of local sensor networks including the scientific knowledge to decide how and where sensors are deployed; (b) integration, interpretation and management of data coming from external sources used to complement the project’s models; and (c) knowledge about simulation results including parameters, interpretation of results, and comparison of results against external data.

Climate sensitive forest dynamics models may prove to be effective tools for developing a comprehensive understanding. However, to be applicable to both regional forest planning and operational forest management, modeling approaches must be capable of simulating forest dynamics across large spatial extents (required for regional planning) while maintaining a high-level of spatial detail (required for operational management). LiDAR remote sensing has shown great utility for operational forest inventory and management, including forest dynamics modeling, albeit across relatively small spatial extents. We present a remote sensing driven approach to spatially initialize a climate-sensitive forest dynamics model (LANDIS-II) in the Pacific Northwest of the US via an integration of airborne LiDAR data with satellite remote sensing data. The system provides detailed forest inventory information - at the landscape level - that is subsequently employed to demonstrate how such models can be used to 1) investigate the potential impacts of climate change on future forest composition and structure, and 2) assess how various forest management practices may either enhance or degrade forest resilience to changing climate and disturbance regimes.",

            "abstract": "Global climate changes have enormous influences on vegetation growth, meanwhile, response of vegetation to climate express space diversity and time-lag effects, which account for spatial-temporal disparities of climate change and spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem. Revelation of this phenomenon will help us further understanding the impact of climate change on vegetation. Assessment and forecast of global environmental change can be also improved under further climate change. Here we present space diversity and time-lag effects patterns of global vegetation respond to three climate factors (temperature, precipitation and solar radiation) based on quantitative analysis of satellite data (NDVI) and Climate data (Climate Research Unit). We assessed the time-lag effects of global vegetation to main climate factors based on the great correlation fitness between NDVI and the three climate factors respectively among 0-12 months’ temporal lags. On this basis, integrated response model of NDVI and the three climate factors was built to analyze contribution of different climate factors to vegetation growth with multiple regression model and partial correlation model. In the result, different vegetation types have distinct temporal lags to the three climate factors. For the precipitation, temporal lags of grasslands are the shortest while the evergreen broad-leaf forests are the longest, which means that grasslands are more sensitive to precipitation than evergreen broad-leaf forests. Analysis of different climate factors’ contribution to vegetation reveal that vegetation are dominated by temperature in the high northern latitudes; they are mainly restricted by precipitation in arid and semi-arid areas (Australia, Western America); in humid areas of low and intermediate latitudes (Amazon, Eastern America), vegetation are mainly influenced by solar radiation. Our results reveal the time-lag effects and major driving factors of global vegetation growth and explain the spatiotemporal variations of global vegetation in last 30 years. Significantly, it is as well as in forecasting and assessing the influences of future climate change on the vegetation dynamics.\nThis work was supported by the High Technology Research and Development Program of China (Grant NO.2013AA122801).",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission utilizes several microwave radiometers on individual platforms to measure global precipitation. In order to derive consistent precipitation measurements among the radiometers in the constellation, the radiometers need to be inter-calibrated. This is achieved by adjusting the brightness temperatures (TBs) of the instruments to agree with a common reference using the double difference method. The GPM X-Cal team has derived inter-calibration offsets for the radiometers in GPM, and it has been shown that inter-calibrating the radiometers has a significant positive impact on obtaining consistent precipitation estimates. One important aspect of the inter-calibration that is currently not incorporated in the precipitation algorithm is the uncertainty. The inter-calibration uncertainty may have a significant impact on the precipitation retrievals, so the X-Cal team has recently started to study this in more detail. This presentation will analyze the various contributors to the inter-calibration uncertainty and show how uncertainties can be calculated for the microwave imager channels from 10 to 91 GHz.\nTwo main contributors to the inter-calibration uncertainty are the radiative transfer model (RTM) and the ancillary inputs to the RTM. The RTM is used to simulate the TBs that a radiometer would observe. This is a necessary component of the inter-calibration algorithm, used to account for differences in frequency, earth incidence angle, and orbits between the radiometers being compared. Since the same RTM is used for all radiometers being inter-calibrated, any errors that the RTM introduces by improperly modeling the TBs should be removed to first order. However, if there are errors that are not linear with respect to frequency or EIA, this will cause sensitivity in the inter-calibration to the RTM. A preliminary study showed sensitivity for those frequencies around the water vapor absorption line (21 to 24 GHz) and for the higher frequencies near 90 GHz, which means that the double difference method is not able to completely account for errors in the RTM. This presentation will expand on that study by quantifying these errors for GPM inter-calibration.",

Is it possible to discern fast flowing seasonally recharged subsurface waters from long residence time waters contributing to base flow? To answer these questions, water samples were collected at ~80 locations distributed over the channel network of the (17 km2) Elder Creek catchment during surveys in May and August/September 2014. The site, located at the Angelo Coast Range Reserve near the headwaters of the South Fork of the Eel River in northern California, experiences a Mediterranean climate with warm dry summers and cold wet winters; this year (2014), our area has received less than 50% of expected precipitation and is experiencing an extreme drought. Our survey times correspond to the beginning of the dry season and late dry season, respectively. The subsurface lithology of the region almost uniform, being largely composed of argillite mudstone with intermittent areas underlain with sandstone. It is forested with Douglas fir, live and tan oaks, madrone and California bay laurel, which vary in abundance with hill-slope orientation. Due to drought, the Elder Catchment has recently experienced the effects of the nearby Lodge Lightening Complex Fire (first detection July 31 2014) and its effects may be differentiated through the continuous 1 – 3 day frequency sampling of Elder Creek water using the ISCO Gravity Filtration System (GFS; Kim et al. 2012, EST). All water samples are analyzed for dissolved major, minor, and trace solutes by Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry and this report focuses on major solutes such as Na, K, Ca, Mg and Si; redox sensitive metals Fe and Mn; and Ba and Sr. Preliminary analysis of May 2014 data shows interesting patterns between tributaries, particularly differences between streams on north vs. south facing slopes. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Na decrease down slope in south facing tributaries, while they slightly increase downslope in north facing tributaries. Concentrations are relatively invariant in the Elder channel but Elder chemistry differs with respect to Na, Ca and Fe to the South Fork Eel River.",

The most important strategy in the nationwide PTHA is predominance of aleatory uncertainty in the assessment but use of epistemic uncertainty is limited to the minimum, because the number of all possible combinations among epistemic uncertainties diverges quickly when the number of epistemic uncertainties in the assessment increases ; we consider only a type of earthquake occurrence probability distribution as epistemic uncertainty. We briefly show outlines of the nationwide PTHA as follows; (i) we consider all possible earthquakes in the future, including those that the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion (HERP) of Japanese Government, already assessed. (ii) We construct a set of simplified earthquake fault models, called “Characterized Earthquake Fault Models (CEFMs)”, for all of the earthquakes by following prescribed rules (Toyama et al., 2014, JpGU; Korenaga et al., 2014, JpGU). (iii) For all of initial water surface distributions caused by a number of the CEFMs, we calculate tsunamis by solving a nonlinear long wave equation, using FDM, including runup calculation, over a nesting grid system with a minimum grid size of 50 meters. (iv) Finally, we integrate information about the tsunamis calculated from the numerous CEFMs to get nationwide tsunami hazard assessments. One of the most popular representations of the integrated information is a tsunami hazard curve for coastal tsunami heights, incorporating uncertainties inherent in tsunami simulation and earthquake fault slip heterogeneity (Abe et al., 2014, JpGU). We will show a　PTHA along the eastern coast of Honshu, Japan, based on approximately 1,800 tsunami sources located within the subduction zone along the Japan Trench, as a prototype of the nationwide PTHA.\nThis study is supported by part of the research project on research on evaluation of hazard and risk of natural disasters, under the direction of the HERP of Japanese Government.",

            "abstract": "The West Iberia continental margin is a type locale for magma-poor rifting, and studies there have been instrumental in changing the classical view of the ocean-continent transition (OCT) from a discrete boundary juxtaposing continental and oceanic crust, into a more complicated zone of varying width that can include exhumed mantle. This study examines two new seismic lines in the Galicia Bank area extending west of the Peridotite Ridge, showing high resolution images of five new ridges. These ridges could be hyperextended continental crust, exhumed continental mantle, or rough ultra-slow spreading oceanic crust. There are no tilted fault blocks with pre-syn rift stratigraphy that would indicate continental crust. There are also no faults indicating mid-ocean spreading with seismic layer stratigraphy indicating normal oceanic crust. The ridges have no coherent internal seismic structure, and some resemble the topographic profile of the Peridotite Ridge. Therefore, it is likely the western ridges are also mainly composed of serpentinized mantle. These western ridges are also similar to small oceanic core complexes observed along the active part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which also contain exhumed serpentinized mantle. This implies that there is a gradual transition within our study area from continental extension to seafloor spreading. Exhumation of continental mantle results in the formation of peridotite ridges, then transitions to episodic volcanism, which produces local thin basaltic crust, and exhumation of oceanic core complexes. Asymmetric processes during initial rifting and spreading results in contrasting structures on the two resulting margins.",

Previous studies have shown that the rising contribution of Asian air pollution to the US has increased the number of days that pollution events exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Whole air samples collected over the Edwards Air Force Base during a June 2014 NASA Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) flight exhibited enhancements in the concentrations of several compounds between 23-32 thousand feet. Chemical tracer analysis of these high altitude samples reveal that the air does not correspond to California emitted air. Chemical signatures in the plume, including high levels of OCS, chloroform, and methyl chloride, and low levels of methyl bromide, indicate that the plume was most heavily influence by coal combustion with contributions from biomass burning events from Asia. Low concentrations of ethene at the high altitude despite enhanced concentrations of ethane and ethyne suggest that this plume was aged. Further analysis of the plume using meteorological wind trajectories reveal that the plume had originated in China approximately 4-5 days prior. This is faster than results from previous studies that had found a Spring transport time of approximately 6 days.",

            "abstract": "In mountainous, snow-dominated watersheds, the relative influence of and interactions among factors controlling the spatio-temporal distributions of soil moisture and soil temperature, including slope, elevation, precipitation magnitude and type, incoming solar radiation, and vegetation, are poorly understood at the watershed scale. We investigated these processes by using the Weather Research and Forecasting model to dynamically downscale the Global Forecast System model to a 4 km resolution for western Montana for years 2000–2006. We used the resulting regional climate data to force a physics-based ecohydrologic model, ECH2O, over the Bitterroot River basin (6,500 km2). The model was run at daily time steps in a 250-m resolution grid and was calibrated against measured streamflow and snow water equivalent, as well as satellite-derived snow covered distribution, gross primary production, evapotranspiration, leaf area index, and land-surface temperature. Soil moisture, soil temperature, runoff, and other ecohydrologic variables were simulated. We focus on analyzing the sensitivity of soil moisture and soil temperature to elevation by studying soil moisture-temperature curves for six elevation intervals spanning the elevation range of ~ 2 km. Results show that as elevation increases, the ranges of variation for depth-averaged soil moisture and soil temperature throughout the year evolve differently. A negative correlation between soil temperature and soil moisture is apparent at all elevations, being stronger in the valley bottom and at low altitudes. The spatial variability of soil moisture and soil temperature increases from the valley bottom toward low and moderate elevations due to more transient and complex patterns of snow cover. A stronger hysteresis between these two variables was also detected as elevation increases with two loops, one corresponding to late summer and fall precipitation and the other to the onset of spring snowmelt. The soil moisture-temperature curves show different characteristics within elevation bands, and are representative of the climate conditions and the snow accumulation and melting regime. The altitudinal analysis of soil moisture and temperature presented here provides insight into which elevation zones may be most vulnerable to climate change.",

            "abstract": "One of the key challenges facing the ecological community lies in understanding the impacts of forecast climate change on the structure and function of ecosystems both through time and across large spatial extents. There are two main obstacles that currently hinder the ability to quantify ecosystem change in this manner within the context of a shifting climate. First, with respect to key ecosystem responses, there are limited data that have sufficient spatial-temporal resolution and extent. Second, methods for quantifying long term changes in ecosystem responses with complex spatial and temporal structure driven by climatic forcing are not well developed.\nIn this work we focus on the question “What is the most appropriate spatial resolution for detecting a process level trend?” We address this question through the development and application of a simulation framework that allows for the parametric specification of the following model components: measurement error, the functional form of the link between climate drivers and the ecosystem response, and annual process variability dealing with non-separable space-time covariance structures. We consider varying spatial resolution and the corresponding impact of the covariance structure associated with the data model. This is parameterized in the simulation framework through an additive measurement error term. As the spatial resolution becomes coarser, sub-pixel heterogeneity becomes absorbed by the measurement error term as opposed to attribution to parameters in the process model. The results of this study characterize an “envelope” of values for these parameters that allow for the detection of trend in process model parameter. This study outlines a quantitative method of choosing a spatial resolution that allows for the detection of trend given a collection of prior distributions associated with other model parameters.",

            "abstract": "An important and uncertain aspect of biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation is that it is often associated with anthropogenic pollution tracers. Prior studies in Atlanta suggested that 70-80% of the carbon in water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) is modern, yet it is well-correlated with the anthropogenic CO. In this study, we deployed a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) at multiple sites in different seasons (May 2012-February 2013) to characterize the sources and chemical composition of aerosols in the greater Atlanta area. This area in the SE US is ideal to investigate anthropogenic-biogenic interactions due to high natural and anthropogenic emissions. These extensive field studies are part of the Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology study (SCAPE). The HR-ToF-AMS is deployed at four sites (~ 3 weeks each) in rotation: Jefferson Street (urban), Yorkville (rural), roadside site (near Highway 75/85), and Georgia Tech site (campus), with the urban and rural sites being part of the SEARCH network. We obtained seven HR-ToF-AMS datasets in total. During the entire measurement period, the ACSM is stationary at the GIT site and samples continuously. We perform positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis on the HR-ToF-AMS and ACSM data to deconvolve the OA into different components. While the diurnal cycle of the total OA is flat as what have been previously observed, the OA factors resolved by PMF analysis show distinctively different diurnal trends. We find that the “more-oxidized oxygenated OA” (MO-OOA) constitutes a major fraction of OA at all sites. In summer, OA is dominated by SOA, e.g., isoprene-OA and OOA with different degrees of oxidation. In contrary, biomass burning OA is more prominent in winter data. By comparing HR-ToF-AMS and ACSM data during the same sampling periods, we find that the aerosol time series are highly correlated, indicating the regional nature of aerosols in the Atlanta area. Taken together, results from these extensive field studies provide invaluable insights into the sources and processing of aerosols in the greater Atlanta area.

            "abstract": "Aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Dark Target (DT) algorithm now has a record of nearly 15 years. During that time, there have been many studies to evaluate the retrieved AOD product, including direct comparison with the AOD reported by ground-based sun photometers. The result has been the rigorous “validation” of the DT products, in that the agreement between retrieved and observed AOD has been quantified on a global scale. For example, validation means that >68% of the MODIS data (or one standard deviation) agrees to the ground-truth, within a specified error envelope. However, validation does not tell a user anything about specific aerosol retrieval cases. Therefore, our team is taking the next logical step and developing the framework for deriving per-pixel retrieval uncertainty. The retrieval uncertainty in AOD comes from (1) non-linearity the algorithm’s look-up-table approach and (2) various assumptions made prior to and during the retrieval. Some of these assumptions include errors in the observed reflectance (calibration or missing data), standard deviation of the reflectance over the retrieval box, non-aerosol (e.g. gas absorption and Rayleigh) atmospheric corrections, and characterization of the surface reflectance. We will discuss the methodology of our framework and present a year’s worth of global and regional analysis of the uncertainty our AOD retrievals.",

            "abstract": "The orogeny is a fundamental process of plate tectonics, and its record is useful for understanding of ancient plate motion. Geotectonic history of British isles has been explained by collision-type orogeny accompanied by closure of Iapetus ocean. High pressure metamorphic rocks such as blueschist and eclogite characterizing Pacific-type orogeny occur in some places, but have not attracted much interests because of their smallness.\nThe subduction-related (Pacific-type) orogeny is characterized by contemporaneous formation of a batholith belt, a regional metamorphic belt (high P/T type) and an accretionary complex. Late Proterozoic-Cambrian (677-498 Ma) calc-alkaline volcano-plutonic complexes crop out in Lleyn and Anglesey areas, northwest Wales. The metamorphic age of high-P/T metamorphic belt in eastern Anglesey was constrained by Ar-Ar isochron age of 560-550 Ma. However, depositional age of the rocks composing accretionary complex wasn’t fully constrained due to the limited zircon U-Pb age data and vague microfossil records.\nMonian Supergroup at Lleyn and Anglesey areas includes three groups; South Stack Group (Gp), New Harbour Gp and Gwna Gp. The Gwna Gp is located at the structural top and includes typical rocks of an ocean plate stratigraphy (OPS), a fundamental unit composing of an accretionary complex. We described detailed geological map and reconstructed the OPSs at some localities with careful attention to layer-parallel thrust. In order to constrain the sedimentary ages of each OPS, we collected sandstones from individual OPSs.\nWe determined U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the sandstones with LA-ICP-MS at Kyoto University. We adopted the youngest age of the detrital zircons as a constraint of sedimentary age. The results indicate that sediments in Gwna Gp deposited from 623 ± 17 Ma to 535 ± 14 Ma. These are contemporary with the ages of both batholith belt and regional metamorphic belt. In addition, it became evident that structurally upper level is older than lower level. This structurally downward-younging polarity is one of the characteristics of accretionary complex. Therefore, we concluded that the accretionary complex at northwestern Wales was formed between 623 ± 17 Ma and 535 ± 14 Ma, and the subduction-related Pacific-type orogeny had formed a part of British Isles.",

Most nonstationary studies proposed the nonstationary general extreme value (GEV) and generalized Pareto models for the annual maximum and POT (peak-over-threshold) data, respectively. However, various alternatives is needed to analyze the nonstationary hydrologic data because of the complicated influence of climate change. This study proposed the nonstationary generalized logistic models containing time-dependent location and scale parameters. These models contain only or both nonstationary location and scale parameters that change linearly over time. The parameters are estimated using the method of maximum likelihood based on the Newton-Raphson method. In addition, the proposed models apply to the annual maximum rainfall data of Korea in order to evaluate the applicability of the proposed models.",

            "abstract": "Large river systems are major economic engines that provide national economic wealth in transporting commerce and providing extensive agriculture production, and their coastal deltas are sites of significant ports, energy resources and fisheries. These coupled natural and social systems from the catchment to the coast depend on how national policies manage the river basins that they depend. The fundamental principle of the Mississippi River Basin, as in all basins, is to capitalize on the ability of fertile soil that moves from erosional regions of a large watershed, through downstream regions of the catchment where sediment transport and storage builds extensive floodplains, to the coastal region of deposition where deltas capture sediment and nutrients before exported to the oceans. The fate of soil, and the ability of that soil to do work, supports the goods and services along its path from the catchment to the coast in all large river basin and delta systems. Sediment is the commodity of all large river basin systems that together with the seasonal pulse of floods across the interior of continents provide access to the sea forming the assets that civilization and economic engines have tapped to build national and global wealth. Coastal landscapes represent some of the most altered ecosystems worldwide and often integrate the effects of processes over their entire catchment, requiring systemic solutions to achieve restoration goals from alluvial floodplains upstream to coastal deltaic floodplains downstream. The urgent need for wetland rehabilitation at landscape scales has been initiated through major floodplain reclamation and hydrologic diversions to reconnect the river with wetland processes. But the constraints of sediment delivery and nutrient enrichment represent some critical conflicts in earth surface processes that limit the ability to design ‘self sustaining’ public work projects; particularly with the challenges of accelerated sea level rise. Only through rethinking how we manage the Mississippi River not only to provide for navigation and flood control, but also as the critical source of sediments to stabilize degrading wetlands, will restoration be realized in a 100-year project cycle.",

Aquifer properties cannot be determined from a single borehole and traditional aquifer tests are difficult to design and analyze without prior knowledge of the subsurface permeability distribution. Using passive monitoring of the water level responses to tidal strains in wells allows for characterization of the aquifer over greater spatial extent and can be used to guide the design and implementation of aquifer tests. In this study, the water level response to tidal strains measured in over 20 groundwater wells, spaced irregularly over an approximately 48 km2 area, was used to estimate the specific storage and transmissivity of the surrounding granite aquifer. The water level data were corrected to remove barometric pressure effects before the amplitude and phase shifts for the O1 and M2 components of the tidal potential were calculated. Systematic differences in the calculated aquifer characteristics were observed. The differences correlate with the density of fractures observed in borehole geophysical logs. The aquifer properties derived from the earth-tide analysis were compared to those derived from aquifer tests conducted at two of the wells analyzed. The two methods yielded similar results.",

            "abstract": "Discussion of climate policy has focused almost exclusively on comprehensive regulatory instruments to price emissions with tradeable permits or emissions taxes. More recently, a number of proposals have been advanced to abandon comprehensive emissions pricing in favor of focusing exclusively on clean-energy innovation. Neither approach adequately accounts for the combination of timing and scale. Advocates of emissions pricing are persuasive that this is the most likely way to reduce emissions sufficiently to stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at desirable levels. However, as innovation advocates point out, the political climate is inhospitable to such sweeping regulations and it is unlikely that comprehensive carbon pricing can be enacted and implemented in the next decade. However, clean-energy innovation by itself is a high-stakes gamble that may fail to reduce emissions sufficiently to stabilize GHG concentrations, and may reduce support for the kind of comprehensive pricing measures that could stabilize GHG concentrations.\nWe propose that analysis of climate policies take account of the opportunity costs associated with the process of enacting a proposed policy: If one measure is much more controversial than another, how does the difference in time necessary to persuade the public and legislators to adopt them affect their ultimate impact? As General Patton is reputed to have said, \"A good solution applied with vigor now is better than a perfect solution applied ten minutes later.\" Similarly, it is important to consider whether adopting one measure would build or erode support for complementary ones.\nAs an example, we consider the largely neglected role of nonregulatory measures, such as private governance and household-level behavior change, as examples of actions that could buy time by producing rapid, although modest, impacts without eroding support for more comprehensive measures later on.",

            "abstract": "The Lake El’gygytgyn sediment core (ICDP 5011-1) contains a near-continuous record of diatoms extending to approximately 3.46 Ma, providing a means to evaluate past climate-related lake system changes in this unique terrestrial Arctic paleoclimate archive. Systematic down-core diatom counts at an average 4-kyr resolution and SEM observations of dominant planktonic taxa from selected intervals are presented here for the first time. During the Pleistocene, the record is characterized by repeated declines in plankton abundance coinciding with a shift in dominant planktonic genus or species. These events correspond to cold intervals inferred from other proxies, implying a mechanism such as severe ice and snow conditions on the lake leading to an extended decline in the plankton. In contrast, during the Pliocene portion of the record, although similar or longer declines in the plankton abundance occur, the plankton has a more stable character, dominated by previously undescribed species of the genus Pliocaenicus. The most significant change occurs after a plankton decline with sustained periphytic diatoms from approximately 2.93-2.80 Ma, when a species with a rimoportula and distinct alveolae is replaced by a species with relatively flat valves with such structures absent or too insignificant to observe in SEM. This zone does not correspond to a particular cold event, as identified by other proxy records, but corresponds to a consistent warm interval with low insolation variability. Thus, diatoms and diatom-related proxies may be recording different lake-system responses to climate during different portions of the lake’s history. Higher resolution analyses of these events will help to characterize the lake system changes occurring during climate events unfavorable for planktonic diatoms.",

            "abstract": "Olivine-rich troctolites from Krivaja-Konjuh massif in the Dinarides (Bosnia and Herzegovina) represent a unique natural laboratory to study melt segregation and retention in originally fertile rift-related mantle rocks. Petrographic and chemical analyses of coexisting minerals (olivine and interstitial clinopyroxene, spinel and plagioclase) show that olivine and spinel are of mantle origin, and interstitial clinopyroxene and plagioclase are products of crystallization of trapped melt. Geochemical and microstructural observations (dissolution of pyroxene) indicate that this trapped melt started off at larger depth and that it was silica undersaturated when it reached the plagioclase stability field. The original mantle olivine remained and texturally equilibrated with the melt, which is evident from the high Ni content and euhedral crystal habit in thin sections. This suggests that the melt that crystallized the interstitial phases, clinopyroxene and plagioclase, was saturated in olivine and probably similar to MORB-type melt. The interstitial phases show no sign of deformation. A mantle origin of olivine is corroborated by EBSD data that show a progressive misorientation across individual olivine grains due to previous episodes of deformation within the mantle. By contrast, grains originating from cumulate crystallization should show little internal deformation. Therefore we suggest that olivine-rich troctolites are not crystallization products, but rather products of reaction of melt with the lherzolitic mantle. The evidence of trapped melt in those rocks provides a new insight into the crust-mantle transition at slow spreading ridges and continental rifts where olivine-rich troctolites have been observed.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution, shallow-seismic reflection using sparker seismic source is one of the most popular offshore exploration methods for imaging sub-surface structures in near shore region. In the present study, high-resolution shallow-seismic reflection data were acquired using 300 Joule sparker energy source with multi-electrode spark array and single-channel streamer containing 16-hydrophones at a boat speed of about 4 knot. The data were recorded in SEG-Y format with record length of 500 ms, sampled at 40 µs. The problems in sparker seismic data are artefacts which primarily include (i) short-path multiples, (ii) long-path multiples, (iii) ghost reflections, (iv) secondary bubble effect, and (v) incoherent noise.\nShort-path multiples, produced by reflectors at seabed/sub-seabed and sea surface, arrive at receiver immediately after the primary reflection, whereas, long-path multiples arrive later as a distinct event. Ghost reflections due to source and receiver arrangement below sea-surface produce a seismic wavelet, delay in time and reverse in polarity with respect to primary. Secondary bubbles (bubble effect) produced destructive interference that strongly attenuated amplitude of the signal, and produced frequency notching as demonstrated in power spectrum of raw seismic data. Incoherent noise present in seismic reflection data reduce the quality of the signal and can often lead to misinterpretation. Processing and analysis of seismic trace of the present study reveal that the artefact related to ghost reflections are not present in the data. However, short-path and long-paths multiples, secondary bubble effect and incoherent noise severely affected the quality of the seismic data.\nThis paper presents and discusses processing of high-resolution, single-channel seismic reflection data acquired between water depth 10 and 70 meter in near shore region of central-west coast of India. Our results show that quality of the processed data is highly improved and yield artefact free interpretable seismic sections. Based on the processed seismic data, several sub-surface features such as gas charged sediments, incised V-shaped valley, and late-Pleistocene to Holocene sedimentary strata are identified.",

            "abstract": "Spectrometers provide our most detailed diagnostics of the solar coronal plasma, and spectral data is routinely used to measure the temperature, density, and flow velocity of coronal features. However, spectrographs suffer from a limited instantaneous field-of-view (FOV). Imaging instruments can provide a large FOV but offer only very limited spectral resolution. In this work, we present an instrument concept that combines the strengths of these two instrument classes, i.e., a large FOV and high spectral resolution.\nOur approach is based on computational imaging, which involves distributing the spectral imaging task between a physical and a computational system, and then digitally forming images of interest from multiplexed measurements by means of solving an inverse problem. In particular, a nonscanning spectral imaging technique is developed to enable performing spectroscopy over a two-dimensional instantaneous field-of-view. This technique combines a parametric estimation approach with a slitless spectrometer configuration. The associated inverse problem, which can be viewed as a multiframe image deblurring problem, is formulated in a Bayesian estimation framework and computationally efficient algorithms are designed to solve the resulting nonlinear optimization problems. Furthermore, statistical bounds are obtained to characterize the estimation uncertainties and performance limits, and to explore the optimized system design for specific observing requirements. We illustrate that such an instrument concept will facilitate the investigation of highly dynamic solar phenomena such as flares, CMEs, and transient brightening, with a significant reduction in hardware cost and complexity, but at an accuracy comparable with conventional designs.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the Colorado River basin (CRb), scientists and river managers collaborate to improve native ecosystems. Native ecosystems have deteriorated due to construction of dams and diversions that alter natural flow, sediment supply, and temperature regimes, trans-basin diversions that extract large amounts of water from some segments of the channel network, and invasion of non-native animals and plants. These scientist/manager collaborations occur in large, multi-stakeholder, adaptive management programs that include the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program, the Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program, and the Upper Colorado River Endangered Species Recovery Program. Although a fundamental premise of native species recovery is that restoration of predam flow regimes inevitably leads to native species recovery, such is not the case in many parts of the CRb. For example, populations of the endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha) are largest in the sediment deficit, thermally altered conditions of the Colorado River downstream from Glen Canyon Dam, but these species occur in much smaller numbers in the upper CRb even though the flow regime, sediment supply, and sediment mass balance are less perturbed. Similar contrasts in the physical and biological response of restoration of predam flow regimes occurs in floodplains dominated by nonnative tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) where reestablishment of floods has the potential to exacerbate vertical accretion processes that disconnect the floodplain from the modern flow regime. A significant challenge in restoring segments of the CRb is to describe this paradox of physical and biological response to reestablishment of pre-dam flow regimes, and to clearly identify objectives of environmentally oriented river management. In many cases, understanding the nature of the perturbation to sediment mass balance caused by dams and diversions and understanding the constraints imposed by societal commitments to provide assured water supplies and hydroelectricity constrains the opportunities for rehabilitation and limits the management objectives to focus either on restoring predam physical processes or recovering native fish fauna and/or recovering native plant communities.",

            "abstract": "Water is commonly the primary limiting factor for tree growth in semi-arid regions of the Western U.S. and tree productivity can vary drastically across landscapes as a function of water availability. The role of topography as a first order control on soil and ground water has been well studied; however, the strategies trees use to cope with water limitation in different landscape positions and across time remain unclear. As growing seasons progress, the availability of water changes temporally, as water inputs transition from snowmelt to rainfall, and spatially, as divergent positions dry more than convergent ones. We seek to understand how the interaction of these processes dictate where trees access water and which strategies most successfully avert water limitation of growth. We take advantage of clear differences in the isotopic signatures of snow and summer rain to track water utilized by Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine, Subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and Western larch in both convergent and divergent landscape positions and across time. We couple these data with evidence of growth limitation inferred from reductions in lateral growth rates observed by continuous dendrometer measurements to link tree water use and productivity. Xylem waters reflect both the precipitation type and soil profile distribution of water used by trees for growth and dendrometer measurements reflect the effects of water limitation through changes in the lateral growth curve as soil moistures decline. Isotope signatures from rain, snow and stream water fell predictably along the local meteoric water line with values from xylem samples falling between those of rain and snow. Trees on southern aspects exhibit more growth limitation in divergent than convergent positions while this effect appears muted or non-existent on northern aspects. Trees in convergent hollow positions rely more on snow water while trees on slopes utilize more rain water. Surprisingly, trees at lower elevation rely more on snow water than trees at higher elevation, suggesting that trees in drier, low elevation sites are accessing deeper, older water from snowmelt throughout the growing season. Our research suggests previously under-recognized topographic and hydrologic modulation of tree growth at surprisingly small spatial and temporal scales.",

            "abstract": "Forested landscapes are ecologically and economically important, and understanding their dynamics is important for land--management decision making. Forest ecosystems are also under stress, and may be changing due to interannual variability and long term change in climate, natural and anthropogenic disturbance, including human use and management. Detecting and tracking shifts in vegetation is important for land--management, conservation planning, monitoring recovery, managing and monitoring forest structure and composition, maintaining species and habitat diversity and many other purposes.\nWe used MODIS NDVI to create phenological ecoregions, or \"phenoregions\" having similar annual phenology using a unsupervised clustering method over the period 2000--2012. These statistically derived phenoregions were reclassified to National Land Cover Database (NLCD) classes using the \"Mapcurves\" algorithm. Interannual transitions in phenologically defined classes are indicator of disturbance and recovery. Because the area within the CONUS is fixed, land cover area changes are a zero-sum game. Changes in one land cover class must be accompained by compensating changes in other classes.\nWe demonstrate a full-circle national-scale accounting system which can track not only area changes in land cover classes, but can show which other compensatory land cover class area changes accompanied them. Area changes in the vegetation distributions, as well as compensatory gains, losses, and trades in area of other land cover types, were mapped and tracked annually during 2000--2012 period at MODIS resolution. The types or labels of the classes used in the accounting can easily be changed to sets of land cover types that maximize the utility of the tracking. For any particular \"focus\" land cover type, results show which other land covers were donors or recipients of area changes, showing ecologists and land managers alike what vegetation types were given up or gained to offset particular increases or losses.",

Surficial exposure of these units is poor, however, necessitating description and sampling of subsurface stratigraphic records. We have examined drillcore from boreholes in the southern part of the Georgina Basin that penetrate particularly thick accumulations of glaciogenic strata. One of these cores includes, in stratigraphic succession, ~500 meters of laminated diamictite, an overlying 150 meters of coarse-grained sandstone and conglomerate, and an upper 30 meter interval of carbonate that includes conspicuous pink dolostone. C isotope values of the carbonate interval are approximately -1‰ at its base, rise to values around 0‰ within the pink dolostone, then decline to -1 to -2% at the top of the cored interval. While it is currently unclear whether the carbonate is a Neoproterozoic cap or an unconformably overlying Cambrian unit, correlations based on regional seismic and well data suggest that the thick accumulation of diamictite is a well-preserved record of Neoproterozoic glaciation. We have obtained high-resolution visible and shortwave-infrared reflectance spectroscopy data from these cores with a HyLogger instrument. These data permit detailed mineralogical description of the glacial interval at a scale of ~1 cm and comprise a fully digital stratigraphic record.",

Over decadal timescales, this internal variability obscures the long-term sea-level change, making it difficult to assess the effect of anthropogenic warming on sea level. Here, an attempt is made to uncover the sea-level rise pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean associated with anthropogenic warming. More specifically, the sea-level variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is estimated and removed from the regional sea-level trends computed from satellite altimetry measurements over the past two decades. The resulting pattern of regional sea-level rise uncovered in the tropical Pacific Ocean is explained in part by warming in the tropical Indian Ocean, which has been attributed to anthropogenic warming. This study represents one of the first attempts at linking the sea-level trend pattern observed by satellite altimetry to anthropogenic forcing. ",

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), approximately 480,000 km of rivers/streams are contaminated in the U.S., and a major cause of contamination is elevated levels of pathogen/pathogen indicator. Many of past studies showed considerably higher pathogen levels in sediment bed than that of the stream water column in rivers. In order to improve the understanding of pathogen levels in rivers in California, we carried out an extensive pathogen monitoring study in four different watersheds (Bear Creek, Ingalsbe, Maxwell, and Yosemite watersheds) of Merced River. Stream water and streambed sediment samples were collected from 17 locations. Pathogen levels (E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes) were enumerated in streambed sediment and water column. In addition, the impacts of heat stress on pathogen survival were assessed by inoculating pathogens into the water and sediment samples for understanding the pathogen survival in stream water column and streambed sediment. The pathogen enumeration (in water column and sediment bed) results indicated that the E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes levels were non-detectable in the water column and streambed sediment. The results of heat stress (50◦ C for 180 minutes) test indicated a pathogen decay at one order of magnitude (108 cfu/ml to 107 cfu/ml). Nonetheless, higher pathogen levels (1.13 × 107 cfu/ml) after the heat stress study showed potential pathogen survival at higher temperature. Preliminary results of this study would help in understanding the impacts of elevated temperature on pathogen in stream environment. Further studies are required to test the long-term heat-stress impacts on pathogen survival.",

            "abstract": "This talk presents results of sensitivity tests on the effects of horizontal diffusion on simulated hurricane intensity and structure using idealized Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) simulations. In the sensitivity experiments, simulations were run using different horizontal mixing length (Lh) ranging from 0 to ~5000 m while keeping the vertical diffusion coefficient and other physical parameterizations unchanged as in the operational HWRF model. The results show that the simulated intensity is sensitive to Lh used in the parameterization of horizontal turbulent fluxes, in particular for Lh<2000m. The sensitivity experiments also demonstrate that the simulated storm structures such as the size of the storm, the kinematic boundary layer height, and eyewall slope are sensitive to Lh. But Lh has little impact on the magnitude of surface inflow angle and thermodynamic mixed layer height. Consistent with previous studies, the results indicate that the main effect of horizontal diffusion is to reduce the radial gradient of the important dynamical and thermodynamical parameters. When Lh is larger, the radial gradient of angular momentum is smaller both within and above the boundary layer, which leads to a weaker hurricane vortex.",

            "abstract": "The rates and distribution of active shortening throughout the Himalayan foreland have been the subject of intense study for the past several decades. Despite substantial progress, the distribution of slip on specific faults remains poorly understood. Numerous studies suggest that fluvial systems developed above growing folds exhibit strong correlations with uplift rate. Here, we build on these studies to develop a quantitative, empirical calibration of the scaling between channel steepness index (ksn – a measure of channel gradient normalized for drainage area) and uplift rate; we derive a geometric model of uplift rate using data of Lavé and Avouac (2000) and analyze channel profiles using a 30m DEM derived from SRTM data. Our analysis confirms a linear relationship between uplift rate and ksn; we apply this calibration to regions of similar lithology along the Baisahi anticline in western Nepal. Here, channel profiles exhibit smooth profiles with similar concavity, consistent with spatially uniform uplift rates above a planar ramp in the Main Frontal Thrust fault (Mugnier et al., 1999). Channel steepness indices along the western anticline are invariant with position along the anticline, suggesting a uniform uplift rate of 9 mm/yr ± 2 mm/yr. Along the eastern portion of the anticline, steepness indices increase systematically from west to east, suggesting that uplift rates increase toward the east. However, structural data suggest that this reflects an increase in the dip of the fault at depth (Husson and Mugnier, 2003). Our analysis suggests that the Baisahi anticline absorbs 17.5 mm/yr ± 4 mm/yr of active shortening. Our results demonstrate how local calibration of channel profile adjustment to uplift rate can be used to place constraints on active deformation in regions where other geomorphic markers are sparse or absent.",

The course is offered through Smart Sparrow's intelligent tutoring system, which records student answers, time on question, simulation setups, and additional data that we refer to as \"analytics\". As the development of the course has stabilized, we have been able to devote more time to analyzing these data, extracting patterns of student behavior and how they have changed as the course has developed.\nDuring the most recent two semesters, pre- and post-tests of content knowledge related to the greenhouse effect were administered to assess changes in students' knowledge. The results of the Fall 2013 content assessment and an analysis of each step of every activity using the course platform analytics were used to identify problematic concepts and lesson elements, which were redesigned for the following semester. We observed a statistically significant improvement from pre to post instruction in Spring 2014. Preliminary results seem to indicate that several interactive activities, which replaced written/spoken content, contributed to this positive outcome. Our study demonstrates the benefit of deep analytics for thorough analysis of student results and quick iteration, allowing for significantly improved exercises to be redeployed quickly.\nThe misconceptions that students have and retain depend on the individual student, although certain patterns do emerge in the class as a whole. These patterns can be seen in student discussion board behavior, the types of answers they submit, and the patterns of mistakes they make. By interrogating this wealth of data, we seek to identify the patterns that outstanding, struggling, and failing students display and how early in the class these patterns can be detected. If these patterns can be identified and detected early in the semester, instructors can intervene earlier, prodding unmotivated students while devoting significant attention to students who struggle yet remain interested in the subject matter. This offers a marked improvement over the more common practice of waiting (often futilely) for students to seek help.",

Using source location and plasma temperature as adjustable parameters, we then step through the parameter space, building up an index of outer-bound estimates of the location for modulation to compare with various observed auroral pulsation frequencies. Preliminary results suggest that for realistic plasma temperatures these short pulsations are modulated below around 1.5 R_e above the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude and spatial distribution of point and non-point dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs to river systems greatly influences the potential for eutrophication of downstream water bodies. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the predominant point source of N in the northeast US, remove some but not all of human waste N they receive. Excess enters rivers, which may further mitigate N concentrations by dilution and denitrification. WWTP effluent combines with upstream flows, which may include non-point sources of N due to agriculture or urbanization. Natural N removal capacities in rivers may however be overwhelmed and become N saturated, which reduces their effectiveness. As a result, natural and man-made services of N removal are intimately linked at the river network scale for provisions of suitable water quality and aquatic habitat. We assessed the summer N mitigation capacity of rivers relative to N removal in WWTPs in the northeastern U.S. using a N removal model developed within the Framework for Aquatic Modeling in the Earth System (FrAMES). The spatially distributed river network model predicts average daily dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations at a 3-minute river grid resolution, accounting for the mixing of natural areas, nonpoint sources, WWTP effluent, and instream denitrification, which is simulated as a function of river temperature, water residence time, and biogeochemical activity. Model validation was done using N concentration data from 750 USGS gauges across the northeast during the period 2000-2010. Confidence intervals (90%) are estimated for river N concentrations based on key uncertainties in simulated river width, uptake rates, and N loading rates. Model results suggest WWTPs potentially impact 25,770 km of river length (10.7% of total river length in the northeast) and increase N concentrations an average of 42.3% at the facility locations. The in-stream ecosystem service of N removal accounts for 2.7% of the total cumulative N removed by WWTPs during the summer in the region. Despite providing a relatively small proportion of N removal, the expected deterioration of WWTP infrastructure and associated costs of upgrading existing systems puts the role of this riverine ecosystem service into economic perspective.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important property of Arctic lake ecosystems, originating from allochthonous inputs from catchments and autochthonous production by plankton in the water column. Little is known about the quality of DOM in Arctic lakes that lack substantial inputs from catchments and such lakes are abundant in southwestern Greenland. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), the fraction that absorbs ultraviolet (UV) and visible light, is the controlling factor for the optical properties of many surface waters and as well informs on the quality of DOM. We examined the quality of CDOM in 21 lakes in southwestern Greenland, from the ice sheet to the coast, as part of a larger study examining the role of DOM in regulating microbial communities in these lakes. DOM was size fractioned and absorbance and fluorescence was measured on each size fraction, as well as on bulk DOM. The specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) at 254 nm (SUVA254), computed by normalizing absorption (a254) to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, provided an estimate of the aromatic carbon content of DOM. SUVA values were generally <2, indicating low aromatic content. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of CDOM fluorescence was used to determine the relative abundance of allochthonous and autochthonous DOM in all size fractions. Younger lakes near the ice sheet and lakes near the coast had lower amounts of CDOM and appeared more microbial in quality. However, lakes centrally located between the ice sheet and the coast had the highest CDOM concentrations and exhibited strong humic fluorescence. Overall distinct differences in CDOM quality were observed between lake locations and among DOM size fractions.",

            "abstract": "Paddy fields are one of the most important eco-system in monsoon Asia and one of the largest source of CH4 emission. CH4 has significant contribution to the global warming next to CO2 and its greenhouse effect is about 21 times as large as same amount of CO2. CH4 is generated by decomposition of organic matter in soil under anaerobic condition. Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) is the most suitable index representing soil aerobic condition. Or, CH4 is more generated under lower ORP conditions.\n In this study, ORP in paddy soil was measured during rice cultivated season at a periodically irrigated paddy field, and some effects on the methane flux from the paddy soil was investigated. 3-days flood and 4-days drained condition were regularly repeated at the site from late-June to early October. ORP under flooded condition was measured during irrigated term in 2013 at two mode; regular interval measurement every 2 weeks and intensive measurements during two flooded periods. Methane flux was also measured by the aerodynamic gradient technique.\n ORP showed rapid decrease when irrigation water was introduced in the paddy field, and lower ORP was shown under the longer flooded condition. From the seasonal-term point of view, lower ORP was shown in later rice season. ORP was suitably modeled as a function of irrigation time. During an irrigation period for four days, higher methane emissions were shown under lower OPR conditions as shown in Fig.1. From the seasonal-term point of view, however, no significant relationship between ORP and methane fluxes. Rapid rise of CH4 flux in early August and gradual decrease between late August and September were shown. It is suggested that seasonal change of methane flux is affected by seasonal changes of soil temperature or the growth level of rice plants.",

Most studies on climate change impact assessment focus on either surface water or groundwater resources alone. In this study, we utilize a fully coupled surface water and groundwater model, Penn-State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), and recent climate change projections from Climate Models Inter-comparison Project-5 (CMIP5) to evaluate impacts of near-term climate change on water availability in the Nueces River basin, TX. After performing calibration and validation of PIHM over multiple sites, hindcast simulations will be performed over the 1981-2010 period using data from multiple General Circulation Models (GCMs) obtained from the CMIP5 Project. The results will be compared to the observed data to understand added utility of hindcasts in improving the estimation of surface water and groundwater resources. Finally, we will assess the impacts of climate change on both surface water and groundwater resources over the next 20-30 years, which is a relevant time period for water management decisions.",

            "abstract": "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi-NPP uses a solar diffuser (SD) as on-board radiometric calibrator for the reflective solar band (RSB) calibration. Solar diffuser is made of Spectralon (one type of fluoropolymer) and was chosen because of its controlled reflectance in the VIS-NIR-SWIR region and its near-Lambertian reflectance profile. Spectralon is known to degrade in reflectance at the blue end of the spectrum due to exposure to space radiations such as solar UV radiation and energetic protons. These space radiations can modify the Spectralon surface through breaking C–C and C-F bonds and scissioning or cross linking the polymer, which causes the surface roughness and degrades its reflectance. VIIRS uses a SDSM (Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor) to monitor the change in the Solar Diffuser reflectance in the 0.4 – 0.94 um wavelength range and provide a correction to the calibration constants. The H factor derived from SDSM reveals that reflectance of 0.4 to 0.6um channels of VIIRS degrades faster than the reflectance of longer wavelength RSB channels. A model is developed to derive characteristic parameters such as mean SD surface roughness height and autocovariance length of SD surface roughness from the long term spectral degradation of SD reflectance as monitored by SDSM. These two parameters are trended to assess development of surface roughness of the SD over the operation period of VIIRS.",

            "abstract": "Positive co-variation of organic matter (OM) with iron and aluminum phases has been known for decades in soil and, in case of OM-Fe, in marine sediments. More recent studies point to the metal control on the mean residence time of organic carbon in soils, suggesting that better understanding of the role of these metal phases and the nature of these organo-metal associations would help to improve the models of soil OM dynamics. We developed a selective dissolution approach to assess these associations (Wagai and Mayer, 2007; Wagai et al., 2013). By taking advantage of well-established extraction techniques that were targeted to dissolve specific metal and aluminosilicate phases in soil, we quantified the amounts of OM co-dissolved by the selective dissolution of these inorganic phases. The inherent limitations in this conceptually simple approach include the presence of C-based compounds (often as complexing agent for metal) in the extractants and the lack of selectivity when dissolving specific inorganic phases. The former was resolved by using nitrogen (N), instead of C, as a surrogate for OM because (i) soil N is mostly present as soil OM with relatively narrow C:N ratio, and (ii) the extractants are N free. We were able to partially overcome the lack of selectivity problem by comparing the co-dissolution of OM from a variety of extractants that use reductive, complexation, and acid/alkaline dissolutions. The potential advantages of our approach include the ability (i) to estimate the contribution of specific inorganic phases to OM stabilization, and (ii) to infer the possible modes of the organo-mineral associations that were extracted from field soils (e.g., adsorptive association vs. coprecipitation of organo-metallic complexes). In this presentation, we will further consider the advantages and limitations of this approach (e.g., methodological cautions), present some of the previous and new findings gained from this approach (including its application to sediments and soil physical fractions), and discuss possible roles of the extractable inorganic phases in OM stabilization.",

            "abstract": "Paleocurrents are significant in predicting heterogeneity in ancient point bar deposits but have been mostly studied from vertical exposures. Changes in channel orientation could be misinterpreted in cross-sectional studies. In this study, we combined closely spaced paleocurrent and grain size data, collected in field, with airborne LiDAR survey (Light Detection and Ranging) to evaluate the paleocurrent geometry in ancient point bar deposits in Cretaceous Ferron Sandstone near Hanksville, Utah. In LiDAR hillshade images, derived from LiDAR digital terrain models, numerous crescent shaped sandstone ridges, dominated by unidirectional paleocurrents, are interpreted as scroll bars. Migration patterns of these scroll bars and their cross-cutting relationships have been interpreted from their distribution in plan view as seen in the hillshade images. Paleocurrent directions, measured in the field, closely follow the shape of these scroll bars. Planview grain size distribution shows a coarsening trend toward the bend apex on an individual point bar. However, on the whole channel bend scale this trend is less prominent. Two sets of cross cutting scroll bars, with different orientations, have been identified in the field area. Paleoflow directions are perpendicular in these scroll bars. A significant change in grain size has been observed at the edge, indicating where the younger scroll bars cut into the older one. These two set of scroll bars are identified as two channel belts built by migration of the bars. However, lack of vertical exposures in the field area limits our understanding of the complete three dimensional geometry, paleohydraulics and the temporal evolution of the channel. Future work will involve integration of our current data set with GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) which will allow reconstruction of the three dimensional architecture of this deposit.",

Geodetic data document that slow slip accompanies tremor in the Cascadia and other subduction zones,however there has not been an observation of deformation associated with the observed tremor in a transform fault setting such as the SAF, despite the ubiquitous presence of tremor and LFEs. The signal is likely too small to be detectable by GPS, and previous studies attempting to use borehole strainmeters in Parkfield have failed to detect any observable strain associated with tremor swarms triggered by passing surface waves and place an upper limit on the surface strain of 5 nanometers [Smith 2009]. We explore/examine strain records associated with newly identified large tremor swarms that are in inferred to be slow slip events with moment magnitudes exceeding 5. These slow slip events have durations of approximately 10 days, and the deformation is far below the detection level of GPS. In this study we utilize data from long-baseline laser strainmeters (LSM) which are particularly well suited to observe these signals, in order to place lower and upper bounds on the deformation associated with the slow-slip events. Preliminary results suggest that average surface strains associated with these events are on the order of ~1 nanometer. ",

At Site U1438, 67 IW samples were collected within a ~950 m section of volcaniclastic sediments. These were analyzed for pH as well as major and trace elements. The corresponding host sediments were mineralogically characterized by XRD and petrographic observations. Three alteration zones are inferred: 1) the upper alteration zone (~0-300 mbsf) characterized by maximum IW concentrations of Si (790.1 μM), Sr (138.5 μM) and Mn (279.5 μM), consistent with volcanic glass and siliceous microfossil dissolution, enhanced reduction of Mn oxides, and carbonate recrystallization. Maximum concentrations in Li and B coupled with the lowest pH (6.7) imply that Li and B are released into the IW due to silicate dissolution and clay desorption. 2) At intermediate depths (~300 to ~550 mbsf) Mg, K, Sr, Si, Mn, Li, and B are at concentration minima, possibly due to growth of authigenic minerals. B and Li minimum concentrations occur at high pH (~9) suggesting that these elements are preferentially removed from high pH waters during the precipitation of clay mineral and zeolite cements in primary and secondary (dissolution) pores. The mineralogy of these phases is confirmed by XRD data, and their pore-filling nature is seen in thin sections of the coarser lithologies. 3) The deep alteration zone (>~550m) is characterized by an increase in B, Li, Sr and Ca. At ~650 mbsf, Ca becomes the dominant cation in solution consistent with either mineral interaction with the IW, or diffusive input from underlying igneous basement (~1400 mbsf).",

            "abstract": "The Central Andes Volcanic Zone (CVZ, 14°-28°S) is one of three distinct arc segments the Nazca-South America subduction system. In comparison to the Northern and Southern segments, the CVZ contains approximately 40% of volcanoes active during the Holocene, but less than 20% of documented eruptions. It is therefore surprising that synoptic geodetic observations since 1992 have so far revealed half of the 20 known uplifting volcanoes in the Andes are in the CVZ. Furthermore, an especially high concentration of Miocene ignimbrite deposits (> 10,000 km^3) suggests that in the past large volumes of eruptible magma traversed the crust in this region. We utilize geodetic modeling to address the following questions: What are physically plausible depths, geometries, volumes, and transport mechanisms of intrusions? What are the conditions for plutonism versus volcanism in the CVZ?\nOur modeling efforts are focused on two of the spatially largest (>2,000 km^2) volcanic uplift events observed globally (Lazufre and Uturuncu). We present a synthesis of InSAR, continuous GPS, and campaign GPS (collected from a small network of sites around Lazurfre in Nov. 2011 and March 2014). New InSAR processing of Envisat ScanSAR (09/2003 - 11/2009), ALOS (02/2007 - 02/2011), and TSX (04/2008 - 07/2014) confirm continued Lazufre uplift rates of approximately 3 cm/yr. Neither TSX data (06/2012 – 07/2014), nor two continuous GPS sites on and around Uturuncu show evidence of continued 1 cm/yr vertical motion since the sites were installed in April 2010.\nAnalytic elastic models of uplift suggest intrusions accumulate in reservoirs in the mid-to-upper crust at both volcanic centers. However, peripheral subsidence at Uturuncu and observations of an extensive low velocity zone motivate the exploration of alternative realistic models that consider the influence of a feeder reservoir in the lower crust and heterogeneous crustal structure. The dual-reservoir model provides a first-order estimate of magma ascent rates, but there is a tradeoff with crustal rheology. Finite element forward models and inverse models with FEM-generated Green’s functions demonstrate that both reservoir separation distance and seismically-defined heterogeneity are significant and effect components of surface displacement disproportionately.",

            "abstract": "The variations in the first-flowering date (FFD) of peach (Prunus persica) and pear (Pyrus pyrifolia) under future climate change in South Korea are investigated using simulations obtained from five models of the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. For the study, daily temperature simulations with Historical (1986-2005), and RCP (2071-2090) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios are statistically downscaled to 50 peach and pear FFD (FFDpeach and FFDpear, respectively) observation sites over South Korea. The number of days transformed to standard temperature (DTS) method is selected as the phenological model and applied to simulations for estimating FFDpeach and FFDpear over South Korea, due to its superior performance on the target plants and region compared to the growing degree days (GDD) and chill days (CD) methods. In the analysis, mean temperatures for early spring (February to April) over South Korea in 2090 under RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios are expected to have increased by 1.9K and 3.3K, respectively. Among the early spring months of February to April, February shows the largest temperature increase of 2.1K and 3.7K for RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The increased temperature during February and March accelerates the plant growth rate and thereby advances FFDpeach by 7.0 and 12.7 days and FFDpear by 6.1 and 10.7 days, respectively. These results imply that the present flowering of peach and pear in the middle of April will have advanced to late March or early April by the end of this century.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was carried out with the support of the Rural Development Administration Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development under Grant Project No. PJ009953, Republic of Korea.",

            "abstract": "The current Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) project provides detailed estimates of energy fluxes and water budget, with currently planned upgrades including improved Land Surface Model (LSM) physics, enhanced global meteorological forcing data sets, more robust soil moisture initialization, updated model specific parameter sets and an advanced snow data assimilation scheme. Because of these advancements made in the GLDAS experiment, the spatio-temporal variability of hydrologic fluxes is expected to be as good as other key land-surface fluxes. Gridded surface runoff from GLDAS experiment provides a unique opportunity to implement flow routing along the network of river system. In this experiment, we add stream flow routing in the GLDAS and investigate the stream flow variability using a computationally expensive cell-to-cell (C2C) routing scheme and a simpler source-to-sink (S2S) routing scheme. Appropriate parameterization of C2C is difficult, but it can use a detailed set of parameters, which provide an opportunity to develop a robust and realistic flow routing. On the other hand, the S2S offers simplified and computationally efficient routing solution but it needs periodic adjustments to its parameters. We will present a comparative analysis of these routing experiments, which may be useful for hydrologic estimations in data scarce regions as well as to establish an operational global stream flow prediction system.",

            "abstract": "Speleothem δ18O can be used as a terrestrial archive of climate variability, offering insight into rapid changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation that impact terrestrial weather patterns [1]. However, separating δ18O ‘amount’, ‘source’, and ‘temperature’ effects is a challenge that requires the use of complementary rainfall proxies, such as trace element (X/Ca) ratios. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios are well understood in continental caves, providing information about wet-vs-dry hydrologic conditions within the epikarst [2], the strength and timing of cave ventilation [3], and evapotranspiration above the cave in arid climates [4]. However, there are few detailed investigations of maritime caves where dripwater X/Ca ratios are impacted by seaspray [5, 6].\nHere we present results from a novel two-year automated dripwater monitoring program in a remote cave on the Island of Niue in the tropical south Pacific. High-resolution cave monitoring traditionally requires frequent site visits; monitoring this remote location required the development of new sampling strategies. The cave was instrumented for micrometeorology, dripwater δ18O and δD, and dripwater chemistry. Because of its maritime location, seaspray represents a significant contribution to karst waters. By using [Cl-] as a conservative tracer for seaspray input, we calculate that seasalt in the modern dripwater accounts for 20% of the Ca and Sr, and up to 85~95% of the Mg and Na, respectively.\nApplying seasalt corrections, we find that increased Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios correlate with enriched dripwater δ18O values, consistent with the amount effect and prior-calcite-precipitation (PCP). This short-term calibration suggests that when rainfall amount is driving speleothem chemistry in this cave, Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios should strongly covary with δ18O, a result we will apply to interpretation of speleothem climate records being generated from Niue.\n[1] Lachniet, (2009) QSR 28, 412-432; [2] Tremaine and Froelich (2013) GCA 121, 522-545; [3] Wong et al.

Founded in 2001 with an emphasis on ocean science, and since expanding to a broader set of environmental sciences, we have advised, coached, and/or trained thousands of researchers of all career stages. Over the years, our primary work has notably shifted from needing to persuade scientists why communication matters to supporting them as they pursue the question of what their communication goals are and how best to achieve them. Since our earliest forays into media promotion, we have evolved with the state of the science communication field. In recent years, we have adapted our approach to one that facilitates dialogue and encourages engagement, helps scientists identify the most relevant people and times to engage, tests our own assumptions, and incorporates relevant social science as possible. In this case study, we will discuss more than a decade of experience in helping scientists find or initiate and engage in meaningful conversations with journalists and policymakers.",

            "abstract": "Cerro Colorado Maar is located at the World Heritage Site, biosphere reserve El Pinacate and Gran Desierto del Altar, at the NNW region of Sonora, Mexico (in El Pinacate Volcanic Field). It is a tuff cone, about 1 km diameter, result of several phreatomagmatic episodes during the late Quaternary. We report paleomagnetic and rock magnetic properties from fusiform volcanic bombs obtained from the borders of Cerro Colorado. This study is based in the thermoremanent magnetization TRM normally acquired by volcanic rocks, which can be used to estimate the emplacement temperature range. We performed the experiments on 20 lithic fragments (10 cm to 20 cm approximately), taking 6-8 paleomagnetic cores from each. Rock magnetic experiments (magnetic susceptibility vs. temperature (k-T), hysteresis curves and FORC analysis, shows that the main magnetic mineral carriers of magnetization are titanomagnetite and titanohematite in different levels of intergrowth. The k-T curves suggest in many cases, only one magnetic phase, but also in other cases a second magnetic phase. Thermal demagnetization was used to demagnetize the specimens in detailed short steps and make a well-defined emplacement temperature determination ranges. We found that temperature emplacement determination range for these two magnetic phases is between 350-450 °C, and 550-580 °C, respectively. These results are consistent with those expected in an eruption of Surtsey type, showing a distinct volcanic activity compared to the other craters from El Pinacate volcanic field.",

            "abstract": "A key limitation to further understand storm induced beach erosion and the development of simple, yet accurate predictive coastal erosion models is the paucity of field scale data collected within a short period of time of an erosion event. Here we will discuss results from a new rapid-response airborne lidar that was tested and flown to collect topographic data of the active dry beach and dune and the subsequent analysis and modeling of the erosion event. Flights were flown daily (weather permitting) pre, during, and post storm over a 6 day period to assess the temporal and spatial evolution of the upper beach during this event.\nObservations of dune erosion were compared against offshore buoy data, as well as calibrated inshore spectral wave model results to further understand the alongshore variation in beach response. Comparison of extreme runup (R2%) with the 5 daily beach surveys indicates that the most severe erosion occurred at alongshore locations where the dune toe (zdune) elevation was the lowest and where R2% > zdune during the peak of the storm.\nThree simple dune erosion models were tested on the data. The Palmsten and Holman (2012) model and a modified version of this model reproduced approximately 60% of the observed alongshore variable dune erosion during the storm. Sensitivity analysis on the impact of alongshore averaging of the topographic input data and the wave forcing as well as the effect of altering the temporal resolution of both the wave and topography updating schemes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "For the past several years we have been using a Picarro G1101-i isotopic mass analyzer to study the behavior of carbon dioxide emanating from active volcanoes. Because of its portability (it weighs about 30 kg), the instrument accompanies us on our field campaigns. Typically, we collect gas samples during the day and analyze them in the evening. The result is near-real-time isotopic measurements of CO2, and we are thus able to plan and adjust our field campaigns according to the results that we obtain on a continual basis. This is the primary advantage of the instrument. The G1101-i requires about 350 watts of power, typically provided by wall current with an uninterruptible power supply between the wall and instrument to deal with power fluctuations and outages. We calibrate the instrument every 2-5 days with a series of four well-characterized gas standards which we bring with us into the field in evacuated glass containers. Calibrations are typically robust and highly linear, with sub per mil precision. We also normally obtain a few samples which we analyze both by the G1101-i and later by mass spectrometry, in order to provide an independent means of checking our accuracy. Standards and samples are typically analyzed at similar CO2 concentrations to minimize any concentration-dependent effects on the isotopic analysis, even though these are generally small to negligible. Our applications so far have been focused at one caldera system and one subduction-related stratovolcano. We have analyzed soil gases at Long Valley caldera, California, to study the interplay of volcanic and tectonic controls upon diffuse CO2 release. We have analyzed CO2 in the the plume of Turrialba volcano, Costa Rica, to identify the volcanic isotopic signal and understand the mixing of the plume with surrounding atmosphere. At both localities, with appropriate dilutions as needed, we have been able to analyze the isotopic signal for CO2 concentrations ranging from atmospheric (400 ppm) to 100 per cent, demonstrating the large flexibility of our measurements. In summary, this approach is highly cost-effective, robust, and accurate for field campaigns at active volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "This research examines the effect El Niño and La Niña have on the climate conditions of 138 ski resorts in western North America. Using ClimateWNA, monthly values for snowfall and degree days < 0°C (a measure of winter season coldness) were generated for the mid-slope elevation of the resorts for the primary ski season months of December, January, February, and March. From this data, composite values were computed by summing the four months analyzed for each of the two variables, with the December value coming from the previous year. Regression analysis was used to see if a relationship exists between the two climate variables and a summed composite of the monthly Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for the same four months. Correlation coefficients were determined by regressing the observations for the time period 1935 to 2012. The correlation coefficients were then mapped using ARCGIS to display possible spatial patterns across the study area. Different map symbols were used to identify whether the correlation coefficient was positive or negative, and whether it fell within four levels of statistical significance: P ≥ 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.0001. Correlation coefficients with probability values equal to P ≥ 0.01 were considered not significant on the map. For the variable degree days < 0°C, resorts located in British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, and coastal south Oregon generally had warmer than usual winters during El Niño events and colder winters when SOI values suggested the occurrence of La Niña. A single resort, Ski Apache in New Mexico showed the opposite trend. Snowfall was found to be higher during La Niña events and lower with El Niño events for a number of resorts above 42° N latitude. Further, the strength of these correlations generally decreased with distance from the coast. Resorts in New Mexico and Arizona generally had more snowfall with El Niño and less snowfall with La Niña.",

            "abstract": "Iron with with 5-10% nickel and a small amount of light element(s) has been suggested to be the major component of the Earth’s core. The lattice preferred orientation of the Fe light element alloy may be responsible for observed seismic VP and VS anisotropies in the inner core. The alloying effects of nickel (a heavier element than iron) and silicon (a potential light element) on sound velocities and EoS parameters of Fe are thus of great importance to establish satisfactorily geophysical and geochemical models of the core. Here we have systematically investigated the density-velocity relation and elastic anisotropies of Fe, Fe-Si and Fe-Ni-Si alloys using combined results from in situ high energy resolution inelastic X-ray scattering (HERIX) (sensitive to VP), nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS) (sensitive to VD and Vs), and X-ray diffraction (including radial X-ray diffraction) measurements in high-pressure diamond anvil cells at various temperatures. Our results also show that the measured density-velocity (ρ-VP, -VD, or -VS) profiles of Fe, Fe-Si and Fe-Ni-Si alloys can be better fitted using an empirical power-law function, instead of a linear approximation, while a visibly temperature effect on the sound velocities is also observed. Fe and Fe-Si and Fe-Ni-Si alloys exhibits similar high-pressure density-velocity behavior via a constant density offset. With comparison to literature results, nickel seems to have less effect on compressional-wave velocity (VP) than on shear-wave velocity (VS), while silicon has a stronger effect on VP than VS. The measured apparent VP anisotropy of hcp-Fe at high pressures is comparable to the inner core VP anisotropy, which might be enhanced by Si substitution. Together with thermoelastic modeling, our results indicate that the Earth’s inner core may contain about twice more light element(s) such as Si than previously thought, together with the presence of 10 at.% Ni, in order to match with the PREM seismic model.",

            "abstract": "Rwanda, a small country with the highest population density in Sub-Saharan Africa, is one of the world’s poorest countries. Although agriculture is the backbone of Rwandan economy, agricultural productivity is extremely low. Over 90 % of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and only 52 % of the total land surface area is arable. Of this land, approximately 165,000 hectares are marshlands, of which only 57 % has been cultivated. Rwandan government has invested in the advancement of agriculture with activities such as irrigation, marshland reclamation, and crop regionalization. In 2001, Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) released the Rural Sector Support Program (RSSP), which aimed at converting marshlands into rice fields at various development sites across the country. The focus of this project was to monitor rice fields in Rwanda utilizing NASA Earth observations such as Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was used to depict the progress of marshland to rice field conversion as it highlights the presence of irrigated rice fields from the surrounding area. Additionally, Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to estimate rice yield at RSSP sites. Various simulations were run to find perfect conditions for cultivating the highest yield for a given farm. Furthermore, soil erosion susceptibility masks were created by combining factors derived from ASTER, MERRA, and ground truth data using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The end results, maps, and tutorials were delivered to the partners and policy makers in Rwanda to help make informed decisions. It can be clearly seen that Earth observations can be successfully used to monitor agricultural and land management practices as a cost effective method that will enable farmers to improve crop yield production and food security.

            "abstract": "A fault’s transition from slow creep to the propagation of an earthquake-generating dynamic rupture is thought to start as a quasi-static slip instability. Here we examine how such an instability develops on a sliding interface whose strength is governed by a slip rate- and state-dependent friction, where the state variable evolves according to the aging law.\nWe find that the development occurs as the attraction of a dynamical system to a fixed point. The fixed points are such that the state of slip and the rate at which velocity diverges (and its spatial distribution) are known. The fixed points are independent of the manner of external forcing and the values of slip rate and state before the onset of instability. For a fault under uniform normal stress and frictional properties, the sole parameter that determines the fixed point (to within a translational invariance) is the ratio of the frictional parameters, a/b (where, for steady-state rate weakening, 0<a/b<1). Below a critical value of a/b, the fixed points are asymptotically stable; however, stability is lost for a/b above that value. Increasing a/b above this critical value leads to a series of Hopf bifurcations. This cascade of bifurcations signals a quasi-periodic route to chaos, implying the existence of a second, larger, critical value of a/b (corresponding to the value at which the third Hopf bifurcation occurs), above which the slip instability may develop in a chaotic fashion. The fixed-point solutions, as well as the critical thresholds concerning their stability, depend on the configuration of slip (e.g., in/anti-plane or mixed-mode slip) and the elastic environment in which the interface is embedded (e.g., a slip surface between elastic half-spaces or one lying below and parallel to a free surface); solving for a fixed point reduces to the solution of an equivalent problem of an equilibrium slip-weakening fracture; and fixed-point stability is determined by linear stability analysis. Solutions of the fixed points and results concerning their stability are found either numerically or in closed form. For comparison, we find numerical solutions of instability development for given initial conditions and forcing. The resulting behaviors of the dynamical system conform precisely to expectations set by the fixed points and the analysis of their stability.",

            "abstract": "Livestock heat stress, especially in regions of the developing world with limited adaptive capacity, has a largely unquantified impact on food supply. Though dominated by ambient air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation all affect heat stress, which can decrease livestock growth, milk production, reproduction rates, and mortality. Indices like the thermal-humidity index (THI) are used to quantify the heat stress experienced from climate variables. Livestock experience differing impacts at different index critical thresholds that are empirically determined and specific to species and breed. This lack of understanding has been highlighted in several studies with a limited knowledge of the critical thresholds of heat stress in native livestock breeds, as well as the current and future impact of heat stress,. As adaptation and mitigation strategies to climate change depend on a solid quantitative foundation, this knowledge gap has limited such efforts. To address the lack of study, we have investigated heat stress impacts in the pastoral system of Sub-Saharan West Africa. We used a stochastic weather generator to quantify both the historic and future variability of heat stress. This approach models temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation, the climate variables controlling heat stress. Incorporating large-scale climate as covariates into this framework provides a better historical fit and allows us to include future CMIP5 GCM projections to examine the climate change impacts on heat stress. Health and production data allow us to examine the influence of this variability on livestock directly, and are considered in conjunction with the confounding impacts of fodder and water access. This understanding provides useful information to decision makers looking to mitigate the impacts of climate change and can provide useful seasonal forecasts of heat stress risk. A comparison of the current and future heat stress conditions based on climate variables for West Africa will be presented, An assessment of current and future risk was obtained by linking climatic heat stress to cattle health and production. Seasonal forecasts of heat stress are also provided by modeling the heat stress climate variables using persistent large-scale climate features.",

            "abstract": "We describe several applications of a phase-resolving, directional nonlinear spectral wave model. The model describes a 2D surface gravity wave field approaching a mildly sloping beach with parallel depth contours at an arbitrary angle accounting for nonlinear, quadratic triad interactions. The model is hyperbolic, with the initial wave spectrum specified in deep water. Complex amplitudes are generated based on the random phase approximation. The numerical implementation includes unidirectional propagation as a special case. In directional mode, it solves the system of equations in the frequency-alongshore wave number space. Recent enhancements of the model include the incorporation of dissipation caused by breaking and propagation over a viscous mud layer and the calculation of wave induced setup. Applications presented include: a JONSWAP spectrum with a cos2s directional distribution, for shore-perpendicular and oblique propagation, a study of the evolution of a single directional triad, and several preliminary comparisons to wave spectra collected at the USACE-FRF in Duck, NC which show encouraging results although further validation with a wider range of beach slopes and wave conditions is needed.",

            "abstract": "Small island states exposed to natural hazards are often in the worst position to absorb the financial impact of natural disasters. In a moment, they can lose a significant portion of their GDP and not have the resiliency to bounce back. Several leaders pushed to build their own resiliency after suffering from four hurricanes in just one year – Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, all swept through the region in 2004 and caused losses in excess of US $4 billion.\nThis push to build their own resiliency resulted in the creation of the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (\"CCRIF\"), a facility providing parametric earthquake and tropical cyclone insurance coverage to 16 Caribbean countries.\nWorking well for the past 7 years, the CCRIF has paid out 8 times for a total of more than US $32 million. This dual protection against earthquake and tropical cyclone has become a well-known success globally.\nHowever, all stakeholders realized that considerable damage in the region is also caused by rainfall and flooding. This consistent realization was felt most recently, in December 2013, when Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and Dominica were ravaged by a torrential rainstorm, leaving several people dead, and causing massive damage to roads, infrastructure buildings and property.\nDue to this additional exposure, the Caribbean sought out ways to further build their own resiliency by requesting coverage for this specific third peril. For the past 2 years, Swiss Re has worked closely with the CCRIF to create an xsr product that can benefit the region now and going forward, as the impacts of climate change are felt.\nExcess rainfall is perhaps the most difficult peril of weather and climate modeling and there exists no scientific consensus on a methodology to underpin excess rainfall coverage. Its nature, prolonged and frequent, causes significant damage to small island states and the costs are only predicted to rise as the population and asset values increase and the climate changes. This product was effectively designed by building on satellite technology to estimate the amount of rainfall, ensuring quick payment to affected countries. The TRMM satellite data was enhanced from a 25 X 25 kilometer basis to a 1 X 1 kilometer basis by Kinanco, a modeling company contracted by the CCRIF.\nIt has been in place since July 2014 for 8 CCRIF member countries.",

Here we used controlled experiments to identify physiological thresholds that control poleward range limits of three species of mangroves found in North America. We found that all three species exhibited a threshold response to extreme cold, but freeze tolerance thresholds varied among species. From these experiments we developed a climate metric, freeze degree days (FDD), which incorporates both the intensity and frequency of freezes. When included in distribution models, FDD was a better predictor of mangrove presence/absence than other temperature-based metrics. Using 27 years of satellite imagery, we linked FDD to past changes in mangrove abundance in Florida, further supporting the relevance of FDD. We then used downscaled climate projections of FDD to project poleward migration of these range limits over the next 50 years.",

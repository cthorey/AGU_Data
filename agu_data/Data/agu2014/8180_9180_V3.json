            "abstract": "Plant leaf waxes are well known biomarkers for terrestrial vegetation. Generally, their hydrogen isotopic composition (D/H) records the isotopic composition of precipitation, modulated by leaf water processes and a large biosynthetic fractionation. In addition, the D/H of methoxyl groups on tree wood lignin is an emerging technique thought to record the D/H of source waters, without leaf water complications. Using each of these biomarkers as proxies requires understanding D/H fractionations in plant systems, but few studies have directly studied hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry in tropical plants. An approach that has proven helpful is the paired analysis of plant waters and plant biomarkers: in order that fractionations can be directly computed rather than assumed. This presents logistical challenges in remote tropical forest environments. We report on a unique dataset collected by tree-climbers from 6 well-studied vegetation plots across a 4km elevation transect in the Peruvian Andes and Amazonia. We have measured the D/H of stem water and leaf water, and we compare these to precipitation isotopes and stream waters. The goal of the plant water studies is to understand plant water uptake and stem-leaf water isotopic offsets which can vary due to both transpiration and foliar uptake of water in tropical montane forests. We are in the process of measuring the D/H of plant biomarkers (n-alkanoic acids, n-alkanes and lignin methoxyl) in order to assess how these water isotopic signals are encoded in plant biomarkers. We compare the species-specific modern plant insights to the plant leaf wax n-alkanoic acid D/H that we have recently reported from soils and river sediments from the same region, in order to understand how signals of plant biogeochemistry are integrated into geological sedimentary archives. Progress and open questions in tropical isotope biogeochemistry will be discussed at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Geologic, geochemical, and geophysical data from both volcanic and deep plutonic materials point to magmatic mushes as a long-term physical state for these systems. Samples from both settings indicate magma mixing commonly occurs, despite apparently high crystallinity and high viscosity melts. Previously proposed mechanisms for mush unlocking cannot recover the diversity of expressions of open system behavior observed at the crystal or meso-scale. Using discrete element simulations containing up to millions of crystals, we observed visco-elastic behavior within the mush. This indicates magma mushes could fail initially as a Mohr-Coulomb material during open system events. We call the failure planes soft faults, delimiting a volume that is subsequently unlocked. In addition we recover the diversity of mixing styles occurring simultaneously: porous media flow, crystal entrainment, new melt mixing with crystal free reservoir melt, etc.\nSpecifically, the open-system models show melt injection rate strongly determines the dynamic response of the mush. We compare injection rates with the minimum fluidization velocity (Umf), the lowest magma injection rate calculated to fluidize a bed of packed crystals. When injection rates are below or near Umf, melt passes through the bed as porous flow and the mush remains locked. Rates higher than Umf create soft faults within the crystal mush, which then bound a fluidized region of crystals we call the mixing bowl. A nearly crystal-free chimney of new melt within the mixing bowl continually entrains crystals, bringing them from the base to the top of the crystal pile. This leads to recurring overturn of the crystals, even at low Reynolds number conditions. We use the Lacey statistical mixing index to quantify the amount of mixing that occurs between particles. Results show the extent of crystal mixing can be predicted by the injection rate of the melt entering into the mush.",

            "abstract": "Surface albedo is one of the climate essential variables, which characterize the surface reflectivity of downward shortwave radiation. For several decades, long-term time series datasets of multiple global land surface albedo products have been generated from satellite observations. These datasets have been used as one of the key variables in climate change studies. This study aims to assess the surface albedo climatology and to analyze long-term albedo changes, from eight satellite-based datasets for the past three decades on a global basis. Our results show that climatological surface albedo datasets derived from satellite observations can reach a good agreement in general and thus can be used to validate, calibrate, and further improve surface albedo simulations and parameterizations in current climate models. However, the albedo products derived from the some coarse resolution datasets have large seasonal biases. Difference in winter zonal albedo at high latitudes can reach 0.4 among the eight satellite datasets. Satellite-based albedo datasets agree relatively well during the summer at high latitudes in both hemispheres. The fine-resolution datasets agree well with each other for all the land cover types in mid- to low latitudes; however, large spread was identified for their albedos at mid- to high latitudes over land covers with mixed snow and sparse vegetation. By analyzing the time series of satellite-based albedo products over the past three decades, albedo of the Northern Hemisphere was found to be decreasing in July, likely due to the shrinking snow cover. Meanwhile, albedo in January was found to be increasing, likely because of the expansion of snow cover in northern winter. However, to improve the albedo estimation at high latitudes, and ultimately the climate models used for long-term climate change studies, a still better understanding of differences between satellite-based albedo datasets is required.",

            "abstract": "This research presents an analysis to estimate water availability and water supply for current and future water management policies in the Apurimac River Basin (ARB), in Peru. The objective of this research is to build a coupled hydrologic and water planning model to simulate the water availability and water supply in the ARB. This model is used to evaluate the average (synthetic) and historic conditions to test current and future water demands that include the construction of a reservoir. The hydrologic model is a two bucket model, where the processes of direct runoff, interflow and baseflow are represented in the top bucket and the process of groundwater storage is represented in the bottom bucket. The water planning model is a routing model that calculates the water balance between water supply, water demand and change in storage throughout the basin. The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) platform is used in this research. Model inputs are climate data (precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity) and land use data (land use cover and crop coefficients). Streamflow at different control points and water budgets for all the sub-basin have been calculated to calibrate the model. A sensitivity analysis for the input data was performed to identify parameters that affect the most the water budget for each sub-basin. Precipitation is the most sensitive input data and root zone conductivity is the most sensitive parameter in the model. This research explains the implications of these conditions, and their impact in the analysis of the water availability and water supply for current and future water demands in the ARB.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of Late Tertiary/Quaternary climate and environmental history in East Africa has, to date, largely been based on outcrop and marine drill core records. Although these records have proven extremely valuable both in reconstructing environmental change and placing human evolution in an environmental context, their quality is limited by resolution, continuity, uncertainties about superposition and outcrop weathering. To address this problem, long drill core records from extant ancient lakes and lake beds are being collected by several research groups. Long cores (up to 100s of m.) from basin depocenters in both the western and eastern rifts are now available spanning nearly the entire latitudinal range of the East Africa Rift. This network of core records, especially when coupled with outcrop data, is providing an opportunity to compare the nature of important global climate transitions (especially glacial/interglacial events and precessional cycles) across the continent, thereby documenting regional heterogeneity in African climate history. Understanding this heterogeneity is critical for realistically evaluating competing hypotheses of environmental forcing of human evolution, and especially ideas about the dispersal of anatomically modern humans out of Africa in the early Late Pleistocene. In particular, understanding the hydrological and paleoecological history of biogeographic corridors linking eastern Africa, the Nile River Valley and the Levant is likely to be vastly improved through comparative analysis of these new drill cores over the next few years. Because we do not a priori know the primary forcing factors affecting this environmental history, it will essential to develop the best possible age models, employing multiple and novel geochronometric tools to make these comparisons.",

            "abstract": "Site preference (SP), the difference in δ15N between the central (α) and outer (β) N atoms in N2O, has emerged as a conservative tracer of microbial N2O production. The key advantages of SP relative to bulk isotopes are (1) that it is independent of the isotope composition of the substrates of nitrification and denitrification and (2) has not been shown to exhibit fractionation during production. In pure microbial culture distinct SP values for N2O production from bacterial denitrification, including nitrifier-denitrification (-10 to 0 ‰), relative to hydroxylamine oxidation and fungal denitrification (33-37 ‰) provide a promising basis to resolve production pathways. In this study, we determined the δ15N, δ18O, δ15Nα, and δ15Nβ of N2O generated by purified fungal (P450nor) and bacterial nitric oxide reductases. The isotope values were used to calculate SP values, enrichment factors (e), and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Both O and Nα displayed normal isotope effects during enzymatic NO reduction by the P450nor with e values of -25.7‰ (KIE = 1.0264) and -12.6‰ (KIE = 1.0127), respectively. However, bulk nitrogen (average δ15N of Nα and Nβ) and Nβ exhibited inverse isotope effects with e values of 14.0‰ (KIE = 0.9862) and 36.1‰ (KIE = 0.9651), respectively. The observed inverse isotope effect in δ15Nβ is consistent with reversible binding of the first NO in the P450nor reaction mechanism. Experiments with bacterial nitric oxide reductase are ongoing, however, preliminary data indicates a inverse isotope effect in the α and β positions and a normal isotope effect in δ18O. In contrast to the constant SP observed during N2O production observed in microbial cultures, the SP measured for purified P450nor was not constant, increasing from ~15‰ to ~29‰ during the course of the reaction. Our results clearly indicate that fractionation of SP during N2O production by P450nor is not zero, and that SP values higher and lower than the proposed end member value of 37‰ can be expected during fungal denitrification. The observation in pure microbial culture of constant SP can only be reconciled if the rate of nitrite and NO reduction are the same (thereby maintaining a steady NO concentration in the cell), and, further, that the magnitude of the P450nor NO binding constant (Kd) maintains the extent of the reaction (1-f) at 65%.",

            "abstract": "Effective discharge calculations are based on continuous recordings of daily discharge, cross-sectional stream properties, and measured or calculated sediment transport rates. This study investigates how different flow frequency analysis and varying amounts of collected on-site cross sectional and sediment data impact the final calculated effective discharge. The analysis is carried out for six river stations on the lower Brazos River and four stations on the middle Trinity River in the state of Texas, USA. Data obtained at each site includes mean daily flow discharge, measured suspended sediment concentration over a range of flow conditions, bed sediment samples and cross sectional geometry. Bed load rating curves are developed based on bed sediment samples and the Einstein-Brown formula. The flow frequency analysis is carried out using (1) equal arithmetic intervals with bin numbers of 25, 50 and 100, and (2) the kernel density estimate method. To answer the question of what kind of on-site measured data is essential for calculating the effective discharge, 4 scenarios using different combinations of measured and unmeasured data are defined. At one end of the scenario spectrum, all measured data is used. At the other end, the only on-site data used is the bed material grain size distribution. Results show that if a smoothed sediment load histogram is used, then the effective discharge is not sensitive to the flow frequency analysis method or to the varying levels of on-site data used in the analysis. The outcome of this is that on the Trinity and Brazos rivers, effective discharge can be adequately calculated using only the bed material size information, USGS daily flow data, and the top width of the river obtained from Google Earth. Comparing the calculated effective discharge to other flow metrics showed that the effective discharge on the Trinity is significantly smaller than the bankfull discharge. Effective discharge on the Trinity ranges between 15000 to 21000 cfs with the return period of 1-1.2 years while the bankfull discharge varies between 25000 to 34000 cfs. On the Brazos the effective and bankfull discharges are closer. The analysis also showed that the half-load discharge is independent of the flow frequency analysis and ranges from 13000 to 24000 cfs on the Trinity, and from 21500 to 38000 cfs on the Brazos.",

            "abstract": "Current climate models predict a warming and drying trend that has a high probability of increasing the frequency and spatial extent of tree mortality events. Field surveys can be used to identify, date, and attribute a cause of mortality to specific trees, but monetary and time constraints prevent broad-scale surveys, which are necessary to establish regional or global trends in tree mortality. This is significant because widespread forest mortality will likely lead to radical changes in evapotranspiration and surface albedo, which could compound climate change. While understanding the causes and mechanisms of tree mortality events is crucial, it is equally important to be able to detect and monitor mortality and subsequent changes to the ecosystem at broad spatial- and temporal-scales.\nOver the past five years our ability to remotely detect abrupt forest mortality events has improved greatly, but gradual events—such as those caused by drought or certain types of insects—are still difficult to identify. Moreover, it is virtually impossible to quantify the amount of mortality that has occurred within a mixed pixel. We have developed a system that fuses climate and satellite-derived spectral data to identify both the date and the agent of forest mortality events. This system has been used with Landsat time series data to detect both abrupt and general trends in tree loss that have occurred during the past quarter-century in northern New Mexico. It has also been used with MODIS data to identify pixels with a high likelihood of drought-caused tree mortality in the Southwestern US. These candidate pixels were then fed to ED-FRT, a coupled forest dynamics-radiative transfer model, to generate estimates of drought-induced. We demonstrate a multi-scale approach that can produce results that will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of tree mortality-climate feedbacks, and improve our ability to predict what forests could look like in the future.",

            "abstract": "Rare earth elements (REE’s) are crucial in the manufacture of smartphones and many other high tech devices. Increasing global demand and relatively narrow geographic sourcing have promoted interest in understanding REE deposit genesis and distribution. Highly weathered, clay-hosted, ion-exchange type deposits in southern China are the source of much of the world’s production of the more valuable heavy REEs. Such deposits form as REE-bearing minerals weather and REEs released to solution in ionic form are retained by negatively charged exchange sites on clay minerals. We are investigating the potential for ion-exchange REE deposits in the Piedmont of the southeastern United States, where slow erosion rates have preserved thick (up to 20 m) regolith, as required for such deposits. The Liberty Hill pluton outcrops as coarse-grained biotite-amphibole granite and quartz monzonite over nearly 400 km2 in South Carolina, and has an age of 305 Ma (new SHRIMP ion microprobe zircon age). In weathered profiles over the pluton, ion-exchangeable REE content ranges from 8 to 580 ppm and accounts for 2 to 80% of bulk REE content. Elemental and heavy mineral distributions suggest the wide ranging differences in leachability may be attributable to the amount and distribution of resistant REE-bearing phases (e.g., monazite) relative to more easily weathered phases (e.g., allanite) in the parent granite. The REEs show little mobility within the regolith, indicating the effectiveness of the ion-exchange retention mechanism. In contrast, vertical redistribution of colloidal material shows maximum accumulations at ~1 m depth, as traced by the newly developed dual-phase (colloids vs. solution) mass balance model. The contrast suggests redistributed colloidal material has minimal influence on REE mobilization or retention. Conditions and processes necessary for ion-exchange REE deposit development exist in the Piedmont, but their presence will depend upon favorable parent rock mineralogy.",

Containment of TRU waste at the WIPP is regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The DOE demonstrates compliance with the containment requirements by means of performance assessment (PA) calculations. WIPP PA calculations estimate the probability and consequence of potential radionuclide releases from the repository to the accessible environment for a regulatory period of 10,000 years after facility closure.\nThe long-term performance of the repository is assessed using a suite of sophisticated computational codes. In a broad modernization effort, the DOE has overseen the transfer of these codes to modern hardware and software platforms. Additionally, there is a current effort to establish new performance assessment capabilities through the further development of the PFLOTRAN software, a state-of-the-art massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code. Improvements to the current computational environment will result in greater detail in the final models due to the parallelization afforded by the modern code. Parallelization will allow for relatively faster calculations, as well as a move from a two-dimensional calculation grid to a three-dimensional grid. The result of the modernization effort will be a state-of-the-art subsurface flow and transport capability that will serve WIPP PA into the future.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

In order to make cost effective and efficient decisions, monitoring network in Turkey has been expanding. However, due to time and budget constraints, desired number of monitoring campaigns can not be carried. Hence, in this study, independent parameters that can be measured easily and quickly are used to estimate water quality parameters in Lake Mogan and Eymir using linear regression. Nonpoint sources are one of the major pollutant components in Eymir and Mogan lakes. In this paper, a correlation between easily measurable parameters, DO, temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, precipitation and dependent variables, TN, TP, COD, Chl-a, TSS, Total Coliform is investigated. Simple regression analysis is performed for each season in Eymir and Mogan lakes by using SPSS Statistical program using the water quality data collected between 2006-2012. Regression analysis demonstrated significant linear relationship between measured and simulated concentrations for TN (R2=0.86), TP (R2=0.85), TSS (R2=0.91), Chl-a (R2=0.94), COD (R2=0.99), T. Coliform (R2=0.97) which are the best results in each season for Eymir and Mogan Lakes. The overall results of this study shows that by using easily measurable parameters even in ungauged situation the water quality of lakes can be predicted. Moreover, the outputs obtained from the regression equations can be used as an input for water quality models such as phosphorus budget model which is used to calculate the required reduction in the external phosphorus load to Lake Mogan to meet the water quality standards.",

            "abstract": "Energization of particles to ultra high energies remains a challenging problem in the plasma physics community. One possible mechanism involves chaotic magnetic fields. It is noteworthy that the equations describing the spatial evolution of field lines of a magnetic field having dependence on three spatial coordinates are not integrable and such field lines are chaotic. Such chaotic magnetic fields are ubiquitous in nature including many astrophysical scenarios. The motion of charged particles in such magnetic fields comprise an important topic of study since it has been suggested that they may be energized if the field is time-dependent.\nWe considered a particular chaotic field, which is often called the Sine field, and assumed a simple sinusoidal time dependence. Sine fields were first introduced for chaotic fluid motion in the study of nonlinear dynamos, and it can be shown that such fields are a particular solution of the double curl equation for the magnetic field. We construct the equation of motion of a charged particle in the presence of the time-dependent magnetic field and the induced time dependent electric field using Faraday's Law. These three coupled nonlinear differential equations are solved using the adaptive Dormand-Prince Runge-Kutta method. We calculate the energy of the charged particle and examine the evolution of this energy over time. Our results suggest that the energy of the particle increases indefinitely.",

Sports news excites people, generating conversations at work and at home throughout the duration of the competition. The popularity of these sporting events engages the general public through print and video channels, but it also offers the opportunity for news beyond the competition results - specifically, how science and scientific principles and properties tie in to the sport. Take the Olympics and the World Cup, for example. News sites were more motivated to write and run stories about the aerodynamics of a soccer ball or science behind Olympic bobsleds because these topics are timely: timeliness is one of the most important reasons news stories get written and published. And analysis of even a small sample of news stories and the language used will show why the news organization posted the story. Since the science content is being translated for the general public, the topics can provide a more general explanation of the science behind sporting events, equipment and the act of doing the sport.\n\nBut beyond international sporting events, even the opening day of baseball, first night of ice hockey, the start of football and the beginning of basketball season provide opportunities for news organizations to provide science news to the public. Scientists need to get ready to collaborate with journalists to tap into the next big sporting event - Super Bowl XLIX. Although it has not been determined which teams are playing yet, scientists can start preparing content-rich stories on the physics of a football, the climate of Phoenix, Arizona, and the green mission of the University of Phoenix Stadium (the location of Super Bowl 2015). This is an opportunity for scientists and media outlets to add science content knowledge to the hype of the event. After the Super Bowl comes the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, which has already been in the news with reporters covering water contamination issues and sustainable construction projects.",

            "abstract": "Recent efforts to balance the surface energy budget on global and regional scales using the latest observational datasets result in unrealistically large imbalances between net radiation into the surface and corresponding turbulent heat fluxes, particularly over the global oceans. These imbalances can be traced, in part, to the fact that component fluxes tend to be estimated independently with no explicit reliance on closure constraints. Arguments have been made in favor of reducing downwelling radiation or increasing global precipitation to resolve these imbalances and satisfy constraints imposed by recent ocean heat content measurements. However, since all estimates of the energy fluxes contributing to the global energy balance have associated uncertainties, it is likely that all terms bear some responsibility for the imbalances. This presentation will document new estimates of continental-scale surface energy budgets and their seasonal cycles obtained using a new objective approach for reintroducing energy balance constraints on observational flux datasets. The method adjusts all component fluxes based on their relative uncertainties and provides explicit metrics for assessing the extent to which global and regional energy and water cycles can be simultaneously balanced within assumed error bounds. The behavior of fluxes in land and oceanic regions will be contrasted and regions that require flux adjustments in excess of assumed uncertainties will be identified.",

            "abstract": "We report geodetic evidence for decadal-scale decoupling of the Japan Trench prior to the 2011 M9 Tohoku earthquake, with supporting evidence from repeating earthquakes. We build on the results of Mavrommatis et al. (2014, GRL), where we investigated GPS time series for 15 years before the M9 event, correcting for the copious postseismic deformation following numerous M ~ 6.5+ earthquakes between 2003 and 2011. We modeled interseismic deformation as linear trends plus constant accelerations and corrected for coseismic and postseismic effects of M 6.3+ quakes during the period 1996 to 2011. We find spatially coherent and statistically significant accelerations throughout northern Honshu.\nWhile the accelerations in northern Tohoku can be explained by decaying postseismic deformation following the 1994 M7.7 Sanriku quake, the accelerations in south-central Tohoku cannot be explained simply by postseismic effects. Time series in south-central Tohoku reveal an approximately continuous transient spanning the period 1996 to 2011, without any obvious onset. The transient is consistent with a decrease in the average shear strain rate by ~1/3 in 15 years, and can be explained by increasing average slip rate and/or updip migration of the locked-to-creeping transition depth. MCMC inversions of instantaneous velocities in 1996 and 2011 imply a shallowing of the transition depth by 13.5 +/- 9.5 km and an increase in the average slip rate in the depth range from 22 km to the transition depth by 48.5 +/- 10.5 mm/yr.\nTo test these predictions and to provide additional constraints on the changes in slip rate, we use independent observations of repeating earthquakes during the same period. We find that several sequences of repeaters offshore south-central Tohoku exhibit decreasing recurrence intervals, possibly implying increasing slip rate, while sequences offshore Sanriku exhibit increasing recurrence intervals, consistent with decaying afterslip from the 1994 M7.7 Sanriku event. This along-strike dichotomy is consistent with an inversion of the GPS accelerations and suggests that some change in slip rate in depths shallower than ~60 km is required by the data. Further analysis of the repeating earthquakes will provide additional constraints to discriminate between such models.",

Here we explore two questions: “What constitutes a trend in a time series?” and “How can a trend be misinterpreted?” There are manifold hazards—both methodological and psychological—in detecting a trend, quantifying its magnitude, assessing its significance, identifying probable causes, and evaluating the implications of the trend. These hazards can combine to elevate the risk of misinterpreting the trend. In contrast, evaluation of multiple trends within a biogeophysical framework can attenuate the risk of misinterpretation. We review and illustrate these hazards and demonstrate the efficacy of an approach using multiple indicators detecting significant trends (MIDST) applied to time series of remote sensing data products.",

Field descriptions and end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) of grain-size distributions (GSD) of 13 sediment samples identified six stages of site formation: three stratigraphic units (SU), two unconformities, and a relict Bt soil horizon. EMMA resulted in the characterization of three end-members (EM) that correlate with field descriptions. EM's 1 and 2 represent 88.4% of the total variance among samples and are present within the upper-most stratigraphic unit, SU1, and the lower-most stratigraphic unit, SU3. EM 3 correlates with the poorly developed Bt horizon within the middle stratigraphic unit, SU2. EM 1 is a well-sorted coarse to medium sand interpreted as fluvial deposition. EM 2 is a trimodal deposit of poorly sorted sand, silt, and clay, interpreted as a predominantly aeolian deposition occasionally punctuated by colluvium derived from the colluvial wedge to the east of the Unit and from the brow of the rockshelter. EM 3 is a bimodal distribution of medium sand to fine silts and clays that represent a predominately aeolian deposit overprinted by a Bt horizon. The results of this study demonstrate the applicability of EMMA to distinguish between depositional units within an archaeological context and provide geologically meaningful interpretations of paleoenvironments for the development of hypotheses related to human environmental interactions.",

            "abstract": "Ensemble forecasting of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) provides significant information in that it provides an estimation of the spread or uncertainty in CME arrival time predictions. Real-time ensemble modeling of CME propagation is performed by forecasters at the Space Weather Research Center (SWRC) using the WSA-ENLIL+cone model available at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC). To estimate the effect of uncertainties in determining CME input parameters on arrival time predictions, a distribution of n (routinely n=48) CME input parameter sets are generated using the CCMC Stereo CME Analysis Tool (StereoCAT) which employs geometrical triangulation techniques. These input parameters are used to perform n different simulations yielding an ensemble of solar wind parameters at various locations of interest, including a probability distribution of CME arrival times (for hits), and geomagnetic storm strength (for Earth-directed hits). We present the results of ensemble simulations for a total of 38 CME events in 2013-2014. For 28 of the ensemble runs containing hits, the observed CME arrival was within the range of ensemble arrival time predictions for 14 runs (half). The average arrival time prediction was computed for each of the 28 ensembles predicting hits and using the actual arrival time, an average absolute error of 10.0 hours (RMSE=11.4 hours) was found for all 28 ensembles, which is comparable to current forecasting errors. Some considerations for the accuracy of ensemble CME arrival time predictions include the importance of the initial distribution of CME input parameters, particularly the mean and spread. When the observed arrivals are not within the predicted range, this still allows the ruling out of prediction errors caused by tested CME input parameters. Prediction errors can also arise from ambient model parameters such as the accuracy of the solar wind background, and other limitations. Additionally the ensemble modeling sysem was used to complete a parametric event case study of the sensitivity of the CME arrival time prediction to free parameters for ambient solar wind model and CME. The parameter sensitivity study suggests future directions for the system, such as running ensembles using various magnetogram inputs to the WSA model.",

            "abstract": "Trace element, Sr-Nd isotopes compositions and U-Th-Ra isotopic disequilibria data are presented for Fuji basalts of the last 10,000 yr. Both Sr and Nd isotopes signatures of Fuji basalts show very narrow range (0.703276-0.703363 and 0.51304-0.51306, respectively), indicating that a homogenous mantle source beneath the volcano. All of the Fuji lavas have 238U-230Th disequilibrium with excesses of 238U. These signatures are typical for arc lavas and not MORB and OIB lavas. Samples from individual stages show linear trends having a trajectory cross the equiline at almost the same value at (230Th/232Th) = 0.84. This common line can thus be regarded as isochron age of ~90 kyr, representing the time intervals since the onset of the disequilibrium by metasomatism of the mantle wage by fluids released from the dehydrated subducting slab. However, (226Ra/230Th) activity ratios in Fuji lavas range from ~1 up to 3.2 indicating that less than 8000 yr elapsed since the generation of the disequilibria by metasomatism of the mantle wedge by fluids released from the subducting slab. Ba/Th ratio shows clear positive correlation with (238U/230Th) disequilibrium, however, it shows no correlation with (226Ra/230Th), instead remains constant for the whole range of (226Ra/230Th) disequilibria, indicating that the fluid that carried Ra was not carried Ba. Multiple dehydration events can be the preferred explanation in order to reconcile the U-Th and Ra-Th disequilibria age information. Therefore, dehydration reactions in the slab, some 90 kyr ago, were released fluids and transporting fluid-mobile elements Ra and U into the overlaying mantle wedge. Consequently, Ra and U depleted in the slab. But, 226Ra with time would have been continually formed in the slab by in-growth from the fluid-immobile 230Th that left after the first dehydration episode. As a result, any later fluid addition into the mantle wedge is capable of adding considerable amount of 226Ra but not extra U, so that the U-Th disequilibria recorded the first fluid addition event around 90 kyr.",

            "abstract": "Airborne imaging spectrometers like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) offer valuable insight into the Earth’s terrestrial and ocean ecosystems, mineralogy, and land use. Estimating surface reflectance requires accounting for atmospheric absorption, which is sensitive to the local abundance of water vapor. Analysts typically estimate water vapor concentrations using the depths of absorption features, which can be inaccurate by up to 50% over surface features containing liquid water or ice. This can bias the retrieved water vapor maps and create atmospheric artifacts in reflectance spectra. A new retrieval method offers significant accuracy improvements over plant canopies or ice by estimating the path lengths of all three phases of water simultaneously, adjusting absorptions to best fit the measurement over a broader spectral interval. This paper assesses the remaining sources of error for the three-phase retrieval technique. We analyze retrievals for synthetic data when the 940 and 1140 nm wavelength features are fitted, for initial vapor path estimates ranging from 0 to ±50% accuracy. These tests indicate that most error comes from inaccuracy in the initial path estimate used to obtain vapor absorption coefficients. We evaluate a modified algorithm that uses multiple iterations to refine this estimate. Error is found to approach a constant value, demonstrating improved robustness to initialization conditions. We also assess the new iterative method using corrected AVIRIS data over various environments. The iterative method yields significantly better water vapor maps, reducing spurious correlations between vegetation canopy water and vapor estimates. The new iterative method offers accuracy improvements over traditional Visible/Short Wave Infrared (VSWIR) atmospheric correction methods, at modest computational cost.",

            "abstract": "Variability observed in near-surface soil moisture is a function of spatial and temporal scale and an understanding of the same is required in numerous environmental and hydrological applications. Past literature has focused largely on the Darcy support scale of measurement for generating knowledge about soil moisture variability and the factors causing it. With the advent of a remote sensing era, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of soil moisture variability and the factors creating it at the remote sensing footprint scale. This understanding will facilitate knowledge transfer between scales which remains an area of active research. In this study, we have presented the hierarchy of controls that physical factors namely, soil, vegetation and topography exert on soil moisture distributions from airborne remote sensor footprint scale (~800 m) to a satellite footprint scale (12800 m) across 3 hydro-climates- humid (Iowa), sub-humid (Oklahoma) and semi-arid (Arizona). We evaluated the effect of physical factors on soil moisture variability at coarse spatial support scales but fine (daily) temporal spacing scales which are typical of remotely sensed soil moisture data. The hierarchy or ranking scheme defined in the study is a function of the areal extent of controls of the different physical factors and the magnitude of their effect in creating spatial variability of soil moisture. We found that even though the areal influence of soil on soil moisture variability remained significant at all scales, it decreased as we went from airborne scale to coarser scales whereas the influence of topography and vegetation increased for all three hydro-climates. The magnitude of the effect of these factors, however, was dependent on antecedent soil moisture conditions and hydro-climate.",

            "abstract": "Optimizing the number and location of tsunami stations in designing a tsunami warning system is an important and practical problem. It is always desirable to maximize the capability of the data obtained from the stations for constraining the earthquake source parameters, and to minimize the number of stations at the same time. During the 2011 Tohoku tsunami event, 28 coastal gauges and DART buoys in the near-field recorded tsunami waves, providing an opportunity for assessing the effectiveness of those stations in identifying the earthquake source parameters. Assuming a single-plane fault geometry, inversions of tsunami data from combinations of various number (1~28) of stations and locations are conducted and evaluated their effectiveness according to the residues of the inverse method. Results show that the optimized locations of stations depend on the number of stations used. If the stations are optimally located, 2~4 stations are sufficient to constrain the source parameters. Regarding the optimized location, stations must be uniformly spread in all directions, which is not surprising. It is also found that stations within the source region generally give worse constraint of earthquake source than stations farther from source, which is due to the exaggeration of model error in matching large amplitude waves at near-source stations. Quantitative discussions on these findings will be given in the presentation. Applying similar analysis to the Manila Trench based on artificial scenarios of earthquakes and tsunamis, the optimal location of tsunami stations are obtained, which provides guidance of deploying a tsunami warning system in this region.",

The group originally planned to make app versions for Google Maps, Leaflet, and OpenLayers. However, because the Leaflet library did not properly load on Android, the group focused efforts on the other two mapping libraries. For Google Maps, the group first designed a UI for the web app and made a working version of the app. After updating the source of fire data to one which also provided historical fire data, the design had to be modified to include the extra data. After completing a working version of the web app, the group used webview in android, a built in resource which allowed porting the web app to android without rewriting the code for android. Upon completing this, the group found Apple IOS devices had a similar capability, and so decided to add an IOS app to the project using a function similar to webview. Alongside this effort, the group began implementing an OpenLayers fire map using a simpler UI. This web app was completed fairly quickly relative to Google Maps; however, it did not include functionality such as satellite imagery or searchable locations. The group finished the project with a working android version of the Google Maps based app supporting API levels 14-19 and an OpenLayers based app supporting API levels 8-19, as well as a Google Maps based IOS app supporting both old and new screen formats.

Two years (2012-2014) of shallow (<200 m) plankton tows, taken along the continental shelf inside the California Current system, offer new insights into the spatial and seasonal dynamics of planktic foraminifera in an upwelling regime. Tows along with intensive hydrologic monitoring by CTD casts and discrete bottle sampling (temperature, salinity, oxygen, thermocline depth, carbonate saturation state) have spanned two complete seasonal upwelling-relaxation cycles. We present the results from these tows as well as preliminary models linking environmental drivers and foraminifera assemblages in this highly dynamic environment. Species abundances appear to be highly seasonal, in keeping with water column structure, with a seasonal upwelling to relaxation trade off between the non-spinose foraminifers Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and Neogloboquadrina incompta.

            "abstract": "While seismicity triggered or induced by natural resources production such as mining or water impoundment in large dams has long been recognized, the recent increase in the unconventional production of oil and gas has been linked to rapid rise in seismicity in many places, including central North America (Ellsworth et al., 2012; Ellsworth, 2013). Worldwide, induced events of M~5 have occurred and, although rare, have resulted in both damage and public concern (Horton, 2012; Keranen et al., 2013). In addition, over the past twenty years, the increase in both number and coverage of seismic stations has resulted in an unprecedented ability to precisely record the magnitude and location of large numbers of small magnitude events.\nThe increase in the number and type of seismic sequences available for detailed study has revealed differences in their statistics that previously difficult to quantify. For example, seismic swarms that produce significant numbers of foreshocks as well as aftershocks have been observed in different tectonic settings, including California, Iceland, and the East Pacific Rise (McGuire et al., 2005; Shearer, 2012; Kazemian et al., 2014). Similarly, smaller events have been observed prior to larger induced events in several occurrences from energy production. The field of statistical seismology has long focused on the question of triggering and the mechanisms responsible (Stein et al., 1992; Hill et al., 1993; Steacy et al., 2005; Parsons, 2005; Main et al., 2006). For example, in most cases the associated stress perturbations are much smaller than the earthquake stress drop, suggesting an inherent sensitivity to relatively small stress changes (Nalbant et al., 2005). Induced seismicity provides the opportunity to investigate triggering and, in particular, the differences between long- and short-range triggering.\nHere we investigate the statistics of induced seismicity sequences from around the world, including central North America and Spain, and natural earthquake swarms and non-swarm tectonic events from California, Nevada and Iceland. We compare the foreshock and aftershock Omori decay parameters and the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude scaling relationships for these different sequences in order to better understand the relationship between triggering and cascade sequences.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols may have a great impact on climate through direct and indirect perturbations to the Earth's radiation balance. In order to quantify these effects, it is fundamental to understand the various physical, chemical and dynamic processes related to the aerosols, as well as their distribution in the atmosphere. For this reason, we applied the model SOSAA to investigate the complex processes of aerosols in a boreal forest site in summer 2013. SOSAA is the chemistry-transport model with detailed chemistry and aerosol dynamics. The meteorology and chemistry in the model have been validated against field observations in previous studies. It showed good agreements for all parameters including the concentration of sulphuric acid, which is believed to be a key component in the nucleation theories we applied in this study.\nOur work emphasized on studying the growth of the secondary organic particles with a newly developed molecular based condensational growth scheme. The model results were compared to the field measurements during the Pan-European-Gas-AeroSOls-climate interaction Study (PEGASOS), which made intensive vertical observations of secondary organic aerosol formation and photochemistry in the lower troposphere at a Finnish boreal forest site in summer 2013. Analysing both the model results and PEGASOS data provided us valuable insights about the formation, evolution and transport of secondary organic aerosols in the lower troposphere.",

            "abstract": "When climate science is communicated to the broader public, many of its key findings are shared in the form of conceptual diagrams or information-dense data graphics. In this collaboration, we applied a data sonification approach to express NASA’s global temperature record as a musical composition for the cello. The resulting piece, which we titled ‘A Song of Our Warming Planet’, transformed 133 years of annual global temperature anomalies into a haunting, atonal melody that stretched across almost all of the instrument’s range. Since its release in June 2013, the song has been featured by several national and international media outlets, including the New York Times, the Weather Channel, and National Public Radio, and its accompanying video has received more than 140,000 views from nearly every corner of the world. We are currently preparing a new composition for string quartet that will add a geographic dimension to describe both the pace and place of global warming. We believe the success of our initial sonification project is testament to the power of music to reach audiences who respond less enthusiastically to traditional methods used to communicate climate science. We also imagine this approach could be applied more broadly to allow students to create novel, visceral, and memorable encounters with other aspects of the geophysical sciences.",

            "abstract": "Ammonia emission is a major concern due to its adverse effects on animal and human health. Ionic strength and suspended solids play key roles in the ammonia volatilization process. These two parameters, however, are usually lumped together in form of total solids. The objective of this study was to separate the contribution of suspended solids (SS) from that of ionic strength (IS) on ammonia volatilization in liquid dairy manure. A two-way factorial experiment was conducted to simultaneously test the effects of IS and SS on ammonium dissociation: a key element of the ammonia volatilization process. The fraction of ammonia (β) in total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) was experimentally determined in a convective emission chamber, for each level of SS and IS, at a constant wind speed of 1.5 m s-1, and air and liquid temperature of 25°C. The two way analysis of variance showed a significant effect of SS concentration (p = 0.04) on fraction of ammonia in the liquid dairy manure, while the effect of ionic strength was marginal (p = 0.05). The highest dissociation of ammonium was observed in manure with the lowest SS concentration (0%) and the lowest ionic strength (0.10 mol L-1). Significant increases in suspended solids concentration and ionic strength were necessary to influence the ammonium dissociation in dairy manure. Results revealed that substantially high content of suspended solids (> 3.0%) or relatively high dilution of manure with water (30%) were necessary for these two parameters to play significant roles in the ammonia volatilization mechanism in liquid dairy manure. Results also showed that the β was more sensitive to the changes in suspended solids concentration than in the changes in ionic strength within the ranges of SS and IS examined in this study. Overall, the SS and IS effects on ammonium dissociation (and by extension on ammonia volatilization process) were thus found negligible within the normal ranges of liquid dairy manure characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Tropical instability waves (TIWs) and vortices (TIVs) in the equatorial Pacific exhibit energetic horizontal and vertical circulation characterized by regions of high Rossby number and low Richardson number. Their strong anticyclonic vorticity and vertical shear can influence the broader-scale circulation by driving lateral mixing and vertical exchange. Here we present recent modeling work aimed at understanding the vorticity and potential vorticity dynamics of TIWs and TIVs and their implications for mixing at the Equator.\nThe anticyclonic vorticity of TIVs mixes Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) water with North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) water within TIV cores, driving an equatorward heat flux that affects the SST budget in the cold tongue. Using Lagrangian vorticity analyses, we show that part of this anticyclonic vorticity is formed through vortex tilting of the horizontal vorticity associated with the vertical shear in the upper EUC. In turn, recent observations have shown that TIWs modulate vertical mixing in the upper EUC. We examine the vortex dynamics of this process and show that TIW induced strain can drive increases in the EUC vertical shear through horizontal vortex stretching, contributing to an increase in vertical mixing. Calculations using a simple 1D model of mixing in the EUC driven by periodic TIW strain indicate that TIWs may increase the turbulent heat flux by up to 30%, with the magnitude of the increase being sensitive to the parameterization for shear driven turbulent diffusion. These results emphasize the role of submesoscale physics in the equatorial region, which are active when both the Rossby and Richardson numbers are O(1).",

            "abstract": "The paleohydrological information can become important to predict hydrological conditions in the future. In Japan, which hydrologically is characterized by relatively small catchment scales with steep relief of topography under humid temperate climatic conditions, the residence time of the groundwater should be relatively short. Thus the paleohydrological information preserved in the groundwater aquifer should also be limited compared with the continental aquifer. However, regarding groundwater in clay and silt sediments have low-permeability characteristic, archiving the paleohydrologic information at the time of deposition is expected.\nTherefore, in this study, cores were drilled into Holocene clay and silt deposits (Site K-1 and Site K-2) in the Lake Kasumigaurain Japan, where the depositional rate 10,000 years ago was rapid and it has been affected strongly by sea level changes including transgression and regression. By using the obtained core samples and extracted pore water from the cores, paleohydrologic information was investigated, and it was tried to understand hydrologic environments at the study area during a Holocene. In addition, groundwater flow and solute transport simulation were conducted to reproduce profiles of pore water.\nResults of investigation show that the profiles of pore water contents reflect sea level change and the difference in hydrological environment at that time at each site. The content of the paleo-brackish water in the culmination of transgression was about 14,000 mg/l in Cl-, -13.0‰ in δD and -2.6‰ in δ18O. It is allowed better understanding paleohydrological information by studying not only inorganic chemistry contents and stable isotopes of pore water and also the diatom fossils and groundwater flow and solute transport simulation. We will characterize the paleohydrological information of the study area acquired by those investigations and analysis.",

The correlation coefficient was mostly negative; the halocline was strong when the SSS was low.

            "abstract": "The 2012 PCAST report identified the improvement of “gateway” science courses as critical to increasing the number of STEM graduates to levels commensurate with national needs. The urgent need to recruit/ retain more STEM graduates is particularly acute in the geosciences, where growth in employment opportunities, an aging workforce and flat graduation rates are leading to substantial unmet demand for geoscience-trained STEM graduates. The need to increase the number of Bachelors-level geoscience graduates was an identified priority at the Summit on the Future of Undergraduate Geoscience Education (\nhttp://www.jsg.utexas.edu/events/future-of-geoscience-undergraduateeducation/\n), as was the necessity of focusing on 2-year colleges, where a growing number of students are being introduced to geosciences. Undergraduate research as an instructional tool can help engage and retain students, but has largely not been part of introductory geoscience courses because of the challenge of scaling such activities for large student numbers. However, burgeoning information technology resources, including publicly available earth and planetary data repositories and freely available, intuitive data visualization platforms makes structured, in-classroom investigations of geoscience questions tractable, and open-ended student inquiry possible.\nExamples include “MARGINS Mini-Lessons”, instructional resources developed with the support of two NSF-DUE grant awards that involve investigations of marine geosciences data resources (overseen by the Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA) portal: www.iedadata.org) and data visualization using GeoMapApp (www.geomapapp.org); and the growing suite of Google-Earth based data visualization and exploration activities overseen by the Google Earth in Onsite and Distance Education project (geode.net). Sample-based investigations are also viable in introductory courses, thanks to remote instrument operations technologies that allow real student participation in instrument-based data collection and interpretation. It is thus possible to model for students nearly the entire scientific process in introductory geoscience courses, allowing them to experience the excitement of “doing” science and thereby enticing more of them into the field.",

The time period of interest is the DYNAMO (Dynamics of Madden Julian Oscillation) field experiment period, starting late October 2011. The NAVGEM experiments are run at an effective 37-km resolution with several different SST configurations. The in the first set of experiments, the initial SST analysis, provided by the NCODA (Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation) system, is either held fixed to the initial value (fixed SST) or updated every 6 hours. These forecasts are compared with forecasts in which the SST is updated with 3-h analyses from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), and forecasts in which NAVGEM is interactively coupled to HYCOM. Experiments are also performed with different physical parameterization options. The extended integrations are verified using observed OLR, TRMM precipitation estimates, and global analyses.\nThe use of fixed SSTs is clearly sub-optimal. Biases in monthly mean fields are far more pronounced in the simulations where the SST is held fixed as compared to those in simulations where updated SST analyses are used. Biases in the monthly mean fields are further reduced when NAVGEM is coupled to HYCOM. Differences in SST can “migrate” to substantial changes in the time-mean land-surface temperatures, illustrating the substantial impact of SSTs over the full domain. Concerning the simulation of the MJO, some improvement is noted when the system is fully coupled, although the simulations still exhibit deficiencies such as eastward propagation that is too slow, and difficulty propagating over the maritime continent. Simulations that are started every 5 days indicate that the NAVGEM uncoupled system has difficulty predicting MJO initiation, but simulations started when the MJO is active in the Indian Ocean are able to capture eastward propagation characteristics. The coupled NAVGEM-HYCOM system shows ability to capture the initiation of an MJO event 20 days into the forecast.",

This is particularly the case for the sparsely-instrumented Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, where the timing and amplitude of regional and hemispheric-scale climatic events is poorly constrained. The climate of New Zealand is influenced by climatological patterns originating in both the tropics (e.g. El-Niño-Southern Oscillation, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation) and the Antarctic (Southern Annular Mode, SAM). Specifically, summer rainfall records from the western South Island of New Zealand exhibit decadal trends that are highly correlated with the SAM.\nA 1,200-year laminated sediment sequence recovered from Lake Ohau (44.234°S, 169.854°E), which sits in this SAM-sensitive region of New Zealand, offers a unique opportunity to explore the hydrology and climate of this region at annual-to-decadal resolution. Here we present a climate-proxy model based on detailed micro-facies analysis, physical (particle size, porosity) and chemical (ITRAX micro-XRF) characteristics of the lamination stratigraphy, and an 85-year hydrometeorological record. Using this model, we explore climate trends over the last 1,200 years and compare this sediment record to SAM reconstructions from paleoclimate model simulations, and South American tree ring and Antarctic ice core proxy records.",

The interaction between the Nazca and South America plates has a high tsunamigenic potential. Historically, Chilean coastal cities has been affected by the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis recorded in the world. The location of the mega-thrust close to the land has raised the need to improve early warning systems. Typically fast tsunami threat assessment in early warning systems is based on homogeneous slip distribution models related with the historical earthquake scenarios\nActually, one of the main aspects in numerical tsunami modeling is the use of finite fault rupture models where slip distribution is provided with more realistic and precise seismic representations. However, in recent years it has been tested that slip distribution has an essential contribution to tsunamigenic hydrodynamic processes such as wave period propagation, arrival times, inundation and run-up pattern along the coast. In this work we have a twofold aim, on one side to test the implications of slip distribution on the tsunamigenic hydrodynamic processes along the Arica, Iquique and Patache coastal zones resulted from the 2014 Pisagua earthquake, and on the other side compare the use of tsunami numerical codes based on linear, and non-linear/non-hydrostatic hydrodynamic equations to assess the above mentioned datasets.\nThe analysis has been possible due of the availability of high resolved finite fault model for the 2014 Pisagua earthquake (Hayes et al., 2014; An et al., 2014; Yagi et al., 2014), the recorded tsunami wave in Arica, Iquique and Patache tsunamigrams and the high resolution coastal bathymetry in the study region in northern Chile. The results provide a better insight of the inference of physical characteristics of the source, the morphological characteristics of seafloor and coastline geometry on the wave period and frequency as well as on the run-up distribution and coastal resonance effects.",

            "abstract": "Our current understanding of drumlin formation is largely based on investigations of individual drumlins either within Pleistocene drumlin fields or within the forefields of contemporary glaciers, showing variable composition and structure resulting in different models for drumlin genesis. The stratigraphy and morphology of drumlins within the active drumlin field at the Múlajökull surge-type piedmont glacier, Iceland, have been studied in order to shed light on their formation. A total of 110 drumlins where mapped and measured and their internal stratigraphy and composition were documented in three exposures. The exposures all revealed several till units where the youngest till truncates the older ones on the flanks of the drumlins and at the proximal side. A geomorphological study shows that drumlins within the 1992 surge end moraine are relatively long and narrow whilst drumlins further away from the current ice margin are wider and slightly shorter. Three models are proposed to explain the stratigraphy and morphological evolution of the drumlins within the Múlajökull drumlin field. Firstly, we suggest that radial crevasses in the glacier terminus lead to spatial differences in normal pressure at the base so that deposition is favoured beneath and erosion in between the crevasses and, consequently, the crevasse pattern of the glacier controls the location of the drumlins. Secondly, sediment accumulating beneath the crevasses acts as an obstacle to the ice, which decreases the ice flow and facilitates sedimentation. Simultaneously and subsequently, the accumulation of sediments is shaped by the ice flow into a drumlin. Thirdly we conclude that the drumlins are evolving from being wide and low to in the distal part to narrow and high in the proximal part. The drumlins are then maintained and their relief increases as the glacier erodes the sides and the proximal end of the drumlin and drapes new till layer over the landform.",

            "abstract": "The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) call for 5th grade students to “obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect Earth’s resources and environment”. Achieving this, and other objectives in NGSS, will require changes in the educational system for both students and teachers. Teachers need access to high quality instructional materials and continuous professional learning opportunities starting in pre-service education. Students need highly engaging and authentic learning experiences focused on content that is strategically interwoven with science practices.\nPre-service and early career teachers, even at the secondary level, often have relatively weak understandings of the complex Earth systems science required for understanding climate change and hold alternative ideas and naïve beliefs about the nature of science. These naïve understandings cause difficulties in portraying and teaching science, especially considering what is being called for in NGSS. The ACLIPSE program focuses on middle school pre-service science teachers and education faculty because: (1) the concepts that underlie climate change align well with the disciplinary core ideas and practices in NGSS for middle grades; and (2) middle school is a critical time for capturing students interest in science as student engagement by eighth grade is the most effective predictor of student pursuit of science in high school and college. Capturing student attention at this age is critical for recruitment to STEM careers and lifelong climate literacy.\nTHE ACLIPSE program uses cutting edge research and technology in ocean observing systems to provide educators with new tools to engage students that will lead to deeper understanding of the interactions between the ocean and climate systems. Establishing authentic, meaningful connections between indigenous and place-based, and technological climate observations will help generate a more holistic perspective on climate change and demonstrate that observing systems can enhance understanding. ACLIPSE materials strive to translate research about climate change effectively into understandable narratives of real world phenomena using ocean data, creating meaningful pathways into ocean-climate science for students in ALL communities.",

            "abstract": "Data from the Dawn spacecraft were used to construct shape models of asteroid 4 Vesta using stereophotogrammetry (SPG) and stereophotoclinometry (SPC) techniques (Jaumann et al., 2012; Gaskell 2012). The purpose of this paper is to identify systematic differences between the models and assess their spatial distribution. Understanding errors in shape models is crucial for confident interpretations in geophysical and geological studies of Vesta.\nThe two shape models were constructed using the same coordinate system. However, we find a difference between the prime meridians of the two models. Using least squares, we find longitudinal offset as a function of latitude. The offset is less than 0.5 arcmin near the equator and increases poleward. It reaches 1.5 arcmin at 50°N, which is equivalent to a displacement of ≈80 meters on the surface, which represents approximately one pixel in the images that constitute the bulk of the data used in constructing the shape models.\nThe most distinctive effect is the difference of elevations that resembles the J2 signal. The SPG model is flatter than the SPC model. The longitude-averaged difference of elevations is minimal at the high southern latitudes (≈25 meters) and reaches ≈175 meters at 15°S. The shape of the longitude-averaged elevation difference resembles the shape of the longitude-averaged radius. This observation alludes to a possible cause of the effect; it may be at least in part a consequence of the difference of image altitudes and therefore image scale. In addition, the mean radius of the two models is different: the SPG’s model mean radius is 118 meters greater than that of the SPC model.\nWe have also analyzed local scale differences. The largest differences in depths are in high northern latitudes where the surface illumination conditions were poorer. The difference reaches several kilometers in deep craters due to different methods of gap filling.\nWhile this analysis is useful in pointing out inconsistencies between models, it does not and cannot distinguish which model is closer to truth, because image-derived topography lacks an absolute reference. In models where image-derived topography has been compared to topographic observations from laser altimetry, long wavelengths in image-derived models are the most poorly determined.",

            "abstract": "The Snowball Earth hypothesis has inspired several variants which may help to explain some of the great mysteries of the Neoproterozoic glaciations. One of these, the \"Mudball Earth\", proposes that as the Earth remained completely frozen for millions of years, a layer of dust accumulated on the ice surface. This dust layer would darken the planet, making it easier for the Earth to escape from the highly stable snowball climate state. This hypothesis is testable: after the ice melted at the end of a glacial era, this dust would sink to the bottom of the ocean, possibly forming a distinct clay, mud, or silt layer on the top of the glacial till deposits: this \"clay drape\" would then be covered by the cap carbonates that mark a return to warm climate. Sublimation and ice flow during the glacial episode should make this layer thicker at the equator and thinner or absent in the poles. Is this clay layer actually present in the rock record? Is it more prevalent at the paleoequator, as predicted? A clay drape has been noticed anecdotally, but no global survey has been done to date. We conducted a thorough literature review of all sites where Neoproterozoic glacial diamictites have been observed, identifying the type of rock that lies between the diamictite and the postglacial cap carbonate, when present, during both Sturtian and Marinoan glacial periods. Only a few publications identify a distinct clay/silt/mud layer that might represent weathered dust. These sites are not grouped by paleolatitude in any obvious way. With access only to published reports, we cannot determine whether such a layer is absent, went unreported, or was misinterpreted by us. With this work we hope to attract the attention of Neoproterozoic field geologists, inviting them to comment on the presence or absence of strata which could confirm or reject the \"Mudball\" hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Birner's work (2006) showed that the extratropical tropopause is extremely sharp when the mean tropopause structure is plotted using the tropopause altitude as the reference level. Wirth suggested that this sharpness is largely control by the upper tropospheric relative vorticity. It has been suggested that this effect, while important, is not sufficient to explain the observed extratropical tropopause sharpness, and that radiative processes provide the needed additional sharpening. Furthermore, there are large annual and latitudinal variations in this tropopause sharpness, but the reasons for these remain unexplained.\nBy analysis of observations and modeling, we suggest that dry baroclinic mixing is sufficient to explain the extratropical tropopause sharpness and its latitudinal and annual variations. We revisit some earlier work by Son and Polvani (2007), who showed that in their dry idealized global model, the tropopause sharpness depended more on horizontal resolution than on vertical resolution, but they gave no explanation. Our work has reproduced these resolution-dependent results, and we have sought to explain these results by a series of diagnostics. Our results suggest that while the Wirth control by upper tropospheric relative vorticity is true on synoptic time scales, the climatological control is much more related to the downward flux of potential vorticity by baroclinic mixing, with heat fluxes playing a lesser role. Our results suggest that baroclinic mixing of potential vorticity is the cause of the observed climatological extratropical tropopause sharpness, and that the resolution dependence of this sharpness is a result of more vigorous baroclinic activity for higher horizontal resolutions as well as the greater resolution of filamentary mixing of potential vorticity. Also, we suggest that the annual variation of the extratropical tropopause sharpness follows the annual migration of the latitude of the jet stream.\nBirner (2006, J. of Geophys.

            "abstract": "For the past 30 months the Curiosity rover has encountered stratified bedrock along a drive route extending from Bradbury Landing à Yellowknife Bay à Kimberley à Pahrump, a distance of ~9 km. Curiosity still has ~2.5 km to make it to Murray Buttes, taken as the base of Mt. Sharp. All bedrock outcrops expose sedimentary rocks, including mud/silt/sandstones, and conglomerate, all of basaltic composition. These rocks all form part of a fluvio-lacustrine facies association, with small volumes of co-mingled eolian deposits. Most are simply interpreted as distal alluvial fan deposits. Paleocurrent data from the Shaler outcrop (Yellowknife Bay) suggests a dominant component of southwesterly flow, and scattered outcrops within the Kimberley region provide evidence for southward-prograding clinoforms. Thus, most of the volume of sedimentary rock observed during the drive from Yellowknife Bay to the Kimberley is consistent with derivation of sediments from erosion of the northern crater rim. However, some stratigraphic intervals may derive from other source areas simply due to the lack of paleocurrent information. A major compositional change is observed in the Yellowknife Bay formation where lower members (Sheepbed, Gillespie) are slightly more mafic than average martian crust, whereas the overlying Glenelg member are more depleted in MgO+FeO, and more enriched in K2O (and Na2O locally). This signature of elevated K2O has been observed commonly in outcrops extending all the way the Kimberley where the drilled Windjana sandstone revealed significant quantities of potassium feldspar. Conglomerates may differ from sandstones in containing a greater fraction of plagioclase feldspar. This suggests that much of the bedrock that underlies Aeolis Palus between Yellowknife Bay and the Kimberley is derived from alkaline source rocks, likely located along the northern rim. In contrast, the lower part of Yellowknife Bay, including the Sheepbed mudstone - with finer grain size - might record more distant provenance. Recent results reflecting the geology between the Kimberley and Murray Buttes will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to create interactive online tool for generating and viewing the anaglyph 3D stereo image on a Web browser via Internet. To achieve this, we designed and developed the prototype system. Three-dimensional visualization is well known and becoming popular in recent years to understand the target object and the related physical phenomena. Geoscience data have the complex data model, which combines large extents with rich small scale visual details. So, the real-time visualization of 3D geoscience data model on the Internet is a challenging work. In this paper, we show the result of creating which can be viewed in 3D anaglyph of geoscience data in any web browser which supports WebGL. We developed an anaglyph image viewing prototype system, and some representative results are displayed by anaglyph 3D stereo image generated in red-cyan colour from pairs of air-photo/digital elevation model and geological map/digital elevation model respectively. The best viewing is achieved by using suitable 3D red-cyan glasses, although alternatively red-blue or red-green spectacles can be also used. The middle mouse wheel can be used to zoom in/out the anaglyph image on a Web browser. Application of anaglyph 3D stereo image is a very important and easy way to understand the underground geologic system and active tectonic geomorphology. The integrated strata with fine three-dimensional topography and geologic map data can help to characterise the mineral potential area and the active tectonic abnormal characteristics. To conclude, it can be stated that anaglyph 3D stereo image provides a simple and feasible method to improve the relief effect of geoscience data such as geomorphology and geology. We believe that with further development, the anaglyph 3D stereo imaging system could as a complement to 3D geologic modeling, constitute a useful tool for better understanding of the underground geology and the active tectonic",

The OCO-3 mission on ISS will have a key role in delivering sustained, global, scientifically-based, spaceborne measurements of atmospheric CO2to monitor natural sources and sinks as part of NASA’s proposed OCO-2/OCO-3/ASCENDS mission sequence and NASA’s Climate Architecture.\nThe OCO-3 mission will contribute to understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle through enabling flux estimates at smaller spatial scales and through fluorescence measurements that will reduce the uncertainty in terrestrial carbon flux measurements and drive bottom-up land surface models through constraining GPP.\nThe combined nominal missions of both OCO-2 and OCO-3 will likely span a complete El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, a key indicator of ocean variability. In addition, OCO-3 may allow investigation of the high-frequency and wavenumber structures suggested by eddying ocean circulation and ecosystem dynamics models.\nFinally, significant growth of urban agglomerations is underway and projected to continue in the coming decades. With the city mode sampling of the OCO-3 instrument on ISS we can evaluate different sampling strategies aimed at studying anthropogenic sources and demonstrate elements of a Greenhouse Gas Information system, as well as providing a gap-filler for tracking trends in the fastest-changing anthropogenic signals during the coming decade.\nIn this presentation, we will describe our science objectives, the characteristics of measurements from the ISS for OCO-3, and the unique features of XCO2 measurements from ISS.",

This program employed the NSF/NCAR GV (NGV) research aircraft from a base in New Zealand in a 6-week field measurement campaign in June-July 2014. During the field phase, the NGV was equipped with new lidar and airglow instruments, as well as dropwindsondes and a full suite of flight level instruments including the microwave temperature profiler (MTP), providing temperatures and vertical winds spanning altitudes from immediately above the NGV flight altitude (~13 km) to ~100 km. The region near New Zealand was chosen since all the relevant GW sources (e.g., mountains, cyclones, jet streams) occur strongly here, and upper-level winds in austral winter permit gravity waves to propagate to very high altitudes.\nThe COAMPS adjoint modeling system provided forecast sensitivity in real time during the six-week DEEPWAVE field phase. Five missions were conducted using the NGV to observe regions of high forecast sensitivity, as diagnosed using the COAMPS adjoint model. In this presentation, we provide a summary of the sensitivity characteristics and explore the implications for predictability of low-level winds crucial for gravity wave launching, as well as predictability of gravity wave characteristics in the stratosphere. In general, the sensitive regions were characterized by localized strong dynamics, often involving intense baroclinic systems with deep convection. The results of the adjoint modeling system suggest that gravity wave launching and the characteristics of the gravity waves can be linked to these sensitive regions near frontal zones within baroclinic systems. The predictability links between the tropospheric fronts, cyclones, jet regions, and gravity waves that vertically propagate upward through the stratosphere will be addressed further in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "There are competing conceptualisations of heterogeneity in catchment systems. It is often convenient to divide catchments into zones, for example the soil profile, groundwater aquifers (saturated zone), riparian zones, etc. We also often divide flow sources into distinct categories such as surface runoff, interflow and baseflow, implying a few distinct stores of water. In tracer hydrology we typically assume water from such zones has distinct and invariant chemistry that is used to infer the runoff source mixture through conservative mixing model techniques such as End-Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA). An alternative conceptualisation is that catchments consist of a large number of stores with varying residence times. In this case individual stores contribute a variable proportion of flow and may have a temporally varying composition due to processes such as evapo-concentration. Hence they have a variable influence on the hydrochemistry of runoff.\nIn this presentation, examples from two field studies in southern Australia will be presented that examine the relationships between hydrologic and hydrochemical conceptualisations and the relative variation within and between different hydrologic zones. The implications for water quality behaviour will be examined and the additional behavioural complexities associated with interactions between runoff pathways for non-conservative chemical species will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Recent earthquakes such as the 1999 Chi-Chi and 2008 Wenchuan events have demonstrated that the hazard from large earthquakes in mountains is not simply that of strong ground shaking. Coseismic landsliding can be as devastating as, or more devastating than, the initial earthquake. In mountainous areas with high seismic hazard, understanding the potential scale and spatial distribution of coseismic landsliding is therefore vital to fully describing the earthquake hazard. Currently however, estimating coseismic landslide susceptibility requires either: a substantially complete coseismic landslide inventory from an historic event in the region; densely spaced, detailed geotechnical data; expert knowledge; or some combination of these. In regions where these are not available, estimating the extent of coseismic landsliding is not currently possible.\nThis study uses statistical analysis of substantially complete coseismic landslide inventories from Northridge, CA and Wenchuan, China to identify common regional factors which appear to control the spatial distribution of landsliding in both locations. These factors were: shaking intensity (MMI), slope angle, distance to faults and streams, and slope position. Factors such as slope curvature, slope aspect, and elevation played no consistent role in the formation of landslides. Combining these observations with fuzzy logic in GIS we are able to successfully model landslide susceptibility for the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake. This suggests that modelling susceptibility for a given earthquake scenario is possible, using observations of historic events in similar geotectonic environments. Applying the result to a potential M8 Alpine fault earthquake in New Zealand yields a susceptibility map for the entire South Island. High susceptibility is modelled across an area >50,000 km2, predominantly focussed on the western rangefront of the Southern Alps. Landsliding therefore has the potential to be widespread, presenting a range of major hazards.",

To date, that mission has been successful in addressing this goal, elucidating the effects of both slow inward diffusion, storm-time local acceleration, and substorm effects. Here we describe the effects of an impulsive solar wind shock on the prompt acceleration of electrons to highly relativistic energies in the inner magnetosphere. On October 8, 2013 the twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft observed both the accelerating shock impulse electric fields and the response of the electron populations across a broad range of energies. The spacecraft were on the dayside where the abrupt shock-induced acceleration to relativistic energies occurs. Simultaneous measurements from spacecraft in the upstream interplanetary medium determined the shock characteristics. Both Probes A and B observe the initial shock at while B is at L~5 and A is further inward near L~3.5. These measurements provide evidence the dayside equatorial magnetosphere experienced a strong dusk-dawn/azimuthal component of the electric field for a period of 1-2 minutes. Both A and B observe order of magnitude “quasi-periodic pulse-like” enhancements in the relativistic (2 – 6 MeV) electron flux. This is a consequence of an extremely rapid energization of electrons due to the shock induced fields on a time scale which is a fraction of their orbital drift period around the Earth, followed by their energy-dependent drift-echo reappearance. With A following B along the same orbit, B observed the pre-shock background for electron flux and phase space density out to Lstar ~ 5 about 1 hr before A observed the post-shock effects across that range of L. While at higher L outer zone electrons were rapidly depleted due to loss to the contracted magnetopause, inside L~4 a new population of highly relativistic electrons was formed and persisted through the recovery of the event.",

During this time, the results from the mission have been used to support a wide range of contemporary studies of Earth System Dynamics. The mission objectives are to sense the spatial and temporal variations of the Earth’s mass through its effects on the gravity field at the GRACE satellite altitude. The primary mission objectives of GRACE are to measure: 1) the Earth’s time-averaged gravity field over the mission life and 2) the monthly variations in the mean gravity field at wave lengths between 200 and 4000 km. The major cause of the time varying mass is water motion and the GRACE mission has provided a continuous decade long measurement sequences which characterizes the seasonal exchange of mass between the oceans, land, cryosphere and atmosphere; its inter-annual variability; and the climate driven secular, or long period, mass transport signals. Measurements of continental aquifer mass change, polar ice mass change and ocean bottom currents are examples of paradigm shifting remote sensing observations enabled by the GRACE satellite measurements. In 2012, a complete reanalysis of the mission data, referred to as the RL05 data release, was initiated. The monthly solutions from this effort were released in mid-2013 and have been applied in numerous science and application related investigations. The RL05 mean and combined models, involving the GRACE/GOCE data combinations, are still in development. This presentation will describe the current mission status and operations activities, which are focused on extending the mission lifetime, review some of the science improvements from the RL05 data release and describe the status and remaining tasks to complete the solution.",

The target metrics cover both physics and biogeochemistry such as snow, permafrost, hydrology, and carbon budget. The MIP consists of two stages: one-dimensional, historical GRENE-TEA site evaluations (stage 1) and circumpolar evaluations using projected climate change data from GCM outputs (stage 2). At the current stage 1, forcing and validation data are prepared, taking maximum advantage of the observation data taken at GRENE-TEA sites (e.g., Fairbanks in Alaska, Yakutsk and Tiksi in Russia, and Kevo in Finland), to evaluate the inter-model and inter-site variations. Since the observation data are prone to missing or lack of the consistency, and not ready to drive the numerical model directly, we create continuous forcing data (called version 0) derived from the reanalysis product (i.e. ERA-interim) with monthly bias corrections using the CRU (for temperature) and GPCP (for precipitation) datasets taken from the respectively nearest grid to the GRENE-TEA sites. Then, it is modified to reflect the local characteristics (version 1), and, in addition, replaced with the observed data (version 1 with obs). These data are partly open at Arctic Data Archive System.

            "abstract": "In the context of coupled human and natural system (CHNS), incorporating human factors into water resource management provides us with the opportunity to understand the interactions between human and environmental systems. A multi-agent system (MAS) model is designed to couple with the physically-based Republican River Compact Administration (RRCA) groundwater model, in an attempt to understand the declining water table and base flow in the heavily irrigated Republican River basin. For MAS modelling, we defined five behavioral parameters (κ_pr, ν_pr, κ_prep, ν_prep and λ) to characterize the agent’s pumping behavior given the uncertainties of the future crop prices and precipitation. κ and ν describe agent's beliefs in their prior knowledge of the mean and variance of crop prices (κ_pr, ν_pr) and precipitation (κ_prep, ν_prep), and λ is used to describe the agent's attitude towards the fluctuation of crop profits. Notice that these human behavioral parameters as inputs to the MAS model are highly uncertain and even not measurable. Thus, we estimate the influences of these behavioral parameters on the coupled models using Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). In this paper, we address two main challenges arising from GSA with such a large-scale socio-hydrological model by using Hadoop-based Cloud Computing techniques and Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) based variance decomposition approach. As a result, 1,000 scenarios of the coupled models are completed within two hours with the Hadoop framework, rather than about 28days if we run those scenarios sequentially. Based on the model results, GSA using PCE is able to measure the impacts of the spatial and temporal variations of these behavioral parameters on crop profits and water table, and thus identifies two influential parameters, κ_pr and λ. The major contribution of this work is a methodological framework for the application of GSA in large-scale socio-hydrological models. This framework attempts to find a balance between the heavy computational burden regarding model execution and the number of model evaluations required in the GSA analysis, particularly through an organic combination of Hadoop-based Cloud Computing to efficiently evaluate the socio-hydrological model and PCE where the sensitivity indices are efficiently estimated from its coefficients.",

            "abstract": "Near-Earth objects (NEOs) of tens of meters in diameter are difficult to detect by optical methods from the Earth but they result in the most damage per year. Many of these bodies are produced in non-destructive collisions with larger well-characterized NEOs. After generation, the debris spreads forward and backward in a cocoon around the orbit of the parent body. Thereafter, scattering will occur due to gravitational perturbations when the debris stream passes near a planet even when the parent body has no such close approaches. Therefore “safe” NEOs which have no close encounters to the Earth for thousands of years may be accompanied by potentially hazardous co-orbiting debris.\nWe have developed a technique to identify co-orbiting debris by detecting the magnetic signature produced when some of the debris suffers destructive collisions with meteoroids, which are numerous and can be as small as tens of centimeters in diameter. Clouds of nanoscale dust/gas particles released in such collisions can interact coherently with the solar wind electromagnetically. The resultant magnetic perturbations are readily identified when they pass spacecraft equipped with magnetometers. We can use such observations to obtain the spatial and size distribution as well as temporal variation of the debris streams.\nA test of this technique has been performed and debris streams both leading and trailing asteroid 138175 have been identified. There is a finite spread across the original orbit and most of the co-orbitals were tens of meters in diameter before the disruptive collisions. We estimate that there were tens of thousands of such co-orbiting objects, comprising only 1% of the original mass of the parent asteroid but greatly increasing the impact hazard. A loss of the co-orbitals since 1970s has been inferred from observations with a decay time consistent with that calculated from the existing collisional model [Grün et al., 1985]. Therefore disruptive collisions are the main loss mechanism of the co-orbiting debris associated with 138175.\nIn summary, our technique helps us to identify which NEOs are accompanied by hazardous debris trails. Although our technique provides only the statistical properties, it indicates where high resolution optical surveys should be obtained in order to identify and track specific hazardous bodies.",

            "abstract": "In 1997, the Kagoshima earthquake doublet, consisting of two closely associated Mw ~ 6 strike-slip events, five km and 48 days apart, has occurred in southwest Japan. The location is where an E-W trending discontinuity along 32°N latitude on southern Kyushu Island is clearly defined in GPS velocities, indicating the presence of a highly active left-lateral shear zone. However, there have not been any obvious indications of active faulting at the surface prior to the earthquake doublet, which could be associated with this shear zone. Three-dimensional inversion of magnetotelluric sounding data obtained in the source region of the earthquake doublet reveals a near-vertical conductive zone with a width of 20 km, extending down to the base of the crust and perhaps into the upper mantle toward the Okinawa trough. The prominent conductor corresponds to the western part of the active shear zone. Elevated 3He/4He ratios in groundwaters sampled from hot spring and drinking water wells suggest the emission of mantle-derived helium from the seismic source region. The geophysical and geochemical observations are significant indications that the invasion of mantle fluids into the crust, driven by upwelling asthenosphere from the Okinawa trough, triggers the notable left-lateral shearing in the zone in the present-day subduction system. In addition, the existence of aqueous fluids in and below the seismogenic layer could change the strength of the zones, and alter the local stress regime, resulting in the occurrence of the 1997 earthquake doublet.",

            "abstract": "The 1 April 2014 Iquique, Chile Mw 8.1 earthquake occurred at 23:46(UTC) along a mega-thrust fault off northernmost Chile, where the Nazca plate is subducting beneath the South America plate at a convergence rate of ~8 cm/year. Northernmost Chile has been quiescent for 136 years since the 1877 M 8.6 earthquake, resulting in a current “North Chile seismic gap” stretching for ~450 km length along the strike of the plate boundary. According to the US Geological Survey (USGS) catalog, the mainshock was preceded by intensive foreshock sequence lasting around 15 days. To obtain a precise record of the foreshock sequence before the 2014 Iquique, Chile Mw 8.1 earthquake, we applied a matched-filter technique to continuous seismograms recorded near the source region. We newly detected about 10 times the number of seismic events listed in the routinely constructed earthquake catalog, and identified multiple sequences of earthquake migrations at speeds of 2–10 km/day, both along-strike and down-dip on the fault plane, up-dip of the mainshock area. In addition, we found out repeating earthquakes from the newly detected events, likely indicating aseismic slip along the plate boundary fault during the foreshock sequence. These observations suggest the occurrence of multiple slow-slip events up-dip of the mainshock area. The final slow-slip event, which had the fastest migration speed, migrated toward the mainshock nucleation point. We interpret that several parts of the plate boundary fault perhaps experienced slow slip, causing stress loading on the prospective largest slip patch of the mainshock rupture (Kato and Obara, 2014).",

            "abstract": "Unusual precipitation increase during summer through winter had continued since 2004 in the central Lena river basin, eastern Siberia. The precipitation increase led to deepening active layer (permafrost thawing near the surface) accompanying with remarkable increase in soil moisture. The perennially waterlogged conditions had exacerbated the boreal forest habitat; that is, larch trees had widely withered and died in this region. The present study clarified spatial extent of permafrost and forest degradation due to the unexpected hydro-climate-driven damages. We have attempted to extract the degraded boreal forest based on satellite image analyses, along with expansion of the perennially waterlogged surface area. We used ALOS-PALSAR and AVNIR-2 images taken from 2006 to 2009. Classification of waterlogged area was performed by PALSAR images with supervised classification based on a microwave backscattering coefficient. Then, we compared the distribution of the waterlogged area between multi-years. Additional supervised classification of boreal forest change was conducted using AVNIR-2 images. Both classifications produced the multi-years change in degraded boreal forest at the intensive observational sites in both left and right bank of Lena River near Yakutsk. In the right bank area, most of alas lakes expanded and boreal forest on the periphery of lakes turned to waterlogged surface. In the left bank area, in contrast, waterlogged surface expanded at concaved terrain and along valleys in conjunction with forest degradation. Field survey supported that humidified and deepening active layer along slope and near alas lakes correspond with the gradient of forest degradation and enhanced thermokarst activity. Both of increasing precipitation and thawing ice in permafrost might cause the degradation. In brief, the method combining ALOS satellite images has possibility to detect permafrost and forest degradation caused by wet climate in boreal forest.",

            "abstract": "This paper develops a Bayesian inversion to infer spatio-temporal parameters of the tsunami source (sea surface) due to megathrust earthquakes. To date, tsunami-source parameter uncertainties are poorly studied. In particular, the effects of parametrization choices (e.g., discretisation, finite rupture velocity, dispersion) on uncertainties have not been quantified. This approach is based on a trans-dimensional self-parametrization of the sea surface, avoids regularization, and provides rigorous uncertainty estimation that accounts for model-selection ambiguity associated with the source discretisation. The sea surface is parametrized using self-adapting irregular grids which match the local resolving power of the data and provide parsimonious solutions for complex source characteristics. Finite and spatially variable rupture velocity fields are addressed by obtaining causal delay times from the Eikonal equation. Data are considered from ocean-bottom pressure and coastal wave gauges. Data predictions are based on Green-function libraries computed from ocean-basin scale tsunami models for cases that include/exclude dispersion effects. Green functions are computed for elementary waves of Gaussian shape and grid spacing which is below the resolution of the data. The inversion is applied to tsunami waveforms from the great Mw=9.0 2011 Tohoku-Oki (Japan) earthquake. Posterior results show a strongly elongated tsunami source along the Japan trench, as obtained in previous studies. However, we find that the tsunami data is fit with a source that is generally simpler than obtained in other studies, with a maximum amplitude less than 5 m. In addition, the data are sensitive to the spatial variability of rupture velocity and require a kinematic source model to obtain satisfactory fits which is consistent with other work employing linear multiple time-window parametrizations.",

            "abstract": "It is 35 years since it was first demonstrated that interannual variations in seasonal Australian region tropical cyclone (TC) activity could be predicted using simple indices of the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO). That demonstration (Nicholls, 1979), which was surprising and unexpected at the time, relied on only 25 years of data (1950-1975), but its later confirmation eventually led to the introduction of operational seasonal tropical cyclone activity. It is worth examining how well the ENSO-TC relationship has performed, over the period since 1975. Changes in observational technology, and even how a tropical cyclone is defined, have affected the empirical relationships between ENSO and seasonal activity, and ways to overcome this in forecasting seasonal activity will be discussed. Such changes also complicate the investigation of long-term trends in cyclone activity. The early work linked cyclone activity to local sea surface temperature thereby leading to the expectation that global warming would result in an increase in cyclone activity. But studies in the 1990s (eg., Nicholls et al., 1998) suggested that such an increase in activity was not occurring, neither in the Australian region nor elsewhere. Trends in Australian tropical cyclone activity will be discussed, and the confounding influence of factors such as changes in observational technologies will be examined.\nNicholls, N. 1979.

            "abstract": "Many areas of the Arctic are undergoing rapid permafrost and ecosystem transitions resulting from a combination of industrial development and climate change as summer sea ice retreats and abundant Arctic natural resources become more accessible for extraction. The Bovanenkovo Gas Field (BGF) in Russia and the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield (PBO) in Alaska are among the oldest and most extensive industrial complexes in the Arctic, situated in areas with extensive ice-rich permafrost. Ongoing studies of cumulative effects in both regions are part of the Northern Eurasia Earth-Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI) and NASA’s Land-Cover Land-Use Change (LCLUC) research. Comparative analysis is focused on changes occurring due to different climate, permafrost, land-use, and disturbance regimes in the BGF and PBO and along bioclimate transects that contain both fields. Documentation of the changes in relationship to the different geoecological and social-economic conditions will help inform management approaches to minimize the effects of future activities. We compare the area of disturbance in the two fields and some of the key differences in the permafrost conditions. Detailed remote sensing and geoecological mapping in both areas reveal major differences in permafrost conditions that have implications for total ecological function. At BGF, highly erodible sands and the presence of massive tabular ground ice near the surface contributes to landslides and thermo-denudation of slopes. At PBO, ice-wedge degradation is the most noticeable change, where thermokarst is expanding rapidly along ice-wedges adjacent to roads and in areas away from roads. Between 1990 and 2001, coincident with strong atmospheric warming during the 1990s, natural thermokarst resulted in conversion of low-centered ice-wedge polygons to high-centered polygons, more active lakeshore erosion and increased landscape and habitat heterogeneity. These geoecololgical changes have local and regional consequences to wildlife habitat, land-use, and infrastructure. A conceptual model describes how infrastructure-related factors, including road dust and roadside flooding, are contributing to more extensive thermokarst in areas adjacent to roads and gravel pads in the PBO.",

            "abstract": "Seismic monitoring at injection sites (e.g., CO2sequestration, waste water disposal, hydraulic fracturing) has become an increasingly important tool for hazard identification and avoidance. The information obtained from this data is often limited to seismic event properties (e.g., location, approximate time, moment tensor), the accuracy of which greatly depends on the estimated elastic velocity models. However, creating accurate velocity models from passive array data remains a challenging problem. Common techniques rely on picking arrivals or matching waveforms requiring high signal-to-noise data that is often not available for the magnitude earthquakes observed over injection sites.\nWe present a new method for obtaining elastic velocity information from earthquakes though full-wavefield wave-equation imaging and adjoint-state tomography. The technique exploits images of the earthquake source using various imaging conditions based upon the P- and S-wavefield data. We generate image volumes by back propagating data through initial models and then applying a correlation-based imaging condition. We use the P-wavefield autocorrelation, S-wavefield autocorrelation, and P-S wavefield cross-correlation images. Inconsistencies in the images form the residuals, which are used to update the P- and S-wave velocity models through adjoint-state tomography.\nBecause the image volumes are constructed from all trace data, the signal-to-noise in this space is increased when compared to the individual traces. Moreover, it eliminates the need for picking and does not require any estimation of the source location and timing. Initial tests show that with reasonable source distribution and acquisition array, velocity anomalies can be recovered. Future tests will apply this methodology to other scales from laboratory to global.",

            "abstract": "This study compares the use of high-resolution multispectral WorldView images and high density Lidar data for individual tree segmentation. The application focuses on coniferous and deciduous forests in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The tree objects are obtained in two ways: a hybrid region-merging segmentation method with multispectral images, and a top-down and bottom-up region-growing method with Lidar data.\nThe hybrid region-merging method is used to segment individual tree from multispectral images. It integrates the advantages of global-oriented and local-oriented region-merging strategies into a unified framework. The globally most-similar pair of regions is used to determine the starting point of a growing region. The merging iterations are constrained within the local vicinity, thus the segmentation is accelerated and can reflect the local context.\nThe top-down region-growing method is adopted in coniferous forest to delineate individual tree from Lidar data. It exploits the spacing between the tops of trees to identify and group points into a single tree based on simple rules of proximity and likely tree shape. The bottom-up region-growing method based on the intensity and 3D structure of Lidar data is applied in deciduous forest. It segments tree trunks based on the intensity and topological relationships of the points, and then allocate other points to exact tree crowns according to distance.\nThe accuracies for each method are evaluated with field survey data in several test sites, covering dense and sparse canopy. Three types of segmentation results are produced: true positive represents a correctly segmented individual tree, false negative represents a tree that is not detected and assigned to a nearby tree, and false positive represents that a point or pixel cluster is segmented as a tree that does not in fact exist. They respectively represent correct-, under-, and over-segmentation. Three types of index are compared for segmenting individual tree from multispectral image and Lidar data: recall, precision and F-score.\nThis work explores the tradeoff between the expensive Lidar data and inexpensive multispectral image. The conclusion will guide the optimal data selection in different density canopy areas for individual tree segmentation, and contribute to the field of forest remote sensing.",

Source regions of the FW CMEs were identified using SOHO/EIT, STEREO/EUVI, and SDO/AIA. Using STEREO EUV observations, we are able to determine the source locations behind the west limb with a high degree of accuracy. The >10 MeV proton flux at Earth was examined using GOES/SEM. The >10 MeV proton flux at the STEREO spacecraft was estimated using STEREO/HET, which detects energetic protons in 11 channels from 13.6 to 100 MeV. We extrapolated the proton flux in the 10 - 150 MeV range with a power-law fit and derived the corresponding >10 MeV proton flux. For each FW CME, we have three proton flux values for three different relative source longitudes with respect to the observer. The SEP association rate is determined by dividing the number of SEP-producing CMEs by the total number of events in each 20° bin of the relative source longitude. We found that the SEP association rate peaked at the W60°–W80° bin and the magnetically well-connected longitudes range from W20°–W100°. We also found that the rate distribution is skewed: the eastern wing of the rate distribution drops slowly compared to the western wing. This indicates that the eastern CMEs (longitude < 0°) have a better chance to reach the magnetic field line connected to Earth than the far-behind-the-west-limb (longitude > 120°) CMEs.",

Satellite measurements of gravity have been made primarily by four techniques: satellite tracking from land stations using either lasers or Doppler radio systems, satellite positioning by GNSS/GPS, satellite to satellite tracking over distances of a few hundred km using microwaves, and through a gravity gradiometer (radar altimeters also measure the gravity field, but over the oceans only). We discuss the challenges in the measurement of gravity by different instruments, especially time-variable gravity. A special concern is how to bridge a possible gap in time between the end of life of the current GRACE satellite pair, launched in 2002, and a future GRACE Follow-On pair to be launched in 2017. One challenge in combining data from different measurement systems consists of their different spatial and temporal resolutions and the different ways in which they alias short time scale signals. Typically satellite measurements of gravity are expressed in spherical harmonic coefficients (although expansions in terms of ‘mascons’, the masses of small spherical caps, has certain advantages). Taking advantage of correlations among spherical harmonic coefficients described by empirical orthogonal functions and derived from GRACE data it is possible to localize the otherwise coarse spatial resolution of the laser and Doppler derived gravity models. This presentation discusses the issues facing a climate data record of time variable mass flux using these different data sources, including its validation.",

The relativistic electron response to these two kinds of drivers is typically different, with the former often leading to a slower buildup of electrons and the latter energizing electrons rapidly. Observations made by the REPT instrument during this period show that both radial transport and local in-situ processes may be involved in the energization of relativistic electrons. We present a detailed analysis of pitch angle distributions, electron spectra and their temporal evolution as well as the phase space density variability of relativistic electrons seen by both the REPT instruments on the Van Allen probes spacecraft. Additional data characterizing the plasma waves and magnetospheric electric and magnetic fields during this period obtained by the EMFISIS and the EFW instruments are examined to fully establish the nature of the electron response during this complex event.",

            "abstract": "Slopes on steady-state soil-mantled hillslopes tend to increase downslope in a way that balances local transport capacity with the sediment supplied from progressively larger source areas. Most predictions for the transport of soil depend purely on topographic slope and constants. Thus, soil mantled topography should evolve toward smooth forms in which soils act to buffer these forms from the underlying geologic structure. However, in the Gabilan Mesa, CA, oscillations in the slope of soil-mantled hillslopes mirror oscillations in the underlying stratigraphy. Using field measurements of stratigraphy and soil depths, topographic analysis, and numerical modeling, we demonstrate that variations in rock type can impact the form of soil-mantled hillslopes. Specifically, variations in the properties of underlying rocks may yield different soil thicknesses. Balancing transport rates across these variations in thickness requires slopes to change when soil transport depends on both soil thickness and slope. A compilation of published data on the variation in activity with depth of various transport processes provides the basis for a geomorphic transport law (GTL) that generalizes the depth dependence of various transport processes. While this GTL is explicitly depth dependent, it is also capable of describing situations in which hillslope transport is relatively insensitive to variations in thickness and therefore essentially equivalent to existing formulations. We use dimensional analysis and numerical modeling to demonstrate the conditions under which transport on soil mantled slopes, and consequently topographic forms, may be sensitive to variations in soil thickness and therefore lithology.",

The Lorenz model is a simple testbed for numerical simulations. We used a two time-scale Lorenz 63 (L63) model to mimic the ocean-atmosphere coupled system and a Lorenz 96 (L96) model coupled to the atmospheric component representing a small-scale spatially resolved system. The full set of equations is defined as the “truth”. The spatially resolved system will be bulk-parameterized by three different schemes: (i) deterministic, (ii) stochastic parameterization , and (iii) perturbed parameter. Perfect initial conditions are applied to investigate pure model error. Although stochastic parameterizations have been proven to resolve systematic errors, they become computationally expensive as the stochastic dimension increases. We propose to apply “informative” probability distributions for the perturbed parameter scheme to resolve systematic bias where previous research have failed to do so. The proposed scheme uses a stochastic spectral method, Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), to reduce model runs while achieving fast convergence to the exact solution. PCE is implemented as an efficient “surrogate” model to generate a large ensemble. The PCE-accelerated informative perturbed parameter scheme generated competitive and reliable ensemble forecasts.",

Despite the known importance of “blue-sky” research that doesn’t have immediate commercial or social applications, it continues to struggle for funding from both government and industry.

Here I will discuss how new digital platforms empower researchers and organisations to showcase their research using video, allowing wider community engagment and funding that can be used to directly support young, risky, blue-sky research that is so important to the future of science.

IODP is one of the world’s largest international marine research programs that is dedicated to advancing understanding of Earth’s processes through scientific drilling of the ocean floor. Few of the activities proposed here can be easily integrated into any 2YC geoscience class. These include, live video conferencing with JOIDES Resolution Ocean Drilling research vessel which provides a unique opportunity for the students to ask questions from the shipboard scientists and learn about their research as well as their experience onboard. In class, students will be introduced to search and use data available through scientific drilling to answer scientific questions. Furthermore, organizing field trips to the IODP Gulf Coast repository will provide hands on experience to describe and analyze cores from the ocean floor. These simple additions to the curriculum will provide wide range of unique experiences to the students at 2YC which will encourage them to pursue advanced studies in ocean sciences and/or careers in scientific ocean drilling.",

            "abstract": "It is important to predict time of landslide occurrence for mitigation of landslide disasters. Several physically-based models have been applied for assessing spatial pattern of landslide susceptibility. However, it is still difficult to predict both time and location of landslide occurrence using physically-based model. A new model which is called “idH-SLIDER” (revised H-SLIDER for assessing rainfall intensity duration thresholds.) has been proposed to assess the time and location of landslide occurrence. We combine a hillslope hydrology model proposed by Rosso et al.,[2006] and infinite slope stability analysis to assess rainfall intensity duration thresholds for each grid. The hillslope hydrology is modeled by coupling the conservation of mass of soil water with the Darcy’s law used to describe a seepage flow. Application of this model can be derived from rainfall event in 21.July, 2009 in Hofu city, Japan. Several parameters, including soil depth, geometry and etc. are composed of our detailed field survey. By integrating the field survey data and the collected rainfall data, it is possible to calculate rainfall intensity duration thresholds. There are: (1) It is realizable to set an appropriate value for cohesion of soil and reproduce the time and location of shallow landslide during the rainfall event. (2) Only few grid cells where observed rainfall data exceeded our calculated rainfall intensity duration thresholds. It has been proved by calculating the rainfall data of last 37 years. (3) Those results integrate with the historical landslide patterns evaluated by aerial photograph interpretation. And the result could be matched ultimately.(4) In result of sensitive analysis of soil thickness and soil mechanical and hydraulic parameters, it is clarified that condition of soil thickness is thicker or soil cohesion is weaker generated missing ratio increasing. According to these results, the method which has been proposed is suitable for reproducing the spatial pattern of rainfall intensity threshold and predictable time and location of shallow landslides triggered rainfall with rainfall data and few parameters.",

            "abstract": "A sudden onset of cholera in South Sudan\n, in April 2014 in Northern Bari in Juba town resulted in more than 400 cholera cases after four weeks of initial outbreak with a case of fatality rate of CFR 5.4%. The total number of reported cholera cases for the period of April to July, 2014 were 5,141 including 114 deaths. With the limited efficacy of cholera vaccines, it is necessary to develop mechanisms to predict cholera occurrence and thereafter devise intervention strategies for mitigating impacts of the disease. Hydroclimatic processes, primarily precipitation and air temperature are related to epidemic and episodic outbreak of cholera. However, due to coarse resolution of both datasets, it is not possible to precisely locate the geographical location of disease. Here, using Land Surface Temperature (LST) from MODIS sensors, we have developed an algorithm to identify regions susceptible for cholera. Conditions for occurrence of cholera were detectable at least one month in advance in South Sudan and were statistically sensitive to hydroclimatic anomalies of land surface and air temperature, and precipitation. Our results indicate significant spatial and temporal averaging required to infer usable information from LST over South Sudan. Preliminary results that geographically location of cholera outbreak was identifiable within 1km resolution of the LST data.",

            "abstract": "The zonal workshops organized by the space education outreach unit of the African Regional Centre for Space Science and Technology Education utilized recent catastrophic events in Nigeria to attract pre-collegiate youths to space science and technology (SST). About 200 school children, aged between 10 and 18 years participated in the program which was coordinated at 2 different geopolitical zones in Nigeria in 2014. The 2-day event was packed with a lot of fun-filled, hands-on educational activities demonstrating the use of outer space to address prevailing socio-economic problems in the nation. The students were introduced to the Nigerian Earth Observation Satellites, and learned why these satellites cannot be used to track the school girls kidnapped by the terrorist group in the northern part of the country. They were also introduced to other types of satellites and participated in activities on the applications of TRMM satellite data to monitor flood events in Nigeria. The Global Positioning System (GPS) technology was introduced as a navigational tool to curb criminal activities in the country and participants used the hand-held GPS unit for geocaching. The program culminated in the launching of space clubs in all the participating schools and a teacher from each school received resource materials on DVD to nurture the space club. To assess the impact of the workshop on the knowledge level of the participants in space science, quiz competitions were administered and the average score of the students was above 70%. The enthusiasm displayed by the students, coupled with the brilliant performance in the evaluation tests, indicated that this method of informal education, that linked science to the alleviation of national disasters is viable, not only for stimulating the interest of Nigerian pre-collegiate youths in SST, but also to inspire the young learners and develop their interest in the Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).",

            "abstract": "Disaster scenarios for Emergency Management (EM) exercises are a widely-used and effective tool for communicating hazard information to policy makers, EM personnel, lifelines operators and communities in general. It is crucial that the scenarios are as realistic as possible. Major disasters however, contain a series of cascading consequences, both environmental and social, which are difficult to model. Consequently, only recently have large-scale exercises included such processes; incorporating these in small- and medium-scale scenarios has yet to be attempted. This study details work undertaken in a recent medium-scale earthquake exercise in New Zealand to introduce such cascading processes into the disaster scenario. Given limited time, data, and funding, we show that the co-production of knowledge between natural disaster scientists, EM personnel, and governance and lifelines organisations can yield detailed, realistic scenarios.\nUsing the co-production process, scenario development was able to identify where the pre-exercise state of knowledge was insufficient. This enabled a focussed research response driven by end-user needs. This found that in general, seismic hazard (ground shaking) and its likely impacts were well known and understood by all parties. However, subsequent landsliding and associated effects were poorly known and understood and their potential impacts unconsidered. Scenario development therefore focussed primarily on understanding these processes and their potential effects. This resulted in cascading hazards being included in a medium-scale NZ exercise for the first time. Further, all participants were able to focus on the potential impacts on their specific sectors, increasing the level of knowledge of cascading processes across all parties. Using group based discussions throughout the design process allowed a detailed scenario to be created, fostered stronger inter-disciplinary relationships, and identified areas for further research. Consequently, further detailed research has begun specifically into the impacts from secondary effects in an effort to further increase resilience to future events.",

            "abstract": "Carbon fluxes were estimated for 84 regions (54 lands + 30 oceans) over the globe during the period of 1990−2011. We used (1) the CCSR/NIES/FRCGC AGCM-based Chemistry Transport Model (ACTM), (2) atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 74 sites from GLOBALVIEW-CO2 (2013) data product, (3) Seasonally varying a presubtracted fluxes for atmosphere-ocean exchange (Takahashi et al., 2009), (4) interannually varying a priori fossil fuel fluxes (incl. cement production) from CDIAC global totals and EDGAR4.2 spatial distributions, and (5) 3-hourly terrestrial biosphere fluxes are constructed from the annually balanced CASA and JRA-25 reanalysis meteorology (Y. Niwa, Pers. Comm., 2013).\nAs a result of time-dependent inversions, mean total flux (excluding fossil fuel) for the period 1990−2011 is estimated to be −3.33 GtC/yr, where land (incl. biomass burning and land use change) and ocean absorb an average rate of −1.98 and −1.35 GtC/yr, respectively. The land uptake is mainly due to northern land (−1.57 GtC/yr), while the tropical and southern lands contribute −0.03 and −0.38 GtC/yr, respectively. It is also found that Boreal North America and Boreal Eurasia show negative trends in the estimated fluxes during the analysis period. The global ocean sink has no clear long-term trend in the period. Results with different inversion settings and for other regions will be discussed. Our analysis suggests that no known transport bias in ACTM forward simulation allow us to estimate CO2 fluxes at good accuracy at hemispheric and regional scale.\nAcknowledgements.

            "abstract": "As rainfall characteristic is more quixotic and localized, it is important to provide a prompt and accurate warning for public. To monitor localized heavy rainfall, a reliable disaster monitoring system with advanced remote observation technology and high-precision display system is needed. To advance even more accurate weather monitoring using weather radar, there have been growing concerns regarding the real-time changes of mapping radar observations on geographical coordinate systems along with the visualization and display methods of radar data based on spatial interpolation techniques and geographical information system (GIS). Currently, the method of simultaneously displaying GIS and radar data is widely used to synchronize the radar and ground systems accurately, and the method of displaying radar data in the 2D GIS coordinate system has been extensively used as the display method for providing weather information from weather radar. This paper proposes a realistic 3D weather radar data display technique with higher spatiotemporal resolution, which is based on the integration of 3D image processing and GIS interaction. This method is focused on stereoscopic visualization, while conventional radar image display works are based on flat or two-dimensional interpretation. Furthermore, using the proposed technique, the atmospheric change at each moment can be observed three-dimensionally at various geological locations simultaneously. Simulation results indicate that 3D display of weather radar data can be performed in real time. One merit of the proposed technique is that it can provide intuitive understanding of the influence of beam blockage by topography. Through an exact matching each 3D modeled radar beam with 3D GIS map, we can find out the terrain masked areas and accordingly it facilitates the precipitation correction from QPE underestimation caused by ground clutter filtering. It can also be expected that more accurate short-term forecasting will be possible using stereoscopic observation of weather phenomena changes.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurement of microtopography plays an important role in fluvial geomorphology. Whereof the surface is obscured by vegetation or landform, airborne remote sensing can be impractical and ground-based surveys using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) show promise. TLS provides high resolution observations of the land surface for relatively low cost and with simple setup. However, the scanning range is effectively limited to less than 100 m, requiring individual scenes to be merged in software to represent larger landforms. For studies requiring several scenes, an efficient scanning strategy should be established in advance to optimize for time, resolution and spatial coverage. This requires careful consideration of scanner placement to merge scenes. We address problems encountered with blind spots. TLS is generally conducted on a 2-m (or shorter) tripod and the low scanning angle to the land surface at long distance inevitably causes blind spots in rugose or complex terrain. Similarly, the distance between TLS placement points is limited by the ability to resolve matching targets from sequential surveys. Here we present a simple geometry-based scanning plan regardless of the type and range of the instrument, with modification of the survey instrument platform. The half of a minimum range is used to make at least 18% of a superposed area with the next scan. Since scanning height barely affects the scanning range, the tripod was substituted to a 3-m stepladder and the platform of the scanner was modified to level and adjust the device easily with one hand. The results show that the new scanning plan performs well regardless of the topography and figure of the area of interest, with sufficient superposed area for combination with other adjacent scans. The modification of the platform also turned out to be more efficient to secure the observing angle and improve usability. The physical enhancement for TLS will provide valuable opportunity to conduct a standardized and field-oriented work in a practical manner.",

Their comprehensive descriptions are vital for watersheds with distinct seasons, low runoff efficiencies, large coefficients of variation, and highly skewed distributions – such as for the Salt and Verde Rivers of the arid lower Colorado River Basin. Long data records together with an amplified temperature response of these watersheds relative to global trends enable a thorough exploration of temperature sensitivity and precipitation elasticity grounded in observational data. Regression analyses and kriging methods have been employed in this study to develop these seasonal heuristics. While results align with expectations at the mean, trends were revealed across key variables, posing important stream flow implications depending on relative position within the distributions. Winter temperature sensitivity is nearly indistinguishable at low evapotranspiration response, while it is significant in summer with overland flow impairment. It is lessened by an active monsoon season, which also dilutes loss contributions at reservoirs. Precipitation elasticity of runoff is often assumed to be approximately 2.0, but this study revealed higher values in winter and lower ones in summer, with smaller elasticity when approaching the base flow level and in the upper range of runoff efficiency. Descriptive algorithms have been derived that can be readily applied to distribution functions with any climate change assumption to assess stream flow impact and water resource sustainability for the region.",

            "abstract": "Chronological control of sedimentary deposits is a key to do paleoclimatic interpretations of proxy records and to compare them with records from other archives. Beyond the reach of radiocarbon dating there are however few options for developing chronological control. We present a detailed radiometrical-based chronological framework of a Norwegian Sea core archive that records ocean-ice sheet interactions in the Nordic Seas covering the time span 50-150 ka BP. The chronology is based on a detailed multi-proxy and multi-archive alignment of high resolution records from the Norwegian Sea and precisely radiometric dated speleothem δ18O record from both China and the Alps. This approach utilizes the close and well documented millennial and multi-centennial scale coupling between the North Atlantic climate variability (recorded in the Norwegian Sea records, the Greenland ice cores and in the Alpine speleothems) and the Asian Monsoon system recorded in the Chinese speleothem δ18O. One intriguing feature of the Norwegian Sea record is that it often is more similar to the Chinese speleothem records than to the Greenland ice core records. The alignment is aided by a tephrostratigraphic link to the Greenland ice cores which provide an independent test of the age model and alignment. Uncertainties are addressed by Bayesian age-depth modeling. The radiometric-based age model and the quantified uncertainties enable an independent comparison between the Nordic Seas ocean-ice sheet interaction and other absolutely dated records such as U/Th dated sea-level indices and orbital parameters. This improves our ability to interpret the ocean–ice sheet interactions of the polar north in a global context over this time span that comprises a glacial-interglacial cycle.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is known to play a key role in controlling surface moisture and heat fluxes, but much of the evidence for this at large scales is based on analysis of data from reanalyses, satellite remote sensing and model data. As such, the relationships are subject to the errors and biases in these data sources. This study evaluates direct observational evidence for land-atmosphere interactions using data from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) which hosts monitoring sites for over 100 locations across the U.S. covering a range of climates and land surface contexts. The relationship between warm season soil moisture deficits and temperature extremes is analyzed for 80 sites that have sufficient data. Statistically significant negative correlations are found in many sites between the number of hot days and soil moisture, with the strength of the relationship increasing from the humid east to the drier Midwest. The signal in the inter-mountain west is somewhat mixed. To distinguish the sources of temperature extremes between local coupling and advection, we estimate advection at each site from meteorological data from the North American Land Data Assimilation (NLDAS2). Although the advection estimates are uncertain, they imply that local coupling can play a significant role in temperature extremes during dry periods. We further characterize individual heat waves according to the estimated contribution of advected heat or local coupling to their emergence and persistence. Heat wave events are generally terminated by precipitation events. The results have implications for understanding land-atmosphere coupling across climate regimes and the utility of model-derived estimates to represent observed behavior at large scales.",

This physical system thus challenges standard data assimilation methods relying on underlying assumptions of Gaussian distributions of measurements and data-model differences, where innovations to the model are small. We have therefore developed a data assimilation method tailored to these properties of the inner radiation belt, analogous to the ensemble Kalman filter but for the unique cases of non-Gaussian model and measurement errors, and non-linear model and measurement distributions. We apply this method to the inner radiation belt proton populations, using the SIZM inner belt model [Selesnick et al., 2007] and SAMPEX/PET and HEO proton observations to select the most likely ensemble members contributing to the state of the inner belt. We will describe the algorithm, the method of generating ensemble members, our choice of minimizing the difference between instrument counts not phase space densities, and demonstrate the method with our reanalysis of the inner radiation belt throughout solar cycle 23. We will report on progress to continue our assimilation into solar cycle 24 using the Van Allen Probes/RPS observations.",

            "abstract": "Geological CO2 sequestration is a promising method to reduce atmospheric CO2 and deep saline aquifers is one of the most important options due to their capacity for CO2 storage. Thus, a better understanding of two immiscible brine-CO2 mobility and its saturation, including invading patterns in deep saline aquifers as CO2 storage sites is required. Lenormand (1990) explored the invading patterns of two immiscible fluids in porous media with a transition region and three dominant regions: capillary fingering, viscous fingering, and stable displacement. These are determined by two main aspect ratios Nm and Nc through experimental studies using micromodel. Micromodel provides the opportunity to discover unrecognized processes, and test existing theories and assumptions in fluid flow through porous media. In this study, the micromodel was used to explore the effects of the scCO2 injecting velocity and ionic strength on invading patterns in geological CO2 sequestration. When scCO2 was injected into the micromodel that has already saturated with brine, the brine in the micromodel was displaced by injected scCO2. Continuous scCO2 injection into the micromodel leaded the scCO2 to pass through the micromodel. And the scCO2-brine displacement distribution in the micromodel remained constant during additional 100 PV scCO2 injection after injecting scCO2 passed through micromodel. When scCO2 passed through the porous media, the scCO2-brine displacement distribution represented the maximum displacement ratio. Results showed that scCO2-brine displacement ratios increased with: elevated pressures in the range of 3MPa~8MPa, decreased ionic strength from 5M to 1M NaCl, and increased scCO2 injecting velocity up to 40 μL/min. Also, Nm and Nc obtained in this study are located in transition region of the invading patterns suggested by Lenormand (1990).",

Establishing a sound management plan of multi-purpose groundwater utilization in Pingtung plain is imperial for water resources sustainability. When extracting groundwater for such multi-purpose use, the major concerns are to assure the meets for the different water quality standards for various water use sectors demand and minimizing the pumping impacts on aquifers. The groundwater quality and hydrogeological conditions play important roles in multi-purpose groundwater utilization. Management and effective use of groundwater typically face great challenges, due to the spatial variability of groundwater quality and hydrogeological condition. This study combines the variability of groundwater quality and hydrological condition to propose zonal management of multi-purpose use of groundwater in Pingtung plain. Based on the water quality standards for various groundwater utilization sectors, the integration of hydrochemical parameters are used to delineate most appropriate zones of various groundwater utilization sectors. For evaluation of hydrogeological condition, transmissivity which represents the ability of water transmitted in aquifer is adopted to determine the most suitable zones of groundwater extraction. Based on the analytical results of the water quality parameters and transmissivity in combination with actual groundwater utilization, a zonal management plan of multi-purpose groundwater utilization is established. The framework in this project can provide an effective tool for government administrator establishing a zonal management of multi-purpose groundwater utilization in Pingtung plain.",

Unfortunately, many terrestrial proxies—tree rings, speleothems, leaf margin analyses, etc.—are influenced by the effects of both temperature and precipitation. Methods that can isolate the effects of temperature alone are needed, and clumped isotope thermometry has the potential to be a useful tool for determining terrestrial climates. Multiple studies have shown that the fraction of 13C—18O bonds in carbonates is inversely related to the temperature at which the rocks formed and may be a useful proxy for reconstructing temperatures on land. An in-depth survey of lacustrine carbonates, however, has not yet been published. Therefore we have been measuring the abundance of 13C18O16O in the CO2 produced by the dissolution of modern lake samples’ carbonate minerals in phosphoric acid and comparing results to independently known estimates of lake water temperature and air temperature. Some of the sample types we have investigated include endogenic carbonates, freshwater gastropods, bivalves, microbialites, and ooids. ",

            "abstract": "Using coupled 3D mantle convection and planetary tectonics models of bi-stable systems, we show how system behaviors for mobile-lid and stagnant-lid states scale as functions of internal heating rates (Q) and basal Ra (Rab). With parameter ranges for temperature- and depth-dependant viscosities: 1e4 – 3e4, Rab: 1e5– 3e5, Q: 0 – 100, and yield stress: 1e4 – 2e5, it can be shown the internal temperatures, velocities, heat fluxes, and system behaviors for mobile-lid and stagnant-lid states diverge, for equivalent parameter values, as a function of increasing Q. For the mobile-lid regime, yielding behavior in the upper boundary layer strongly influences the dynamics of the system. Internal temperatures, and consequently temperature-dependant viscosities, vary strongly as a function of yield stress for a given Q. The temperature distribution across the upper and lower mantles are sub-adiabatic for low to moderate yield stress, and adiabatic to super-adiabatic for high yield stresses. Across the parameter range considered, and for fixed yield stress, the Nu across the basal boundary (Nub) is positive and only weakly dependant on Q (varies by ~ 9%). Nub varies strongly as a function of yield stress (maximum variation of ~84%). Both mobile-lid velocities and lid-thicknesses are yield stress dependant for a given Q and Ra. In contrast to mobile-lids, the stagnant-lid regime is governed by the relative inefficiency of heat transport through the surface boundary layer. Internal temperatures are yield stress independent, and are on average 30% greater. Nub has a strong dependence on heating rates and surface boundary layer thicknesses. Within the parameter space considered, the maximum stagnant-lid Nub corresponds to the minimum mobile-lid Nub (for high yield stress), and decreases with increasing Q. For high Q, super-heated stagnant-lids may develop, with Nub< 0, and changes in trends for system behaviors. Planets with high levels of internal heating and/or high yield stresses (e.g. Super-Earths), may favor super-heated stagnant-lids early in their evolution. These regimes indicate reduced heat transport efficiencies (from the nominal stagnant-lid), and as a result, increasing heat flux into the core with increasing Q. Implications for terrestrial and Super-Earth planetary evolution will be discussed.",

Instead of progressing as a uniform front, the less viscous fluid forms fingers that vary in size and shape to create complex patterns. The interface created from these patterns affects mixing between the two fluids, and therefore understanding how these patterns evolve in time is of critical importance in applications such as enhanced oil recovery and microfluidics.\nIn this work, we focus on experimentally quantifying the impact miscible viscous fingering has on mixing. We use a radial Hele-Shaw cell as an analog of radial flows in porous media, and the local concentration field is measured temporally and spatially with the use of a fluorescein tracer in the injected fluid. We first observe two distinct growth regimes in the evolution of the diffuse invading front: an initial regime of rapid growth due to the viscous fingering instability, and a latter regime of growth equivalent to a stable uniform displacement. We propose a scaling framework that predicts the time of transition between these two regimes, and subsequently the total length of the invading front at that time. This information is then used in combination with concentration gradient information to present an overall scaling framework for the growth of the mixing zone, and the overall rate of mixing observed experimentally.",

However, it is currently difficult to maintain consistency of indexing content within IEDA schema, and perform unified or precise searching of the data in these diverse systems as each system maintains separate vocabularies, hierarchies, authority files, or sub taxonomies. We present here the IEDA Thesaurus, a system, which combines existing separate controlled vocabularies from the different systems under the IEDA schema into a single master controlled vocabulary, also introducing some new top facets for future long-term use. The IEDA thesaurus contains structured terminology for petrology, geochemistry, sedimentology, oceanography, geochronology, and volcanology, and other general metadata fields. 18 top facets (also called ‘top categories’) are defined, including equipment, geographic gazetteer, geologic ages, geologic units, materials, etc. The terms of the thesaurus are cross validated with others popular geoscience vocabularies such as GeoRef Thesaurus, U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System, Global Change Master Directory (GCMD), and Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET) ontologies. The thesaurus is organized along with the ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005 Guidelines for the Construction, Format, and Management of Monolingual Controlled Vocabularies, and is published using Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) format.

            "abstract": "Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) form in the lower stratosphere during the polar night due to the cold temperature inside the polar vortex. PSCs are important to understand because they are responsible for the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole and the ozone depletion over the Arctic. In this work, we explore the formation and evolution of STS particles (Super-cooled Ternary Solution) and NAT (Nitric-acid Trihydrate) particles using the SD-WACCM/CARMA model. SD-WACCM/CARMA couples the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model using Specific Dynamics with the microphysics model (CARMA). The 2010-2011 Arctic winter has been simulated because the Arctic vortex remained cold enough for PSCs from December until the end of March (Manney et al., 2011). The unusual length of this cold period and the presence of PSCs caused strong ozone depletion. This model simulates the growth and evaporation of the STS particles instead of considering them as being in equilibrium as other models do (Carslaw et al., 1995). This work also explores the homogeneous nucleation of NAT particles and derives a scheme for NAT formation based on the observed denitrification during the winter 2010-2011. The simulated microphysical features (particle volumes, size distributions, etc.) of both STS (Supercooled Ternary Solutions) and NAT particles show a consistent comparison with historical observations. The modeled evolution of PSCs and gas phase ozone related chemicals inside the vortex such as HCl and ClONO2 are compared with the observations from MLS, MIPAS and CALIPSO over this winter. The denitrification history indicate the surface nucleation rate from Tabazadeh et al. (2002) removes too much HNO3 over the winter. With a small modification of the free energy term of the equation, the denitification and the PSC backscattering features are much closer to the observations. H2O, HCl, O3 and ClONO2 are very close to MLS and MIPAS observations inside the vortex. The model underestimates ozone depletion for this winter by about 15%.",

            "abstract": "Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are recently discovered bacterial membrane lipids, ubiquitously present in peat bogs and soils, as well as in rivers, lakes and lake sediments. Their distribution appears to be controlled mainly by soil pH and annual mean air temperature (MAT) and they have been increasingly used as paleoclimate proxies in sedimentary records. In order to validate their application as paleoclimate proxies, it is essential evaluate the influence of small scale environmental variability on their distribution. Initial application of the original soil-based branched GDGT distribution proxy to lacustrine sediments from Valles Caldera, New Mexico (NM) was promising, producing a viable temperature record spanning two glacial/interglacial cycles. In this study, we assess the influence of analytical and spatial soil heterogeneity on the concentration and distribution of 9 branched GDGTs in soils from Valles Caldera, and show how this variability is propagated to MAT and pH estimates using multiple soil-based branched GDGT transfer functions. Our results show that significant differences in the abundance and distribution of branched GDGTs in soil can be observed even within a small area such as Valles Caldera. Although the original MBT-CBT calibration appears to give robust MAT estimates and the newest calibration provides pH estimates in better agreement with modern local soils in Valles Caldera, the environmental heterogeneity (e.g. vegetation type and soil moisture) appears to affect the precision of MAT and pH estimates. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of soils leads to significant variability among samples taken even from within a square meter. While such soil heterogeneity is not unknown (and is typically controlled for by combining multiple samples), this study quantifies heterogeneity relative to branched GDGT-based proxies for the first time, indicating that care must be taken with samples from heterogeneous soils in MAT and pH reconstructions.",

This finding allowed to reduce the problem to hall-less pair plasma fluid description and reproduce kinetic reconnection rates in large-scale single-fluid simulations by incorporating kinetic non-gyrotropic corrections to the induction equation. It was demonstrated that nongyrotropic effects incorporated into symmetric magnetotail reconnection could significantly alter the global magnetosphere evolution. In this paper we will extend the approach to non-symmetric configurations relevant to planetary magnetospheres and solar corona. We will examine the applicability of the non-gyrotropic fluid approach to nonsymmetric magnetic reconnection and demonstrate consequences of local kinetic effects on global evolution.",

How the SAM will respond increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the future remains uncertain. Understanding the variability of the SAM in the past under a colder climate such as during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) might provide some understanding of the response of the SAM under a future warmer climate. We analyzed the changes in the SAM during the LGM in comparison to pre-industrial (PI) simulations using five coupled ocean–atmosphere models (CCSM, FGOALS, IPSL, MIROC, HadCM) from the second phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP2). In CCSM, MIROC, IPSL, and FGOALS, the variability of the simulated SAM appears to be reduced in the LGM compared to the PI simulations, with a decrease in the standard deviation of the SAM index. Overall, four out of the five models suggest a weaker SAM amplitude in the LGM, consistent with a weaker SH polar vortex and westerly winds found in some proxy records and model analyses. The weakening of the SAM in the LGM was associated with an increase in the vertical propagation of Rossby waves in southern high latitudes.",

A groundwater sample contains a mixture of solute particles that recharged the aquifer at different times; thus the groundwater sample contains a distribution of solute ages. For tracers, solute age is equivalent to groundwater age, which quantifies the amount of time since groundwater has recharged the aquifer. For sorbing solutes, however, solute age is higher than groundwater age. One application of solute age is to quantify the persistence of contamination at a groundwater well. If a well is contaminated and the source of contamination is removed, the well will remain contaminated until all of the residual contamination has passed the aquifer. This persistence of contamination can be quantified by the solute age distribution. We present an adjoint approach for calculating solute age. In the adjoint approach, information is propagated upgradient and backward in time, from the well to the source of contamination. The solute age distribution can be obtained with one adjoint simulation. We demonstrate the use of the solute age distribution in evaluating the persistence of groundwater well contamination.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the responses of different ion species (H+, He+, He++, and O+) to fast plasma flows and local dipolarization in the plasma sheet in terms of energy density. We use energetic (9-210 keV) ion composition measurements made by the Geotail satellite at r = 10~31 RE. The results are summarized as follows: (1) whereas the O+-to-H+ ratio decreases with earthward flow velocity, it increases with tailward flow velocity with Vx dependence steeper for perpendicular flows than for parallel flows; (2) for fast earthward flows, the energy density of each ion species increases without any clear preference for heavy ions; (3) for fast tailward flows the ion energy density increases initially, then it decreases to below pre-flow levels except for O+; (4) the O+-to-H+ ratio does not increase through local dipolarization irrespective of dipolarization amplitude, background BZ, X distance, and VX; (5) in general, the H+ and He++ ions behave similarly. Result (1) can be attributed to radial transport along with the earthward increase of the background O+-to-H+ ratio. Results (2) and (4) indicate that ion energization associated with local dipolarization is not mass-dependent possibly because in the energy range of our interest the ions are not magnetized irrespective of species. In the tailward outflow region of reconnection, where the plasma sheet becomes thinner, the H+ ions escape along the field line more easily than the O+ ions, which possibly explains result (3). Result (5) suggests that the solar wind is the primary source of the high-energy H+ ions.",

The LE approach with its particle tracking algorithm and/or finite element methods (FEM) were employed to discretize interior nodes while the finite element method is selected to set up algebraic equations for boundary nodes. The use of FEM for boundary nodes alleviate the difficulty in dealing with flux and gradient types of boundary conditions. Extrapolations are no longer needed to handle flux or gradient type boundary conditions. In this new mixed LE&E approach, subsurface flow in variably saturated media can be efficiently dealt with. Three examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. First, a one-dimensional column problem is used to compare the accuracy of the mixed LE&E approach versus the traditional Eulerian approach. Second, a three-dimensional drainage problem was simulated to compare the CPU time between two approaches. Third, a three-dimensional pumping well problem was simulated. In all three examples, the mixed LE&E using relatively large time steps yielded superior results in terms of the accuracy and computational efficiency in comparison with the conventional Eulerian approach. The proposed mixed LE&E approach may contribute to the efficient numerical solutions of problems involving moving sharp fronts problems such as groundwater in real-world watersheds.",

The foraminiferal tests of Globigerinoides ruber were sampled from a marine sediment core MD05-2925 (9o20.60’S, 151o27.54’E; water depth 1661 m). Using inductively coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometric (ICP-SF-MS) techniques with 2s precision of 2-6%, we measured rare earth elements (REEs) to Ca ratios in the planktonic foraminifer to reconstruct precipitation and make inferences about the orbital-timescale evolution of the Pacific ITCZ. In addition to precessional feature, which is expressed in the East Asian counterpart, our record shows that the Pacific ITCZ migration was dominantly influenced by obliquity changes. Model simulations suggest that this obliquity forcing could be primarily delivered by a meridional thermal/pressure contrast, resulting from the asymmetric continental configuration between Asia and Australia in a coupled East Asian-Australian circulation system.",

The boundary clay is also enriched in Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Sb. Especially concentrations of Sb and As are unusually large. However, the origins and concentration processes of Sb are unknown. In this study, local structure around antimony atoms in K-T boundary clay from Stevns Klint, Denmark, was determined by Sb K-edge XAFS spectroscopy. The XAFS analyses give the information about the chemical state and coordination environment around Sb atoms and help identify of the concentration phase, and also may provide various kinds of information about the asteroid impact and mass extinction. The XAFS measurements were performed at the BL-NW10A beamline at the Photon Factory in KEK, Tsukuba, Japan. The XANES spectra and radial structure function (RSF) showed that Sb in K-T boundary clays is high oxidation state Sb5+ and occupies a SbO6 octahedral site. The Sb-O interatomic distance in K-T clay sample is 2.08(1) A. It is known that Sb5+ is stable form in soil and soil water under an equilibrium situation within the Earth’s surface environment. Antimony belongs to group 15 in the periodic table below arsenic, and the chemical behavior of Sb5+ is similar to that of As5+. Because there is a close correlation on co-precipitation between As and Fe (Ebihara and Miura, 1996; Sakai et al., 2007) , it is considered that Sb also correlates closely with Fe compounds (e.g., ferric hydroxides). Abundant ferric hydroxides occur in K-T boundary clays. It is considered that one of the reasons of abnormal high concentrations of Sb and As in K-T boundary clays is a lot of dust from impact ejecta falls with iron ions and deposits on surface of the Earth for a short period of time after the asteroid impact.\n",

            "abstract": "Wetland rice production is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere, and rice production is predicted to increase dramatically in the future due to expected growth in human populations. Mitigating GHG emissions from future rice production is possible with best management practices for water management, residue management and organic amendments. Policy initiatives and programs that promote practices to reduce GHG emissions from rice production will likely need robust methods for quantifying emission reductions. Frameworks based on process-based model provide one alternative for estimating emissions reductions. The advantages of this approach are that the models are relatively inexpensive to apply, incorporate a variety of management and environmental drivers influencing emissions, and can be used to predict future emissions for planning purposes. The disadvantages are that the models can be challenging to parameterize and evaluate, and require a relatively large amount of data.\nThe DayCent ecosystem model simulates plant and soil processes, and is an example of a model that could be used to quantify emission reductions for reporting mitigation activities associated with rice production systems. DayCent estimates methane emissions, which is the major source of GHG emissions from wetland rice, but also estimates nitrous oxide emissions and soil organic C stock changes. DayCent has been evaluated using data from China, explaining 83% of the variation in methane emissions from 72 experimental rice fields. In addition, DayCent has been applied regionally in the United States to estimate methane, nitrous oxide emissions, and soil C stock changes, in compliance with the guidelines for reporting GHG emissions to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Given the cost of alternatives, process-based models such as DayCent may offer the best way forward for estimating GHG emissions from rice production, and with quantification of uncertainty, could provide a robust framework for policy initiatives and programs in the future.",

            "abstract": "Coastal margins commonly host slope stability hazards that are influenced by hydrologic, geologic, and / or anthropogenic perturbations. A firm foundation for rigorously understanding the component contributions and process-based linkages among hydrologic and geomorphic response is comprehensive physics-based simulation. This study is motivated by the hydrologically-driven, creeping and episodic deep-seated bedrock slides that intersect a former section of the Pacific Coast Highway in the active landslide zone at Devil’s Slide near Pacifica, California. For this study, deterministic-conceptual hydrogeologic simulation was employed to estimate fluid pressures for saturated three-dimensional (3D) subsurface systems. One-dimensional (1D) vertical, transient, variably-saturated simulations were conducted to establish the position of the water table (i.e., the upper boundary condition) for the 3D steady-state saturated problems which encode the geologic information for heterogeneous and anisotropic systems. The concept-development effort undertaken here demonstrates that, for a Devil’s Slide-like system: (i) specific climatic conditions facilitate variable lag times associated with water-table dynamics, (ii) recharge is the most sensitive parameter to establish risk-averse estimates of fluid pressure, (iii) nuances in the 3D flow field related to fault zone characteristics markedly influence fluid pressures, and (iv) it is unlikely that seasonal fluctuations in the regional water table account for severe failure modes. The simulated fluid pressures encourage new interdisciplinary data discovery to investigate the spatial and temporal persistence of perched water in the study area. To capture event-driven failures for the Devil’s Slide site, future efforts should develop characterizations of the unsaturated near surface with a rigor similar to the treatment of the saturated zone demonstrated by this study.",

            "abstract": "Advances in technology enable us to collect massive amounts of diverse data. With the ability to collect more data, the problem of comparative analysis becomes increasing difficult. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) designed the Spatial Temporal Oceanographic Query System (STOQS) to create new capabilities for scientists to gain insight from data collected by oceanographic platforms. STOQS uses a geospatial database and a web-based user interface (UI) to allow scientists to explore large collections of data. The UI is optimized to provide a quick overview of data in spatial and temporal dimensions, as well as in parameter and platform space. A user may zoom into a feature of interest and select it, initiating a filter operation updating the UI with an overview of all the data in the new filtered selection. When details are desired, radio buttons and check boxes can be selected to generate a number of different types of visualizations. These include color-filled temporal section plots, parameter-parameter plots, and both 2D and 3D spatial visualizations. The ISO/IEC 19775-1, Extensible 3D (X3D) standard provides the technology for presenting 3D data in a web browser. STOQS has been in use at MBARI for four years and is helping us manage and visualize data from month-long multi-platform observational campaigns. These campaigns produce tens of millions of diverse measurements. These volumes are too great to really understand – even with an effective data exploration UI.\nEffective management of these diverse data in STOQS is achieved through a two-step harmonization process: 1) conversion of all data to OGC CF-NetCDF Discrete Sampling Geometry feature types and 2) loading all data into the STOQS data model. Having all of the data easily accessible via this data model made development of the UI possible. This same method of access is also being used for development of visualization and analysis programs for tasks that cannot be executed within the UI. Examples include 1) generating a movie of chlorophyll-backscatter plots from data collected by multiple platforms over weeks and 2) classification of measurements via machine learning methods. This poster will highlight some of the recent advances made in using STOQS to help scientists understand their data.",

Although geosciences are often at the center of these relationships, especially as they pertain to the development of natural resources, tribal economics, and environmental stewardship, Tribal/Indigenous people remain severely underrepresented in advanced geoscience education.\nOur students and communities have responded to the invitation. To represent and most important develop and lead research initiatives. Leadership is a central focus of the invitation to participate, as Tribal people have immense responsibility for significant landscapes across North American Continent, critical natural resources and millennia of unpretentious natural evolution with the localized native geologies, species and environmental systems.\nINRSEP and Pacific Northwest Tribal Nations found sustaining relationships with the Geoscience Alliance, MS PHD's, Woods Hole PEP, Native American Pacific Islander Research Experience (NAPIRE) and LSAMP programs, in addition to state/federal agencies, has advanced culturally-relevant STEM research. Research foundationally grounded on traditional ecological knowledge, individual and Tribal self-determination. A key component is student research experiences within their ancestral homelands and traversing to REU’s in multiple national and international Tribal/Indigenous ancestral territories.\nThe relationships also serve an immense capacity in tracking student achievement, promoting best practices in research development and assessing outcomes. The model has significantly improved the success of students completing STEM graduate programs.\nThe presentation will highlight lessons learned on how to 1) Ensure a diverse cohort/community of student, professionals and researchers; 2) Evolve intergenerational mentoring processes/outcomes; 3) Innovate research and programs; and 4) Advance the broader impact of geosciences research and outcomes.",

A total of 158 earthquakes with 18,859 records are selected and nonlinear mixed-effect model with maximum likelihood method is used to accomplish the regression analysis of ground-motion attenuation relationships for peak ground acceleration (PGA), with considering earthquake source, distance, site condition (Vs30), fault mechanism, and tectonic regine. The very much concerned ground-motion variability in PSHA is reviewed and studied with huge amount of data from Taiwan. We analyzed aleatory variability firstly by direct observation on inter-event variability and site-specific variability, and then by two additional simple approaches, the variogram and the standard deviation distribution in single site stady and in single earthquake study and got spatial distribution of single-path sigma as well as their earthquake component and site component. The single-path sigma is ranging from 0.219 to 0.254. These are 58% to 64% smaller than the total sigma (0.601). If we only use aleatory variability in PSHA, then the resultant hazard level would be 20% lower than the traditional one in 2,475 year return-perid.",

            "abstract": "The water in the mantle is also important for dynamics, evolution, composition and structure of deep Earth’s interior [e.g. Karato, 2011]. However, the hydrous mantle was not assumed for thermo-chemical evolution model in numerical mantle convection simulations [e.g. Nakagawa and Tackley, 2014]. To assess the effect of hydrous mantle in thermo-chemical evolution of deep Earth’s interior, we develop a coupled core-mantle evolution model including water transportation system based on Iwamori [1998; 2004]. The important ingredient of this model is the rheological property of hydrous mantle and dehydration processes. Here we assume this taken from deformation experiments on hydrous olivine [e.g. Mei and Kohlsteadt, 2000; Korenaga and Karato, 2008; Fei et al., 2013], which ranges from weak to extremely strong viscosity dependence due to the water content. We also assume the reduction of solidus temperature of mantle minerals based on Katz et al. [2003].\nPreliminary results suggested that the best-fit scenario of thermo-chemical evolution of Earth’s mantle and core could be found in the weak rheological dependence due to the water content. In the successful model, the lower mantle would be close to water-saturated situation less than 1.0 Gyrs from initial condition assuming the completely dry mantle. In the presentation, we will also discuss the possibility on hydrous basalt in the lowermost mantle and geochemical evolution in the deep mantle.",

            "abstract": "The manifestation of multidomain (MD) grains in paleointensity data is one of the primary reasons for experimental failure and ambiguity in the reliability of accepted results. To better characterize MD effects we take the novel approach of incorporating realistic levels of experimental noise into a phenomenological MD model and systematically exploring the parameter space of paleointensity experiments (the choice of protocol, laboratory and ancient field strengths, and angular dependences). Our model predictions qualitatively and quantitatively compare well with real data from MD specimens and predict recently observed MD behavior. We also explore the quantification of the fraction of natural remanent magnetization used to make a paleointensity estimate and find that FRAC, a recently proposed alternative quantification, is consistently better at isolating accurate results than the traditionally used f. On the basis of ensuring at least an accurate average paleointensity estimate, we recommend minimum FRAC values of 0.65, 0.45, 0.65, and 0.55 for the Thellier, Coe, Aitken, and IZZI protocols, respectively. Building upon this, we use the models and stochastic optimization to develop new sets of selection criteria (MCRIT) designed to maximize the likelihood of accepting accurate estimates from a suite of specimens influenced by MD behavior. Using a quasi-independent synthetic data set generated from the MD model and a fully independent real data set compiled from control paleointensity experiments, we demonstrate that the MCRIT criteria outperform their original counterparts, in terms of their ability to isolate accurate results with low scatter. The use of independent constraints in the data selection process are vital if we wish to remove the arbitrariness that hinders the identification of reliable paleointensity data.",

Comparison of mass spectrometry protein search algorithms and their biases is crucial for maximizing the quality and amount of protein identifications in mass spectral data. Available algorithms employ different approaches when mapping mass spectra to peptides against a database. We compared mass spectra from four microbial proteomes derived from high-organic content soils searched with two search algorithms: 1) Sequest HT as packaged within Proteome Discoverer (v.1.4) and 2) X!Tandem as packaged in TransProteomicPipeline (v.4.7.1). Searches used matched metagenomes, and results were filtered to allow identification of high probability proteins. There was little overlap in proteins identified by both algorithms, on average just ~24% of the total. However, when adjusted for spectral abundance, the overlap improved to ~70%. Proteome Discoverer generally outperformed X!Tandem, identifying an average of 12.5% more proteins than X!Tandem, with X!Tandem identifying more proteins only in the first two proteomes. For spectrally-adjusted results, the algorithms were similar, with X!Tandem marginally outperforming Proteome Discoverer by an average of ~4%. We then assessed differences in heat shock proteins (HSP) identification by the two algorithms by BLASTing identified proteins against the Heat Shock Protein Information Resource, because HSP hits typically account for the majority signal in proteomes, due to extraction protocols. Total HSP identifications for each of the 4 proteomes were approximately ~15%, ~11%, ~17%, and ~19%, with ~14% for total HSPs with redundancies removed. Of the ~15% average of proteins from the 4 proteomes identified as HSPs, ~10% of proteins and spectra were identified by both algorithms. On average, Proteome Discoverer identified ~9% more HSPs than X!Tandem.",

Here we use satellite measurements of LAI to look at the ability of the current generation of models to simulate the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of LAI. In addition, we look at observed temperature and precipitation relationships with interannual variability in LAI, and consider whether the models are able to correctly simulate these relationships. We use this analysis to also examine how useful particular metrics are for inter-model comparisons and model skill evaluation. We propose that good metrics for evaluating coupled earth system models are those that are relatively insensitive to the meteorology used to force them. In addition, it is valuable to have skill metrics that correlate with future projections, which would allow us to eliminate some future projections as less likely. Depending on the region of interest (tropics, mid-latitudes or high latitudes), we show that different metrics are of the most use. For future projections over the whole globe and in the tropics the most important metrics are related to current LAI correlations with time, as well as the magnitude of the mean LAI. However, several metrics are shown to have significant correlations with future projections, inhibiting our ability to use the correlation of skill metrics with future projections to improve future projections.",

            "abstract": "Climate Change is becoming one of the major threats to the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. It is affecting all sectors mainly fresh water, agriculture, forest, biodiversity and species. The subsistence agriculture system of Nepal is mainly rain-fed; therefore, climate change and climate extremes do have direct impacts on it. Weather extremes like droughts, floods and landslides long-lasting fog, hot and cold waves are affecting the agriculture sectors of Nepal. As human-induced climate change has already showing its impacts and it is going to be there for a long time to come, it is paramount importance to move towards the adaptation. Early warning system is an effective way for reducing the impacts of disasters. Forecasting of weather parameters (temperature, precipitation, and wind) helps farmers for their preparedness activities. With consultation with farmers and other relevant institutions, a research project was carried out, for the first time in Nepal, to identify the forecast information need to farmers and their dissemination mechanism. Community consultation workshops, key informant survey, and field observations were the techniques used for this research. Two ecological locations: Bageshwori VDC in Banke (plain) and Dhaibung VDC in Rasuwa (mountain) were taken as the pilot sites for this assessment. People in both the districts are dependent highly on agriculture and the weather extremes like hailstone, untimely rainfall; droughts are affecting their agriculture practices. They do not have confidence in the weather forecast information disseminated by the government of Nepal currently being done because it is a general forecast not done for a smaller domain and the forecast is valid only for 24 hours. The weather forecast need to the farmers in both the sites are: rainfall (intensity, duration and time), drought, and hailstone but in Banke, people wished to have the information of heat and cold waves too as they are affecting their wheat and tomato crops respectively the most. The mechanism of dissemination of the forecast information has been identified and agreed as local radio/FM, mobile telephoning to community leader and displaying and daily updating the forecast information in community hoarding boards.",

            "abstract": "We investigate climatic change trends in a region of the Altai Mountains located on the western edge of Mongolia using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. This region, which lies on the southern border of the Eurasian cryosphere, includes glaciers and discontinuous permafrost areas. Therefore, the region is especially useful for understanding the influence of arctic warming on the mid-latitudes. In addition, the preservation of snow and ice on the mountains is crucial to neighboring communities, especially in Mongolia. Analyses of data for the 25-year period between September 1987 and August 2012 revealed that a decrease in precipitation began to accelerate around the year 2000 regardless of the season. The rate of precipitation decline reached more than 40 mm per year near the mountain ridge where the average annual precipitation was about 500 mm. Moreover, the projected winter temperature has been decreasing annually despite warming in other seasons. Further analysis that focused on winter temperature variation found that the hemispheric atmospheric circulation was fluctuating. This slows the zonal wind speed, decreases the temperature by permitting southing of cold air, and decreases precipitation by restraining the inflow of water vapor. Water vapor reduction also contributes to temperature decline through the radiation cooling effect. Extreme cold winter weather events in Eurasia have been reported with increasing frequency in recent years. In this region, winter temperatures are declining continuously while desiccation is spreading simultaneously.",

            "abstract": "The high-temperature clinoenstatite (HT-CEn) is one of the important MgSiO3 pyroxene polymorph. The single-crystal of C2/c HT-CEn endmember is firstly synthesized by rapid pressure-temperature quenching from 15-16 GPa and 900-1900 °C [1]. No report that it is produced as single crystal or large domain had been made on the MgSiO3 endmember. The HT-CEn-type modifications were observed in Ca-poor Mg-Fe clinoenstatite and pigeonite and are always found to be unquenchable in rapid cooling.\nThe high pressure and high temperature experiments of MgSiO3 composition were carried out with a Kawai-type multi-anvil apparatus. The samples were quenched by rapidly releasing the oil pressure load and/or by blow out of anvil cell gasket. The space group of C2/c is strictly determined by Rigaku RAPID Weissenberg photographs and synchrotron radiation. HT-CEn and HP-CEn have the greatly different beta angles of 109° and 101°, respectively. Raman spectra of HT-CEn and OEn single crystals were collected at ambient conditions.\nThe unusual bonding distances frozen in the metastable structure. The observed average Mg1-O and Si-O distances in HT-CEn [1.997 and 1.620 Å, respectively] are shorter than those in HP-CEn at 7.9GPa. The average Mg2-O distance in HT-CEn [2.311 Å] is significantly longer than that in L-CEn, providing an abnormal larger distance for the Mg2 atom. The Mg2 polyhedron in HT-CEn is more irregular than that in HP-CEn. The Debye-Waller factor of atoms in HT-CEn have abnormally larger amplitude. The static irregularity of the atomic displacement caused by the transition is frozen in the metastable state.\nAlmost all Raman peaks are broad owing to the large statistical positional arrangement of atoms in HT-CEn. The braod patterns have the common feature which were obserbed by the high temperature Raman spectroscopy for pyroxene. The peaks have been confirmed at 108, 259, 684, and 1097 cm-1. Peak positions for HT-CEn are different from those for protoenstatite under high temperature. HT-CEn may be found in natural rocks that had rapid quenching history such as a shock-metamorphosed meteorite. Especially the peaks of 108 and 684 cm-1 are clear and Raman spectrra can use for an identification.\n[1] A. Yoshiasa, A. Nakatsuka, M. Okube and T.

            "abstract": "The accurate measurement for equation of state (EoS) of non-crystalline materials under pressure conditions is a long-standing problem. Selected 2 element systems were studied under high pressure via synchrotron microtomographic, x-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as pair distribution function (PDF) techniques using diamond anvil cell and large volume press. Amorphous selenium (a-Se) is a model system for examining pressure effects in amorphous materials because of the wide range of structure and bonding properties. An unexpected pressure-induced dynamic crystallization process associated with a volume expansion in this material at bout 10 GPa was discovered, and one amorphous to amorphous state transitions at about 3.7 - 5 GPa was proposed based on the PDF result. For Ga melt case, which the recent PDF researches showed controversial feature, the origin of this unusual phenomenon is examined using synchrotron microtomographic technique combined with XRD using large volume press, which allowed direct measurement of the EoS of the melting state and detecting solidification. Besides obtaining measured EoS of Ga melt, a possible liquid-to-liquid transition in Ga is founded from the abnormal compressibility of the melt. These examples demonstrated that the combination of synchrotron x-ray tomography and PDF methods offer the powerful tools to investigate the structure and EoS on non-crystalline materials under high-pressure extreme conditions.",

            "abstract": "The early warning system operated by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has been available in public since October 2007.The present system is still not effective in cases, that we cannot assume a nearly circular wavefront expansion from a source. We propose a new approach based on the extrapolation of the early observed wavefield alone without estimating its epicenter. The idea is similar to the migration method in exploration seismology, but we use not only the information of wave field at an early stage (i.e., at time T2 in Figure, but also its normal derivatives the difference between T1 and T2), that is, we utilize the apparent velocity and direction of early-stage wave propagation to predict the wavefield later (at T3 in Fig.).\nFor the extrapolation of wavefield, we need a reliable Green’s function from the observed point to a target point at which the wave arrives later. Since the complete 3-D wave propagation is extremely complex, particularly in and around Japan of highly heterogeneous structures, we shall consider a phenomenological 2-D Green’s function, that is, a wavefront propagates on the surface with a certain apparent velocity and direction of P wave. This apparent velocity and direction may vary significantly depending on, for example, event depth and an area of propagation, so we examined those of P wave propagating in Japan in various situations. For example, the velocity of shallow events in Hokkaido is 7.1km/s while that in Nagano prefecture is about 5.5km/s. In addition, the apparent velocity depends on event depth, 7.1km/s for the depth of 10km and 8.9km/s for 100km in Hokkaido.\nWe also conducted f-k array analyses of adjacent five or six stations where we can accurately estimate the apparent velocity and direction of P wave. For deep events with relatively simple waveforms, they are easily obtained, but we may need site corrections to enhance correlations of waveforms among stations for shallow ones.\nIn the above extrapolation scheme, we can only estimate the arrival times of P wave at remote stations, but we need to estimate S wave arrival time and intensity in practice. We compare the actual S wave arrival times with P wave ones for various epicenter distances, event depths and regions, so that some empirical relations between them are listed for our final goal of S wave estimations.",

It was landed on 14 December, 2013 successfully. Hovering and obstacle avoidance stages are essential for CE-3 safety soft landing so that precise spacecraft trajectory in these stages are of great significance to verify orbital control strategy, to optimize orbital design, to accurately determine the landing site of CE-3, and to analyze the geological background of the landing site. Because the time consumption of these stages is just 25s, it is difficult to present spacecraft’s subtle movement by Measurement and Control System or by radio observations. Under this background, the trajectory reconstruction based on landing camera images can be used to obtain the trajectory of CE-3 because of its technical advantages such as unaffecting by lunar gravity field spacecraft kinetic model, high resolution, high frame rate, and so on. In this paper, the trajectory of CE-3 before and after entering hovering stage was reconstructed by landing camera images from frame 3092 to frame 3180, which lasted about 9s, under Single Image Space Resection (SISR). The results show that CE-3’s subtle changes during hovering stage can be emerged by the reconstructed trajectory. The horizontal accuracy of spacecraft position was up to 1.4m while vertical accuracy was up to 0.76m. The results can be used for orbital control strategy analysis and some other application fields.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution records of sediment 15N at three sites along the western margin of North America were recently shown to indicate a gradual weakening of water-column denitrification and therefore anoxia from 1860 to 1990 followed by two decades of intensifying denitrification and anoxia (Deutsch et al., Science August 8, 2014). An ocean general circulation model driven by wind and buoyancy fluxes reproduces these variations for the last 50 years and mechanistically links them to changes in the depth of the thermocline in the eastern Pacific. The data-model comparison shows that strong denitrification and anoxia are associated with a shallow thermocline in the eastern equatorial Pacific and vice-versa. We present here a longer record of sediment 15N from one of the previously studied sites, Soledad basin, indicating that the period of particularly weak denitrification and anoxia in the eastern Pacific reached in the early 1990s was unprecedented for the past 2000 years. This supports the notion that a concomitant deepening of the thermocline during the 20th century simulated by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models may have been driven by the anthropogenic buildup of greenhouse gases. At the other end of the spectrum, the extended sediment 15N record indicates a period of particularly strong denitrification and anoxia extending from about 800 to 1200 AD. This coincides with the Medieval Warm Period of prolonged droughts indicated by tree-ring studies in the American West as well as reduced runoff recorded off coastal Peru. The particularly shallow thermocline inferred from the Soledad basin 15N record for this interval is consistent with the prolonged La Nina-like conditions in the equatorial Pacific that have been proposed to explain the Medieval droughts.",

            "abstract": "Occurrence of induced seismicity with large magnitude has been considered as critical environmental burden associated with fluid injection for shale gas/oil extraction, waste water disposal, and creation of engineered geothermal systems (EGS). Therefore, studies for understandings of the large events and risk assessment of induced seismicity has been activated (e.g. Ellsworth, 2013 or McGarr, 2014). Many of the risk assessment models is based on the seismological statistics and they use only basic information of the occurrence time and event magnitude.\nIn this study, we originally developed the risk assessment model based on the more physical interpretation of microseismic events. We newly defined new index reffered to as “Slip-able area (SAA)”, which describes the cumulative fault areas under critical state in a study area during/after the stimulation. The informations used in estimating SAA were given by the analysis of microseismic events. This model can provide the potentially slip-able area in semi real time nature. SAA can be directly converted into the event magnitude, therefore this model can contribute to the short (one or two days) or middle (week) term the risk assessment of the large seismic event.\nSAA is defined as simple product of slipped area density and stimulated volume using the equation (1).\nAslip=K×Vstimu (1)\nwhere Aslip is the cumulative SAA, K is slipped area density, and Vstimuis the stimulated volume by fluid injection.\nK, slipped area density is defined as the summation of fault areas of the seismic events which occurred during given time step from given volume. Vstimu means the rock volume whose permeability was enhanced by the fluid stimulation. So, Vstimuis estimated by distribution of the hypocenter location.\nIn order to verify the feasibility of this model, SAA is estimated using the microseismic data set from Basel, Switzerland and compared the observed seismic fault area. In this process, slipped area density was calculated using 40m grid of cube for each time step (1day) and we selected the grid where the number of the seismic events is maximum. Vstimu were estimated by summation of 25m cubic cells, which contain at least one seismic event. The estimates of the SAA showed the good agreement with the observational fault area.",

            "abstract": "Sun/sky-radiometer is a type of ground-based remote sensing instrument which plays an important role in sun radiometry and aerosol observation in fields of climate change, atmospheric environment and earth observation. A worldwide network, known as AERONET, is initially built in 1993 and now composed of overpass 500 sites. For us, the new type of polarized sun/sky-radiometer is applied by using multi-wavelength polarimetric measuring techniques, and a Sun/Sky-radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) has been established in China. SONET provides an long-term and reliable observation for remote sensing of aerosol optical and microphysical properties.\nIn this paper, we introduce (i) characteristics, principles and functions of the multi-wavelength polarization radiometer and basic information about distributed field sites of SONET in Chinese typical regions; (ii) running modes, as well as parameter settings, of sun/sky radiation and polarization measurements under direct-sun, solar principal plane and almucantar geometries; (iii) calibration methods we use for solar irradiance, sky radiance and degree of linear polarization measurements, and data processing of aerosol and water vapor products together with examples under clean and haze conditions; (iv) the total column atmospheric aerosol models (urban, rural and haze models) derived from long-term continuous observation at typical sites in China.\nOn the basis of extension of multi-wavelength polarization measurements, we also have developed other operation techniques of sun/sky-radiometer observation network including automatic observation, quick data processing, routine calibration and maintenance, which can contribute to construction of typical atmospheric aerosol models, retrieval and validation of satellite aerosol products and monitoring of atmospheric environment.",

            "abstract": "The Eastern Himalayan System (east of 88°E) is distinct from the rest of the India-Eurasia continental collision, due to a wider zone of distributed deformation, oblique convergence across two orthogonal plate boundaries and near absence of foreland basin sedimentary strata. To understand the seismotectonics of this region we study the spatial distribution and source mechanism of earthquakes originating within Eastern Himalaya, northeast India and Indo-Burman Convergence Zone (IBCZ). We compute focal mechanism of 32 moderate-to-large earthquakes (mb >=5.4) by modeling teleseismic P- and SH-waveforms, from GDSN stations, using least-squares inversion algorithm; and 7 small-to-moderate earthquakes (3.5<= mb <5.4) by modeling local P- and S-waveforms, from the NorthEast India Telemetered Network, using non-linear grid search algorithm. We also include source mechanisms from previous studies, either computed by waveform inversion or by first motion polarity from analog data. Depth distribution of modeled earthquakes reveal that the seismogenic layer beneath northeast India is ~45km thick. From source mechanisms we observe that moderate earthquakes in northeast India are spatially clustered in five zones with distinct mechanisms: (a) thrust earthquakes within the Eastern Himalayan wedge, on north dipping low angle faults; (b) thrust earthquakes along the northern edge of Shillong Plateau, on high angle south dipping fault; (c) dextral strike-slip earthquakes along Kopili fault zone, between Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills, extending southeast beneath Naga Fold belts; (d) dextral strike-slip earthquakes within Bengal Basin, immediately south of Shillong Plateau; and (e) deep focus (>50 km) thrust earthquakes within IBCZ. Combining with GPS geodetic observations, it is evident that the N20E convergence between India and Tibet is accommodated as elastic strain both within eastern Himalaya and regions surrounding the Shillong Plateau. We hypothesize that the strike-slip earthquakes south of the Plateau occur on re-activated continental rifts paralleling the Eocene hinge zone. Distribution of earthquake hypocenters across the IBCZ reveal active subduction of the Indian plate beneath Burma micro-plate.",

            "abstract": "Swath bathymetry and high-resolution penetration echo sounder (chirp) data from fjords and sounds between Kong Oscars Fjord and Bredefjord, East Greenland, reveal glacial landforms and sedimentary processes that can be used to infer glacial activity from the last glacial to the present.\nRelatively straight, linear features oriented parallel to the fjord axes, as well as beyond the mouths of some fjords, are interpreted to be glacial lineations providing evidence of fast-flowing grounded ice draining the eastern parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet during the last glacial. In some areas, the glacial lineations are the only preserved glacigenic landfjorms (e.g. beyond the mouth of Bredefjord). However, in other areas, they are covered with multiple transverse ridges interpreted to be small terminal moraines (e.g. in Youngsund). Whereas the absence of such moraines is suggested to represent a rapid ice retreat due to lift-up and disintegration during parts of the deglaciation, their presence reflects that multiple halts and/or re-advances interrupted the retreat.\nAcoustically stratified sediment sequences dominate the fjord-fill stratigraphies (up to 180 ms two-way travel time). These deposits are suggested to reflect repeatedly changing lithological compositions in a glacimarine environment where deposition mainly occurred from suspension fall-out, in addition to ice rafting from icebergs calving off from tidewater glaciers, and sea ice. The stratified deposits form often relatively uniform drapes indicating that the tidewater glaciers were mainly located near the fjord heads since the last deglaciation. However, acoustically transparent bodies with irregular geometries, intercalated within the stratified deposits, occur in some of the inner fjords. These are suggested to be glacigenic sediment wedges (debris-flow lobes) that formed during relatively recent advances of tidewater glaciers (e.g. in Nordfjord and Moskusoksefjord).",

            "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a globally distributed contaminant that threatens ecosystem health across aquatic environments. The complexity of the Hg cycle and its primary drivers, coupled with dynamic food web processes that govern biomagnification, result in marked spatial variability in Hg bioaccumulation across aquatic ecosystems. However, it is unclear if patterns of bioaccumulation are consistent in magnitude and direction across ecosystem types. We synthesized data from several studies spanning more than 200 individual sites, comprising four distinct ecosystem classifications (estuaries, sub-alpine lakes, rivers, and managed wetlands). Within each ecosystem, we compared fish Hg concentrations among replicated sub-habitats and also evaluated the influence of land use, landscape composition, and biogeochemical drivers on fish Hg concentrations. We found substantial variability in fish Hg concentrations among adjacent sub-habitats within ecosystems. In estuarine environments, fish Hg concentrations were 7.4x higher in seasonal-saline wetlands than adjacent tidal wetland habitats. In riverine alcoves, preliminary data suggest that fish Hg concentrations were 1.5x higher than in fishes from paired mainstem river habitat. Among managed wetland habitats, fish Hg concentrations in rice fields were 2x higher than those in managed seasonal wetlands that were subjected to identical wetting and drying patterns. Across ecosystems, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in surface waters were consistently correlated with fish Hg concentrations, highlighting its importance in Hg methylation and transport processes. Yet, the strength and direction of the relationships varied among habitat types. For example, fish Hg concentrations were positively correlated with DOC concentrations in riverine environments, whereas we found a negative correlation in alpine lakes. Instead, the most important determinant of fish Hg concentrations in alpine lakes was conifer tree density within a lake’s catchment, resulting in a 4x increase in fish Hg concentration in lakes with the lowest to the highest catchment conifer tree density. Together, this integrated ecosystem analysis highlights the importance of understanding small-scale variation in bioaccumulation processes in order to better predict Hg risk.",

            "abstract": "To comprehensively understand the impact of atmospheric CO2 on air temperature, it is necessary to discuss about climate change by embracing attention to internal variability. However, the existing studies relevant to future prediction basically having century-scale analyses due to computational load problem, we remained in discussion about the transient change of earth system. This study demonstrated a comprehensive effect of CO2 (including both external and internal variability), by a millennial-scale global warming prediction with the simplified-type earth system model. As a result, during initial 1000 years CO2 emission had a positive influence in temperature in long-term, and in atmospheric CO2 in short-term. The difference of response time was caused by latent heat (the delay of oceanic response to CO2 emission). In the quasi-steady state, higher cumulated CO2 emission encourages more independence of relationship between temperature and atmospheric CO2. It revealed that there might be a definite limitation to effectiveness for global warming caused by the CO2 emission in millennial scale. As future work of the global warming prediction, by collaborating with paleoclimatic studies, we need to figure out new mechanism leading to tipping point of earth system, especially an undescribed feedback system that provokes an irreversible change, while confirming a consistency of the model study with paleoenvironmental studies (e.g., paleoclimatic indicator, model, record) as clue for comprehending the high-priority process.",

One of methods numerically calculating them is based on a minimum traveltime tree algorithm for tracing rays: a focal locus is represented in terms of ray paths in its residual field from the minimum point (namely initial point) to low residual points (referred as reference points of the focal locus). The method has no restrictions on the complexity of the velocity model but still lacks the ability of correctly dealing with multi-segment loci. Additionally, it is rather laborious to set calculation parameters for obtaining loci with satisfying completeness and fineness.

            "abstract": "Chemical fractionation of slab-derived supercritical fluids can play an important role in elemental transfer from subducting slab to the mantle wedge and arc magmatism [1]. Recent findings of saline fluids from sub-arc mantle peridotite indicate that aqueous fluids in mantle wedge can contain 3.7 wt% NaCl in Ichinomageta, Northeast Japan arc [2] to 5.1 wt% NaCl in Pinatubo, Luzon arc [3]. It is, therefore, important to determine the effect of Cl on the trace element partitioning between aqueous fluids and melts.\nSynchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis is conducted to know Rb, Sr, and Pb partitioning between aqueous fluids and melts [4]. There is a positive correlation between partition coefficients and pressure, as well as salinity. Two slab-derived components, melt and fluid components, are suggested to explain trace element characteristics of arc-basalts in the Mariana arc [5]. The fluid component is characterized by enrichment of alkali and alkali earth elements. Such features can be explained if the fluid component is a saline fluid, because alkali earth elements and Pb are much less mobile with Cl-free fluids than Cl-rich fluids [4]. We suggest that slab-derived components have compositional features consistent with a saline fluid and a melt, which can be formed through a separation of a slab-derived supercritical fluid [1]. Slab derived supercritical fluids contain Cl, and aqueous fluids inherit much of the Cl and some of the large-ion lithophile elements.\n[1] Kawamoto et al. 2012, Separation of supercritical slab-fluids to form aqueous fluid and melt components in subduction zone magmatism.

            "abstract": "Seismic reflection profiles acquired in the continent-ocean transition zone (COT) of South China Sea provide a detailed view of Moho and deep crustal reflectors and continental lithosphere extension and breakup styles. At the north margin, rift basins are often bounded by listric normal faults, most of which are terminated at the base of the upper crust. The upper-lower crust interface corresponds to the brittle-ductile transition zone, where listric faults tend to converge into a low angle detachment fault. According to calculated stretch factors in different depth scales (upper crust, lower crust) along several profiles, hyper-extended continental crust is widespread, with the upper crust being often preferentially more thinned than the lower crust. The ductile lower crust is more resistant to faulting and therefore stretching. A high-velocity lower crustal layer represents either magmatic underplating or pervasive lower crustal intrusions in the northern margin. The possible lower crust ductile flow and the high-velocity lower crustal layer may have contributed to extension discrepancy, leading to direct exposure of lower crust material landward of the continent-ocean boundary. Hyper-extended continental crust and thick syn-rift sequence developed during a long period of rifting prior to the inception of seafloor spreading are also observed in the southern continental margin, further suggesting depth-dependent continental extension in the South China Sea. Basement highs and discontinuity in Moho reflector are common features around the continent-ocean boundary of South China Sea. The basement ridges are located at the landward edge of the continent-ocean boundary and possibly composed by lower crust material. The COT is ~50 km wide, where the gravity anomaly is approximately zero and the Moho reflector is discontinuous. The COT here is narrower than those found in other magma-poor margins (e.g., Iberia-Newfoundland type), indicating that normal oceanic crust started to establish soon after crustal breakup.",

            "abstract": "Recently, lidar (light detection and ranging) has been used to extracting tree structural information. Portable scanning lidar systems can capture the complex shape of individual trees as a 3-D point-cloud image. 3-D tree models reproduced from the lidar-derived 3-D image can be used to estimate tree structural parameters. We have proposed the voxel-based 3-D modeling for extracting tree structural parameters. One of the tree parameters derived from the voxel modeling is leaf area density (LAD). We refer to the method as the voxel-based canopy profiling (VCP) method. In this method, several measurement points surrounding the canopy and optimally inclined laser beams are adopted for full laser beam illumination of whole canopy up to the internal. From obtained lidar image, the 3-D information is reproduced as the voxel attributes in the 3-D voxel array. Based on the voxel attributes, contact frequency of laser beams on leaves is computed and LAD in each horizontal layer is obtained. This method offered accurate LAD estimation for individual trees and woody canopy trees. For more accurate LAD estimation, the voxel model was constructed by combining airborne and portable ground-based lidar data. The profiles obtained by the two types of lidar complemented each other, thus eliminating blind regions and yielding more accurate LAD profiles than could be obtained by using each type of lidar alone. Based on the estimation results, we proposed an index named laser beam coverage index, Ω, which relates to the lidar’s laser beam settings and a laser beam attenuation factor. It was shown that this index can be used for adjusting measurement set-up of lidar systems and also used for explaining the LAD estimation error using different types of lidar systems. Moreover, we proposed a method to estimate woody material volume as another application of the voxel tree modeling. In this method, voxel solid model of a target tree was produced from the lidar image, which is composed of consecutive voxels that filled the outer surface and the interior of the stem and large branches. From the model, the woody material volume of any part of the target tree can be directly calculated easily by counting the number of corresponding voxels and multiplying the result by the per-voxel volume.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate reconstructions using δ18O as a proxy for the isotopic composition of rainfall are based upon the mostly untested assumption that either rainfall amount or equilibration temperature are the main drivers modulating the isotopic composition of pluvial precipitation. Whilst a broad correlation between geographical location and driving mechanisms has been long recognized (i.e. amount effect is pervasive in tropical areas), further tests are required to determine the effect that different sources of moisture might impose on the isotopic composition of precipitation, particularly in areas where contributions from different ocean-basins might be significant, such as south Mexico.\nHere, we present the δ18O and δ2H composition of summer rainfall collected throughout south, central and western Mexico, particularly from Veracruz, Puebla, Guerrero, Morelos, Mexico City, Jalisco, Michoacán and Querétaro states. The geographical and temporal extent of our sampling (2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011) results in a large dataset comprising more than 600 samples and represents the base data to understand the atmospheric mechanisms modulating the isotopic composition of rainfall in Mexico. Our data span a range of 30‰ in δ18O, from high values nearest the Gulf of Mexico coast and during weak rainfall events, to lowest values in high-altitude central Mexico and during heavy rainfall events associated with tropical cyclones. Values on the Pacific Coast are intermediate, and likely reflect a contribution of both Gulf of Mexico and Pacific sources. Our data define a meteoric water line of δ2H = 7.92 × δ18O + 9.48, which indicate that most precipitation values formed close to isotopic equilibrium with water vapor. The two primary physiographic variables controlling δ18O values are distance from the Gulf of Mexico and altitude, which together explain about 70% of the variation in spatial δ18O values.",

An 8-kg wooden hammer was used as an active source. The seismic waves were recorded for 8 to 30 s and digitized at 125 to 500 Hz sample rates. Dispersion images of the Rayleigh waves were obtained by the extended spatial autocorrelation (ESPAC) method. At 46 recording sites, the overburden layer was too thick to investigate bedrock with this shallow geophysical method. Shear-wave velocity models were derived from the estimated dispersion curves using the damped least-squares inversion scheme. From these 1-D velocity models, estimated mean values of Vs at the top of bedrock, depth to the bedrock, average Vs of the overburden layer, and average Vs of the top 30-m depth (Vs30) are 672±37 m/s, 17±0.5 m, 253±9 m/s, and 343±15 m/s, respectively, in the 95% confidence range. The estimated values from the inverted profiles were interpolated to yield maps for the entire low altitude area. Most of the investigated areas in Gangneung belong to NEHRP site class D (58%), C (34%), E (4%), and B (4%). In downtown area, both the lower estimates of Vs30 and thick overburden layer make it more prone to significant ground amplifications. The computed correlation coefficients (r) of Vs30 with elevation and topographic gradient, on linear scales, are 0.7 and 0.6, respectively.",

We analyzed frequencies of ULF waves recorded during 26 strongly disturbed geomagnetic events (substorms) and compared them with frequencies of ULF waves detected during magnetically quite times. Our analysis demonstrates that the frequency of the waves carrying most of the power almost in all these events is less than 1 mHz. We also analyzed data from the ACE satellite, measuring parameters of the solar wind in the L1 Lagrangian point between Earth and Sun, and found that in several occasions there is a strong correlation between oscillations of the magnetic field in the solar wind and oscillations detected on the ground. We also found several cases when there is no correlation between signals detected on ACE and on the ground. This finding suggests that these frequencies correspond to the fundamental eigenfrequency of the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The low frequency of the oscillations is explained by the effect of the ionosphere, where the current is carried by ions through highly collisional media. The amplitude of these waves can reach significant magnitude when the system is driven by the external driver (for example, the solar wind) with this particular frequency. When the frequency of the driver does not match the frequency of the system, the waves still are observed, but their amplitudes are much smaller.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice represents an important component of the climate system, since it is an effective insulator between the oceans and the atmosphere, restricting the exchange of heat, mass, momentum and chemical constituents. The ongoing severe reduction of Arctic sea ice is largely ascribed to anthropogenic effects, but the current rate of sea-ice reduction is much faster than predicted by models. Despite its importance, little is known about past changes in sea-ice cover and the underlying forcing mechanisms.\nThe central West Greenland shelf is an area which is very sensitive to climate and in particular sea-ice variability, as it lies right at the boundary between the quite extensive sea-ice cover in the north and almost sea-ice free waters in the south. In this study, we use diatom assemblages from marine sediment cores, GA306-GC3 and GA306-GC4 located off West Greenland, to reconstruct changes in sea-ice cover over the past 6,700 years. In order to test the possible role of solar irradiance on sea ice, the sea-ice reconstruction record was compared with variations in the 14C production rate, a proxy for past solar variability inferred from atmospheric 14C concentrations measured in tree rings. The results show a strong link between sea-ice cover off West Greenland and solar variability over the past 4000 years, in particular during the last millennium. Variations in solar activity may directly drive changes in sea-ice cover in the Arctic region, which would further amplify the variations in sea-ice cover off West Greenland through a sea-ice–ocean–atmosphere feedback mechanism. In contrast, solar forcing appears to have been less important for sea-ice concentrations during earlier millennia, underlining the complex link between solar forcing and sea-ice cover. Improved understanding of the natural sea-ice variability is important for predicting future changes in Arctic sea-ice cover associated with anthropogenic influences on climate.",

Periodic pressurization controls explosion timing, which nearly always occurs at peak inflation, as detected with tiltmeters. Tilt cycles in January 2012 reveal regular 26 +/-6 min inflation/deflation cycles corresponding to at least ~101 kg/s of gas fluxing the system. Very long period (VLP) earthquakes presage explosions and occur during cycles when inflation rates are most rapid. VLPs locate ~300 m below the vent and indicate mobilization of volatiles, which ascend at ~50 m/s. Rapid gas ascent feeds pyroclast-laden eruptions lasting several minutes and rising to ~1 km. VLPs are not observed during less rapid inflation episodes; instead, gas vents passively through the conduit producing no infrasound and no explosion. These observations intimate that steady gas exsolution and accumulation in shallow reservoirs may drive inflation cycles at open-vent silicic volcanoes.",

In this study, we look for surface expressions that are indicative of recent to on-going tectonic modification beyond the Okavango region. A number of landforms can be highlighted. These include drainage lines in north eastern Namibia which are aligned along a “horsetail” fracture system, interpreted as the response to an apparent incipient rifting extending west of the Okavango Graben and Gumare fault line. The second region of interest, in north eastern Botswana, is known to house a second lesser graben, centred along the Ntwetwe panhandle but with a wider surface manifestation than previously noted. We can demonstrate that the area north of the Makgadikgadi has been modified by “piano key” type fault blocks. And thirdly, structural modifications to linear dune ridges of the southern central Kalahari manifest faulting, shearing and rotation. These observations raise questions about the extent of tectonic processes operating across the southern African interior and attribute additional processes to Kalahari landforms.",

Most significantly the most pronounced shift in Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) took place within the shortest period of time ever observed, and when the Allies navies approached Japan’s coast line two years later, winter air temperatures (December to February 1944/45) fell to the lowest level ever observed. The Naval War in the Pacific from 1943 - 1945 was not only devastating to man and material, but also substantially altered the structure of the sea surface layer down to 100 meter and more, with a subsequent impact on air temperatures, and PDO balance across the Northern Pacific. Until now the question has received little attention although it is obvious that a global rising temperature trend prior the early 1940s turned into a decreasing mode during the time when huge naval war activities took place across the oceans in the Northern Hemisphere that eventually lasted for three decades until the mid-1970s While the impact of screw driven vessels since their invention in the 19th Century on the sea surface structure is difficult to assess, and no investigations have been made yet . The naval war in the Pacific from 1943 - 1945 could be regarded as a huge scale ‘field experiment’ on manmade marine geohazards due to the suddenness, the magnitude and the intensity, penetrating the ocean to considerable depths. Naval operations and available sea and climate data need to be identified, linked, evaluated and discussed. What kind of impact did the Pacific War have on climate? It seems due time to pay attention to this issue.",

The Late Quaternary (~ last 15 ka) regional tephrostratigraphic record for this region is however still poorly developed. We combine detailed stratigraphic logging of terrestrial sections in the vicinity of Llaima, Sollipulli, Villarrica, Quetrupillan, Mocho-Choshuenco and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanoes with petrological, whole-rock and glass geochemical data, and 14C dating on charcoal entrained in volcanic deposits, and correlate the on-land sequences with tephra layers in existing 14C-dated lacustrine records of Laguna Las Ranas and Lagos Villarrica, Calafquén and Riñihue. The combined record includes previously described major eruptions, e.g. Llaima Pumice (Llaima) and Alpehue Pumice (Sollipulli), which help to constrain the relative timing of events. These correlations suggest that several widespread volcanic units are several hundreds to thousands of years older than previously thought. The record also includes newly described pumice-producing events, e.g. for the poorly studied Quetrupillan volcano, and provides new insights into the post-glacial eruptive frequency in the Southern Volcanic Zone. The newly updated stratigraphy with high-quality geochemical data also contributes to the regional tephrochronological framework which helps to significantly improve age models for lacustrine palaeoseismological and palaeoenvironmental archives.",

However, most global scale hydrological models do not include a lateral groundwater flow component due to a lack of consistent global-scale hydrogeological information. Such data is needed to arrive at a more realistic physical representation of the groundwater system allowing for the simulation of groundwater head dynamics and lateral flows including abstractions in confined and unconfined aquifers. This improved process description is indispensable to understand the effects of past and future climate variations and human dependence on global water resources. In this study we developed a high resolution (5 arc-minutes) global scale transient groundwater model presenting confined and unconfined aquifers. This model is based on MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1988) and coupled with the land-surface model PCR-GLOBWB (van Beek et al. 2011) via recharge and surface water levels. The aquifer parameterization is based on available global data-sets on lithology (Hartmann and Moosdorf 2011) and permeability (Gleeson et al. 2011) and newly derived estimates of aquifer depth and thickness of confining layers from an integration of lithological and topographical information. In a sensitivity analysis the model is run with various hydrogeological parameter settings, under natural recharge only. Scenarios of past groundwater abstractions and recharge (Wada et al 2012) are evaluated. Trends and fluctuations of groundwater head and streamflow are studied in response to human groundwater use and climate variability, as well as revealing hotspots and magnitude of global groundwater depletion.",

            "abstract": "It is essential that understanding of grain size sorting and its influence upon sediment transport in gravel-bed rivers is deepened due to implications for channel stability, ecology and stratigraphy. Previous work has shown how the addition of finer material to a coarse channel bed can enhance the mobility of the coarser sediment due to a reduced entrainment threshold. This enhanced mobility has been indexed using the change in equilibrium slope within the channel. However, it is not yet known how variations in the grain size ratio (diameter of coarse/diameter of fine), along with the concentration of fine material, influences this behavior.\nNew experiments undertaken with bimodal mixtures of spherical glass particles in a relatively narrow sediment-feed flume permit observation of the individual and bulk particle motion. These experiments demonstrate that degradation can occur when fine sediment is added to a coarse bed (Figure 1), and show the grain size ratios and fine sediment feed concentrations at which this arises. The research also shows that under certain conditions, aggradation can also occur due to the addition of finer sediment to a coarse channel bed. The amount of degradation and aggradation under varying conditions is quantified using the change in equilibrium bed slope.\nFigure 1: Channel degradation (flow from right to left)",

            "abstract": "A looped duplex Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) deployment uses a bifilar arrangement of two optical fibres in the same cable or conduit. On one end of the cable the ends of the fibres are spliced together. The other ends are connected to a (double ended) DTS system or one end is connected to a (single ended) DTS system. A light pulse shot from one end will eventually emerge from the other end and vice versa. Back scattered Raman-shifted photons will thus be detected twice for each posistion along the cable or conduit but delayed in time by twice the distance from the symmetry point (turn around sub) divided by the speed of light in the fibre.\nCalibration of a DTS system requires, first and foremost that differential loss; i.e. the difference in optical attenuation between Stokes and anti-Stokes backscattered signals, is compensated for. It will be shown that residual errors due to uncompensated differential loss can only be due to the uneven part of the (non-uniform) differential loss distribution. A \nbifilar deployment is therefore highly insensitive to uncompensated differential loss because ageing, chemical or mechanical damage to the cable as well as thermal or mechanical strain may vary over the length of the cable but remain symmetrical and therefore even with respect to the turn around sub.\nBy writing the (non-)uniform differential loss as the sum of an even and an uneven part it is possible to derive an equation for the residual error of a DTS temperature measurement expressed as an integral over the uneven part of the differential loss distribution only. Thus it is possible to estimate any residual temperature error under field conditions. Such a capability is especially useful where no access to one end of the cable is possible, such as is the case in borehole applications.",

            "abstract": "Detailed descriptions of the subsurface heterogeneities in coarse fluvial aquifer gravel often lack in concepts to distinguish between the essence and the noise of a permeability structure and the ability to extrapolate site specific hydraulic information at the tens to several hundred meters scale. At this scale the heterogeneity strongly influences the anisotropies of the flow field and the mixing processes in groundwater. However, in many hydrogeological models the complexity of natural systems is oversimplified. Understanding the link between the dynamics of the surface processes of braided-river systems and the resulting subsurface sedimentary structures is the key to characterizing the complexity of horizontal and vertical mixing processes in groundwater.\nFrom the different depositional elements of coarse braided-river systems, the largest permeability contrasts can be observed in the scour-fills. Other elements (e.g. different types of gravel sheets) show much smaller variabilities and could be considered as a kind of matrix. Field experiments on the river Tagliamento (Northeast Italy) based on morphological observation and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys, as well as outcrop analyses of gravel pit exposures (Switzerland) allowed us to define the shape, sizes, spatial distribution and preservation potential of scour-fills. In vertical sections (e.g. 2D GPR data, vertical outcrop), the spatial density of remnant erosional bounding surfaces of scours is an indicator for the dynamics of the braided-river system (lateral mobility of the active floodplain, rate of sediment net deposition and spatial distribution of the confluence scours). In case of combined low aggradation rate and low lateral mobility the deposits may be dominated by a complex overprinting of scour-fills. The delineation of the erosional bounding surfaces, that are coherent over the survey area, is based on the identification of angular discontinuities of the reflectors. Fence diagrams and horizontal time-slices from GPR data are used to construct simplified 3D hydraulic properties distribution models and to derive anisotropy patterns. On the basis of this work, conceptual models could be designed and implemented into numerical models to simulate the flow field and mixing in heterogeneous braided-river deposits.",

            "abstract": "The impact of climate change on regional ecosystem structure and biogeochemical cycling has two important aspects that require better elaboration to improve projections of these effects. The first is that ecosystems don't respond directly to climate, but indirectly via frequency and occurrence of weather systems, which are driven by climatic shifts in global circulation and radiative processes. The second is that many responses of ecosystems to these weather patterns and extremes are lagged in time. Here, we examine these aspects for northern Alpine grasslands. Long-term eddy covariance flux tower and phenology observations in Austria and Germany and biophysical models reveal a strong influence of winter air temperature, snowfall, and snowmelt frequency on winter grass mortality and spring grassland carbon uptake. Further, the mode of climate variability that drives winter air temperature and snow depth patterns is primarily the frequency of strong regional southerly Foehn flow that promotes warm, dry conditions in winter. Finally, we demonstrate that much of the interannual variance in Foehn frequency and southerly flow is driven by statistics and climatic trends of 500 hPa pressure patterns in Greenland, part of the Arctic Oscillation. However, a few years, including the unusually warm and dry winter of 2013-2014 appear to have secondary, possibly local thermotopographic circulation factors that promoted its weather conditions regionally, which also included primarily cool and wet conditions in northern Europe and the southern Alps. These findings demonstrate that the regional response of ecosystems to climate change is modulated by how large-scale circulation patterns influence local meteorology and topographic flows both during and outside the growing season and provides a framework for future assessment and climate model improvements of linkages of climate change, weather patterns, and ecosystem responses.",

            "abstract": "In this article, the predictability of the 20th century sea-surface temperature (SST) forced East African short rains variability is analyzed using observational data and ensembles of long atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations. To our knowledge, such an analysis for the whole 20th century using a series of AGCM ensemble simulations is carried out here for the first time. The physical mechanisms that govern the influence of SST on East African short rains in the model are also investigated. It is found that there is substantial skill in reproducing the East African short rains variability, given that the SSTs are known. Consistent with previous recent studies, it is found that the Indian Ocean and in particular the western pole of the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) play a dominant role for the prediction skill, whereas SSTs outside the Indian Ocean play a minor role. The physical mechanism for the influence of the western Indian Ocean on East African rainfall in the model is consistent with previous findings and consists of a gill-type response to a warm (cold) anomaly that induces a westerly\n(easterly) low-level flow anomaly over equatorial Africa and leads to moisture flux convergence (divergence) over East Africa. On the other hand, a positive El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) anomaly leads to a spatially non-coherent reducing effect over parts of East Africa, but the relationship is not strong enough to provide any predictive skill in our model. The East African short rains prediction skill is also analyzed within a model-derived potential predictability framework and it is shown that the actual prediction skill is broadly consistent with the model potential prediction skill. Low-frequency variations of the prediction skill are mostly related to SSTs outside the Indian Ocean region and are likely due to an increased interference of ENSO with the Indian Ocean influence on East African short rains after the mid-1970s climate shift.",

            "abstract": "At many sites of hydrothermal discharge in the deep-sea, the deposition of metal sulfides from hydrothermal fluids leads to the formation of geological structures known as hydrothermal chimneys. The mixing of reduced hydrothermal fluids with oxygenated seawater leads to the formation of steep redox gradients within the chimney walls. These gradients facilitate the co-existence of metabolically diverse microorganisms in the narrow habitable zone of hydrothermal chimney walls. However, the overall composition of chimney-associated microbial community is usually of low complexity and represents an environment suitable for metaomic-based studies.\nWe used metagenomic and metaproteomic tools to compare microbial communities colonizing two metal-sulfide chimneys from the Manus Basin back-arc spreading center in the Bismarck Sea off Papua New Guinea. These chimneys were supplied by the same source hydrothermal fluids, but exhibited different fluid flow regimes. One chimney (RMR5) had a focused venting edifice, while the other (RMR-D) displayed diffuse fluid efflux on its entire outer surface.\nAlthough the microbial diversity of both chimneys is similar and dominated by mesophilic Epsilonproteobacteria, our results indicate a strong structuring effect of hydrothermal fluid flow regime on chimney-associated biofilms. The microbial community composition indicates a homogeneous colonization of the diffuse chimney walls. In contrast, the walls of the focused venting chimney appear to be colonized in layers reflecting different temperature tolerances of the dominant microorganisms. Sulfide-oxidation is likely the key metabolism in both chimneys, which is in line with the high sulfide content of the source hydrothermal fluid. However, preliminary metaproteome analysis indicates high activity of low-abundant methanotrophic Bacteria in the diffuser chimney walls. This finding is particularly interesting in light of the very low methane content of the source hydrothermal fluid. Overall, this study is among the first metaprotoemic investigations of hydrothermal vent associated communities and provides deep insights into the metabolic versatility of hydrothermal chimney colonizing microbes.",

Flux tower measurements showed that photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration in the region were easily influenced by air temperature and/or precipitation generally than in the other regions. Therefore, the future energy and water condition probably alter the present relationship between vegetation and soil activities and meteorological phenomena. However, there are few quantitative analysis which demonstrates terrestrial ecosystem response to future climate change in Eastern Asia. For this research, we estimated present (2001 - 2010) and future (2091 - 2100) seasonal NEP control factor with 10km-grid in Eastern Asia. We created future 10km-grid climate data by combining present satellite and climate datasets with CMIP5 GCM outputs and vegetation data by using empirical method considering extension of growing length. The terrestrial biosphere model BEAMS was used for NEP control factor analysis. As a result, difference of primary NEP control factor between present and future was characteristic by seasons. In spring and autumn, temperature precedence area in the high latitudes decreased in future. While in summer, most of the area showed radiation precedence except water precedence in arid area in both periods, but radiation contribution for NEP in the middle latitudes decreased. We found that primary NEP control factor changed by terrestrial sensitivity to climate change and a capacity of climate to drive carbon cycle. Future warming mitigated the photosynthetic activity restriction which caused by cold stress. Terrestrial carbon cycle demand for radiation in summer might be approaching satisfaction in future. Our simulation provided quantitative evidence that unique climate feedback via terrestrial ecosystem activity will behave variedly in each region and season.",

We investigate the effects of variability of annual precipitation on ecohydrological dynamics. Specifically, the Advanced WEather GENerator, AWE-GEN is used to simulate 200 years of hourly meteorological forcing obtained by imposing four types of precipitation annual process. The generated time series force a mechanistic ecohydrological model, Tethys-Chloris. Simulations are performed for four locations characterized by different vegetation cover and climate conditions. The results indicate that long-term transpiration (T) and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes and vegetation productivity expressed as Gross and Above-ground Net Primary Production (GPP, ANPP) are essentially unaffected by the imposed climate fluctuations, showing a mild response only in the water-limited environment. This finding supports the hypothesis of interannual insensitivity of evapotranspiration and vegetation productivity to annual climatic fluctuations, which are mostly reflected in fluxes of deep leakage and runoff. The occurrence of short periods of favorable meteorological conditions randomly taking place within the year was found to be a better explanatory variable for interannual variability of ET and ANPP than average annual or growing season conditions. Sensitivity of ET and GPP/ANPP to changes in mean precipitation was found to be much larger than sensitivity to changes in annual precipitation variability. As local, single-site sensitivities are considerably smaller than the sensitivities observed across climatic and vegetation gradients, an important role of ecosystem re-organization in modifying ANPP and ET sensitivity in a changing climate is highlighted.",

In this study, a theoretical analysis is carried out to explain the dynamics that determines the phenomenon found in observation and modelling studies. The analytic solution of the tidal motion in an idealized bay indicates that the tidal current in a small coastal bay such as the JZB is linearly proportional to its spatial dimension, if is far less than a quarter of the tidal wave length. This suggests that the decrease in the tidal current speed in JZB mouth is owing to land reclamation inside the bay (the remote factor). Because of the insensitivity of tidal range to , a linear relationship between bay areas and tidal current of JZB mouth can be derived, according to which the change of the amplitude of tidal current after the land reclamation can be well predicted. The results of mean tidal current amplitude derived by simple theoretical method agree well with previous 3D model studies. We also found that the spatial asymmetry of the tidal current in JZB mouth is determined by the predominate role of advection in tidal motion which is controlled by the sharp Tuandao headland (the local factor). Unchanged shoreline around Tuandao headland leads to the stable spatial asymmetry of tidal current. Numerical experiments indicate it is the nonlinear process of advection that generates the tidal residual current in JZB mouth. Therefore, the weaker tidal current can lead to weaker residual current, while the unchanged asymmetry of tidal current results in the unaltered pattern of inflow in the north and outflow in the south for the tidally induced residual current in JZB mouth.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific plate subducts WNW under the Eurasian plates with a ~30° angle of dip and a rate of ~8 cm/yr from the Japan–Kuril Trench. The Kuril-NE Japan arc of the uppermost mantle, overlying the subducting Pacific slab, is the locus of important processes, including serpentinization of the forearc mantle wedge, repeated genesis of megathrust earthquakes, slab dehydration, arc magmatism and interplate coupling. To improve our knowledge of crustal and upper mantle structures through tomographic imaging, we determined the three-dimensional (3-D) velocity (Vp, Vs) and Vp/Vs structures under the Kuril–NE Japan subduction zone. The Vp, Vs and Vp/Vs models provide compelling evidence for a highly hydrated and serpentinized forearc mantle and the fluids related to low-velocity and high-Vp/Vs anomalies associated with the slab dehydration. Significant slow anomalous Vp and Vs with a high-Vp/Vs ratio are clearly imaged along the volcanic front with an extended depth of ~100 km under the Kuril–NE Japan arc, showing good consistency with the results of previous studies. This is caused mainly by the fluids associated with the extensive dehydration of the subducting Pacific slab. Fluid-related anomalies under the Kuril–NE Japan arc system, attributed to various processes such as slab dehydration and serpentinization of the forearc mantle wedge, are contributed mainly by arc magmatism, interplate coupling and the repeated generation of megathrust earthquakes. The characteristic distribution of high and low Vp/Vs in the forearc continental crust along the trench-parallel direction may reflects the spatial heterogeneity of the amount of the subducted water which related to the difference of the sedimentary unit and seismic activity in the oceanic crust. Our study demonstrates that the directly optimization of Vp/Vs tomographic procedure provides more stable and reliable Vp/Vs image than previous method.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we attempt to incorporate the rupture directivity effects into seismic hazard analysis in the Marmara region, Turkey. We introduce information about the fault segments by focusing on the fault rupture characteristics, near source directivity effects and its influence on the probabilistic seismic hazard analyses (PSHA) accounting for the azimuthal variations of the ground motion spatial distribution. An analytical model developed by Spudich and Chiou (2008) is used as a corrective factor that modifies four ground motion predictive equations (GMPEs) (Abrahamson & Silva 2008; Boore & Atkinson 2008; Campbell & Bozorgnia 2008; Chiou &Youngs 2008) and accounts for rupture related parameters that generally lump together into the term directivity effect. In this paper, we only use the relation calibrated for the Abrahamson & Silva (2008) and Boore & Atkinson (2008).\nIn order to evaluate the impact of the rupture directivity effects to ground motion hazard in the near source we attempt to calculate the fault-based probabilistic seismic hazard maps (PSHA) of mean Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) having 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years on rock site condition. Therefore the PSHMs for the Marmara region is produced incorporating detailed knowledge of active faulting and tectonic rates in earthquake recurrence models using the available database and the most innovative approaches.\nIn order to test the impact of the corrective factor on seismic hazard we first considered its effect on a normal fault and on a strike slip fault as a function of magnitude. Seismic hazard is given in terms of Spectral Acceleration (SA) at seven different periods. We also report the percentage ratio between the seismic hazards computed with the directivity model and without it, over the seismic hazard resulting from the standard practice.\nFinally, we improve the seismic hazard maps in the near fault source incorporating the directivity effects in the ground motion prediction in the Marmara Region. The correction is applied to compute spectral accelerations at 2 sec, 3 sec and 5 sec. At 5 sec the increment in seismic hazard estimation is up to 50% and is achieved along the entire system of faults. At 2 sec the effectiveness of the corrective factor is lower (up to 30%). The areas affected by the modifications are approximately the same.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that (pick-up) ions in the inner heliosphere do not\nmaintain Maxwellian distributions but tend to non-equilibrium distributions\nwith extended suprathermal tails. Such states have been classified as\nquasi-equilibria which in many cases can well be described by so-called\nκ-distributions. With the present study we start out from a phase space\ntransport equation for pick-up ions in the inner heliosphere that adequately\ndescribes the most important processes such as injection, convection, cooling,\nand diffusion in velocity space. Assuming that the underlying distribution\nfunctions are κ-distributions, we proceed from this transport equation\nto a second-order moment, i.e. pressure equation which represents an ordinary\ndifferential equation for the adequate κ-parameter as function of the\nheliocentric distance. This strategy allows one to describe the transition\nfrom an initial Vasyliunas-Siscoe distribution to κ-distributions with\ngradually more pronounced suprathermal tails. While the velocity-dependence of\nthe velocity diffusion coefficient determines the systematic reduction of the\nparameter κ, the latter always has the (formal) asymptotic value\nof 3/2. This translates into values of 1.5 < κ < 2.2\nin the upstream region of the (upwind) solar wind termination shock that defines\nthe outer validity range of the model.",

            "abstract": "Discharge of surplus mine water into ephemeral streams may elevate groundwater levels and alter the exchange rate between streams and underlying aquifers but it is unclear whether volumes and recharge processes are within the range of natural variability. Here, we present a case study of an ephemeral creek in the semi-arid subtropical Hamersley Basin that has received continuous mine discharge for more than five years. We used a numerical model coupled with repeated measurements of water levels, chloride concentrations and the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope composition (δ2H and δ18O) to estimate longitudinal evapotranspiration and recharge rates along a 27 km length of Weeli Wolli Creek. We found that chloride increased from 74 to 120 mg/L across this length, while δ18O increased from -8.24‰ to -7.00‰. Groundwater is directly connected to the creek for the first 13 km and recharge rates are negligible. Below this point, the creek flows over a highly permeable aquifer and water loss by recharge increases to a maximum rate of 4.4 mm/d, which accounts for ~ 65% of the total water discharged to the creek. Evapotranspiration losses account for the remaining ~35%. The calculated recharge from continuous flow due to surplus water discharge is similar to that measured for rainfall-driven flood events along the creek. Groundwater under the disconnected section of the creek is characterised by a much lower Cl concentration and more depleted δ18O value than mining discharge water but is similar to flood water generated by large episodic rainfall events. Our results suggest that the impact of recharge from continuous flow on the creek has not extended beyond 27 km from the discharge point. Our approach using a combination of hydrochemical and isotope methods coupled with classical surface flow hydraulic modelling allowed evaluation of components of water budget otherwise not possible in a highly dynamic system that is mainly driven by infrequent but large episodic floods.

            "abstract": "Hontomín hosts the first Spanish CO2storage Technology Development Plant. The area, located in the southern part of Mesozoic Basque–Cantabrian Basin, presents E-W and ESE-WNW faults formed during a Permian-Triassic extensional event. The latter were reactivated during the opening of the Bay of Biscay, while a new set of NNE-SSW faults developed. Fractures were reactivated again during the Alpine compression. The resulting configuration is a dome-like structure that includes the Mesozoic succession (Upper Triassic to Lower Cretaceous) and is crowned by Upper Cretaceous and Eocene rocks lying unconformably. The target injection pointis located at 1500 m depth, within a Jurassic carbonate saline formation.\nSeveral multidisciplinary studies have been carried out in Hontomín aiming to obtain a thorough geological characterization. Among these, a microgravity survey, acquired under the umbrella of the CIUDEN foundation, has provided us with a complete 3D image of the site. A 4x4 km2area, coincident with that surveyed by 3D seismic reflection, has been sampled using a dense grid with a station spacing of 100 m.\nThe result is a high resolution Bouguer anomaly gravity map capable of offering insights into the subsurface geology down to the depth of the injection point. The application of mathematical procedures to the data has further enhanced its potential for interpretation. The calculated regional anomaly indicates that the dome structure strikes E-W to ENE-WSW, sub-parallel to a major fault: the South Fault, part of the Ubierna fault system. The resulting residual anomaly enhances a number of NW-SE features that have also been interpreted as faults and that can be observed after performing vertical and horizontal derivatives to the data. Calculation of the Euler solutions confirms the previous results and brings out a new NNW-SSE feature, namely the East Fault.\nIntegration with 3D seismic data suggests that faults affect different levels of the sedimentary sequence. Whereas the South and the East faults, identified in both datasets, appear to affect the basement and the entire succession, the NW-SE fault system, not identified in the seismic dataset, only affects shallow sediments. Contrarily, N-S and E-W faults identified in the seismic data set do not have a gravity response, thus suggesting they have a limited offset.",

            "abstract": "Post-depositional U loss or addition in stalagmites lead to increasing/decreasing (230Th/238U) activity ratios and thus to older/younger 230Th/U-ages, respectively. In order to determine potential small-scale age inversions, we determined 230Th, 234U, and 238U isotope abundances in a stalagmite from the Hüttenbläserschachthöhle, western Germany, applying a high-spatial-resolution in-situ LA-MC-ICP-MS technique. This sample has the advantage that – because of its aragonitic composition - the U content is high (several µg g-1) and that large-scale age inversions have been previously detected by solution MC-ICP-MS. Due to the low intensity of 230Th (20 – 80 cps), we carefully optimized the operating parameters of the 213 nm Nd:YAG laser, such as scan speed (4 µm s-1), ablation time (1000 s), spot size (110 µm), and pulse repetition rate (20 Hz). We obtained a repeatability (RSE) of about 0.6 % – 0.9 % for 230Th/238U. The isotope ratios were corrected for instrumental biases using an external carbonate reference material (i.e., a flowstone in secular equilibrium). Including all sources of analytical uncertainty, we obtain a total age error (2 SE) of ca. 8 ka for a 215 ka old sample. Repeated dating of the same layers of the stalagmite yields a reproducibility of ca. 4 %. The LA-MC-ICPMS ages agree with the solution MC-ICP-MS ages within the analytical uncertainty. The high spatial resolution enables to detect small, but significant age inversions, which could not be detected by solution MC-ICP-MS. These inversions can be explained by diagenesis of speleothem CaCO3, which may play an important role for the alteration of speleothem ages.",

Whereas the idea of using GPS for tsunami early warning is clear, its practical implementation still requires extensive studies and validation against real events. The northern Chile 1 Apr. 2014 M8.0 Pisagua earthquake and resulting tsunami was extensively recorded by large number of land- and ocean-based sensors including real-time GPS. Earthquakes of this magnitude range (M7.0-M8.0) are especially challenging for tsunami warning centre since, in contrast to the mega-earthquakes, they do not necessary trigger devastating tsunamis. GPS-fingeprints of such earthquakes may also approach the limit of real-time detect ability. Thus, earthquakes of such a magnitude range fall in \"a blurred zone\", a zone of higher uncertainty in sense of tsunami early warning.\nWe take the opportunity and consider the 2014 Pisagua event as a case study to explore possible sources and magnitudes of uncertainty in the GPS-based real-time tsunami forecasting. In particular, we test uncertainties related to derivation of real-time source model: (1) Uncertainty of co-seismic displacements retrieved by different real-time GPS-processing strategy: precise relative positioning and precise point positioning; by different software platform: RTKLIB, PANDA, EPOS-RT, Bernese (post) (2) Uncertainty of source inversion by different approaches: single Okada fault, distributed slip in homogeneous and layered half space. We consider individual uncertainties as well as their propagation to the final tsunami forecasting. As a result, “up streams” and “down streams” are combined together, in which case a “close loop” criteria is illustrated for evaluation of uncertainty of the GPS-based tsunami forecasting.",

In the recent history 71 GLEs have been recorded. The last one was the May 17, 2012 event that has not only been measured by more than one neutron monitor but also by sophisticated instrumentation in space like PAMELA and the Electron Proton Helium INstrument (EPHIN) aboard SOHO. The January 6, 2014 solar energetic particle (SEP) event led to an intensity increase of about 3 percent at both South Pole neutron monitors and was considered by Thakur et al. (2014) to be a GLE. Since only one pair of neutron monitors show an unambiguous increase the energy spectra for this event can only be determined by spacecraft like e.g. PAMELA or SOHO/EPHIN.\nWe show that the Electron Proton Helium INstrument at Langragian point L1 is capable to measure the proton energy spectra of solar energetic particle events at energies between 150 MeV and above 700 MeV. A GEANT Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to determine the energy response function of EPHIN for electrons, protons and heavier ions. As a result of this calculation we developed a method using energy loss information of particles measured in the detector stack that allow to derive the proton energy spectra in the range from about 150 MeV to more than 700 MeV. In order to validate our method we compared our results to the one obtained by PAMELA that was published by Bazilevskaya et al. (2013) for the May 2012 event.\nFurthermore, the January 6, 2014 event spectrum in the given energy range is presented and discussed in comparison to the May 2012 event.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind composition provides important constraints to solar composition and to the processes that modify such compositional patterns in the atmospheres of the Sun and of active stars. There are a number of ways that composition can be observed, including spectroscopy, helioseismology, and the collection of solar samples either in the form of solar wind or energetic particles. In either case, models are needed to infer compositional constraints from observations. For example, models are needed to interpret solar spectroscopy results, and the evolution of these has recently led to significant changes to the previously accepted solar composition. The collection of solar samples requires a different type of consideration. Most solar wind and energetic particle samples are fractionated according to first ionization potential (FIP) as first pointed out by Hovestadt et al. in the seventies – elements with FIP below 10 eV are enhanced relative to elements at higher FIP, and He and possibly Ne are further depleted. Besides FIP fractionation there are indications from both isotopic and elemental data that mass fractionation, either through gravitational and/or collisional processes, may also play a role.\nBased on comparisons of in situ data with coronal spectroscopy it is evident that most of these processes occur at the interface between the photosphere and the corona. However, the high-latitude corona near solar minimum appears to undergo much less fractionation, if any at all. Thus it provides a heliospheric sample that is – to within our observational constraints – photospheric in nature. The low-latitude heliosphere further provides direct access to plasmas that have the fractionation pattern qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the one observed in the corona.\nWe present a recent reanalysis of the SWICS observations on both Ulysses and ACE using modern statistical tools. Concentrating on C, N, and O, which together with the recently published Ne (Shearer et al., ApJ, 2014) contribute 96% of the solar metallicity, we find that the solar wind metallicity is significantly higher than the recent compilation of spectroscopic abundances (Asplund et al., ARAA, 2009). It is more in line with earlier spectroscopic results and, more importantly, not incompatible with helioseismology results of the solar interior.",

Global measurements of various trace species were performed from the arctic to the early antarctic vortex in August to September 2012. Here, we focus on the northern hemispheric distribution of CO, N2O and ozone above 380 K. In this region we could for the first time identify mixing lines, which indicate mixing between stratospheric air masses of different origin. Introducing a new pair of correlation species (N2O-CO) we could identify air masses, which do not involve mixing directly at the tropopause. The use of CO-N2O correlations provides additional knowledge on the end members and therefore the reservoirs involved in the mixing processes within the stratosphere compared to the CO-O3-correlation. Trace gas distributions for the atmospheric region between the extratropical tropopause and potential temperatures up to Θ = 405 K indicate mixing of 'young' stratospheric air with aged processed air. Backward trajectories indicate that the “younger” stratospheric air masses originate in the Asian monsoon region and contribute to the chemical composition of air above Θ = 380 K, thereby circumventing the TTL region. Therefore we conclude that the monsoon significantly contributes to the flushing of the extratropical UTLS during summer and autumn.",

The AMSR2 soil moisture products which have been produced by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) with a coarse grid scale (50 km) were downscaled by a spatial distribution of thermal inertia (3 km), which was retrived from a two-source linear surface heat budget model using an optimization method in which the input variables such as MODIS surface temperature, insolation retrieved from a geostationary satellite, and surface meterological data were incorporated. The downscale technique employed a characteristic that thermal inertia is almost proportional to volumetric soil moisture content, which was found in results of some field experiments. This downscale technique was applied to the AMSR2 products of summer season of central Mongolia where typical and dry steppe were dominated. A preliminary result of the downscaling technique showed fairly good result that the values of downscaled soil moisture were varied in response to rainfall events at some grids where meteorological stations existed, while the values of AMSR2 were not significantly changed.",

Accurately quantifying cloud amount (or cloud fraction) is of great importance but difficult to accomplish. Satellite and surface observe clouds in different field of views (FOVs), the inconformity of different FOVs may make large discrepancies when compare satellite and surface derived cloud fraction. From the view of surface incident surface solar radiation, this paper compares Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level-2 cloud fraction data with two surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) surface cloud amount dataset at five sites. The correlation coefficients between MODIS and surface cloud fraction are about 0.80-0.91, varied with different SURFRAD sites. There are considerable cases when MODIS observe large cloud fraction bias compared with surface data. The result shows that the variances between MODIS and surface cloud fraction datasets are more apparent when small convective or broken clouds exist in the view. The magnitude of the discrepancy between MODIS and surface derived cloud fraction depends on the sensor zenith angle (SZA) of the satellite. On the average, compared to surface cloud fraction data, MODIS observe larger cloud fraction at SZA >40 º and smaller cloud fraction at SZA <20º. When comparing long-term average of MODIS with surface datasets, Aqua/MODIS observes higher yearly mean cloud fraction. That may be due to that convective clouds are more well developed in the afternoon when Aqua observing.",

            "abstract": "There are numerous sources of uncertainty that impact policy decisions relating to climate change: There is scientific uncertainty, as for example encapsulated in estimates of climate sensitivity. There is policy uncertainty, which arises when mitigation efforts are erratic or are reversed (as recently happened in Australia). There is also technological uncertainty which affects the mitigation pathway. How can policy decisions be informed in light of these multiple sources of uncertainty? We propose an “ordinal” approach that relies on comparisons such as “greater than” or “lesser than” (known as ordinal), which can help sidestep disagreement about specific parameter estimates (e.g., climate sensitivity). To illustrate, recent analyses (Lewandowsky et al., 2014, Climatic Change) have shown that the magnitude of uncertainty about future temperature increases is directly linked with the magnitude of future risk: the greater the uncertainty, the greater the risk of mitigation failure (defined as exceeding a carbon budget for a predetermined threshold). Here we extend this approach to other sources of uncertainty, with a particular focus on “ambiguity” or “second-order” uncertainty, which arises when there is dissent among experts.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols that absorb solar radiation have a direct effect on climate. Brown carbon (BrC) represents the type of carbonaceous aerosols characterized by large absorption coefficients in the near-UV range of the spectrum. BrC can be either directly emitted into the atmosphere from combustion sources, or be formed in the atmosphere through multi-phase reactions, such as aging of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) mediated by ammonium sulfate (AS). Under the conditions of exposure to solar radiation, both primary and secondary BrC can potentially change their molecular composition and optical properties as a result of photodegradation of chromophoric compounds. This presentation will discuss the molecular level composition, the absorption and fluorescence spectra, and the mechanism of photodegradation among several representative types of BrC. The primary BrC samples include aerosol produced by smoldering wood combustion. The secondary BrC samples include AS aged products of chamber-generated SOA, products of reaction between methylglyoxal and AS, and SOA produced by the hogh-NOx photooxdiation of aromatic compounds, such as naphthalene. This presentation will also include preliminary data on the absorption and fluorescence spectra of photo-degraded bioaerosols. In all cases, absorption spectra of extracted bulk samples are measured during irradiation by a known flux of UV or visible light. The molecular level composition of the fresh and photobleached samples are characterized by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS). Photobleaching of BrC is found to occur over a range of atmospherically relevant time scales. In many cases, the molecular level composition of photobleached BrC exhibits only subtle changes suggesting that the optical and fluorescence properties of BrC are controlled by a few compounds present in low quantities. The observed fluorescence from non-biological BrC indicates potential issues in using fluorescence-based methods to detect bioaerosols. Overall, the results demonstrate a high degree of variability in optical properties and the highly dynamic nature of atmospheric BrC.",

            "abstract": "The measurement of seismic anisotropy using the method of shear wave splitting (SWS) has potential as a stress monitoring tool at volcanoes and is increasingly being used by researchers. Even though anisotropy, caused by preferentially aligned microcracks, can be a valid proxy for determining the stress regime in the subsurface, there are many other reasons that SWS may be observed. Anisotropy in the crust may be due to aligned macroscopic fractures, layering, or aligned minerals. Apparent SWS may also be observed due to site effects and phase conversions near the surface. Temporal changes in SWS may be an artefact of migrating sources passing through a heterogeneous anisotropic field.\nAt Tungurahua Volcano in Ecuador, we have analysed SWS from local VT earthquakes from 2008 to 2012, spanning the onset of major eruptive activity in 2010. We have found significant site effects at several of the seismic stations, and corrections indicate how influential these effects can be. We explore both lateral and vertical variation in anisotropy, before targeting temporal variations associated with volcanic activity. Comparison with local geology and ground deformation allows us to identify regions where seismic anisotropy is controlled by local stress and is likely to change due to volcanic activity. Preliminary results suggest that apparent temporal changes in SWS measurements are due to sampling regions controlled by different mechanisms of anisotropy, demonstrating how important it is to identify the cause of anisotropy before seeking temporal variations caused by changing stress.",

This seasonal survey (April 2011 to May 2013) revealed a year-round strong terrigenous contribution to the plant derived particulate organic matter (POM) with significant algal inputs observed in March and attributed to phytoplanktonic blooms likely dominated by diatoms.\nSpecific sitosterol and cholesterol degradation products were quantified and used to estimate the part of biotic and abiotic degradation of POM within the river. Plant-derived organic matter appears to be mainly affected by photo-oxidation and autoxidation (free radical oxidation), while organic matter of human origin, evidenced by the presence of coprostanol, is clearly more prone to bacterial degradation. Despite the involvement of an intense autoxidation inducing homolytic cleavage of peroxy bonds, a significant proportion of hydroperoxides is still intact in higher plant debris. These compounds could play a role in the degradation of terrestrial material by inducing an intense autoxidation upon its arrival at sea.\nAlthough sitosterol has been commonly used as a tracer of the terrestrial origin of POM in rivers, we show here that is it also found in phytoplankton, which highlights the need to use different tracers to determine the origin of POM in rivers. As part of the set of tracers we use, we have identified betulin to be an interesting candidate, although limited to a number of angiosperms species. Not only can we trace betulin to an unequivocal terrestrial origin, we also identified its specific degradation products, allowing us to trace the degradation state of angiosperm particulate debris in rivers, as well as the type of degradation undergone.",

We present new measurements from 50 global earthquakes of fundamental-mode Rayleigh and Love wave amplitude anomalies measured in the period range 35-275 seconds using two different schemes: (i) a standard time-domain amplitude power ratio technique; and (ii) a mode-branch stripping scheme. For minor-arc data, we observe amplitude anomalies with respect to PREM in the range of 0-4, for which the two measurement techniques show a very good overall agreement. We present here a statistical analysis and comparison of these datasets, as well as comparisons with theoretical calculations for a variety of 3-D Earth models. We assess the geographical coherency of the measurements, and investigate the impact of source, path and receiver effects on surface wave amplitudes, as well as their variations with frequency in a wider range than previously studied.",

The object-based model mimics this behaviour: at each iteration truncated ellipsoids (scour-fill deposits) are distributed, as a marked point process, at the previous simulated floodplain surface and are followed on top by a layer with a specified thickness (gravel sheets) that define the next floodplain topography. The truncated ellipsoids have erosional and depositional properties. Compared with the scour-fills, the gravel sheets show much less variability and a much smaller hydraulic conductivities with only a vertical anisotropy. Accordingly, specific three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity tensors and porosity values are stochastically attributed to the truncated ellipsoids and the horizontal layers.\nThis object-based model is able to simulate a large range of the morphodynamics of braided-river systems (scenarios) that result in different sediment sorting processes and, in turn, in specific hydraulic heterogeneity and connectivity patterns of high permeable units.\nIn the context of surface water-groundwater interaction the model is used to assess the impact of some scenarios on the groundwater flow field as well as on solute transport. We evaluate the vertical mixing of the groundwater flows, the horizontal flow deviation caused by the anisotropy of the scour-fill deposits as well as the solute transport behaviour. We discuss the specific hydraulic responses in relation with the heterogeneity and connectivity variability.",

It is shown that the energy distribution is not in accord with standard critical balance and the associated scale anisotropy. This is not surprising as the present setup with isotropic large-scale forcing predominantly yields fluctuations in the weak-turbulence regime. In spite of this, measurable anisotropy of structure-function scaling exists independent of taking spatial increments with respect to the mean or local direction of the magnetic field.\nWe, thus, propose a combination of weak Iroshnikov-Kraichnan dynamics governing energy transfer in the field-perpendicular plane and the ricochet process distributing energy quasi-resonantly along all other directions. This turbulence properties are consistent with the main numerical findings, in particular, regarding the energy spectrum: (i) an inertial-range power law exponent independent of direction, (ii) a direction-dependent power-law spectral-range extent\n∼\nb\nrms/\nB\n0\n. This spectral transfer process asymptotically approaches the 2D IK-cascade as\nB\n0\nincreases.\nThe new transfer mechanism is at variance with the commonly accepted resonant weak-turbulence cascade as well as with the critically balanced strong turbulence cascade, both resulting in strictly perpendicular energy transfer. This is necessary to explain the significant field-parallel extent of the observed energy distribution,The findings also disagree with the small-scale dynamic-alignment phenomenology.\nThe important dynamical roles of (i) pseudo-Alfv\\'en waves and (ii) the correlation time of the turbulence driving are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "In a period of about 1 month starting on October 31, 2013, the Songyuan region inside the central Songliao Basin, northeast China, characterized by null or low historical seismicity, was severely shaken by an intense earthquake sequence, causing significant casualties and property damage. The unusual earthquake sequence included two seismic swarm episodes. At 03:03 UTC on October 31, 2013, the first episode started with an earthquake of Ms 5.7, followed by an Ms 5.1 earthquake. 23 days later, on November 23, another Ms 5.8 earthquake hit the same area. It was preceded by an Ms 5.2 foreshock and followed by an Ms 5.0 aftershock. In addition to these five magnitude 5+ earthquakes, more than 200 aftershocks with a local magnitude scale of ≥1.0 were also recorded. Immediately after the first Ms 5.7 shock, a temporary seismic network of 7 short period stations were deployed in the source area. The combined dataset from permanent and temporary arrays provide us an excellent opportunity to investigate the dynamics of this earthquake sequence. In this study, we first inverted the complete moment tensor of the 5 largest events (Ms > 5) using the combined waveform data. The focal mechanism solutions suggest that the 5 events are predominant by high-angle reverse faulting with an NNE-SSW orientation. The P axis aligns horizontally in the W-E direction, consistent with the regional stress field of the area. In addition, the inverted moment tensor also appears to have significant amount of non-DC component, which might be related to water injection and hydraulic fracturing activities for enhancing oil/gas recovery in the area. By applying double-difference relocation and template based matching technique, we plan to delineate the spatiotemporal evolution of the seismic swarm. Our ultimate goal is to have a better understating of the seismotectonic structure of the fault system and to further explore potential physical processes (stress, fluids etc.) that are responsible for this unusual earthquake sequence.",

            "abstract": "The study is based on a new glacier inventory derived from the recent Landsat TM/ETM+ and ASTER images and the modified first glacier inventory from topographical maps of China. Results indicate that glaciers have been generally in retreat during the late 1950s when there were available maps and ~2010, with very few glaciers in advance. The sample glaciers with two inventories covering 83% of the total area of glaciers first mapped during late 1950s and early 1980s have lost 18.1% of their total area in the past 50 years with an annual rate of -0.54%/a or -243.7 km2/a. Some small glaciers have vanished and some large glaciers have disintegrated into several small glaciers. Of all the mountains in China, glaciers in Altai, Gandise and Sawir Mountains are those with the largest area reduction, over 1/3 of the area of their glaciers in the time of first glacier inventory has disappeared, while the area reduction by 20~30% has been found for glaciers in Himalaya, Tangula, Nyainqêntanglha, Tianshan, eastern Pamir, Qilian and Hengduan Mountains. Glaciers in Karakoram, Kunlun (including Altun) and the central Tibetan Plateau are among the least decrease in area of all glaciers in China, their shrinkages are 11.3~ to 8.4%. The spatial pattern is also confirmed while expressing the area reduction of glaciers in annual percentage, i.e., glaciers of the Qangtang Plateau of the Tibetan Plateau show the smallest shrinkage with gradual increase in annual reduction rate in the surrounding mountains over the Tibetan Plateau. We have measured length changes of >1500 glaciers with a total area of 19628km2, 12.7 km2 in average. Only 53 glaciers with average area of 32.8 km2 displayed the obvious advance during the last 50 years. All glaciers with length measurements have lost 8.7% of their total area in the considered period. All advancing glaciers are mostly located in the Tianshan, eastern Pamir, Karakoram and Kunlun Mountains, with 18 glaciers in Karakoram with almost double annual rate of 17.7m/a compared to 9.6m/a of advancing glaciers in other mountains. The big glaciers might experience less area shrinkage, for example, 65 glaciers larger than 50 km2 in China have lost a total area of 577 km2, -3.8% or -0.1%/a. The general retreat of glaciers may be a result of the regional warming especially during the recent 20 years in western China.",

The number density of O+ ions was ~0.1 cm-3 detected by Cluster C4 within the night-side high-latitude magnetosheath. The observed energetic O+ ion flux was periodic in the ULF wave Pc 5 range, ~ 3 min. The fluctuations of O+ number density, dNO+ were closely correlated with the pulsations of magnetic field, dBx. The phase difference between the dNO+ and dBx is ~ 1800 or ~ 900, which corresponding to the O+ pitch angle distribution mainly in the direction parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field, respectively. These results indicate that the O+ ions can be energized by Pc 5 waves both in the parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field in the night-side high-latitude magnetosheath during the storm initial phase. Our observation investigation presents a new source of the abundant energetic O+ in the plasma sheet during the storm main phase, which is from the night-side high-latitude magnetosheath throughout the magnetopause/mantle/lobe region. These energetic ions are likely one of the major sources of O+ filling into the near-Earth plasma sheet and ring current during the storm main phase.",

            "abstract": "Turbulent diffusion is a cornerstone in geophysical fluid mechanics, controlling the exchange of momentum, heat and mass in surface flows occurring in the atmosphere, in rivers and in the ocean. In fluvial and coastal systems, modeling turbulent diffusion of momentum and suspended sediment requires knowledge about turbulent diffusivities, which is generally derived from parameterizations based on laboratory experiments. Field determinations of momentum and sediment diffusivities are cumbersome, requiring an instrumental array to simultaneously sample turbulence and mean flow quantities in time and in space. Recently, a new technique to analyze geophysical surface flow turbulence was introduced, appropriate for large scale systems, based on coupling of acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs). Here, we extend this approach to obtain collocated profiles of both the Reynolds stress tensor and eddy covariance fluxes, to derive vertical profiles of turbulent momentum and sediment diffusivity in a tidal river. Shear and normal stresses are obtained by combining the variances in radial velocities measured by the ADCP beams. The covariances between radial velocities and calibrated acoustic backscatter allow to determine the three Cartesian components of the turbulent flux of suspended sediment. The main advantage of this new approach is that flow velocity and sediment concentration measurements are exactly collocated, and that it allows to profile over longer ranges, in comparison to existing techniques. Results show that vertical profiles of the inverse turbulent Prandtl-Schmidt number is coherent with corresponding profiles of the sediment diffusivity, rather than with profiles of the eddy viscosity. This implies modelling suspended sediment dynamics requires knowledge about the sediment diffusivity, as the Prandtl-Schmidt number cannot be estimated from the eddy viscosity alone.",

            "abstract": "3D variations in viscosity have a significant effect on predictions of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) models, such as uplift and gravity rate, which are used in a wide range of applications. 3D viscosity maps can be derived from global seismic tomography models. However, the conversion of seismic velocities to mantle temperature and viscosity is subject to large uncertainties due to unknown mantle composition and anelastic corrections (the correction for dispersion of seismic velocities due to anelastic effects). Also the seismic velocities themselves have large uncertainties. Here we investigate these uncertainties and their effect on GIA model predictions.\nThe largest variations in temperature between different tomography models (up to 200 K) occur in the regions of the mantle with the lowest temperatures, because the anelastic correction reduces temperature sensitivity for high temperatures. The effect of different assumptions for mantle composition in the conversion of seismic velocity anomalies to mantle temperature leads to variations in mantle temperature of 30-40K. Preliminary results from employing viscosity maps from two different tomography models in a GIA model show variations in predicted present-day uplift rates of several mm/year.",

            "abstract": "Global mean surface air temperature have risen by 0.74 °C over the last 100 years. However, the definition of mean surface air temperature is still a subject of debate. The most defensible definition might be the integral of the continuous temperature measurements over a day (Td0). However, for technological and historical reasons, mean temperatures (Td1) over land have been taken to be the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperature measurements. All existing principle global temperature analyses over land are primarily based on Td1. Here, I make a first quantitative assessment of the bias in the use of Td1 to estimate trends of mean air temperature using hourly air temperature observations at 5600 globally distributed weather stations from the 1970s to 2013. I find that the use of Td1 has a negligible impact on the global mean warming rate. However, the trend of Td1 has a substantial bias at regional and local scales, with a root mean square error of over 25% at 5°×5° grids. Therefore, caution should be taken when using mean air temperature datasets based on Td1 to examine spatial patterns of global warming.",

In order to understand how such flow varies below the Juan de Fuca plate and is affected by its subduction along the Cascadia forearc, stacked splitting results are determined for 90 offshore and 27 onshore broadband seismometers. These instruments were deployed as part of phases one and two of the Cascadia Initiative, which is an ongoing effort to understand tectonic processes in the Pacific Northwest. The onshore results conform to those of previous studies, suggesting a uniformly trench-perpendicular flow field and thus implying a thick layer of material entrained beneath the slab. The offshore results offer suggestions about how the orientation of asthenospheric flow evolves across the width of the Juan de Fuca plate, and are unique in that they document variation in anisotropy from the ridge to the trench. The results indicate ridge-perpendicular flow geometry close to the Juan de Fuca ridge, which appears to rotate towards the direction of absolute plate motion as one moves towards the trench. As suggested by the latest tomographic images the subducting Juan de Fuca plate is segmented, with ‘gaps’ between the segments. These gaps may act as channels for the flow of mantle material.",

Even if a remarkable wide range of natural and socioeconomical data sets, from stock market values to quantum phase transitions, fit this peculiar law, the conformity to it has deserved few scientific applications, being used mainly as a test to pinpoint anomalous or fraudulent data. We developed a procedure to detect the arrival of seismic waves based on the degree of conformity of the amplitude values in the raw seismic trace to the BL. The signal is divided in time windows of appropriate length and the fitting of the first digits distribution to BL is checked in each time window using a conformity estimator. We document that both teleseismic and local earthquakes can be clearly identified in this procedure and we compare its performance with respect to the classical STA/LTA approach. Moreover, we show that the conformity of the seismic record to the BL does not depend on the amplitude of the incoming series, as the occurrence of events with very different amplitudes result in quite similar degree of BL fitting. On the other hand, we show that natural or man-made quasi-monochromatic seismic signals, surface wave trains or engine-generated vibrations can be identified through their very low BL estimator values, when appropriate interval lengths are used. Therefore, we document that the degree of conformity of a seismic signal with the BL is primarily dependent on the frequency content of that signal.",

Calibration factors were obtained using parallel registrations with the FG5X-221 absolute gravimeter of the FGI.\nWe show selected free oscillation spectra from the SG, and seismic data obtained at Metsähovi with the Nanometrics Trillium 120P broadband seismometer of the Institute of Seismology (University of Helsinki). The noise level of the data is then compared with the New Low Noise Model NLNM.\nThe results with the dual sphere SG can be compared with parallel observations with the SG T020. This 20-year old instrument is situated in the same room at a distance of 2 metres from the dual-sphere SG.",

            "abstract": "Gaseous phase often displays ubiquitous bubble textures within the ice body from natural lakes and ponds. An occurrence of bubbles (enclosures filled with gas) within ice relates to a content of the dissolved gas in the lake/pond water prior to freezing over the surface. When water freezes, dissolved gases are rejected and redistributed at the ice-water interface, depending on the saturation ratio between the gas and water. Therefore, the content of dissolved gases within the water along the ice interface increases as the ice gets thicker. When the concentration of dissolved gases surpasses a critical value (as freezing progresses with variable speed), the water at the interface becomes supersaturated, and gas bubbles nucleate and grow to a visible size along the interface. The bubbles generated at the ice-water interface are either incorporated into the ice crystal as the ice-water interface advances, thus forming gas pores in the ice, or migrated along the interface.\nWe provide temperature measurements of the ice formed under natural winter conditions over the pond Dolní Tušimy in Mokrovraty, Czech Republic. Data show decrease in ice growth rates, while freezing rates remain constant or increase. We interpret this observation as Mpemba effect detected for the first time in natural lake/pond environment. Additionally, distinct layers of gas bubbles were captured after the ice samples were retrieved. Their presence indicates fast growth rates of ice. Our measurements and calculation showed for these layers the maximum growth rates were about 1 μm/s, much lower than when produced in laboratory condition. This comparison emphasizes that the presence of impurities in natural waters lowers the limit of growth rate, required for bubble occurrence, more than order of magnitude compared to distilled water in laboratory setting (from over 20 μm/s down to 1 μm/s).",

Our road toward exascale will continue to increase the generated data volumes to be analyzed, even when reducing data output to coarser output grids before storage and analysis. These problems are not confined to the climate scientific community, but it is shared among several scientific fields, such as high-particle physics, linguistics, and seismology, among others.\nWithin the framework of the European EUDAT project, several emerging services are being developed and deployed operationally to enhance collaborative and federated infrastructures that can scale to very large data volumes, driven by scientific communities' needs and international collaborations notably with the Research Data Alliance (RDA) and through Working Groups involving EUDAT partners and international experts. One of these Working Groups is focusing on Workflows and their execution near the data storage in a federated infrastructure, and these workflows will also be using EUDAT services.\nEUDAT current and upcoming services will be presented, with a focus in how these services will be useful to the climate community ESGF infrastructure in a Big Data era, to perform data analyses that are not hampered by limitations simply because of too large data volumes given today's tools and infrastructures. A generic interface/protocol for abstraction of specific communities federated data environments, enabling cross-communities data sharing and collaboration, will also be presented.\nThis study was funded by the EU project EUDAT funded by the European Commission’s Seventh Framework Research Programme under the grant agreement 283304.",

            "abstract": "Early Eocene climate is characterised by extreme and persistent warmth punctuated by abrupt global warming events (‘hyperthermals’), such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~56 Ma ago), when global temperatures became even warmer. These hyperthermals were associated with perturbations to the global carbon cycle that would have had a profound effect on the distribution of O2in the oceans. However, the timing and extent of any fluctuations in global ocean oxygenation during these events are still poorly constrained.\nIn this study, we investigate how seawater oxygen levels responded to environmental changes in the early Eocene by determining the Mo and U stable isotope compositions of anoxic sediments from the Arctic Ocean obtained by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302. It has previously been shown that these two isotope systems each respond to changes in seawater oxygen levels and that they may be used to reconstruct the extent of global marine anoxia in Earth’s past. Furthermore, since Mo and U have different residence times in the oceans and their isotope fractionations display different sensitivities to dissolved oxygen concentrations, the use of both proxies enables us to estimate past changes in seawater oxygenation with greater confidence. By combining the information provided by these two isotope systems, we are able to better constrain the onset and the severity of the episodes of seawater anoxia during the Eocene, thereby allowing us to better understand the Earth processes that control ocean oxygenation levels.",

            "abstract": "The Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), one of Africa’s most populated transboundary watersheds and home to more than 30 million inhabitants, is increasingly challenged by both water quality problems and water quantity shortages against a backdrop of climate variability and change; and other environmental challenges. As a result of pollution, droughts, more erratic rainfall, heightened demand for water for both consumption and agricultural needs as well as differences in water allocation among the riverine countries of Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi, many parts of this region are already experiencing water scarcity on a recurrent basis. Furthermore, given projected annual population growth rates of 2.5 to 3.5% for the next 20 years, water shortages are likely to be exacerbated in the future. Analyzing historical changes in the water resources of this region is hence important to identify “hot spots” that might be most sensitive to future changes in climate and demography. In this presentation, we report the findings of a comprehensive analysis performed to (i) examine changes in water resources of LVB in recent decades and (ii) identify overlap between regions of significant changes in water resources with land cover changes and high population centers that are also projected to grow the fastest over the coming decades.\nWe first utilize several satellite, stations and model(s) based climatic and hydrologic datasets to assess changes in water resources in this region. We then use a quality-controlled Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product to identify areas of significant land cover changes. Simultaneously we use projections of gridded population density based on differential growth rates for rural and urban population to estimate fastest projected human population growth for 2030 and 2050 relative to 2010 data. Using the outcomes of these change analysis we identify water insecurity hotspots in the LVB.",

This study evaluates for the first time whether the broad igneous activity on Mars may have led to the formation of orthomagmatic Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide mineralisation similar to that associated with terrestrial komatiites and ferropicrites. Particular focus is laid on two different components of the Martian Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide mineral system: 1) the potential metal and sulphur fertility of source regions, and 2) the physical/chemical processes that enable sulphide supersaturation and metal concentration into an immiscible sulphide liquid.\nWe show that potentially metal-rich Martian mantle melts likely reach sulphide saturation within 20-35 wt% of simple silicate fractionation; a value that is comparable to that of the terrestrial equivalents (i.e. ferropicrites and komatiites). However, the majority of terrestrial world-class Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide deposits originated by the assimilation of crustal sulphur-rich country rocks, allowing the attainment of sulphide supersaturation and liquid segregation during early stages of magma evolution. The high sulphur content in Martian crustal lithologies, ranging from sulphide bearing magmatic rocks to sulphate-rich regoliths and sedimentary deposits, imply that mantle melts potentially assimilated significant amounts of crustal sulphur during their ascent and emplacement. As a main outcome we show that channelled and fluid lava flows, which potentially emplaced and incised into these sulphur-rich crustal lithologies, are the most promising systems that may have led to the formation of Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide mineralisation on Mars.",

We provided an idea to investigate the spatio-temporal urban growth using satellite images with population data.\nWe analyze the urban expansion in Japan from 1990 to 2005 by using gridded land-use data, population census data, and DMSP satellite images of nighttime lights. First, we mapped the DMSP nighttime lights and land-use data onto a grid based on the standard 1 km2grid cell system of Japan to determine the proportional areas of DMSP nighttime lights and urban land use within each grid cell. Then, we investigated the relationships among population density, DMSP nighttime lights area, and urban area. A rapid expansion of the urban/built-up area around megacities was associated with population increases; in contrast, population density dropped steeply in rural areas and in small towns.\nSpatial correlation analysis showed a strong positive correlation between population density and urban land use (r= 0.59). In addition, correlation coefficients between population density and DMSP data increased as the DMSP nighttime lights brightness value increased. We then used census population data as the base population input, and performed a linear multiple regression analysis to predict population density from the combination of urban land-use area and DMSP data in Hokkaido, Japan. Visual and numerical evaluation of the results showed that the combination of urban land-use data and DMSP data could be used to predict the spatial distribution of population density.\nThe results from this study indicated the high correlation between these data and suggested the potentials of population density prediction using DMSP data and land use data.\n",

The Eastern China pluvial events during 1376-1427 and 1547-1549 as existing paleoclimatic archives are shown to be part of a global hydroclimatic regime linked to persistent La Niña–like conditions in the tropical Pacific, while which causes the other two pluvial events of 1725-1770 and 1816-1856 is not clear. The model could not produce these pluvials over eastern China during the last millennium except the events occurred in the 18th century. The AOGCM simulations of climate for the first two events are shown to reproduce many aspects of hydroclimate found in paleo‐proxy records for much of the Eastern Hemisphere, northern Eurasia, with the noticeable exception of North and South America, which both strongly linked to ENSO. These results suggest that many features of global hydroclimate changes during these periods could be explained by changes in the tropical interdecadal variability centered over the central and eastern Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Magmatic processes leading to hydrothermal venting and the controls on the distribution of vents at two locations along the New Hebrides arc-backarc system are being revealed by new bathymetric data and geological maps interpreted from remotely operated vehicle dive videos.\nThe Nifonea volcanic complex spans the width of the Vate Trough, a nascent backarc basin located ~50 km to the east of the New Hebrides arc. Hydrothermal activity occurs in the caldera at the summit of Nifonea at a water depth of ~1875 m. A NW-trending eruptive fissure cuts through the center of the caldera near the area of active venting. This fissure is associated with isolated pillow mounds and collapse features along its length, and is the source of extensive jumbled sheet flows that cover the caldera floor. Low-temperature, diffuse venting is widespread; active black smoker chimneys are localized on and around the pillow mounds, in clusters of ~20 x 20 m and growing directly on the flows. The impression is that the hydrothermal venting is young and not yet “organized,” in large part because of the eruptive style dominated by collapsed sheet flows.\nThe Tinakula seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposit is located in a much shallower (~1150 m), extended arc-backarc setting at the northern end of the New Hebrides arc, ~25 km from the arc front. Chimney fields occur along two corridors, and are associated with volcanic mounds and calderas. The eastern field occupies an area of ~1200 x 200 m, and the western sulfide field is ~500 x 100 m in size. The density of chimneys appears to be largely controlled by permeability of the volcanic facies, which are dominated by autoclastic and hyaloclastic breccias. Tinakula has been commercially drilled, offering insight into the third dimension of the system.\nThis is one of the first studies of SMS deposits in the New Hebrides arc and fills a ‘knowledge gap’ in the occurrence of seafloor hydrothermal systems in arc-related settings of the Melanesian archipelago.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive mechanism to explain seismicity in stable intraplate regions remains enigmatic. Within eastern and central North America, for example, a number of moderate to large-sized earthquakes have occurred, with the New Madrid sequence of 1811 and 1812 being the most noteworthy. The much more recent M 5.8 Virginia earthquake is a fresh reminder that there is a source for strain accumulation within eastern North America. Although there is agreement that these intraplate earthquakes owe their activity to the reactivation of ancient faults created during previous tectonic events, there is no comprehensive model to explain how these faults get reactivated. Several hypotheses exist, including lithospheric sources, such as ridge push, coupling with mantle flow, or even strain release associated with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Here we explore whether tectonic effects, which consist of forces associated with topography and lithosphere structure (gravity potential energy differences – GPE), coupled with the effects of large scale mantle flow, are compatible as a source of stress for seismicity within eastern US. We compare the p-axes of all compiled earthquake mechanisms in this region to the SHmax directions of deviatoric stresses, modeled using a global finite element method. The method we employ couples gravitational potential energy derived stresses with stresses from a global density-driven mantle convection model that incorporates both radial and lateral viscosity variations. Additionally, we also investigate how lateral strength variations within the lithosphere of continental North America and adjacent regions affect these forces, and consequently the occurrence of earthquakes in this region.",

            "abstract": "The current consensus is that humans evolved in Africa and then migrated in waves to other parts of the world starting as early as 2 Ma. The climate was both cooling and drying. One of the major unknowns connected with human survival in this climatically turbulent environment is the availability of resources, particularly water. A growing body of geological evidence shows an association between springs, stone tools and hominin fossils at a number of sites in the East African Rift System (EARS) during a critical period for hominin evolution (from 1.8 Ma). The springs may have been vulnerable to climate variability, thus the role that groundwater availability may have played in human evolution and migration to other continents is not known.\nUsing palaeogeological reconstruction and groundwater modelling of the paleo-catchment of one such EARS site, Olduvai Gorge (3°S), we show how spring discharge was likely linked to climate variability of annual to Milankovitch cycle timescales. Under decadal to centennial timescales, spring flow would have been relatively invariant providing good water resource resilience through long droughts. For multi-millennial periods, modelled spring flows lag groundwater recharge by 100s to 1000 years. Our results show how groundwater would have provided ‘drought proof’ water supply and habitats during arid phases as potable surface water from rivers or lakes became increasingly scarce.\nLocalized groundwater systems are likely to have been widespread within the EARS providing refugia and intense competition during dry periods. Thus, springs and associated wetlands may have been important factors in natural selection and evolution, as well as a vital resource during dispersal within and out of Africa. While further exploration is needed to test the geographical extent of groundwater use by early humans, we propose that groundwater flow systems produced in the EARS played a significant role in the evolution and dispersal of early humans.",

            "abstract": "The major difficulty in detecting the aerosol signal from visible and near-infrared remote sensing observations is to reach the proper separation of the components related to the atmosphere and the surface. This issue becomes especially challenging over bright targets such as deserts. A method is proposed to circumvent this issue by exploiting the directional and temporal dimensions of the satellite signal through the use of a semi-empirical kernel-driven model for the surface/atmosphere coupled system. As a result, simultaneous retrieval of surface albedo and aerosol properties is made possible. The proposed method proves to be capable of detecting and tracking the presence of anthropogenic aerosols, volcanic ash emissions and dust events over deserts.\nThe proposed method referred to as AERUS-GEO (Aerosol and surface albEdo Retrieval Using a directional Splitting method - application to GEO data) is applied to three spectral bands (0.6 mm, 0.8 mm, and 1.6 mm) of MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) observations, which scan Europe, Africa, and the Eastern part of South America every 15 minutes. The AERUS-GEO AOD estimates compare favorably with measurements of several AERONET stations, MODIS-derived (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer), and MISR-derived (Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer) products within a 20% of accuracy. Also, results reveal the capability of AERUS-GEO to detect more aerosol events within a given time period compared to products derived from low Earth orbit satellites. This higher availability of AOD products thanks to AERUS-GEO may benefit the accurate monitoring of the aerosol radiative forcing. The AERUS-GEO algorithm was recently implemented by the ICARE Data Center (http://www.icare.univ-lille1.fr), which operationally disseminates a daily AOD product at 670 nm over the MSG disk since 2014.",

A partial correlation coefficient method is used to detect the drought effects on plant growth in association with the consideration of the temperature and solar radiation influence. The results reveal that the vegetation in the arid regions can respond to droughts at short time-scales, and it is most likely that there are some mechanisms allowing the plant species in arid regions to rapidly adapt to changing water availability. The plant species in humid regions can respond droughts shortly. Further, the respond time of the plants in semiarid and subhumid regions to droughts is long, probably because the plants are able to bear water shortage but response to droughts slowly.",

The Heletz area is located in the Southern part of the Mediterranean Coastal Plain, about 7km from the sea shore. The target layer is composed of sandstone, has a thickness of ~20 meters and is located at a depth of ~1500 m.\nFlow-through laboratory experiments of CO2-rich brine were realized to evaluate the chemical processes occurring in the Heletz site. The Heletz sandstone rock is poorly consolidated and has a high porosity (around 23%) and connectivity. Consequently, it was impossible to core the rock into small core rock sample of 9 mm diameter and 18 mm length. We decided to reproduce artificial core rock samples using stainless steel core folder of external sizes 9 x 18 mm and internal size of 7 x 14 mm. We placed in both side one sintered stainless steel sample of 7 mm diameter and 2 mm long and we pressed the Heletz sandstone grains rock sample into the stainless steel folder and sintered discs. The mineralogy, mineral grains sizes and porosity of natural Heletz rock sample were reproduced to mimic the chemical and structural properties of Heletz reservoir. We performed four flow-through experiments at in situ storage conditions (T = 60 ºC, P = 15 MPa, PCO2 = 1.8 MPa). The flow rates injection were 0.05 and 0.30 mL.min-1. Two different brine solutions were used, both representative of the Heletz reservoir native water. The first one was a synthetic brine of the Heletz reservoir (closed to seawater). The second one was the first one equilibrated with gypsum.\nThe results show an increase in permeability and porosity for all the percolation experiment whatever the flow rate and the brine solution. This is explained by the dissolution of dolomite and feldspar. We observed that the permeability increase is higher and faster for high flow rate injection than for low flow rate. Secondary minerals precipitate during the CO2 injection such as clays and gypsum.",

            "abstract": "The seismometers that the Apollo astronauts deployed on the Moon provide the only recordings of seismic events from any extra-terrestrial body so far. These lunar events are significantly different from ones recorded on Earth, in terms of both signal shape and source processes. Thus they are a valuable test case for any experiment in planetary seismology. In this study, we analyze Apollo 16 data with a single-station event detection and classification algorithm in view of NASA's upcoming InSight mission to Mars. InSight, scheduled for launch in early 2016, has the goal to investigate Mars' internal structure by deploying a seismometer on its surface. As the mission does not feature any orbiter, continuous data will be relayed to Earth at a reduced rate. Full range data will only be available by requesting specific time-windows within a few days after the receipt of the original transmission. We apply a recently introduced algorithm based on hidden Markov models that requires only a single example waveform of each event class for training appropriate models. After constructing the prototypes we detect and classify impacts and deep and shallow moonquakes. Initial results for 1972 (year of station installation with 8 months of data) indicate a high detection rate of over 95% for impacts, of which more than 80% are classified correctly. Deep moonquakes, which occur in large amounts, but often show only very weak signals, are detected with less certainty (~70%). As there is only one weak shallow moonquake covered, results for this event class are not statistically significant. Daily adjustments of the background noise model help to reduce false alarms, which are mainly erroneous deep moonquake detections, by about 25%. The algorithm enables us to classify events that were previously listed in the catalog without classification, and, through the combined use of long period and short period data, identify some unlisted local impacts as well as at least two yet unreported deep moonquakes.",

            "abstract": "Mycorrhizal and heterotrophic respiration may represent up to 80% of total soil respiration in temperate environments; however little is known about arid environments where the dynamics of carbon cycling is less known. To improve models of CO2 efflux to the atmosphere in these environments it is necessary to quantify the contribution of soil components (roots, mycorrhizas and heterotrophic respiration) to soil respiration and their response to temperature increases. We settled up a soil partitioning experiment in December 2013 to address this topic. Using a mesh-collar design we quantified soil respiration of the tree main components (roots, mycorrhiza and heterotrophic respiration) in a Mediterranean arid location dominated by the shrub Rethama sphaerocarpa under two temperature regimes, an increased air temperature using open-top chambers (OTC) and a control. For the firths 6 months of measurements, we recorded a decrease in annual species cover with increased temperature; total soil respiration varied between treatments, being higher in the control treatment while, contrary to our expectations, mycorrhizal and soil heterotrophic respiration did not vary between treatments. When looking at the relative contribution of the different soil components, the treatment enclosing both mycorrhizal and soil heterotrophic respiration represented more than half the total soil respiration. These results show that temperature affects total soil respiration and that, in our case, mycorrhizal and soil heterotrophic community were not major drivers of soil respiration responses to temperature. However, these data correspond to an abnormal dry period and data to be collected during the wet season would help us to better understand the contribution of the different soil components to temperature increases in arid environments.",

The main focus of CP4O has been on the additional measurement capabilities that are offered by the SAR mode of the SIRAL altimeter, with further work in developing improved geophysical corrections.\nCP4O has developed SAR based ocean products for application in four themes: Open Oceans, Coastal Oceans, Polar Oceans and Sea Floor Topography. The team has developed a number of new processing schemes and compared and evaluated the resultant data products. This work has clearly demonstrated the improved ocean measuring capability offered by SAR mode altimetry and has also added significantly to our understanding of the issues around the processing and interpretation of SAR altimeter echoes.\n The project finishes in the summer of 2014, so this paper presents an overview of the major results and outlines a proposed roadmap for the further development and exploitation of these results in operational and scientific applications.\nThe results are of course also highly relevant to support the planning for future missions, including Sentinel-3 and Jason-CS.\n The “CryoSat Plus for Oceans” (CP4O) project has been supported by ESA (Support To Science Element) and CNES.",

            "abstract": "The orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is usually aligned with a spiral form. Sometimes this orientation becomes radial, i.e., the solar wind plasma flowing in align with the IMF. Under this circumstance, the magnetospheric system, including the bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, and magnetosphere, responds to the radial IMF in a way that is different from the other orientations. For example, the magnetopause moves outward and the bow shock moves inward, resulting a thin magnetosheath. Although the magnetospheric state for radial IMF is generally quiet, active local field-aligned currents can be observed in the high-latitude ionosphere. In this presentation, the current understandings and future perspectives on the origin of the radial IMF and its effects on the magnetospheric system will be reviewed.",

The phase assemblage consists of glass, clinopyroxene, spinel, and plagioclase with the occurrence of sporadic olivine, orthopyroxene and melilite. Both the glass and crystalline fractions are well correlated with the composition of residual melt. Generally, the amount of crystals decreases with increasing cooling rate. However, some exceptions occurs showing no correlations or even opposite trends. For the example of, Al2O3 and CaO in clinopyroxenes from B100, B80R20, B60R40 and B40R60, their concentrations scale as a function of both cooling rate and the degree of clinopyroxene crystallization.\nThe value of Rc changes of 5 order of magnitude from <1 to ~9000 °C/h when the melt composition changes from R100 to B100, respectively. The most important Rc variations are measured between B80R20 and B60R40, levelling off towards B100. This trend scales with NBO/T (non bridging oxygen per tetrahedron) and can be modelled by the following master sigmoid equation: Rc = a / 1+e-(NBO/T-xo/b), where a, b and xo are fitting parameters equal to 9214, 0.040 and 0.297, respectively.\nOur data can be used to retrieve the solidification conditions of aphyric, degassed and oxidised lavas. Indeed, the relationship between crystal content and cooling kinetics suggests that the solidification path is more complex than previously assumed and strongly non-linear. This finding has also implications to design glass-ceramics based on natural, accessible and low-cost starting materials.",

            "abstract": "Faial is one of the most volcanically active islands of the Azores Archipelago. Historical eruptions occurred on the Capelo Peninsula (westernmost sector of the island) during A.D. 1672–1673 and more recently in A.D. 1957–1958. The other exposed volcanic products of the peninsula are so far loosely dated within the Holocene. Here, we present a successful attempt to correlate scoria cones and lava flows yielded by the same eruption on the Capelo Peninsula using paleomagnetic data from 31 sites (10 basaltic scoriae, 21 basaltic lava flows). In the investigated products, we recognize at least six prehistoric clusters of volcanic activity, whereas 11 lava sites are correlated with four scoria cones. Dating was conducted by comparing our paleomagnetic directions with relocated Holocene reference curves of the paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field from France and the UK. We find that the studied volcanic rocks exposed on the Capelo Peninsula are younger than previously believed, being entirely formed in the last 8 k.y., and that the activity intensified over the last 3 k.y. Our study confirms that paleomagnetism is a powerful tool for unraveling the chronology and characteristics of Holocene activity at volcanoes where geochronological age constraints are still lacking",

            "abstract": "The Louisville Ridge Seamount Chain (LRSC) is a 4300 km-long chain of Cretaceous-Cenozoic seamounts. The oldest extant seamount (~77-79 Ma) intersects the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone at ~26S, coinciding with the divide between the Tonga forearc morphology to the north and the contrasting Kermadec forearc to the south.\nMultichannel seismic reflection (MCS), wide-angle (WA) refraction, gravity, magnetic, swath bathymetry, and Parasound data were collected along an ~725 km profile over the LRSC and the overriding plate during R/V Sonne cruise SO215 in 2011. The objectives of this study are to determine: 1) the structure of the LRSC and pre-subduction crust, identifying any along-ridge variation in crustal structure or magmatic underplating, 2) how seamounts interact with the overriding plate during subduction, and 3) how along-ridge variation in topography and crustal structure relate to post-collisional forearc uplift. Interpretation of these features will be complemented by previous profiles acquired perpendicular to the LRSC and adjacent parts of the trench.\nWe apply a forward ray-tracing approach to the WA data obtained by 55 OBS to develop a crustal and upper mantle velocity model. The initial model is developed using MCS data to determine the sediment thickness and velocity, and this is underlain by average thickness and velocity oceanic crust and upper mantle. The resulting best-fit velocity model will be used to re-stack the MCS data, and tomographic inversion of travel times will be performed to test uniqueness. The velocity model will be converted into a density model and the gravity anomaly calculated and compared with the observed free-air gravity anomaly. Here we present an in-progress LRSC model, which will be used to characterize seamount structure prior to subduction at the trench and guide investigations as to whether any intact seamounts older than 77-79 Ma are present on the subducting plate interface.",

A generic shortcoming of this model type, however, is a tendency for the advection scheme to produce unphysical numerical diapycnal mixing, which in some cases may exceed the explicitly parameterised mixing based on observed physical processes, and this is likely to have effects on the long-timescale evolution of the simulated climate system. Despite this, few quantitative estimations have been made of the magnitude of the effective diapycnal diffusivity due to numerical mixing in these models.\nGO5.0 is the latest ocean model configuration developed jointly by the UK Met Office and the National Oceanography Centre (Megann et al, 2014), and forms part of the GC1 and GC2 climate models. It uses version 3.4 of the NEMO model, on the ORCA025 ¼° global tripolar grid. We describe various approaches to quantifying the numerical diapycnal mixing in this model, and present results from analysis of the GO5.0 model based on the isopycnal watermass analysis of Lee et al (2002) that indicate that numerical mixing does indeed form a significant component of the watermass transformation in the ocean interior.",

            "abstract": "The influence of climate on erosion of alpine catchments has been sparsely understood due to the missing temporal or spatial resolution of archives and the quantification of processes. Sediment budget studies in the Alps show severalfold increased lateglacial denudation compared to the present being in line with the concept of paraglacial cycle.\nHere, we present results coupling a 15-ky record of cosmogenic 10Be-derived paleo-denudation rates (n=42) from a 160 m Stappitz lake archive in the Austrian Alps (Seebach-Valley, 34 km2) and a two-year timeseries of the modern stream. The age-depth chronology was established using 14C dates and relative pollen-stratigraphy. Postdepositional correction for the core samples was not necessary due to sufficient shielding while deposited in a lake. Catchment mapping combined with glacial extents reconstructions of revealed prominent lateglacial moraines which likely decoupled the sediment flux from upper valley flanks to the trunk stream since Younger Dryas. Thus, we interpret the denudational pattern as being dominated by the lower hillslopes for the Holocene with only minimal admixing of glacial material. The latter was probably the dominant sediment source in the lateglacial. The beginning of the Holocene shows decreasing denudation rates down to a minimum at 5 ky BP from 1.0 to 0.3 mm/yr. The transition from 5 to 3 ky BP is marked with increasing rates up to the level of the last 3 ky with 0.6 mm/yr, similar to the modern rate. Given the stratigraphy of the core, we attribute the rather low alpine denudation rates to the stabilising effect of vegetation on the hillslopes. Based on an assumed lag time, the denudation rates increase due to the cooler and wetter climate in the late Holocene resulting in less vegetation (on the slopes), more shallow debris-flows and frost cracking. Our results suggest that in the study area climate modulates denudation by dictating vegetation on the hillslopes and efficient frost cracking processes. Importantly, the state of coupling of sediment storage compartments e.g. glacial deposits to the trunk stream has to be considered otherwise nuclide concentrations might be solely a result of mixing. Furthermore, our data seem to contradict the concept of paraglacial cycle. Denudation rate and sediment flux might be not as tightly coupled as commonly assumed.",

Here, we use Crystallographic Preferred Orientation (CPO) and Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) data to reveal the kinematic evolution of the metamorphic core of the Himalayan orogen, the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS).\nThe Himalayan orogen is commonly explained with models of channel flow, which describe the GHS as a partially molten, rheologically weak mid crustal channel. Extrusion of the channel was facilitated by coeval reverse- and normal-sense shear zones, at the lower and upper channel margins respectively. Whilst many thermobarometric studies support the occurrence of channel flow, the spatial and temporal distribution of strain within the GHS is one aspect of the model that is yet to be fully resolved. We present a quantified strain proxy profile for the GHS in the Annapurna–Dhaulagiri region of central Nepal and compare our results with the kinematic predictions of the channel flow model.\nSamples were collected along a NS transect through the Kali Gandaki valley of central Nepal for CPO and AMS analysis. Variations in CPO strength are used as a proxy for relative strain magnitude, whilst AMS data provide a proxy for strain ellipsoid shape. Combining this information with field and microstructural observations and thermobarometric constraints reveals the kinematic evolution of the GHS in this region.\nLow volumes of leucogranite and sillimanite bearing rocks and evidence of reverse-sense overprinting normal-sense shearing at the top of the GHS suggest that channel flow was not as intense as model predictions. Additionally, observed EW mineral lineations and oblate strain ellipsoid proxies in the Upper GHS, indicative of three dimensional flattening and orogen parallel stretching, cannot be explained by current channel flow models.\nWhilst the results do not refute the occurrence of channel flow in the Annapurna-Dhaulagiri Himalaya, orogen parallel deformaiton may also play an important role during the evolution of the GHS. Such processes should be fully investigated to understand the role of orogen parallel deformation in the development of the Himalaya to further our knowledge of lithospheric deformation during orogenesis.",

This mission is performed through real time acquisition, processing, and evaluation of data acquired by a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic, and infrasonic sensors. Automatic and human reviewed event solutions are stored in a data warehouse which contains over 15 years of alphanumeric information and waveform data. A significant effort is underway to employ the data warehouse in real time processing to improve the quality of automatic event solutions, reduce analyst burden, and supply decision makers with information regarding relevant historic events. To this end, the US NDC processing pipeline has been modified to automatically recognize events built in the past. Event similarity information and the most relevant historic solution are passed to the human analyst to assist their evaluation of automatically formed events. This is achieved through real time cross correlation of selected seismograms from automatically formed events against those stored in the data warehouse. Historic events used in correlation analysis are selected based on a set of user defined parameters, which are tuned to maintain pipeline timeliness requirements. Software architecture and database infrastructure were modified using a multithreaded design for increased processing speed, database connection pools for parallel queries, and Oracle spatial indexing to enhance query efficiency.

            "abstract": "The Continental Deep Drilling Programme (KTB) was a scientific drilling project from 1987 to 1995 near Windischeschenbach, Bavaria. The main super-deep borehole reached a depth of 9,101 meters into the Earth's continental crust. The project used the most current equipment for data capture and processing. After the end of the project key data were disseminated through the web portal of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). The scientific reports were published as printed volumes.\nAs similar projects have also experienced, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a data portal over a long time. Changes in software and underlying hardware make a migration of the entire system inevitable. Around 2009 the data presented on the ICDP web portal were migrated to the Scientific Drilling Database (SDDB) and published through DataCite using Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) as persistent identifiers. The SDDB portal used a relational database with a complex data model to store data and metadata. A PHP-based Content Management System with custom modifications made it possible to navigate and browse datasets using the metadata and then download datasets.\nThe data repository software eSciDoc allows storing self-contained packages consistent with the OAIS reference model. Each package consists of binary data files and XML-metadata. Using a REST-API the packages can be stored in the eSciDoc repository and can be searched using the XML-metadata. During the last maintenance cycle of the SDDB the data and metadata were migrated into the eSciDoc repository. Discovery metadata was generated following the GCMD-DIF, ISO19115 and DataCite schemas.

            "abstract": "The vertical transition from roughness sublayer to inertial layer is a well-established concept in turbulent boundary layer flows over complex topographies. The transition occurs at approximately three times the canopy height, below which the turbulence statistics resemble a turbulent mixing layer. Turbulent momentum fluxes in `canopy turbulence’ or `obstructed shear flows’ (Ghisalberti, 2008 JFM 641, 51—61) are typically dominated by turbulent sweep events (downward excursions of high momentum fluid), owing to the presence of coherent motions that occupy the region of fluid above the canopy. We have used large-eddy simulation with an immersed boundary method to study turbulent flows over a distribution of uniform height, staggered cubes. The computational domain has been designed such that both the roughness sublayer and a region of the inertial layer are resolved. With this, we record vertical profiles of time series of fluctuations of streamwise velocity, , and vertical velocity, . Contour images of fluctuating velocity component (where fluctuation is computed as a quantity’s deviation from its time-averaged value during a time period over which the simulation exhibits statistical stationarity) shown relative to vertical position and time reveals an advective-lag between the passage of a high- or low-momentum region in the aloft inertial layer and excitation or relaxation of cube-scale coherent vortices in the sublayer. We quantify this advective lag and demonstrate how these events precede elevated Reynolds stresses associated with turbulent sweeps at the cube height. We propose that coherent, low and high momentum regions in the inertial layer are responsible for the reported advective lag. Vortex identification techniques are used to illustrate the presence of hairpin packets encapsulating low momentum regions. A simple, semi-empirical model for prediction of advective lag with height is developed. In spite of its simplicity, the model manages to capture the advective lag profiles reasonably well.",

The measured tritium concentrations were interpreted (i) with reference to historical records at three nearby GNIP (Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation) stations in Ethiopia, (ii) in conjunction with hydrochemical variables that can imply residence time of water in aquifer formations and unsaturated layers, and (iii) in association with some of the major basin attributes that could potentially influence on the process of natural recharge, hence, age of aquifer waters. The measured tritium counts in 102 water samples generally fall between 2.5 and 4 TU. Measurements portrayed no spatial patterns and defined relations with variables including concentration of chloride, molar ratios of Mg2+ to Ca2+ and Na+ to Cl-, NO3-, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chemical water types, fracture density, static water level, depth to water table, depth of well, depth of precipitation, degree of aridity, drainage density, and surface slope. This study shows the limited application of tritium to quantify the residence time of recharge waters and conceptualize the mechanism of recharge in the study area.

More recently, Pedatella et al. [2014], using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Extended version (WACCM-X) and the thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIME-GCM) has demonstrated that the semi-diurnal lunar tide (M2) is an important contributor to the ionosphere variability during the 2009 SSW. Although the model results were focused on the low-latitude ionosphere and compare with Jicamarca electric fields, Pedatella et al. [2014] also reported that the M2 was enhanced in the northern mid and high latitudes (between 30 and 70oN) at mesospheric and lower thermospheric altitudes during the 2009 SSW. Motivated by this finding, we have analyzed winds from 80 to 100 kms obtained with meteor radars from Juliusruh (54oN) and Andøya (69oN) stations during five SSWs (2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013). By fitting the usual solar components (diurnal and semidiurnal and M2, we have been able to identify clearly the enhancement of the M2 as well as the semi diurnal solar tide during all these SSWs. The qualitative agreement with the Pedatella et al. [2014] simulations is very good, i.e., stronger signature at 54oN than at 69oN and enhanced around SSW. The analysis of other SSWs not only show the clear relationship with SSWs, but also the different behaviors in strength, time of occurrence, duration, etc., that appear to be associated to the mean wind dynamics as well as the stratospheric planetary wave characteristics.",

This data can potentially be used to estimate the depth of the observed flows on the Jupiter. Here, we propose a new methodology for the inversion of the gravity data into into the full three-dimensional flow on Jupiter. Using the adjoint method we construct an inverse model for a dynamical model in which the gravity field is calculated from the observed surface wind, thus allowing its backward integration, from the gravity field to the wind. Given a gravity field, the adjoint based model finds the atmospheric dynamics that can explain best the gravity field (minimum difference). The dynamical model is set up to allow either zonal flow only, or a full horizontal flow in both zonal and meridional directions based on the observed cloud-level wind. In addition, dynamical perturbations resulting from the the non-spherical shape of the planet are accounted for. The dynamical model, together with its adjoint counterpart, are used for examination of various scenarios, including cases in which the depth of the wind depend on latitudinal position.",

            "abstract": "The temporal and spatial correlation among earthquakes in diffuse plate boundary zones is not well understood yet. The region north of the Garlock fault between the Sierra Nevada and Death Valley is part of a diffuse plate boundary zone, which absorbs a significant fraction of the plate motion between Pacific and North America. This area has experienced at least eight Mw ≥ 6 earthquakes in historical times, beginning with the 1872 Mw 7.5 Owens Valley earthquake. Furthermore, since 1978 Long Valley caldera has been undergoing periods of unrest, with earthquake swarms and resurgence. Our goal is to determine whether the 1872 Owens Valley earthquake has influenced the seismicity and volcanic activity in the area. We model the evolution of coseismic, interseismic and postseismic Coulomb stress (ΔCFS) in the region due to both earthquakes and caldera activity in the last 150 years. Our results show that the 1872 Owens Valley earthquake strongly encourages faulting in northern Owens Valley. In addition, there is a correlation among smaller events, in the form of a west-to-east migration of earthquakes from Long Valley caldera toward the White Mountains immediately following the 1978 caldera inflation event. The last event in this sequence, the 1986 Mw 6.3 Chalfant Valley earthquake, controls the location of over 80% of its own aftershocks, which occur in areas of positive ΔCFS and reach Mw 5.7. We also calculate the cumulative ΔCFS on several major active faults in the region. Stresses up to 30 bars and 10 bars respectively have accumulated on the White Mountains (Central section) and Deep Springs faults, comparable to the expected stress drop in an average earthquake. Because no surface ruptures more recent than 1.8 ka have been identified on these faults [dePolo, 1989; Lee et al., 2001], we consider them as likely candidates for the next major earthquake in the region.",

            "abstract": "The study of detrital shocked minerals (DSMs) merges planetary science, sedimentology, mineralogy/crystallography, accessory mineral geochemistry, and geochronology, with the goal of identifying and determining provenance of shock metamorphosed sand grains. Diagnostic high-pressure impact-generated microstructures (planar fractures, planar deformation features) are readily identified on external grain surfaces using standard SEM imaging methods (BSE), and when found, unambiguously confirm an impact origin for a given sand grain. DSMs, including quartz, zircon, monazite, and apatite, have thus far been documented at the Vredefort Dome [1,2,3], Sudbury [4], Rock Elm [5], and Santa Fe [6,7] impact structures. DSMs have been identified in alluvium, colluvium, beach sand, and glacial deposits. Two main processes are recognized that imply the global siliciclastic record contains DSMs: they survive extreme distal transport, and they survive ‘deep time’ lithification. Distal transport: In South Africa, shocked minerals are preserved in alluvium from the Vaal River >750 km downstream from the Vredefort impact; SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology has confirmed the origin of detrital shocked zircon and monazite from shocked Vredefort bedrock [2]. Vredefort-derived shocked zircons have also been found at the mouth of the Orange River on the Atlantic coast, having travelled ~2000 km downriver from Vredefort [8]. Deep time preservation: Vredefort-derived shocked zircon and quartz has been documented in glacial diamictite from the 300 Myr-old Dwyka Group in South Africa. Shocked minerals were thus entrained and transported in Paleozoic ice sheets that passed over Vredefort [9]. An impact crater can thus be viewed as a unique ‘point source’, in some cases for billions of years [2,4]; DSMs thus have applications in studying eroded impact craters, sedimentary provenance, landscape evolution, and long-term sediment transport processes throughout the geologic record.

To assist the interpretation of the break-up and drift mechanisms and its relation with mantle circulation patterns, we carried out a 2D numerical modelling of the dynamics of these processes. Different regimes of upper plate deformation are studied as consequence of stress coupling with convection patterns. Subduction of the oceanic plate and induced mantle flow propagate basal tractions to the upper plate. This mantle drag forces (FMD) can be subdivided in two types: (1) active mantle drag occurring when the flow drives plate motion (FAD), and (2) passive mantle drag (FPD), when the asthenosphere resists plate motion. The active traction generated by the convective cell is counterbalanced by passive mantle viscous drag away from it and therefore tension is generated within the continental plate. The shear stress profiles indicate that break-up conditions are met where the gradient of the basal shear stress is maximised, however the break-up location varies largely depending on the convection style primarily controlled by slab stagnation on the transition zone, avalanching through or subduction in the lower mantle. We found good correspondence between our models and the evolution of convergent margins on Earth, giving precious insights into the break-up and drifting mechanisms of some continental plates, such as the North and South American plates, Calabria and the Japan Arc.",

High resolution simulations are conducted with triple nested domains having horizontal resolution of 27, 9 and 3 km; 51 vertical levels by using the 1x1 degree NCEP Final Analysis meteorological fields for initial and boundary conditions. In the study, eight fair weather days in each season (winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) with no significant synoptic activity are chosen. Sensitivity experiments are conducted with two non-local [Yonsei University (YSU), Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2)] and three local turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) closure [Mellor- Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 2.5 PBL (MYNN2), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), and quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE)] turbulence diffusion parameterisations to study the evolution of PBL parameters and thermodynamic structure during the all seasons. The model simulated parameters are validated with the available in situ meteorological observations at Ranchi. Simulations reveal that the low-level flow field is highly influenced by the topography and widely varies in different seasons. Results indicates the non-local PBL schemes ACM2 followed by YSU and the TKE closure MYNN2 could capture the local scale circulations and the diurnal trends in surface meteorological variables, surface layer fluxes and the vertical atmospheric structure in better agreement with observations over the Ranchi. The better performance of ACM2, YSU, MYNN2 is evident in the lesser bias, MAE and RMSE for various parameters relative to other PBL schemes.\nKey words: WRF model, Planetary Boundary layer Parameterization, Complex Terrain",

            "abstract": "In this study we present for the first time the nonmigrating tidal spectrum for the electron density in the topside ionosphere on global scale for different seasons at both solar maximum and minimum conditions. The electron density observations from the CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload) satellite provide evidence for prominent nonmigrating tides at different latitude regions. The diurnal tides DE1, D0, and DW2 appear preferably at middle and high latitudes during all the seasons. DE1 is only found in the northern middle and high latitudes, while D0 and DW2 are much stronger in the southern hemisphere. These tides are believed to be driven by the thermospheric winds through ion-neutral interactions. The semidiurnal tides SW1 and SW3 can also be found with appreciable amplitudes throughout the whole year at low and middle latitudes, but preferably during equinox seasons. At equatorial and low latitude regions the most prominent diurnal tides are DE2 and DE3. DE2 is found to be present at low latitude regions throughout the whole year with larger amplitudes in the southern hemisphere, while DE3 shows largest amplitudes (symmetric above the dip equator) at the EIA crest region during September solstice. A general anti-phase behavior between the EIA crest and trough is observed for the tides DE3, DE2, DW2 and SW3. We consider this as strong evidence for the modulation of the EIA electron density by the E-layer zonal electric field via the ion fountain effect. An exception makes the tidal component D0, which exhibits anti-phase variations between the two hemispheres. The phase value at the equatorial trough is half way between those of the two hemispheres. Presently we cannot give an explanation for it, and study concerning special model effort is further needed.",

Hydro-geomorphic processes acting during these early development phases often lead to the emergence of surface structures that constitute the boundary conditions for further ecosystem development, and of linear erosion features that act as pathways for water, solute and sediment transport, and thus can increase the system’s connectivity.\nStudies on initial landform evolution are often limited to relatively small-scale experiments or rely on modeling exercises. Larger-scale experiments can be carried out in constructed hydrological catchments with well-known and documented initial conditions. The central aim of this work was to describe the hydro-geomorphic surface structure evolution during the initial years of ecosystem development, its dependence on initial and boundary conditions; and on its relations to hydro-geomorphic connectivity. The data are from the 6-ha, constructed hydrological catchment ‘Hühnerwasser’.\nHydro-geomorphic development was quantified using a combined analysis of digital elevation models and aerial photographs. Empirical results were compared with those obtained with a numerical landscape evolution model. Phases of rill network growth, contraction and stabilization could be characterized. Results show influences of initial morphology, precipitation characteristics, and developing structure-process-interactions on rill network geometry and connectivity increase in the catchment. The results suggest that phases of hydro-geomorphic surface structure evolution can be related to the spatial organization of surface flow patterns during initial phases of landform development.",

            "abstract": "Partition coefficients of trace elements are very important for the reconstruction of Earth formation and evolution processes. As such processes typically take place at extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, it is still challenging to obtain experimental data. However, recent developments in super-computing facilities and in computational methods have made it possible to obtain supplementing information on melts and element partitioning from ab initio atomistic calculations.\nThe model system used in this pilot study consists of two different melts: a simple Fe-Ni alloy representing the metal and a silicate phase with a varying ratio of Fe and Mg ((Fe,Mg)2SiO4). Traces of Ni or Cr are added to each system. Molecular dynamics simulations based on density functional theory are initially run at 2500 K and ambient pressure, using the CPMD and CP2K software packages. Conditions are chosen so that the results can be compared to available experimental data in order to assess the feasibility of the approach and the quality of its results. However, preliminary results at increased pressure and temperature conditions that are more relevant for core formation will be presented as well.\nThe results of the calculations include information on the melt structure, such as coordination environment, nearest neighbor distance and x-ray diffraction structure factors. The calculations at ambient pressure show that the behavior of Ni atoms in the silicate melt shows similarities to Mg and differs clearly from Fe. First results with a Cr trace show that it resembles Fe rather than Ni.\nFurthermore, thermodynamic integration is able to provide thermodynamic information about the exchange of trace elements between both phases. It is possible to obtain the energy difference connected to this exchange, which can then be used to estimate partition factors. First results on the Ni partitioning will be presented.",

As one of the Essential Climate Variables, land cover observations are used for climate models and several other applications. Remote sensing technologies have enabled the generation of several global land cover (GLC) products that are based on different data sources and methods (e.g. legends). Moreover, the reported map accuracies result from varying validation strategies. Such differences make the comparison of the GLC products challenging and create confusion on selecting suitable datasets for different applications.\nThis study aims to conduct comparative accuracy assessment of GLC datasets (LC-CCI 2005, MODIS 2005, and Globcover 2005) using the Globcover 2005 reference data which can represent the thematic differences of these GLC maps. This GLC reference dataset provides LCCS classifier information for 3 main land cover types for each sample plot. The LCCS classifier information was translated according to the legends of the GLC maps analysed. The preliminary analysis showed some challenges in LCCS classifier translation arising from missing important classifier information, differences in class definition between the legends and absence of class proportion of main land cover types. To overcome these issues, we consolidated the entire reference data (i.e. 3857 samples distributed at global scale). Then the GLC maps and the reference dataset were harmonized into 13 general classes to perform the comparative accuracy assessments.\nTo help users on selecting suitable GLC dataset(s) for their application, we conducted the map accuracy assessments considering different users’ perspectives: climate modelling, bio-diversity assessments, agriculture monitoring, and map producers. This communication will present the method and the results of this study and provide a set of recommendations to the GLC map producers and users with the aim to facilitate the use of GLC maps.",

Whilst the cause is almost certainly related to a greater storage of carbon in the ocean, the mechanism remains unsolved. Radiocarbon derived ventilation ages may shed light on this problem as they help us to determine the distribution of carbon in the ocean as well as the partitioning of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere.\nHere we use paired benthic and planktonic foraminifera radiocarbon ages to reconstruct the apparent ventilation age of intermediate-deep waters in both the Atlantic and the Pacific over the last deglaciation.\nOur data show a ventilation pulse of the entire deep Atlantic at the transition from Heinrich-Stadial1 to the Bølling-Allerød. A hint of this deep ventilation is also seen in the equatorial Pacific. This poses a conundrum for the deglacial carbon-cycle. A ventilation pulse would result in the release of old, radiocarbon depleted CO2 from the deep ocean to the atmosphere yet the pulse seems to occur during a plateau in the deglacial atmospheric CO2 increase and radiocarbon activity decrease.",

Designed to measure the most energetically important range (100 to 2000 cm-1) of Earth’s emitted infrared spectrum, the FIRST instrument was specifically engineered to include the often overlooked far-infrared (100 to 650 cm-1). To date, the FIRST instrument has been deployed on several field missions, both balloon-borne and ground-based, with the most recent deployment occurring at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Table Mountain Facility in California during the months of September and October 2012. This deployment, located 2,285 meters above the Mojave Desert, provided an opportunity to observe down-welling radiances under low water vapor conditions, with some cases having total column water vapor amounts of approximately 2 to 3 millimeters. Such low water vapor conditions allow for stringent testing of both the FIRST instrument and the radiative transfer methods used to analyze these measurements. This study is focused on the analysis of the FIRST measurements in the far-infrared obtained during clear-sky conditions, and requires an accounting of the uncertainties in both the measured and calculated radiances. The former involves the manner in which calibration and full-sky conditions affect the radiances measured by the FIRST instrument. The latter involves not only differences in the model formulations and the uncertainties in the water vapor and temperature data provided by the radio-sonde measurements, but also the critical differences and uncertainties contained within the input line parameter databases. This study specifically explores the significant differences that can arise in the calculated radiances that are associated with the choice of a line parameter database, and how this choice affects the analysis of the FIRST measurements.",

Previously (Yuan et al., 2014), we presented a 3D radially anisotropic shear wave model of North America (NA) lithospheric mantle based on full waveform tomography, combining teleseismic and regional distance data sampling the NA. Regional wavefield computations were performed numerically, using a regional Spectral Element code (RegSEM, Cupillard et al., 2012), while teleseismic computations were performed approximately, using non-linear asymptotic coupling theory (NACT, Li and Romanowicz, 1995). For both datasets, the inversion was performed iteratively, using a Gauss-Newton scheme, with kernels computed using either NACT or the surface wave, path average approximation (PAVA), depending on the source-station distance.\nBuilding upon our previous work, we here present a new radially anisotropic lithospheric/asthenospheric model of shear velocity for North America based entirely on regional waveforms from an augmented dataset of ~150 events contained and observed inside the study region, with forward wavefield computations performed using RegSEM down to 40s, starting from our most recent whole mantle 3D radially anisotropic shear velocity model (SEMUCB-wm1, French and Romanowicz, 2014). Several iterations of inversion are performed using a Gauss-Newton scheme. We present and compare two models obtained, on the one hand, using NACT/PAVA kernels as in our previous work, and on the other, using hybrid kernels, where the Hessian is computed using NACT/PAVA, but the gradient is computed numerically from the adjoint wavefield, providing more accurate kernels while preserving the fast convergence properties of the Gauss-Newton inversion scheme. We also present an update to our azimuthally anisotropic shear velocity model under NA (Yuan and Romanowicz, 2010), obtained starting from the final radial anisotropy model and including a large dataset of station-averaged SKS splitting data over NA.",

The mission involves two satellites in a loosely controlled tandem formation, with a micro-wave link measuring the inter-satellites distance variation. Earth’s mass distribution non-uniformities cause variations of the inter-satellite distance. This variation is measured to recover gravity, after subtracting the non-gravitational contributors, as the residual drag. ONERA (the French Aerospace Lab) is developing, manufacturing and testing electrostatic accelerometers measuring this residual drag applied on the satellites.\nThe accelerometer is composed of two main parts: the Sensor Unit (including the Sensor Unit Mechanics – SUM - and the Front-End Electronic Unit - FEEU) and the Interface Control Unit - ICU. In the Accelerometer Core, located in the Sensor Unit Mechanics, the proof mass is levitated and maintained at the center of an electrode cage by electrostatic forces. Thus, any drag acceleration applied on the satellite involves a variation on the servo-controlled electrostatic suspension of the mass. The voltage on the electrodes providing this electrostatic force is the measurement output of the accelerometer.\nThe impact of the accelerometer defaults (geometry, electronic and parasitic forces) leads to bias, misalignment and scale factor error, non-linearity and noise. Some of these accelerometer defaults are characterized by tests with micro-gravity pendulum bench on ground and with drops in ZARM catapult.\nThe Preliminary Design Review was achieved successfully on November 2013. The Engineering Model (EM) was integrated successfully and is under test, with ground levitation, drops, Electromagnetic Compatibility and thermal vacuum. The complete EM tests will be achieved on October 2014. The Critical Design Review is scheduled at the end of September 2014, and the integration of the first Flight Model will begin on October 2014. The results of the Engineering Model tests and the status of the Flight Models will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Plates move relative to the mantle because some torques are acting on them. The shear in the low-velocity zone (LVZ) at the base of the lithosphere is the expression of these torques. The decoupling is allowed by the low viscosity in the LVZ, which is likely few orders of magnitudes lower than previously estimated. The viscosity value in the LVZ controls the degree of coupling/decoupling between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. Lateral variations in viscosity within the LVZ may explain the velocity gradient among tectonic plates as the one determining the Ethiopian Rift (ER) separating Africa from Somalia. While it remains not fully understood the mechanisms of the torques acting on the lithosphere (thermally driven mantle convection or the combination of mantle convection with astronomical forces such as the Earth's rotation and tidal drag), the stresses are transmitted across the different mechanical layers (e.g., the brittle upper crust, down to the viscous-plastic ductile lower crust and upper mantle). Differential basal shear traction at the base of the lithosphere beneath the two sides of the East African Rift System (EARS) is assumed to drive and sustain rifting. In our analysis, the differential torques acting on the lithospheric/crustal blocks drive kinematics and block rotations. Since, ER involves the whole lithosphere, we do not expect large amount of rotation. Rotation can be the result of the whole plate motion on the sphere moving along the tectonic equator, or the second order sub-rotation of a single plate. Further rotation may occur along oblique plate boundaries (e.g., left lateral transtensional setting at the ER). Small amount of vertical axis rotation of blocks in northern ER could be related to the presence of local, shallower decollement layers. Shallow brittle-ductile transition (BDT) zone and differential tilting of crustal blocks in the northern ER could hint a possibility of detachment surface between the flow in the lower crust relative to the brittle crust above. Our study suggests that kinematics of crustal blocks in the ER is controlled by Africa and Somalia plates interaction at different scale and layers.",

In contrast, many climate scientists believe that increases in CO2 concentration levels do indeed have climate and meteorological consequences but that it is impossible to disentangle these effects from those of other factors. This paper contends that it is possible to assess the effects of CO2 and other greenhouse gases on weather. This paper explores the relationship between the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the dry-bulb temperature using hourly CO2atmospheric concentration and solar irradiance data from the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO) in Hawaii.\nThe starting point of this paper is the recognition that meteorologists do not explicitly take CO2–induced temperature changes into account when making weather forecasts. The analysis makes use of day-ahead hourly weather forecast data to control for expected weather conditions exclusive of CO2 considerations. The analysis employs a two-step procedure. In the first step, the issue of functional form is addressed. Using the results of the first step as a base, an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process is then modeled. The estimation results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hourly CO2 concentration level has implications for temperature. An out-of-sample forecast is then performed using six months of hourly data. Consistent with the existence of a causal relationship, the inclusion of the CO2 level as an explanatory variable improves the accuracy of the forecast. The improved forecast is also more accurate than conventional temperature forecasts for the same location.",

            "abstract": "Vertical distributions of atmospheric gases measured by satellite instruments can be retrieved by mathematical inversion algorithms involving a forward model of the radiative transfer equation. Hence, an accurate forward model to predict atmospheric spectra is necessary for estimating volume mixing ratio quantities of these gases. One particular forward model is the SASKTRAN Inter-Face (or SASKTRANIF), which is a line by line radiative transfer model typically used to model atmospheric spectra arising from limb scattered sunlight at ultraviolet to near infrared wavelengths, using linear ray tracing and a three dimensional spherical shell atmosphere of homogeneous layers. An additional engine has now been implemented, designed to model solar occultation based measurements. Solar rays are traced through each atmospheric layer using an algorithm that accounts for refraction of the atmosphere. The extinction is calculated along the line of sight for a penetrating ray intersecting multiple layers of the atmosphere given a known chemical composition. By default, the engine uses the HITRAN 2008 spectral database to obtain information about the absorption cross sections of each modeled species, and also utilizes user defined climatologies for a priori information (such as input trace gas concentrations, temperature, and pressure). The new engine is currently in a testing phase. Here, we firstly compare synthesized spectra from SASKTRANIF with spectra derived from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) forward model. Secondly, we retrieve vertical volume mixing ratio profiles of various atmospheric gases by performing a global fit to ACE-FTS measured spectra where model parameters are determined using a Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares algorithm. Resulting vertical profiles are compared to those derived using the ACE-FTS retrieval system.",

            "abstract": "Microbial communities commonly live and grow in aggregates called biofilm. This slimy material is composed of exopolymeric substances (EPS) secreted from the microbial cell to the surrounding environment. Certain biofilms show internal microscopic fabrics, as for example, regularly shaped alveolar structures. These microfabrics are often considered as artifacts due to the dehydration steps required for scanning electron microscopy. However, recent studies have demonstrated that some microfabrics are not artifacts but actual structures, whose architecture is controlled by the microorganisms. These findings, mainly achieved for medical purposes, may have yet unconsidered implications for the search of early life on Earth and on Mars. Indeed, evidence exists that the microfabrics can be mineralized during early diagenesis, preserving fossil imprints of the original biofilm throughout the geological record. Here, we present the results of microscopic investigations of ancient sediments of various age, composition and metamorphic degree that contain microfabrics that we interpret as fossil biofilms. We compile a list of criteria that need to be evaluated before excluding that the putative fossil biofilms may be artifacts due to sample preparation or late stage contamination of the studied rocks. Additionally, we compare these microfabrics to those produced by pure cultures of microorganism grown in the laboratory, as well as microfabrics present in microbial mats that develop in modern evaporitic environments. Finally, we discuss the hypothesis – and the evidence that already exists in its support – that the micrometric size and the morphology of the EPS fabrics is specific to the organism and the genome concerned. By establishing a linkage between specific microbes and the architecture of the mineralized microfabrics, it may be possible to gain precise taxonomic information on early life, as well as to establish a new type of morphological biosignature to be searched for in Martian rocks during the forthcoming rover missions.",

Centroid moment tensors for 23 earthquakes with moment magnitudes (Mw) between 3.7 and 6.0 are determined by applying a waveform inversion method. The mainshock is a shallow focus strike-slip with reverse component event at a depth of 30 km. The seismic moment (Mo) of the mainshock is estimated as 1.28 × 1018 Nm and rupture duration of the Fethiye mainshock is 38 s. The focal mechanisms of the aftershocks are mainly strike-slip faulting with a reverse component. The geometry of the focal mechanisms reveals a strike-slip faulting regime with NE-SW trending direction of T-axis in the entire activated region. A stress tensor inversion of focal mechanism data is performed to obtain a more accurate picture of the Fethiye earthquake stress field. The stress tensor inversion results indicate a predominant strike-slip stress regime with a NW-SE oriented maximum horizontal compressive stress (SH). According to variance of the stress tensor inversion, to first order, the Fethiye earthquake area is characterized by a homogeneous interplate stress field. The Coulomb stress change associated with the mainshock and the largest aftershock are also investigated to evaluate any significant enhancement of stresses along the Gulf of Fethiye and surrounding region. Positive lobes with stress more than 0.4 bars are obtained, indicating that these values are large enough to increase the Coulomb stress failure towards NNW-SSE and E-W directions.",

Shortening estimates across the Longmen Shan provide strain accumulation rates and clarify the eastward extrusion of the Tibetan plateau. Here, to explain the interseismic GPS velocities across the greater Longmen Shan region, we develop a boundary element model including earthquake cycle effects, topography, the westward dipping Beichaun fault, and a ~20 km deep, shallowly dipping, detachment. The detachment is inferred from observations of postseismic afterslip following the Wenchuan earthquake and from structural considerations. In contrast to analyses which neglect the detachment and earthquake cycle effects, we find that interseismic GPS data are consistent with a shortening rate of 7±1 mm/yr. These results suggest that the Longmen Shan is an active fold-and-thrust belt with Wenchuan style earthquake recurrence intervals of <500 years.",

            "abstract": "Several lines of geological, petrological and geochemical evidence have supported that the Early Permian Tarim Large Igneous Province (LIP) in the Tarim cratonic block of northwestern China were generated by a mantle plume. However, the over 200,000 km2 Tarim continental flood basalts, as the dominant part of the Tarim LIP, show little geochemical and isotopic features similar to those plume-derived intrusive rocks in this region. This is mainly because that their parental magmas were more or less contaminated by the thick crust during ascending. Modeling by trace element and Nd isotopic compositions further suggest that the three basalt groups (Groups 1a, 1b and 2) in the Tarim LIP have experienced variable degree of crustal contamination (i.e., Group 1b > Group 1a > Group 2). After eliminating the effect of crustal contamination, the widespread Group 1 basalts (including both Groups 1a and 1b) would have relatively uniform εNd(t) values of ca. −1.7. This indicates that they were more likely to be produced by partial melting of some enriched mantle components in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) beneath the Tarim block, probably due to conductive heating that resulted from an incubating mantle plume. The Group 2 basalts, on the other hand, were only found in a small region but display a relatively higher and wider range of εNd(t) values roughly between −1.7 and 0.8 (if without crustal contamination). This may suggest that during the generation of Group 2 basalts, the upwelling mantle plume not only provided an enormous amount of heat, but also continuously injected isotopically depleted plume components into the isotopically enriched magma source region in the SCLM. The source isotopic heterogeneity of three basalt groups and other various Tarim LIP rocks (e.g., picrites, ultramafic–mafic intrusive rocks and syenitic rocks), with their εNd(t) values varying between ca. −5 and 5, may correlate with the plume–lithosphere interaction during the generation of the Tarim LIP.",

            "abstract": "The influence of impacts on the history of terrestrial planets from the point of view of both internal dynamics and surface conditions is investigated in this study. We make use of our previous work on Venus’ long term evolution through a coupled atmosphere/mantle numerical code.\nThe solid part of the planet is simulated by the StagYY code (Armann and Tackley, 2012) and releases volatiles into the atmosphere through degassing. Coupling with the atmosphere is obtained by using surface temperature as a boundary condition.\nThe evolution of surface temperature is calculated from CO2and water concentrations in the atmosphere with a gray radiative-convective atmospheric model. These concentrations vary due to degassing and escape mechanisms. We take into account hydrodynamic escape, which is dominant during the first hundred million years, and non-thermal processes as observed by the ASPERA instrument and modeled in various works.\nImpacts can have different effects: they can (i) bring volatiles to the planet, (ii) erode its atmosphere and (iii) modify mantle dynamics due to the large amount of energy they release. A 2D distribution of the thermal anomaly due to the impact is used leading to melting and subjected to transport by the mantle convection. Volatile evolution is still strongly debated. We therefore test a wide range of impactor parameters (size, velocity, timing) and different assumptions related to impact erosion, from large eroding power to more moderate ones (Shuvalov, 2010).\nAtmospheric erosion appears to have significant effects only for giant impacts and to be mitigated by volatiles brought by the impactor. While small (0-10 km) meteorites have a negligible effect on the global scale, medium ones (50-150 km) are able to bring volatiles to the planet and generate melt, leading to strong short term influence. However, only larger impacts (300+ km) have lasting effects. These can cause volcanic events both immediately after the impact and later on. Additionally, the amount of volatiles released is large enough to modify normal evolution and surface temperatures by tens of Kelvins. This is enough to modify mantle convection patterns. Depending on when such an impact occurs, the surface conditions history can be deeply modified. A key factor is thus the timing of the impact and how it interacts with other processes.",

This provides us with the opportunity to predict the importance of some wave-particle interactions like Landau damping of the daughter ion-acoustic waves for the given pump wave and plasma conditions. We apply the dispersion relation to plasma parameters, typical for low-beta collisionless solar wind close to the Sun. We compare the analytical solutions to the linear stage of hybrid numerical simulations and discuss the application of the model to the problems of preferential heating and differential acceleration of minor ions in the solar corona and the fast solar wind.

Global warming may increase the frequency of extreme ENSO events. Although the Cretaceous plate tectonic configuration was different from today, the sedimentary record suggests that ENSO-type oscillations had existed at the time of Cretaceous greenhouse conditions.\nCored Cretaceous lacustrine sediments from the Songliao Basin in Northeast China (SK-1 cores from the International Continental Drilling Program) potentially offer a partially varved record of Cretaceous paleoclimate. Fourteen polished thin sections from the depth interval 1096.12-1096.53 m with an age of 84.4 Ma were analyzed by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ImageJ software was applied to extract gray scale curves from optical images at pixel resolution. We tracked minimum values of the gray scale curves to estimate the thickness of each lamina.\nFive sedimentary structures were recognized: flaser bedding, wavy bedding, lenticular bedding, horizontal bedding, and massive layers. The mean layer thicknesses with different sedimentary structures range from 116 to 162mm, very close to the mean sedimentation rate estimated for this sampled interval, 135mm/year, indicating that the layers bounded by pure clay lamina with the minimum gray values are varves. SEM images indicate that a varve is composed, in succession, of one lamina rich in coarse silt, one lamina rich in fine silt, one clay-rich lamina with some silt, and one clay-rich lamina. This suggests that a Cretaceous year featured four distinct depositional seasons, two of which were rainy and the others were lacking precipitation. Spectral analysis of extended intervals of the tuned gray scale curve indicates the presence of inter-annual periodicities of 2.2-2.7 yr, 3.5-6.1 year, and 10.1-14.5 year consistent with those of modern ENSO cycles and solar cycles, as well as those recognized in the Cretaceous Arctic and Marca Shale of California.",

            "abstract": "The hypothesis of rip current generation from purely hydrodynamic processes is here investigated through laboratory experiments.\nThe experiments have been performed at the Cantabria Coastal and Ocean Basin (CCOB) with a segmented wavemaker consisting of 64 waveboards. The basin measures 25m in the cross-shore and 32m in the alongshore direction and the water depth at the wavemaker is 1m. A concrete plane sloping (1:5) beach has been built in the opposite side of the wave machine, its toe is 15m from the waveboards. Reflective lateral walls covered the full length of the basin.\nThe set of instruments consists of 33 wave gauges deployed along two longshore and two cross-shore transects, 7 acoustic Doppler velocimeters and 15 run-up wires. Furthermore a set of two cameras has been synchronized with the data acquisition system.\nTwo types of experiments have been performed to specifically study the generation of rip currents under wave group forcing.\nFirst, similarly to the experiments of Fowler and Dalrymple (Proc. 22nd Int. Conf. Coast. Eng.,1990), two intersecting wave trains with opposite directions have been imposed. They give rise to the formation of a non-migrating rip current system with a wavelength that depends on wave frequency and direction.\nSecond, single wave trains with alongshore periodic amplitude attenuation have been imposed. Although the attenuation has been set such that the incident wave field has the same envelope as in the first type of experiments, the rip current system differs due to diffraction and interference processes.\nThe results for different wave conditions (maximum incident wave height from 0.2m to 0.4m, wave period from 1.4s to 2s) will be presented and the intensity of the rip currents will be compared to the alongshore variation in wave set-up.\nThis research is part of the ANIMO project funded by the Spanish Government under contract BIA2012-36822.",

            "abstract": "On 2014 May 24, the Gokceada Island in northern Aegean Sea region was hit by an Mw = 6.9 earthquake. The Gokceada earthquake occurred 43 km SW of Gokceada Island. Centroid moment tensors for 42 events with Mw between 3.5 and 6.9 are computed by applying a waveform inversion method. The time span of data covers the period between 2014 May 24 - June 26. The mainshock is a shallow focus strike-slip event at a depth of 15 km. Focal depths of aftershocks range from 5 to 25 km. The seismic moment (M0) of the mainshock is estimated 2.53 × 1019 Nm. The focal mechanisms of the aftershocks are mainly strike-slip faulting with a variable and sometimes significant normal component. This geometry indicates a strike-slip faulting regime with NE-SW trending direction of T-axis in the entire activated region. A Stress tensor inversion of focal mechanism data is performed to obtain a more accurate picture of the Gokceada earthquake stress field. The stress tensor inversion results show a predominant strike-slip stress regime with a NW-SE to NNE-SSW oriented maximum horizontal compressive stress (SH). The secondary fault system striking mostly E-W is activated generally with normal faulting in the east of the mainshock. This difference in mechanism suggests that towards the east, a different fault system is activated with respect to the NE-SW trending strike-slip faults beneath Gokceada Island and more to the west. Thus, to first order, the Gokceada Island earthquake region is characterized by a homogeneous intraplate stress field.",

            "abstract": "A new range of crustal density values for Mars was calculated from the major element chemistry of Martian meteorites (3100 - 3700 kg/m3), igneous rocks at Gusev crater (3100 - 3600 kg/m3) and from the surface concentration of Fe, Al, Ca, Si, and K measured by the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS) (3250 - 3450 kg/m3) (Baratoux et al., 2014). Whereas a dense basaltic crust would be compatible with the moment of inertia factor of Mars, its thickness would exceed 100 km. Such a thick crust is not compatible with the geoid-to-topography ratios in the highlands, and would be unstable and prone to basal flow and/or crustal delamination. An alternative possibility is the existence of a buried light felsic or anorthositic component. A low-density crustal component in the highlands would be consistent with an isostatic compensation associated with a difference in elevation between the two hemispheres of Mars. This alternative is reinforced in the context of the findings of felsic or anorthositic material from visible/NIR spectroscopy (Carter and Poulet, 2013, Wray et al. 2013), and the identification of feldspar-rich rocks at Gale crater (Sautter et al., 2014), whereas felsic lithologies were already identified by Pathfinder. The recently identified outcrops could be either remnants of an ancient anorthositic crust or the result of local igneous differentiation of plutonic bodies. The latter interpretation is currently preferred as early Mars conditions should not be compatible with the formation of a plagioclase floatation crust (Elkins-Tanton et al., 2005). However, in light of the geophysical and petrological constraints discussed above, and given the absence of abundant light material at the surface, we advocate for the existence of a buried anorthositic crustal component that has been largely buried by volcanic material of basaltic composition in the late Noachian or Hesperian eras. Implications regarding the magma ocean scenario for Mars will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Climatic change is exerting considerable influence on the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles of snow- dominated montane forest ecosystems. Growing season drought stress is a common occurrence after snowmelt-derived soil water content (WC) and stream flow (Q) have declined, leading to an increase in atmospheric water demands (i.e. vapor pressure deficit, VPD). Here, we analyzed a 6-year record (2006–2011) of H2O and CO2 fluxes from the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, a montane forest in the northern Rocky Mountains to examine (1) how growing season evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem production of carbon (NEP), and water use efficiency (WUENEP/ET) respond to changing WC and VPD, (2) how annual NEP is influenced by annual precipitation and growing season length (GSL), and (3) the relationship of stream flow (Q), a catchment-wide indicator of water availability, to NEP and WUENEP/ET. Growing season NEP exhibited a linear relationship with WC and a log-linear relationship with Q, indicative of persistent water limitations when streamflow and soil moisture reach their annual minima late in the growing season. Nevertheless, years with long GSLs had relatively higher NEP, with a small net carbon sink maintained even at low levels of WC and Q, suggesting that trees are able to obtain water from deeper portions of the soil profile (>30 cm) during droughts. However, the warmer, drier climate projected for this region could bring this system closer to a critical threshold of GSL, WC, and VPD, introducing vegetation water stress that could alter the current relationship between GSL and annual NEP.",

            "abstract": "The Chaîne des Puys, central France, is a highly variable monogenetic lineament, with eruption styles that vary from Hawaiian to Subplinian and compositions from alkali basaltic to tachytic. The chain is an excellent natural laboratory to explore the variability of monogenetic volcanoes, and improve eruption scenarios. The eruption of the La Vache and Lassolas cone complex ca. 9 ka cal BP is the most recent large basaltic eruption. It formed two separate large scoria cones, a 14 km long lava flow and a well-defined fall out deposit. The wide distribution (18 km2) and thickness deacay rate of the tephra deposit suggests violent strombolian to subplinian activity. This study aims to determine the processes that produced this widespread deposit by combining detailed tephra studies, including grain size and componentry analysis with textural studies of clast shape, density and permeability. Componentry analysis in the 32 mm-180 µm size range shows that the juvenile fraction comprises mainly very vesicular, ragged juvenile clasts and minor amounts of dense sheet like juvenile clasts and round juvenile clasts. Except for an accidental lithic rich basal layer, lithic clasts are an accessory fraction that contains predominantly clasts from the granitic basement and rarely basaltic clasts from the underlying older lava flows. Both componentry and grain size are invariable within the main proximal section, while the density of juvenile clasts increases slightly with stratigraphic height. However, in the top part of the section the grain size decreases and the componentry changes to containing predominantly round juvenile clasts. This data indicates constant eruption conditions during most of the activity, with slightly decreasing vesiculation, and thus increasing juvenile clast density. This increase may be coherent with changes in the eruption style, documented by changes in grain size and componentry seen at the top of the sequence. This work provides important information on violent monogenetic eruptions and the possible impact of similar activities on populated areas.",

Averages of the first and last quartiles of monthly temperature data display a slightly increasing linear trend over the past seven years of records. These increases are consistent for all probes at each depth. Using the averages of the first and last quartiles of each month’s data minimizes the influence of anomalous temperature extremes throughout the data set.

            "abstract": "From paleoclimate data and GCM models simulations, we learnt that, when ice sheets are unstable, they produce large surges of icebergs that cover North Atlantic and produce global climate instability through atmosphere and ocean dynamics. Indeed, these instabilities are associated with a cold (glacial) context. In a warming world, it appears that the two remaining ice sheets (Antarctica and Greenland) are becoming unstable. The probability of abrupt ice sheet changes is therefore to be investigated. In comparison with predicted AR5 sea level rise (SLR) (28 to 82 cm), such a fast melting could add a contribution of 2 to 5 meters, which corresponds to the sea level rise estimate of glacial instability (Heinrich events). The aim of this presentation is to describe consistent sea level and climate simulations.\nWe define 3 scenarios, the sea level rise is produced by the melting of about third of the Greenland, or the disappearance of West Antarctica, or finally a mixture of both ice sheets melting. We first analyze, using IPSL OAGCM, the climatic impact. Indeed, superimposed to direct sea level rise, climate changes has drastic consequences in North Atlantic (Europe and east of North America) due to the thermohaline circulation breakdown. Moreover, when freshwater is injected into North Atlantic, far field effects on the location and amplitude of Asian Monsoon have been shown with its drastic decrease. The second step of this multidisciplinary study is to quantify the impact of the sea level rise and the climatic changes on populations migration, with a focus on Southern Asia with a prospective migration of several hundreds of people. In a third step, we intend to simulate the reorganization of power supply to adapt to the expected new distribution of population, using a quantitative energy model (COSIME).\nHere, we show the climate response to the 3 investigated climate scenarios and the response in terms of migration, which is huge due to the very large part of the population living in coastal areas.",

Bioenergy crops have been proposed to be able to mitigate the effects of climate change as well as provide increased energy security. The aim of this project is to assess the impact of land conversion to second generation non-food bioenergy crops on GHG balance for several land use transitions, including from arable, grassland and forest.\nA network of 6 sites was established across the UK to assess the processes underpinning GHG balance and to provide input data to a model being used to assess the sustainability of different land use transitions. Monthly analysis of soil GHGs shows that carbon dioxide contributes most to the global warming potential of these bioenergy crops, irrespective of transition. Nitrous oxide emissions were low for all crops except arable cropping and methane emissions were very low for all sites. Nearly all sites have shown a significant decrease in CO2 flux from the control land use.\nEddy flux approaches, coupled with soil assessments show that for the transition from grassland to SRC willow there is a significant reduction in GHG emissions from soil and a negative net ecosystem exchange due to increased GPP and ecosystem respiration. These results suggest for this land use transition to bioenergy in a UK specific context, there may be a net benefit for ecosystem GHG exchange of transition to bioenergy\nFinally we are developing a meta-modelling tool to allow land use managers to make location-specific, informed decisions about land use change to bioenergy.\nThis work is based on the Ecosystem Land Use Modelling & Soil Carbon GHG Flux Trial (ELUM) project, which was commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI).

As an Essential Climate Variables, land cover observations can be used by climate modelling, forest resource and biodiversity assessments and so on. These applications have varying requirements for GLC maps. To date, several global land cover reference (GLCR) datasets have been produced and used for production and validation of specific maps. Despite significant efforts put into generating them, their availability and role in applications outside their intended use have been very limited. We analysed the suitability of GLCR datasets for a range of GLC validation applications. The potential use of GLCR datasets were assessed for main user communities such as the Climate modelling, Global forest change analysts, the GEO community of practice for agricultural monitoring and GLC map producers. We assessed 12 GLCR datasets using sets of criteria reflecting the main user requirements on the sampling, thematic and spatio-temporal detail, and quality. The analysis revealed the dataset suitability is highly dependent on specific applications by the user communities. The LC-CCI, GOFC-GOLD, FAO-FRA and Geo-Wiki datasets had the broadest applicability for multiple uses. Furthermore, we present the reference data portal from the GOFC-GOLD Land-Cover Project Office. This portal, currently under development, not only aims to make available GLCR datasets freely accessible but it will also guide the user to the most suitable dataset based on their specific needs.

Mean wave period in the tropical Pacific also shows downward trends exceeding -0.4 s per decade during this period. These changes in wave climate in the North Pacific and tropical Pacific are found to be attributable to recent changes in tropical Pacific climate. The downward trends in significant wave height in the mid-latitude North Pacific are found to be due to frequent occurrence of the negative phase of the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. The downward trend in the mean wave period in the tropical Pacific is found to result from an increased (decreased) occurrence frequency of wind wave (swell) which is caused by strengthened near-surface easterly winds in the equatorial Pacific.",

The borehole YD0903 (30°53′54.3″N, 122°54′33.0″E) was collected in a water depth of 36 m, with the top 22-m layer composed of massive muds. They were deposited about 8000 cal yr BP in an offshore to prodelta setting. Paleoflood reconstruction using XRF scanning elemental Zr/Rb ratios shows four mega-stages of extreme flood activities: (1) a highly active stage from 8000 to 5800 cal. yr B.P. with 5 extreme flood periods (7900~7600, 7440~7210, 6780~6590, 6430~6240, 6100~5840 cal yr BP); (2) a quiescent stage form 5800 to 3900 cal yr BP with 2 extreme flood periods (4900~4640, 4380~4240 cal yr BP); (3) a relatively quiescent stage from 3900 to 2000 cal yr BP with 3 extreme flood periods (3900~3700, 3460~3240, 3000~2800 cal yr BP) featuring extraordinarily large flood events; (4) a relatively active stage since 2000 cal yr BP with relatively weak flood events. Long-term variation in flood events is considered to be linked to the damping strength of the East Asian Summer Monsoon. Shorter-term periodicities of flood events in the Yangtze catchment are potentially related to solar variations over ~200 yr and ~100 yr periods, and to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation with a period of ~40 yr.",

One of the fundamental aspects of understanding this coupling is the study of ionospheric O+ flows into the magnetosphere.

The mechanisms that control O+ ion outflows are the major topic that will be discussed in this talk.",

            "abstract": "The Rif cordillera forms, together with the Betic ranges, one of the tightest orogenic arcs on Earth. This continental boundary zone is dominated now by the slow convergence between Nubia and Eurasia, but with clear evidences of extensional tectonics. One of the missing elements to constrain the complex geodynamics of the Gibraltar Arc System is the knowledge on crustal structure beneath northern Morocco. In the last decade a major effort has been done in this sense, from active and passive seismics. We compile here the recent results available from the Rif domains. Two 330 km long wide angle DSS profiles were recorded end of 2011 across the Rif in NS and EW transects within the Rifsis project, complemented by onshore recordings of the Gassis-WestMed marine profiles. At the same period, BB seismic arrays were deployed in the area within Topo-Iberia and Picasso projects, allowing receiver function analyses of crustal depths. The ray-tracing modeling of the Rifsis profiles reveal a large Moho step and an area of crustal thickening both in EW and NS directions, grossly coincident with the Bouguer gravity anomalies. The deployment logistics allowed that all the stations recorded all the shots, thus providing useful offline data. We will use here all available in-line and offline data to provide a map of the crustal thickness in northern Morocco. We combined two approaches: i) a hyperbolic time reduction applied to the seismic data, resulting in low-fold stacks in which the reflections from the Moho should appear as subhorizontal lines; ii) the arrival times of the observed PmP phases allow, assuming a mean crustal velocity, to assign a midpoint crustal thickness to each lecture. Although some uncertainties may be inherent to those approaches, a large crustal root, reaching more than 50 km, is well documented in the central part of the Rif Cordillera, close to the zone where the Alboran slab may still be attached to the lithosphere. We also compared these results with those from receiver functions recalculated for the Topo-Iberia and Picasso stations, as well as for a new seismic BB array installed in late 2013 to densify the available dataset. The derived crustal depths confirm a deep crustal root beneath the central Rif and a rapid thinning eastward of Nekkor fault, even if some observed differences deserve further analyses.",

            "abstract": "Higher surface air temperatures over the Antarctic Peninsula are hypothesised to have caused melt-pond formation, destabilisation and sudden disintegration of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002. The almost total removal of the shelf resulted in an acceleration of the extant glacier fronts, upstream thinning and unabated ice loss up to this day. Similar thinning is observed for Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers in the Amundsen Sea sector, but here, ocean warming is suspected for enhancing the shelf melting. In both cases, shelf geometries were altered in a way that upstream buttressing was reduced, an explanation for the observed accelerations. Since more than half of all Antarctic glaciers extend into floating shelves and since most of them showed no significant accelerations in the recent past, it remains unclear how susceptible the upstream ice sheet is to geometric changes of the corresponding shelves under further warming in the future.\nIn this context, we aim at quantifying the dynamic susceptibility using ice geometry and surface velocities inferred from observations. To obtain the stress distribution near the grounding line, the shelf viscosity field is determined using a variational inverse method that optimises the mismatch between observed and modelled surface velocities. This allows us to compute a buttressing factor along the grounding line. Using this factor as one criterion, we succeed to a priori discern the segments of the grounding line in the Amundsen Sea sector that, in fact, retreated by now. An abrupt drop-off in buttressing across the main trunk of Thwaites Glacier can explain its asymmetric retreat pattern. Moreover, other regions in this sector are recognised as susceptible to further loss of shelf buttressing, where, for now, perturbations remain too weak for a distinct migration of the grounding line. With the chosen criteria, we are able to localise the regions that are prone to changes in the downstream shelves. This identification enables us to classify each Antarctic glacier and ice stream according to the retreat susceptibility.",

            "abstract": "More than 90% of organic material on Earth resides in sedimentary rocks in the form of kerogens; fossilized organic matter formed through selective preservation of high molecular weight biopolymers under anoxic conditions. Despite its prevalence in the subsurface, the extent to which this material supports microbial metabolisms is unknown. Whilst aerobic microorganisms are known to derive energy from kerogens within shales, utilization in anaerobic microbial metabolisms that proliferate in the terrestrial subsurface, such as microbial iron reduction, has yet to be demonstrated.\nData are presented from microbial growth experiments in which kerogens and shales were supplied as the sole electron donor source for microbial iron reduction by an enrichment culture. Four well-characterized kerogens samples (representative of Types I-IV, classified by starting material), and two shale samples, were assessed. Organic analysis was carried out to investigate major compound classes present in each starting material. Parallel experiments were conducted to test inhibition of microbial iron reduction in the presence of each material when the culture was supplied with a full redox couple.\nThe results demonstrate that iron-reducing microorganisms in this culture were unable to use kerogens and shales as a source of electron donors for energy acquisition, despite the presence of compound classes known to support this metabolism. Furthermore, the presence of these materials was found to inhibit microbial iron reduction to varying degrees, with some samples leading to complete inhibition. These results suggest that recalcitrant carbonaceous material in the terrestrial subsurface is not available for microbial iron reduction and similar metabolisms, such as sulphate-reduction.\nFurther research is needed to investigate the inhibition exerted by these materials, and to assess whether these findings apply to other microbial consortia. These results may have significant implications for the role of anaerobic microbial metabolisms in the subsurface terrestrial carbon cycle. Kerogens are chemically similar to organic material in carbonaceous chondrites. As such, further study may provide insight into the potential availability of organic compounds for microbial metabolisms operating in the subsurface of Mars.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost history of the last ~1.35 millions of years (Ma) was reconstructed using chronology of speleothems from a Siberian cave. Rain and snowmelt waters can penetrate into caves only when soil and subsoil temperatures are above 0°C and permafrost above the cave is discontinuous or absent. Speleothems in regions currently affected by permafrost therefore provide a tracer of past permafrost thawing events.\nLedyanaya Lenskaya Cave is located at 60°22’N-116°57’E, on the southern boundary of modern continuous permafrost, with no present-day water seepage and a mean annual temperature of -5°C ‒ -6°C. U-Th dating of speleothems from this cave in a previous study [1] showed that the youngest speleothem growth period occurred at 427±23 thousand years ago (ka), during early Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11. In this study we dated several horizons of older speleothems from this cave using the U-Pb method [2]. Two high precision ages indicate growth at 1074.2 +6.6/-5.2 ka and 947.8 +3.3/-3.4 ka, while new preliminary data provide strong evidence of an older growth period around 1.35-1.30 Ma. Other preliminary data mostly overlap the high precision ages, but also hint at limited growth at ~860 ka, with one data point suggesting younger, but minor growth at ~560 ka. The timing of these permafrost thawing events apparently correlates with interglacial episodes of exceptionally high Pacific Warm Pool sea surface temperature (~30°C) [3]. During these warm episodes the average global temperature was 1.1-1.5°C higher than pre-industrial temperatures. These findings put the threshold of thawing of continuous permafrost at its southern boundary at slightly more than 1.0°C above preindustrial level.\n",

In our efforts to address the big data challenges of climate science, we are moving toward a notion of Climate Analytics-as-a-Service (CAaaS). We focus on analytics, because it is the knowledge gained from our interactions with big data that ultimately product societal benefits. We focus on CAaaS because we believe it provides a useful way of thinking about the problem: a specialization of the concept of business process-as-a-service, which is an evolving extension of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS enabled by cloud computing. Within this framework, cloud computing plays an important role; however, we see it as only one element in a constellation of capabilities that are essential to delivering climate analytics-as-a-service. These elements are essential because in the aggregate they lead to generativity, a capacity for self-assembly that we feel is the key to solving many of the big data challenges in this domain. This poster will highlight specific examples of CAaaS using climate reanalysis data, high-performance cloud computing, map reduce, and the Climate Data Services API.",

The observed tidal variability in the ionosphere and thermosphere is quantitatively connected to ENSO and QBO induced tidal variability in the lower thermosphere and further down to tidal forcing variability derived from MERRA and TRMM satellite data. The results suggest that the TEC tidal response is particularly large during the La Niña phase with up to 50% enhancement depending on the tidal component. As such, global weather phenomena like ENSO substantially modulate the local time and longitudinal structure of the low-latitude ionosphere and the thermospheric energy budget.",

            "abstract": "Carbon decomposition dynamics have been studied in a variety of ecosystems and its variation can mostly be explained in terms of environmental variables (e.g. temperature and precipitation). However, carbon dynamics in arid, water limited regions have shown to be very different and are still largely unknown. Several studies have indicated the importance of photodegradation, the direct breakdown of organic matter by sunlight, in these arid regions. A FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer) was set up to continuously measure concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O, CO as well as del13C in CO2. The FTIR was connected to 2 different flux measurement systems: a Flux Gradient system and 2 flux chambers, providing a continuous data set of gas concentrations and biosphere-atmosphere gas fluxes at different heights and scales. Field measurements showed photodegradation induced carbon fluxes. Also, respiratory del13CO2 was determined by use of Keeling plots, and was determined to vary between -25‰ and -21‰. A clear diurnal pattern in respiratory del13CO2 was found, suggesting either different (dominant) respiratory processes between day and night or the effect of diffusive fractionation.",

            "abstract": "The on-going continent-continent collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates since ~55 Ma has created the spectacular topography of the Tibetan plateau. However, many first order questions remain to be answered as to the mechanisms behind this young orogenic process. Under the auspices of the SinoProbe Project, a three dimensional (3-D) Magnetotelluric (MT) array have been deployed on the Tibetan Plateau from 2010 to 2013 to better understand this orogeny. By the end of 2013, 1099 MT stations have been completed, including 102 combined broadband MT (BBMT) and long period MT (LMT) stations. In this study, MT data of these 102 combined stations have been used to investigate the deep lithospheric electrical structure of the Tibetan Plateau. MT impedances within the period range of 10 – 50000 s were extracted to be used for 3-D inversions with the ModEM code using the standard NLCG algorithm. The resulting lithospheric electrical structure of the Tibetan Plateau shows a distinct pattern of strong variation not only vertically, but also horizontally. Conductors are found to be widespread in the middle to lower crust. But their geometries are quite complex, and not obviously consistent with the hypothesis of continuous eastward channel flow. Instead, most crustal conductors in central and southern Tibet display a pattern of N-S extension. In the depth range of the upper mantle, two more conductive regions can be identified in the southern Qiangtang Terrane and in the central Lhasa Terrane. As a next step in this study we will include more of the BBMT data in the 3-D inversion to explore the crustal electrical structure in greater detail. Further efforts will also focus on testing the reliability of deep structures, especially deep conductors, via forward modeling and constrained inversion.\n*This work was jointly supported by the grants from Project SinoProbe-01-01, SinoProbe-01-02, and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2652014016).",

            "abstract": "Several small ice caps have been identified outside of the margins of the last (late Devensian) British ice sheet, but few sites in the uplands of southwest England show evidence for late Devensian niche/cirque glaciers and/or perennial snowbanks. Here we present evidence for the southernmost site yet discovered, in west Penwith, Cornwall. Here, a NE-facing hollow developed on granite bedrock is surrounded by tors with deep bedrock fractures and displaced angular blocks. Bedrock is exposed at the base of the hollow but sediments form a subdued ridge, interpreted as a terminal moraine, at the front of the hollow. The sediments comprise gravelly diamicton containing facetted clasts that are occasionally striated, interbedded with sand lenses. Sediments are deformed by periglacial involutions. We used a 2-D glacier energy balance and iceflow model (Plummer and Phillips, 2003, Quat Sci Rev) to discover if the climatic conditions during the late Devensian could have sustained a cirque glacier at this site. Met Office regional climate data (1981-2010) were used to define mean monthly air temperatures, lapse rate, precipitation, cloudiness and relative humidity, and surface energy fluxes were calculated based on solar position during the present day and last glacial maximum (LGM). We ran a range of different glacier model simulations to test an envelope of late Devensian paleoclimate conditions inferred from other climate proxies. Model results suggest that a cirque glacier could have formed at this site under conditions equivalent to a change in temperature from present-day values of –8.5°C accompanied by a 20% decrease in precipitation, which is consistent with the regional LGM. Response times for these simulations are greater than 500 years, indicating that it is unlikely that such cirque glaciers maintained steady state and were instead short-lived features.",

            "abstract": "Inner core convection, and the corresponding variations in grain size and alignment, has been proposed to explain the complex seismic structure of the inner core, including its anisotropy, lateral variations and the F-layer at the base of the outer core. We develop a parameterised convection model to investigate the possibility of convection in the inner core, focusing on the dominance of the plume mode of convection versus the translation mode. We investigate thermal and compositional convection separately so as to study the end-members of the system. In the thermal case the dominant mode of convection is strongly dependent on the viscosity of the inner core, the magnitude of which is poorly constrained. Furthermore recent estimates of a large core thermal conductivity result in stable thermal stratification, hindering convection. However, an unstable density stratification may arise due to the pressure dependant partition coefficient of certain light elements. We show that this unstable stratification leads to compositionally driven convection, and that inner core translation is likely to be the dominant convective mode due to the low compositional diffusivity. The style of convection resulting from a combination of both thermal and compositional effects is not easy to understand. The stabilising thermal buoyancy is greater than the destabilising compositional buoyancy, however we anticipate complex double diffusive processes to occur given the very different thermal and compositional diffusivities and more work is needed to understand these processes.",

Underwater earthquakes are one of the dominant sources of hydro-acoustic waves in the oceans. However, atmospheric low frequency sound, i.e., infrasound, from underwater events has not been considered thus far, due to the high impedance contrast of the water-air interface making it almost fully reflective. Here, we report for the first time on atmospheric infrasound from a large underwater earthquake (Mw 8.1). Seismic waves coupled to hydro-acoustic waves at the ocean floor, after which the energy entered the SOund Fixing And Ranging (SOFAR) channel. The energy was diffracted by a sea mount and an oceanic ridge, which acted as a secondary source, into the water column followed by coupling into the atmosphere. The latter results from evanescent wave coupling and the attendant anomalous transparency of the sea surface for very low frequent acoustic waves. Current research focuses on the contribution of underwater sources to ambient atmospheric noise field of infrasonic waves. Such infrasonic energy is expected to be partly absorbed in the upper atmosphere, i.e., mesosphere and thermosphere.",

Measurements were made in the Amazonian (Rondônia and Amazonas) region during September 2012, a period of extensive biomass burning. Data was obtained between 100m and 8500m from the FAAM BAe 146 research aircraft. Isoprene was observed to be constrained overwhelmingly to the boundary layer (height typically ~2500m) with mean boundary layer mixing ratio of ~2 ppbv and a peak of ~5 ppbv at the lowest flight levels of 100 m. First generation isoprene oxidation products, methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein, were quantified individually rather than as the sum of the pair, which is more commonly found in the literature. Both MACR and MVK were constrained primarily to the boundary layer, however trace quantities could be seen in the free troposphere to a height of 8000 m. Benzene from biomass burning was observed in both boundary layer and free troposphere, with a peak mixing ratio of ~0.8 ppbv at 750 m. This work will present the spatial distribution of isoprene within the boundary as a function of underlying surface type. The vertical profiles of all species are then compared to representative simulations from the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model and conclusions drawn on the success of the model in representing emissions and oxidation chemistry.",

            "abstract": "Currently 69% of Maryland’s shoreline is eroding and 12% is hardened with increasing rates of hardening occurring as development progresses. Shoreline erosion rates are likely to increase, and community needs for shoreline protection are likely to become more important as rates of sea-level rise increase with climate change, constituting a serious coastal hazard. However, the effects of different shoreline stabilization structures on erosion and nearshore water quality and habitat are complex. A variety of stabilization techniques are used in the Maryland Chesapeake Bay, and while the qualitative effects of the different techniques are generally known, there is little quantitative, long-term information available. This study has developed a comprehensive data set comparing long-term impacts of different shoreline stabilization techniques on both the physical environment and habitat. These data include shoreline and bathymetric surveys for comparison to pre-installation information, comparison of pre- and post-construction submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage, field surveys of SAV and marshes, and collection of cores to determine changes in sediment characteristics and accumulation rates. We have also assembled available estimates of wave and tides near each site to construct wave-sea level climatologies for use in a semi-empirical model of erosion potential. Statistical tests are used to explore relationships among variables. Preliminary results suggest that sediment characteristics depend on the source of material – shoreline type and estuarine salinity zone (proxy for fine sediment availability) – whereas sedimentation rate depends on structure geometry and the pre-construction sedimentation, which generally reflects physical processes controlling sediment transport. Also, sediment type, rather than structure type, seems to influence SAV (plants need sand).",

            "abstract": "Nowadays the Arctic Ocean is an area of higher scientific interest. Investigation of composition, genesis, sources and source areas of marine sediments is necessary for a gain of geological knowledge and geo-engineering development of the region. One should note that the dating issue in the Arctic Ocean is a challenge by itself. However, magnetostratigraphy can offer a powerful stratigraphic tool applying to marine sediments here.\nThe 6-meters length core was retrieved from the Mendeleev Ridge in 2012 and subjected to paleomagnetic studies. The examined core was revealed to dominate by normal polarity up to 123 cm below seafloor (cmbsf) and assigned there to the Brunhes polarity chron of the geomagnetic field (0.78 Ma). Then prevalence of reverse polarity persists up to 394-397 cmbsf, assigned to Matuyama age, and short positive intervals are believed to be subchrons of normal polarity. Change from reverse to normal polarity at 394-397 cmbsf is considered as the Matuyama – Gauss (2.58 Ma) boundary and is traced up to 530-531 cmbsf including one short reversal. After this depth a drop back to reverse polarity is ascribed to the beginning of the Gilbert polarity chron (3.58 Ma). The resultant magnetostratigraphy is presented on Figure 1.\nThe stepwise alternating field demagnetization and demagnetization by heating were performed to remove viscous overprints and then to define component magnetization directions. Spikes of natural remanent magnetization intensity and magnetic susceptibility are discovered near almost all assigned chron boundaries, and it may act as an independent factor for determination of polarity boundaries. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility is also considered in order to find out additional peculiarities of the sedimentation. The relative abundance of shallow inclinations at least implies the existence of secondary processes, which may have altered the paleomagnetic record.\nThe mean sedimentation rates on the Mendeleev Ridge do not exceed 1.58 mm kyr-1 for 3.58 Ma and therefore represent the sedimentation rates as low for the whole Quaternary period and also for the part of the Pliocene epoch.",

Although it is unclear how to increase SOCR via land management, it is a relatively stable carbon (C) pool that is important for terrestrial C sequestration. SOC concentration declines with soil depth on upland soils without a spodic horizon; however, the portion that is SOCR and the residence time of this fraction on LLP stands is unknown. Soils were collected by depth at five sites with common land use history, present use for active military training and a three-year prescribed fire return cycle. Soils were treated with H2O2 and dilute HNO3 to isolate SOCR. In the upper 1-m of soil SOC stocks averaged 72.1 ± 6.6 Mg C ha-1 and SOCR averaged 25.8 ± 3.2 Mg C ha-1. Depending on the site, the ratio of SOCR:SOC ranged from 0.25 to 0.50 in the upper 1-m of soil. On clayey soils the ratio of SOCR:SOC increased with soil depth. One site containing 33% clay at 50 to 100 cm depth had a SOCR:SOC ratio of 0.68. The radiocarbon age of SOCR increased with soil depth, ranging from approximately 2,000 years before present (YBP) at 0 to 10 cm to over 5,500 YBP at 50 to 100 cm depth. Across all sites, SOCR makes up a considerable portion of SOC. What isn’t clear is the proportion of SOCR that is of pyrogenic origin (black carbon), versus SOCR that is stabilized by association with the mineral phase. Ongoing analysis with 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will provide data on the degree of aromaticity of the SOCR and some indication of the nature of its biochemical stability.",

            "abstract": "Despite a sustained production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, the Earth’s mean near-surface temperature paused its rise from 2000 onward. To explain such a pause, an increase in ocean heat uptake below the superficial ocean layer has been hypothesized to overcompensate for the Earth’s heat storage. Contributions have also been suggested from the deep prolonged solar minimum, the stratospheric water vapor, the stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols. This presentation will illustrate how successful retrospective climate predictions of this warming slowdown up to 5 years ahead can be exploited to attribute this slowdown through sensitivity experiments and heat budget analysis.",

            "abstract": "Environmental and societal issues are often inherently linked, especially in coastal and estuarine environments, and science and social values must often be balanced in ecosystem management and decision-making. A new seminar course has been developed for the Marine Estuarine and Environmental Science (MEES) graduate program, an inter-institutional program within the University System of Maryland, to examine these issues. This 1-credit course, offered for the first time in Spring 2015, takes a complex systems perspective on major environmental and societal challenges to examine these linked issues in a variety of contexts. After a brief introduction to the emerging field of “geoethics,” students develop a list of issues to examine throughout the seminar. Example topics could include fracking, offshore wind technology, dam removal, and iron fertilization, among others. A case-study approach is taken, with each class meeting focusing on one issue. For each case study, students are asked to 1) identify relevant scientific principles and major knowledge gaps, 2) predict potential outcomes, 3) identify stakeholders and likely viewpoints, and 4) construct communication plans to disseminate findings to these stakeholders. At the end of the semester, students give a brief presentation of the ethical aspects of their own research topics.",

            "abstract": "Recent droughts and the continuing water wars between the states of Georgia, Alabama and Florida have made agricultural producers more aware of the importance of managing their irrigation systems more efficiently. Many southeastern states are beginning to consider laws that will require monitoring and regulation of water used for irrigation. Recently, Georgia suspended issuing irrigation permits in some areas of the southwestern portion of the state to try and limit the amount of water being used in irrigation. However, even in southern Georgia, which receives on average between 23 and 33 inches of rain during the growing season, irrigation can significantly impact crop yields. In fact, studies have shown that when fields do not receive rainfall at the most critical stages in the life of cotton, yield for irrigated fields can be up to twice as much as fields for non-irrigated cotton.\nThis leads to the motivation for this study, which is to produce a forecast tool that will enable producers to make more efficient irrigation management decisions. We will use the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) vars EPS (Ensemble Prediction System) model precipitation forecasts for the grid points included in the 1◦ x 1◦ lat/lon square surrounding the point of interest. We will then apply q-to-q bias corrections to the forecasts. Once we have applied the bias corrections, we will use the check-book method of irrigation scheduling to determine the probability of receiving the required amount of rainfall for each week of the growing season. These forecasts will be used during a field trial conducted at the CM Stripling Irrigation Research Park in Camilla, Georgia. This research will compare differences in yield and water use among the standard checkbook method of irrigation, which uses no precipitation forecast knowledge, the weather.com forecast, a dry land plot, and the ensemble-based forecasts mentioned above.",

            "abstract": "From a few years now, there is a growing body of evidence that photoinduced processes could be of great importance for the tropospheric chemistry. Here, we would like to present two additional outcomes of this new area of research, firstly the photosensitized direct VOC uptake by aerosols and, secondly, the photoinduced chemical formation of unsaturated VOC from marine microlayer proxy.\nIt was recently shown that the chemistry of glyoxal toward ammonium ions into droplets and wet aerosols leads to the formation of light-absorbing compounds. Among them, we found that imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (IC) acts as a photosensitizer and is able to initiate the growth of organic aerosols via the uptake of VOC, such as limonene. Given its potential importance, the mechanism of this photoinduced uptake was investigated thanks to aerosol flow tube experiments and UPLC-ESI-HRMS analysis. Results reveal hydrogen abstraction on the VOC molecule by the triplet state of IC leading to the VOC oxidation without any traditional oxidant.\nAs well as aerosol, the sea-surface microlayer, known to be enriched in light-absorbing organics, is largely impacted by photochemical processes. Recent studies have pointed out for example the role of photosentitized processes in the loss of NO2 and ozone at water surfaces containing photoactive compounds such as chlorophyll. In order to go further, we worked from sea-surface microlayer proxy containing humic acids as photoactive material and organic acids as surfactants. Beside oxidation processes, we monitored by high resolution PTR-MS the release in the gas phase of unsaturated compounds, including C5 dienes (isoprene ?). A strong correlation between the measured surface tension and the C5 diene concentration in the gas phase was evidenced, clearly pointing toward an interfacial process.\nThis contribution will highlight the similarities between both systems and will attempt to present a general chemical scheme for photosensitized chemistry at interfaces.",

The NoMelt experiment was conducted in 2012 on ~70-m.y.-old lithosphere, in the center of the spreading segment between the Clarion and Clipperton fracture zones, with the goal of delineating the detailed seismic and electrical structure of “normal,” mature oceanic lithosphere. The seismic component of the experiment consisted of a 600x400 km array of 27 broad-band (BB) ocean bottom seismometers (OBS); 31 short period (SP) OBS, spaced at 20 km, deployed along the long axis of the array (the main transect), oriented along a plate-kinematic flow line; and 3 SP OBS deployed along a line normal to the main transect, at 50 km spacing, extending to 200 km southeast of the center of the main transect. The SP OBS array was deployed to record airgun shots fired by the R/V M.G. Langseth’s 36-element array. Airgun shots were fired along the two perpendicular lines and also along a semi-circular arc with a 75-km radius centered at the line intersection at the center of the main transect. Pn (upper mantle refraction) arrivals from shots fired along the semicircle and recorded by OBS within the semicircle’s arc span 180 degrees of azimuth and an offset range of ~40-150 km. Preliminary analyses of these Pn arrival travel times indicate an azimuthal dependence of P-wave speeds, which range from ~8.6 km/s to ~7.6 km/s. These preliminary results suggest a pattern of azimuthal wave-speed dependence that requires depth-dependent seismic anisotropy and/or a dipping mantle fabric, with the latter being more likely given the limited range of source/receiver offsets spanned by the Pn arrivals used in this analysis. We will present results that include these observations as well as Pn arrivals from a much more comprehensive set of source/receiver pairs from the NoMelt experiment.",

This transformation has important implications for water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles—a topic that has been explored extensively, as reflected in the ecohydrological literature. The changes related to WPE have important societal implications as well. It is clear that human actions are strongly linked with both the causes and the consequences of WPE. At the same time, WPE has proved intractable in the face of attempts to slow or abate the phenomenon. Increasingly, it is being recognized that such complex environmental problems must be treated as social–ecological  systems, that is, coupled human and natural systems. In this presentation, I will discuss recent progress in understanding WPE as a social–ecohydrological system and explore potentially promising approaches that merge insights from multiple disciplines—including hydrology, ecology, remote sensing, economics, and social sciences—as a basis for agent-based models that can improve our understanding of this complex phenomenon.",

            "abstract": "Climate change is an “all-hands-on-deck” challenge: it will affect everyone, everyone can find something to offer, and we will need people from all walks of life to face it adequately. Thus a curriculum on this problem needs to be thoroughly multidisciplinary: not just for students in the Earth, natural, and social sciences, though of course they are important, but for all interested students. It should create well-informed generalists who grasp the overall picture and the range of available expertise and can ask intelligently for help from specialists. This presentation will offer some relevant lessons learned through the work of Changing Climates @ Colorado State, a multidisciplinary climate change education and outreach initiative.\nA climate change curriculum needs at least one truly multidisciplinary course, and such a course needs many instructors, most practically in the form of visiting speakers, who need to be well coached in advance. It needs a curious and flexible supervising instructor and readings that students can actually understand—and that will engage their minds, imaginations, even feelings. These readings need to cover the globe but should probably focus on North America, since local information is the most effective, and their writers need to be diverse in gender, race, and ethnicity. Speakers and readings need to provide both a realistic picture and authentic grounds for optimism; to leave students feeling not hopeless but energized, they must offer a wide choice of actions personal to professional, daily to lifelong.\nThroughout such a course and curriculum, simplification and translation are critical. Because disciplines differ in their questions, their language, the evidence they consider, their methods, and the conclusions they value, experts do not readily understand each other. Very often, a discipline’s most basic elements are the most important to communicate: how greenhouse gases operate and why scientists know we have a climate problem; what is meant by “discounting the future” or “fixing” carbon or “fairness” or “vulnerability” or “cultural work”; how we are very often moved by values and emotions rather than pure reason.",

The Nepal Himalayas is fairly well distributed with denser network and earthquakes. Some 10864 P- and 5293 S-arrival times from 821 selected events Mw > 4.0 recorded during 2004-2014 are used for this study; on average, almost 20 phases per event have been available. The tomographic results shed a new light on crustal thickness variation along and across the Nepal Himalayas. The crustal thickness varies between 40 and 80 km from foothills to high Himalayas, which is verified by synthetic modeling. The crustal thickness also widely varies along the strike of the Himalayas. The zones of higher and lower crustal thicknesses may be correlated with some hidden transverse structures in the foothills region, which are well reflected in gravity and magnetic maps. The estimated crustal thickness matches fairly well with the free air gravity anomaly; thinner crust corresponds to lower gravity anomaly and vice versa. Some correlation with the magnetic field anomaly is also observed. Higher magnetic anomaly corresponds to thicker crust. We propose that the more rigid segments of incoming Indian crust comprising of igneous and metamorphic rocks cause more compression in the Himalayan thrust zone and leads to stronger crustal thickening. Under thrusting of weaker crust / sediments, on the other hand, is associated with less shortening, and thus cause the thinner crust in the collision zone.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice plays an important role on the Earth’s climate system by controlling fluxes of heat and moisture across the ocean-atmosphere interface and changes in the Earth’s albedo, as well as oceanic circulation processes (e.g. the thermohaline circulation). Thus, reconstruction of Arctic sea ice is necessary to understand past sea ice variability and help improve the accuracy of model-based estimates of future changes in climate. Recently, the presence of the sea ice diatom biomarker IP25in Arctic marine sediments has been used as a proxy for past spring sea ice occurrence and as an indicator of wider palaeoenvironmental conditions for different regions of the Arctic over various timescales (e.g. Belt and Müller, 2013).\nHere, we present and compare new and existing biomarker data from different sediment cores along a S-N transect on the Norwegian – Svalvard continental margin from ca. 69 ºN to 78.5 ºN, northern North Atlantic. The presence and abundances of the sea ice biomarker IP25, a related HBI Diene and various sterols (e.g. brassicasterol, 24-methylenecholesterol) were used to infer past variations of sea ice/open-water conditions in the study area during the last 14 kyr BP. In addition, a comparison with other commonly used proxies for reconstructing different palaeoenvironmental conditions (e.g. planktic and benthic foraminiferal fauna, SST, IRD) was used to enable a more comprehensive reconstruction of climatic variations.\n",

            "abstract": "As a glacier retreats, land surface beneath the glacier is newly exposed, and changes in soil have initiated as well as microbial and plants species. Numerous studies have been done on soil development along the chronosequence in the glacier moraine, and mostly undisturbed areas were selected as sampling sites to represent soil age well. However, the surface of glacier moraine is remodeled by active flows, and terrain attributes are very diverse, thus soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation is not always a linear function of soil age in the glacier moraine. Therefore, we examined the distribution of SOC in the Midtre Lovénbreen morain with a consideration of soil age, microtopography, and runoff activity in this study. Forty two soil sampling sites were selected among previously observed 300 points of plant species via the systematic random sampling method with a consideration of soil age, runoff activities, slope, aspect, and X, Y coordinates. Three close to the glacier terminus and nine sites outside of moraine were additionally sampled. Four different depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) of soil were collected, and soil volume was measured by the excavation method in summer 2014. Currently, we are in a status of acquiring microtopographic information from digital elevation model, calculating bulk density, and preparing soil samples for SOC analysis. Once we gather all data, corresponding analysis and classification will be conducted to characterize sampling sites. Then, SOC distribution over the glacier moraine using microtopographic information will be estimated through modelling.",

Modern software and computing power allow us to produce accurate data sets from low cost surveys, thus improving the observational capabilities on a wider range of glaciers and glacial processes. In particular, highly accurate glacier volume change monitoring and 3D movement computations will be possible\nTaking advantage of the helicopter flight needed to survey the ice stakes on Kronenbreen, NW Svalbard, we acquired high resolution photogrammetric data over the well-studied Midre Lovénbreen in September 2013. GoPro Hero 2 cameras were attached to the landing gear of the helicopter, acquiring two images per second. A C/A code based GPS was used for registering the stereoscopic model. Camera clock calibration is obtained through fitting together the shapes of the flight given by both the GPS logger and the relative orientation of the images. A DEM and an ortho-image are generated at 30cm resolution from 300 images collected. The comparison with a 2005 LiDAR DEM (5 meters resolution) shows an absolute error in the direct registration of about 6±3m in 3D which could be easily reduced to 1,5±1m by using fine point cloud alignment algorithms on stable ground. Due to the different nature of the acquisition method, it was not possible to use tie point based co-registration. A combination of the DEM and ortho-image is shown with the point cloud in figure below.\nA second photogrammetric data set will be acquired in September 2014 to survey the annual volume change and movement. These measurements will then be compared to the annual resolution glaciological stake mass balance and velocity measurements to assess the precision of the method to monitor at an annual resolution.",

            "abstract": "We measured the acquisition of magnetic remanence of iron-nickel alloys under pressures up to 23 GPa at room temperature. Experiments on pure iron using different pressure transmission media reveal a higher remanent magnetization at 21.5 GPa than at initial conditions, which could be attributed to a distorted hexagonal closed packed phase grown during the martensitic transition. Upon both compression and decompression, the remanent magnetization of the body centered cubic phases increase several times over initial conditions while the coercivity of remanence remains mostly invariant with pressure. Similar behavior is observed for the face centered cubic phases, where magnetization rises by a factor of 2-3 during compression to the highest applied pressures. Immediately upon decompression, magnetic remanence increases while magnetic coercivity remains fairly constant at relatively low values (5-20 mT). One exception is for the invar composition Fe64Ni36, where magnetization decreases markedly between 5 and 7 GPa. Martensitic effects best explain the increase in remanence rather than grain-size reduction, as the creation of single domain sized grains would raise the coercivity. The magnetic remanence of low Ni invar alloys increases faster with pressure than for other body centered cubic compositions due to the higher magnetostriction of the low Ni invar metals. Thermal demagnetization spectra of Fe64Ni36 measured after pressure cycling broaden as a function of peak pressure, with a systematic decrease in Curie temperature. Irreversible strain accumulation from the martensitic transition likely explains the broadening of the Curie temperature spectra, consistent with our X-ray diffraction analyses.",

To this end, we conducted forecast experiments in eight calendar years from 2006 to 2013 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Noah land surface model and estimated the background error statistics based on the National Meteorological Center (NMC) methodology. All the WRF-Noah simulations were initialized with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) FNL operational global analysis dataset. In our study domain, covering the contiguous United States, the results show that the soil moisture background error exhibits strong seasonal and regional patterns, with the highest magnitude occurring during the summer at the top soil layer over most regions of the Great Plains. It is also revealed that the soil moisture background errors are strongly biased at some regions, especially Southeastern United States, and bias impacts the magnitude of the error from top to bottom soil layer in an increasing order. Moreover, we also found that the estimated background error is not sensitive to the selection of WRF physics schemes of microphysics, cumulus parameterization, and land surface model. Overall, this study enhances our understanding on the space-time variability of the soil moisture background error and promises more accurate land-surface state estimates via variational data assimilation.",

            "abstract": "The failure of magmatic foams appears to be a fundamental eruption process at open-conduit, basaltic volcanoes. We applied the fiber bundle model using global load sharing to model the failure of magmatic foams. The fiber strengths in the model were taken from bubble wall widths measured in four computer-simulated foams and by X-ray tomographic microscopy in three foams produced in the laboratory by heating hydrated basaltic glasses at 1 atm. to 1200 °C. The strengths of the modeled foams were calibrated based upon the correlation of the strength of one foam with published experimental data. The fiber bundle model successfully reproduced measured tensile strengths of porous volcanic rocks studied by other researchers and confirms published findings of the primary importance of foam porosity, as well as the secondary importance of structural details that affect the number and size of bubble walls and permeability. The success of the fiber bundle model in reproducing foam strengths encouraged us to compare its predictions with infrasonic measurements associated with bubbles at Stromboli (Italy). We found that within uncertainty the power-law exponents of the infrasonic energies and of the fiber bundle model energies are in agreement. They both show a cross-over from an exponent of 5/2 associated with the bursting of small bubbles in the infrasonic measurements to an exponent of 3/2 for normal Strombolian eruptions associated with infrasonic signals from meter-scale bubbles. The infrasonic signals for major explosions and a paroxysmal eruption at Stromboli fall near the extrapolation of the power law defined by the low-amplitude, bubble bursting events. The measurement of small-amplitude infrasonic events at Stromboli thus appear useful in predicting the recurrence interval of paroxysmal eruptions at this volcano and may also provide a tool that uses common, small-amplitude infrasonic events to constrain the frequency of larger eruptions at other volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Safe management of the long-lived and high-level radioactive waste originating primarily from nuclear power stations requires isolating and confining the waste for periods up to 100 000 years. Disposal in deep geological formations is currently the solution advocated by international organisations (e.g. the IAEA and the OECD-NEA) and governments, but nowhere in the world is such repository for civilian nuclear waste in operation yet. Concerns about the governance of the involved risks and uncertainties for such long periods lie at the heart of the controversies that have slowed down the identification of a solution. In order to draw lessons potentially relevant for the governance of long-term climate risks, this paper examines the ways in which two interrelated aspects have been addressed in nuclear waste management in France, the US, and the Nordic countries.\nThe first issue concerns “reversibility” – i.e. the possibility on one hand to retrieve the waste once it has been disposed of in a repository, and on the other to return at any point in time along the decision-making process to the previous decision-making phase. Reversibility constitutes today a fundamental, legally binding requirement in French radioactive waste policy. A strategy for managing risk and uncertainty as such, reversibility nevertheless also poses significant safety challenges of its own.\nThe second topic goes beyond the timescales (max. 300 years) in which reversibility is usually considered applicable, addressing the question of intergenerational knowledge transfer, comparing the Nordic and the American approaches to the issue. The key challenge here is ensuring the transfer to the future generations – for periods up to 100 000 years – of sufficient knowledge concerning the siting, characteristics and management of the waste deposited in a repository. Even more fundamentally, instead of knowledge transfer, should we rather aim at “active forgetting”, in order to prevent the curious in the future from intruding into the repository?\nFinally, lessons are drawn for the governance of climate risks, on the basis of the experience of reversibility and intergenerational knowledge transfer in nuclear waste governance.",

            "abstract": "Many seismic hazard projects use earthquake rates estimated from paleoseismic data as a mainstay for estimating future earthquake probabilities. A prime example is the third Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast (UCERF3), which relies on reported dates of observed paleo-seismic displacements at 31 sites on 13 named faults in California. However, there is a problem: recorded paleoseismic events ceased at about the beginning of the instrumental seismic era. The reported event rates for the ensemble of 31 sites sums to about 0.1 per year. Allowing generously for occurrences of earthquakes that rupture multiple sites simultaneously, the event rate is on the order of 0.04 per year. Yet the most recent paleo-event date is 1910. Such a long open interval would be extremely unlikely for a Poisson process with that rate, which might be expected statewide even if individual faults ruptured in quasi-period events. Quasi-periodic behavior for the whole ensemble would make the discrepancy worse. Possible explanations for the discrepancy include (1) extreme luck, (2) unexplained regional collaboration amongst faults, or (3) mistaken identification of near-surface displacements as evidence of large earthquakes. The first can be rejected with 99% confidence. There is no evidence for the second in the pre-1910 paleoseismic history nor in any theoretical models yet published. The third could explain the observed quiescence because mistaken identity would be prevented by instrumental seismic data.",

The corresponding effective medium, or homogenized medium, can be computed thanks to the non-periodic homogenization technique. In the seismic imaging context, limiting ourselves to layered media, we numerically show that a tomographic elastic model which results of the inversion of limited frequency band seismic data is an homogenized model. Moreover, we show that this homogenized model is the same as the model that can be computed with the non-periodic homogenization technique. We first introduce the notion of residual homogenization, which is computing the effective properties of the difference between a reference model and a ``real'' model. This is necessary because most imaging technique parametrizations use a reference model that often contains small scales, such as elastic discontinuities. We then use a full waveform inversion method to numerically show that the result of the inversion is indeed the homogenized residual model. The full waveform inversion method used here has been specifically developed for that purpose. It is based on the iterative Gauss-Newton least square non linear optimization technique, using full normal mode coupling to compute the partial Hessian and gradient. The parametrization has been designed according to the residual homogenized parameters allowing to build a real multi-scale inversion with progressive frequency band enrichment along the Gauss-Newton iterations. We show with examples how this result can impact our interpretation of tomographic models.",

            "abstract": "To understand the environment and select detecting objects for the Yutu Rover, NAOC used the DEM and DOM data obtained by CE-2, geological data released by USGS, and high resolution image captured by CE-3 and LRO-NAC to analyze the topographical characteristic, geologic age, Geomorphological feathers and new dust distribution in two scale levels. The first level is 45km×75km, and another one is 4km×4km. The center of the study region is the CE-3 landing site (19.51°W, 44.12°N). The following is the initial conclusions:\n(1) CE-3 landed on a relatively flat region in the Mare Imbrium with an elevation of -2615m. The geological age of the landing site belongs to young Eratoshenian. 10km to the north of the landing site is the older Mare Imbrium stratum, and the location of the landing site is just on the intersection area of these two stratums.\n(2) The landing site lies on the edge of a lunar mountain with a decline tendency from west to east, and the topographic slope and roughness of the landing region is low, which is the typical characteristic of lunar mare. There is a big crater with diameter of 430 meters in the west of the landing site, and lots of stones in different colors on the rim of this crater, shown in the Figure2.\n(3) By comparing the images captured by LRO-NAC before and after the landing, much lunar dust was blown away by the engine plume during the landing of CE-3. The change scope is about 60m with from east-west and 135m length from south-north. The direction of landing is from south-north, so the length is larger than the width, shown in the figure 3.\n(4) In the initial stage, the Yutu Rover was suggested to move in south direction and late in north direction, which would get more scientific data and result.",

            "abstract": "Ice clouds play an important role in Earth radiation balance by reflecting solar and absorbing thermal radiation, which is expressed as albedo and greenhouse effects, which cause significant differential atmospheric heating and cooling in both horizontal and vertical directions. Two co-orbital sensors, the CloudSat radar and the CALIPSO lidar, provide global profiles for the first time of atmospheric ice clouds. A combination of radar and lidar is useful for examining clouds of varying optical depth, as the radar excels in probing optically thick clouds while the lidar is better suited to the thin clouds. With these joint measurements from the CloudSat radar and the CALIPSO lidar, ice cloud climotological properties are studied and radiative effects are calculated for with a wide range of optical depth using libRadtran, a model package for radiative transfer.\nIce cloud climatological studies show that the global mean optical depth and effective radius are around 4 and 48 μm, respectively. Mean ice water path is approximately 110 g m-2for all measurements. Their occurrence frequencies and ice mass amount distributions do not just depend on seasons, but also rely on the optical depth values. Meanwhile, ice water content and effective radius show different temperature dependent relationships among the tropics, mid- and high-latitudes.\nGeographical variations of ice cloud forcing are investigated to discover where warming/cooling by ice cloud occurs, and how these effects are modulated by seasonal and regional variations. Vertical heating rate profiles are also studied to reveal heating/cooling structures for cases such as mid-latitude summer. Meanwhile, ice cloud forcing is calculated as a function of optical depth. Past studies have established in general that thin and high cirrus warm the earth system due to the greenhouse effect, whereas thicker ice clouds are cooling because of stronger solar albedo effect. However, the whole spectrum of ice cloud forcing have yet to be studied quantitatively. This study attempts to find thresholds where ice clouds change from a net warming to a net cooling effect.",

            "abstract": "At the end of the Cassini mission, the spacecraft will descend into close-by proximal orbits around Saturn. During those proximal orbits, Cassini will obtain high precision gravity measurements of the planet. In this talk, we will discuss how this data can be used to estimate the depth of the observed flows on the planet. This can be done in several ways: 1. measurements of the high order even harmonics which beyond J10 are dominated by the dynamics; 2. measurements of odd gravity harmonics which have no contribution from a static planet, and therefore are a pure signature of dynamics; 3. upper limits on the depth can be obtained by comparing low order even harmonics from dynamical models to the difference between the measured low order even harmonics and the largest possible values of a static planet; 4. direct latitudinally varying measurements of the gravity field exerted on the spacecraft. We will discuss how these methods may be applied and show that given the expected sensitivity of Cassini the odd harmonics J3 and J5 will have the best sensitivity to deep dynamics, allowing detection of winds reaching only O(100km) deep, if those exist on Saturn. We use a hierarchy of dynamical models ranging from full 3D dynamical circulation models to simplified dynamical models where the sensitivity of the gravity field to the dynamics can be explored. In order to invert the gravity field to be measured by Cassini into the depth dependent circulation, an adjoint inverse model is constructed for the dynamical models, thus allowing backward integration of the dynamical model. This tool can be used for examination of various scenarios, including cases in which the depth of the wind depends on latitudinal position. In summary, we expect that the very end of Cassini's tour holds an opportunity for gravity measurements that may finally allow answering one of the long-lasting puzzles in planetary science regarding the depth of the zonal jets on the gas giants. In fact, as Juno will be performing similar measurements we hope to be able to build a picture of the dynamics for both Jupiter and Saturn. Answering this puzzle, will likely help explain the origin of the multiple jet streams and strong equatorial superrotation on the gas giants.",

            "abstract": "When policy makers are aware of immediate and long-term risks to communities, what do they do to plan for and mitigate the effects of climate change? This paper addresses that question in two ways. First, as an organizing framework it presents an overview of the empirical evidence on focusing events. Focusing events are defined as sudden, rare events that reveal harm or the potential for future harm that the general public and policy makers become aware of simultaneously. These large-scale events are typically natural and disasters, crisis, or technological accidents. This paper considers the empirical evidence of the relationship between focusing events, the harm revealed by the event and policy change aimed at reducing future risk of harm. Second, this paper reviews the case of flood mitigation policy in the United States from 1968 to 2008. It considers the ways in which policy makers have and have not integrated future flood risks into mitigation policy and planning, particularly after large-scale floods. It analyzes the political, intergovernmental, demographic and geographic factors that have promoted and constrained long-term flood mitigation policy. This paper concludes with a discussion of the meaning and implications of potential focusing events and constrains on policy for long-term climate change concerns.",

            "abstract": "The seismoelectric effect might help improving our knowledge of the subsurface. This complex physical phenomenon can be described by Biot’s poroelasticity equations coupled to Maxwell’s electromagnetic equations. Besides simultaneously offering seismic resolution and electromagnetic sensitivity, the coefficient coupling these two types of fields can in principal provide us with direct information on important medium parameters like porosity and permeability.\nTwo types of seismoelectric coupling can be distinguished:\n1) localized coupling generating an electromagnetic field that is present inside the seismic wave and travels with its velocity, referred to as the coseismic field\n2) An independent electromagnetic field diffusing with electromagnetic velocity, referred to as the seismoelectric conversion, providing us with information at depth.\nOne of the major challenges of seismoelectrics is the very weak signal-to-noise ratio of especially the seismoelectric conversion. In order to make seismoelectrics applicable in the field, we need to find ways to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of this second order effect. Can nature help us? It is well-known that a seismic wave travelling through a package of thin-beds, can experience amplitude-tuning effects that result in anomalously high amplitudes for the seismic signal. Can similar enhancing signal effects occur for seismoelectric phenomena?\nUsing our analytically based, numerical modeling code ESSEMOD (ElectroSeismic and Seismoelectric Modeling), we investigate what effects thin-beds can have on the seismoelectric signal, thereby focusing especially on the seismoelectric conversion. We will highlight the factors that play a role in the possible enhancement of the seismoelectric signal-to-noise ratio by thin-beds. We show that the seismoelectric method is sensitive to changes in medium parameters on a spatial scale that is much smaller than the seismic resolution.\nAcknowledgements: This research was funded as a Shell-FOM (Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter) project within the research program ’Innovative physics for oil and gas’.",

            "abstract": "Although the distribution of paleomagnetic data for the Jurassic of stable Europe is notorious for its wide spread and lack of any recognizable age control of pole positions it was only recently that the Jurassic has moved closer to the focus of paleomagnetic research (Kent and Irving, 2010; Muttoni et al. 2013). Here we present paleomagnetic data for carbonate rocks of early and late Jurassic age from southern (Franconia and Swabia) and northern Germany. A total of 406 samples from 37 localities in northern Germany and 180 samples from 19 localities in southern Germany were collected and subjected to detailed demagnetization experiments. All localities are dated biostratigraphically covering the Oxfordian to Tithonian (northern Germany) and the Pliensbachian (southern Germany) in time. After removal of a component of magnetization of secondary origin, stable magnetizations could be identified in 176 samples from 17 sites in northern Germany (D=003.2°, I=53.2°, k=79.4, α95=4.5°). Similar directions (D=001.2°, I=43.3°, k=18.6, α95=13.2°) were isolated in 108 sampled from 8 sites of coeval rocks from southern Germany. Positive fold and reversal tests support our interpretation that the resulting mean direction of is of primary origin e.g. late Jurassic in age. Unfortunately, however, the situation for the early Jurassic of southern Germany is less favourable. Here, only 15 samples from 2 sites yielded magnetizations which were interpreted to be of primary origin (D=025.3°, I=59.4°, k=51.0, α95=11.2°) . The resulting paleo north pole positions for the Lower and Upper Jurassic of Germany plot at comparable latitudes (70°N) but are separated in longitude by roughly 60°. This is compatible with the apparent polar wander path proposed by Kent and Irving (2010). Taking into consideration that the only reliable paleopole for the middle Jurassic of stable Europe is indistinguishable from the late Jurassic paleopole lends additional support to the proposed late Jurassic jump connecting the connecting the early/mid Jurassic standstill to the Jurassic/Cretaceous hook of the Kent and Irving (2010) apparent polar wander path.",

            "abstract": "Field records and experimental studies show that the fluvial geophysical processes that shape the landscape, such as debris flows and river sediment transport, are extremely unpredictable in large part due to the nonlinear dependence of the transport rates on the structural properties of the sediment.\nThere is a need for a more fundamental understanding of the physical processes that control sediment transfer rates, particularly the magnitude and frequency of the bed load transport flux.\nWe present experiments in a simple geometry, an annular couette cell, that allows us to study the free-surface dynamics at the interface between a flowing viscous fluid and a submerged particle bed made of plastic spheres, a highly idealized river. This geometry presents an opportunity to study details of the bed structure and particle transport with a well-controlled steady shear stress during long-time experiments.\nWe use the refractive-index-matched laser scanning technique [Dijksman et al. 2012], to detect the particle positions on a two-dimensional vertical slice at the middle of the 15 particle wide bed, and characterize their dynamics over a range of timescales of six-orders of magnitude. We find that the particle dynamics are spatiotemporally heterogeneous, but that the overall flow field reaches a well-developed steady-state. Below the fluid flow depth, we find a wide flowing layer characterized by a fast, approximately exponential decay of the particle velocity versus depth. This layer can be associated with the active layer commonly mentioned in the literature. We find that the thickness of the flow layer increases with the applied shear stress. However, deep in the bed, the velocity profile does not indefinitely follow a exponential decay. Instead, the rate of decay of the velocity profile slows drastically, transitioning continuously to a quasistatic flow regime, with a very different exponential decay.\nThis study provides a new framework for understanding the threshold of bed load particle transport, as the result of a jamming process occurring at a critical depth. We test different rheological hypothesis in order to predict the entire particle velocity profile.",

Measurements were taken during the research cruise of r/v Roger Revelle using the VMP profiler down to ~ 140 m to infer the kinetic energy dissipation rate eps, temperature T, salinity S, and potential density anomaly sigT.\nVery strong stratification was observed just below a thin (less than 15-20 m deep) vertically homogeneous turbulent surface layer (SL), which effectively decoupled the former from the underlying thermohalocline. The upper boundary of the near-surface pycnocline was at z ~ 10 - 11 m and its lower boundary at z ~ 15 m. Under moderate (11 - 12 m/s) winds, the dissipation in the SL gradually decreased from the sea surface down to 10^-6 – 10^-8 W/kg at depths z ~ 10 - 15 m. Below z ~ 15 m, the dissipation rate sharply dropped to ~10^-9 W/kg, remaining approximately constant downward. The horizontal/temporal differences of T, S and sigT in the middle of SL were as high as dT ~ 0.25 C, dS ~ 0.4 psu, and dsigT ~ 0.22, respectively, over a distance of ~ 2 km.\nOn the next day, under higher winds (~ 16 - 18 m/s), the SL deepened only slightly, being nominally decoupled from the pycnocline. The intensification of wind stress from ~ 0.16 to ~ 0.51 N/m2, led to an increase of eps to 10^-6 – 10^-7 W/kg across the entire mixing layer. The enhanced turbulence not only produced vertical mixing, but also initiated horizontal stirring, thus dramatically reducing thermohaline differences in the mixed SL down to dT ~ 0.017C, dS ~ 0.02 psu, and dsigT ~ 0.008, respectively. However, very strong stratification in the pycnocline suppressed the wind-induced vertical mixing, which did not penetrate below z ~ 22 - 25 m. No internal sources of turbulence were evident in the water interior, suggesting that under mild or even relatively strong but short-sustained winds small-scale dynamics of the SL and that of the pycnocline are effectively detached from each other. Internal wave radiation and their breaking below the pycnocline appear to be damped by local dynamics. Near-surface turbulence of this genre, which produces weakly-penetrative vertical mixing but effective horizontal stirring could be a characteristic feature of the BoB dynamics in the regions away from strong local frontal zones.",

            "abstract": "Mobilization of naturally occurring molybdenum (Mo) and arsenic (As) in sedimentary rocks, mainly carbonates, contaminate groundwater in the Lithia area. The sedimentary rocks contains up to 825 mg kg-1 Mo and 144 mg kg-1 As. Mo and As groundwater concentrations reached up to 5000 µg L-1 and 300 µg L-1 and exceed the WHO guidelines of 70 and 10 µg L-1, respectively. In order to asses their fractions and origins, a modified five-step (adsorbed/exchangeable, carbonates, hydrous iron oxides, crystalline iron oxides, sulfides and organic matter (OM)) sequential extraction procedure (SEP) was applied to 10 samples. Determination of the elements was carried out by ICP-MS. The SEP results were compared to values obtained by total digestion with aqua regia. The recovery ranged from 88 to 111 % for Mo and 75 to 116 % for As and RSD was better than 10%. In most samples up to 90 % of the Mo was present in the adsorbed/exchangeable fraction (step 1), characterizing a major Mo source. Pyrite, which is present in the aquifer matrix beneath Lithia, is generally considered a source for Mo. Electron microprobe analysis, did not confirm the presence of Mo in pyrite. Thus oxidation of OM is the main reason for the high Mo content in step 1 and groundwater. Another possible source for Mo in groundwater could be the mineral powellite (CaMoO4). To investigate this possibility powellite saturation was calculated with PHREEQC under alkaline conditions. Powellite was super saturated once Mo concentrations exceeded 3000 μg L-1. Thus powellite was not considered a source, but rather a sink for Mo released form OM.\nIn contrast to Mo, As was present in each extraction step in somewhat similar abundance: step 1 (17%), step 2 (11% ), step 3 (30 %), step 4 (23 %) and step 5 (18%). Hydrous and crystalline iron oxides which were dissolved in step 3 and 4 contained the highest As concentrations. Electron microprobe analysis of pyrite, which was dissolved in step 5, showed concentrations of up to 2000 mg kg-1 As. Our results suggest the Mo found in groundwater is mainly related to OM rather than pyrite and powellite, whereas As could originate from OM, pyrite and iron oxides. A possible way to get more precise information about their distribution in the aquifer matrix beneath Lithia would be the application of the chromium reduction method.",

            "abstract": "Advances in molecular microbiology techniques (e.g. epi-fluorescent microscopy and PCR) are making it easier to study the influence of specific microorganisms on nutrient transport. Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) are commonly used in wastewater treatment plants to remove excess phosphorus (P) from effluent water. PAOs have also been identified in natural settings but their ecological function is not well known. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PAOs in natural environments would release and accumulate P during anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively. We placed stream biofilms in sealed, covered tubs and subjected them to alternating air (aerobic conditions) and N2 gas (anaerobic condition) bubbling for 12 hours each. Four treatments investigated the influence of changing dissolved oxygen on micribially-controlled P cycling: (1) biofilms bubbled continuously with air, (2) biofilms bubbled alternatively with air and N2, (3) biocide treated biofilms bubbled continuously with air, and (4) biocide treated biofilms bubbled alternatively with air and N2. Treatments 3 and 4 serve as abiotic controls to treatments 1 and 2. We analyzed samples every 12 hours for soluble reactive P (SRP), temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. We also used fluorescent microscopy (i.e. DAPI staining) and PCR to verify the presence of PAOs in the stream biofilms. SRP results over the course of the experiment support our hypothesis that anaerobic and aerobic stream conditions may impact PAO mediated P release and uptake, respectively in natural environments. The results of these experiments draw attention to the importance of microbiological controls on P mobility in freshwater ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The sulfur cycle in marine sediments exerts a major control on the redox state of the ocean and atmosphere. The overall driver in the sulfur cycle is the microbial mediated sulfate reduction to sulfide (SR), In near-surface sediments, only a small fraction of the sulfide produced becomes permanently buried in the reduced form as pyrite (FeS2) Paradoxically, the deep, reduced, sulfidic zone of marine sediments is often characterized by the presence of zero-valent sulfur compounds, e.g. elemental sulfur and polysulfides [1,2,3]. The presence of oxidized iron and manganese has been suggested as the source of oxidizing power for the formation of elemental S and polysulfides in these deep, anoxic and sulfidic sediment environments, which often lie at or below the sulfate-methane transition [1,3]. The findings of Milucka et al. [4] suggest that anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfate reduction (AOM) may provide another source of zerovalent sulfur to such environments. AOM is thought to be mediated by a consortium of methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria. Milucka et al. [4] show that zero-valent sulfur compounds (S0) are formed during AOM-coupled SR and conclude that the S0 is a product of a novel pathway for sulfate reduction performed by the ANME. Thus, AOM may not be an obligately syntrophic process. Furthermore, the produced S0, in the form of hydrodisulfide, can serve as a substrate for disproportionation by the Deltaproteobacteria associated with the ANME, and that this disproptionation proceeds under sulfidic conditions. These observations may have significant implications for role of sulfur intermediates in our understanding of the biogeochemical carbon and sulfur cycle in modern and past environments.\n [1] Holmkvist et al.

            "abstract": "The solar spectral irradiance (SSI) varies on all time scales, and these variations are highly dependent on wavelength. The daily and 27-day solar rotation variations are best understood from many different satellite observations over the past five decades. There has also been much progress in understanding the longer term 11-year solar activity cycle variations. However, instrument degradation corrections are not as accurate as sometimes needed for long-term studies, thus there can be challenges in understanding the solar cycle variations at some wavelengths. In particular, the Harder et al. (GRL, 36, L07801, 2009) results for the near ultraviolet (NUV), visible, and near infrared (NIR) have indicated more NUV variation and some out-of-phase variation for some visible and NIR wavelengths. These variations have been challenged as they are inconsistent with some prior measurements and with some SSI models. A different approach to study the solar cycle variations, but without the need for long-term instrument degradation corrections, is to examine the total energy during isolated solar outburst periods. A solar active region typically appears suddenly and then takes about seven months to decay and disperse back into the quiet Sun network. The isolated outburst period refers to when only one major active region dominates the irradiance variation. The solar outburst energy, which includes all phases of active region evolution, could be considered to be the primary cause for solar cycle variations. Using TIMED, SDO, and SORCE extreme ultraviolet and far ultraviolet observations, the outburst energy (7 months) spectral variation is found to be very similar to their multi-year (solar cycle) variation. The same approach is applied for studying the NUV-Visible-NIR variations from SORCE, and these new results provide a different, and perhaps more accurate, indicator of SSI variation.",

            "abstract": "One prominent event of the Bølling/Allerød (B/A) interstadial was the large meltwater release to global oceans. The Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) is usually considered the main source. But, the large LIS meltwater discharge conflicts with the marine record showing an active North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) during the B/A interval. Continuous dune-lacustrine successions in the Illinois River Valley (IRV) have shown complete records of the last deglacial chronozones. Their grain-size distributions and accurate B/A age 14C dates of plant fossils from 15 m deep lacustrine sediment in the IRV suggest that most of the IRV and parts of the adjacent upland were inundated by water. The inundation was caused by a sediment dam interpreted to have been constructed and followed by a breach at the confluence of the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers during the B/A interval due to sediment mobilization by the large meltwater release. The grain size distributions correlate with meltwater pulses and mineralogical excursions in sediments from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) very well. The blockage and release of illite and chlorite rich fine-grained sediments from the Lake Michigan basin changed the relative abundance of clay minerals and thus the ratio of smectite/(illite + chlorite) in the sediment of the GOM. This finding explains why the meltwater episodes from the LIS and the associated detrital discharges are not synchronous in the sediments in the GOM. The finding also ties meltwater pulses and associated detrital discharges in the GOM closely to the LIS discharges via the Mississippi River Valley on chronozonal scales. Three arguments can be made from this result: 1) unaffected AMOC during B/A interval resulted potentially from the hyperpycnal inflow into the GOM floor; 2) limited volume of the meltwater discharge did not significantly influence the AMOC; and 3) the freshwater input into the GOM from the LIS at this particular location did not significantly influence the AMOC.",

            "abstract": "Desert varnishes are thin, shiny, blackish to brown coatings frequently found on the surfaces of exposed rocks in deserts around the globe. They have been proposed as terrestrial analogues of superficial hematite enrichments observed on Mars. While the first scientific studies of such varnishes go back to Darwin and von Humboldt, and intensive studies by a variety of techniques have been conducted over the last few decades, their origin is still a matter of debate. Microscopic and molecular studies have shown the presence of fungi and bacteria, but it is still unclear whether they are involved in the formation of the varnish material or just opportunistic colonizers on available surfaces.\nWe have analysed samples of desert varnish from sites in Death Valley, the Mojave Desert, the Negev of Israel, Central Saudi Arabia, and the Succulent Karoo by a variety of microanalytical techniques. Measurements by UV-femtosecond Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry show enrichments of manganese, iron, barium and other elements. Isotopic and trace chemical signatures show that these enriched elements cannot originate from the rocks that form the substrate on which the crusts have been deposited, but most likely are the result of (bio?)chemical transformation of windblown material. For a more detailed investigation of the internal structure of the crusts, we prepared ultra-thin sections (~100 nm) using focused ion beam slicing and analysed them by Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy with Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS). This technique revealed layered or chaotic structures consisting of alternating Mn and Fe-rich zones. Some of these layers are enriched in organic carbon with spectral features dominated by aromatic and carboxylate functionalities, indicating a biological origin of some of the crust material. Some crusts also show cavities that are lined with similar organic material. Since the age of these crusts is of the order of 100-10,000 of years, this organic matter must represent fossil evidence that has survived intensive solar radiation, extreme temperatures, and chemical weathering over long periods of time within microns from the varnish surface.",

            "abstract": "The Lepsy fault of the northern Tien Shan, SE Kazakhstan is an example of an active structure that connects a more rapidly deforming mountain region with an apparently stable continental region (SCR). The fault extends E-W ~100 km from the high mountains of the Dzhungarian Ala-tau, a sub-range of the northern Tien Shan, into the low-lying Kazakh platform. Our field-based and satellite observations reveal a ∼10 m vertical offset exceptionally preserved along the entire length of the fault. Geomorphic analysis and age control from radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating methods indicate that this scarp formed in the Holocene and was generated by two substantial earthquakes. The most recent event, which we date to some time after ∼400 years BP, is likely to have ruptured the entire ∼100 km fault length in a Mw 8 earthquake. In spite of the long recurrence times expected for such large SCR earthquakes, they represent a potential earthquake hazard in the increasingly populated Tien Shan foreland region. To characterise the Lepsy fault kinematics we use digital elevation models (DEMs) and high-resolution satellite imagery, which indicate that the predominant sense of motion is reverse right-lateral with a fault strike, dip, and slip vector azimuth of ∼290°, 45/50°S, and 335° respectively, which is consistent with predominant N-S shortening related to the India-Eurasia collision. Finally, the geometry of the western Lepsy fault termination suggests that shortening may also be partly accommodated by counter-clockwise rotation about a vertical axis.",

While there is general agreement on the necessary environmental conditions for many years, there is no such consensus on the role of deep, intense convection, sometimes referred to as convective bursts. One school of thought, stimulated by the original “hot tower” hypothesis from the Riehl-Malkus era, can be characterized as “the more intense the convection, the better”. This talk examines the evidence from 16 years of data from the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, as well as other passive microwave sensors, by a number of investigators, which suggests a different conclusion. While there is still some consensus that intense convection in the eyewall (or inside the radius of maximum winds) can contribute to deepening, evidence is accumulating to suggest that strengthening of the tropical cyclone is favored by symmetric inner core rainfall from convection of only moderate intensity, while intense convective bursts may delay or even hamper intensification.",

The focus was on the influence of biogenic-anthropogenic interactions on the measured aerosol particles, especially as related to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Through a combination of meteorology, emissions, and chemistry, the research site was affected by biogenic emissions from the tropical rainforest that were periodically mixed with urban outflow from the Manaus metropolitan area. Results from the first intensive operation period, from 1 February to 31 March 2014, show that for the wet season the PM1 mass concentration had typical values on order of 1 to 2 μg/m3. The organic species were dominant, followed by sulfate. The mass-diameter distribution of the particle population had a prevailing mode between 300 and 400 nm (vacuum aerodynamic diameter, dva), and at times a smaller mode at finer size was also present. Highly oxidized organic material was frequently observed, characterized by a dominant peak at m/z 44. There was a diel trend in the elemental oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio peaking in the afternoon.\nThe analysis of the results aims at delineating the anthropogenic impact on the measurements. Multivariate statistical analysis by positive-matrix factorization (PMF) is applied to the time series of organic particle mass spectra. The factors and their loadings provide information on the relative and time-varying contributions of different sources and processes affecting the organic component of the aerosol particle phase. Relationships between AMS results and measurements from co-located instruments that provide information on anthropogenic and biogenic gas and particle tracers are investigated, toward the goal of improving the understanding of anthropogenic influences on the submicron atmospheric particle population.",

            "abstract": "Convection in the Earth's outer core is responsible for the generation of the planet's magnetic field and is strongly dependent on interactions between the mantle and inner core. However, despite undergoing vigorous convection, the outer core is not necessarily a single uniform, homogeneous layer of the Earth. Recent seismic and geomagnetic studies suggest that the uppermost outer core is comprised of a chemically distinct layer of stably stratified material. This layer is likely enriched in light elements, which may either be accumulating due to the release of light elements during the solidification of the inner core, or due to a flux of material across the core mantle boundary.\nHere we compile a new dataset of SmKS and PmKP differential travel time data to investigate the vertical and geographical extent of stratification in the uppermost outer core. By jointly considering SmKS and PmKP phases, carefully correcting for known mantle structures, exploring the effect of core mantle boundary topography, and considering changes in the core over recent time, we are able to place new constraints on this stably stratified layer at the top of the outer core.",

            "abstract": "Hekla is one of the most active Icelandic volcanoes, with 18 subplinian-Plinian eruptions since 1104 AD and since 1970, the frequency of such eruptions have increased to once every decade. Hekla is currently inflated to the levels observed prior to the most recent eruptions in 1991 and 2000. Any future eruption is likely to pose a hazard to air traffic between North America and Europe because explosive eruptions of Hekla, independent of size, typically start with a powerful explosive phase that produces a sustained ash plume. We present an overview of 5 of the 18 historical Hekla eruptions (1104, 1158, 1300, 1693, and 1766). These eruptions cover a range of magma composition (andesite to rhyolite), eruptive volume (0.3 to 2 km3) and intensity (VEI 3 to 5), and with contrasting wind fields (dispersal axes NW to NE). New isopach maps have been constructed, which show both greater deposit thicknesses in the proximal region and wider dispersal than previously inferred. This leads to a significant increase in the estimated volume and mass eruption rates for these eruptions.",

            "abstract": "A new development of on-board data processing platform has been in progress at NASA Langley Research Center since April, 2012, and the overall review of such work is presented. The project is called High-Speed OnBoard Data Processing for Science Instruments (HOPS) and focuses on an air/space-borne high-speed scalable data processing platform for three particular National Research Council’s Decadal Survey missions such as Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems (ACE), and Doppler Aerosol Wind Lidar (DAWN) 3-D Winds. HOPS utilizes advanced general purpose computing with Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based algorithm implementation techniques. The significance of HOPS is to enable high speed on-board data processing for current and future science missions with its reconfigurable and scalable data processing platform. A single HOPS processing board is expected to provide approximately 66 times faster data processing speed for ASCENDS, more than 70% reduction in both power and weight, and about two orders of cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art (SOA) on-board data processing system. Such benchmark predictions are based on the data when HOPS was originally proposed in August, 2011. The details of these improvement measures are also presented. The two facets of HOPS development are identifying the most computationally intensive algorithm segments of each mission and implementing them in a FPGA-based data processing board. A general introduction of such facets is also the purpose of this presentation.",

            "abstract": "For viable CCS implementation variables such as CO2 dissolution rates, reactions with the host rock and the extent of groundwater interaction must be accurately constrained. Noble gases play an important role in these systems [e.g. 1,2]. Their application, however, requires accurate Henry’s constants within dense CO2-H2O systems. Current interpretations use pure noble gas-H2O partitioning data [3,4] and assume CO2-noble gas interactions are negligible, even at high (>700 kg/m3) CO2 densities [2].\nTo test this assumption we experimentally determined noble gas CO2-H2O partitioning for the 170-656 kg/m3 CO2 density range; representative of most CCS environments. Contrary to assumption, CO2 density significantly affected noble gas partition coefficients. For helium, increasing CO2 density resulted in a negative deviation trend from CO2-free values whilst for argon, krypton and xenon strong, positive deviations were observed. At 656 kg/m3 these deviations were -35%, 74%, 114% and 321% respectively. This is interpreted as the CO2 phase acting as a polar solvent inducing polarisation in the noble gases. Deviation trends are well defined using a 2nd order polynomial. The effect of a dense CO2 phase can now be incorporated into existing noble gas models.\nWe also present results from a Gibbs-Ensemble Monte Carlo molecular simulation to model partitioning for this binary system. This fundamental technique makes predictions based on the pair-potentials of interaction between the molecules. Here it gives the phase compositions and Henry coefficients for noble gases. With a proven ability in accurately replicating both the CO2-H2O system and low pressure noble gas Henry constants the focus is now on fully optimising the model to match high pressure observations.\n[1] Gilfillan et al.

The GSTHs were inferred using singular variable decomposition (SVD). Three locations (Sudbury, Manitouwadge, and Thompson) presented multiple boreholes. Here, simultaneous inversion was utilized to illustrate any regional trends present. For all studied sites, the inversion shows that ground surface temperatures throughout the LGC near the pressure melting point of ice, -1.41-2.51°C. These ground surface temperatures are representative of the basal temperatures of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered the region throughout the LGC. These temperatures allow for the possibility of basal flow and fast flowing ice streams, which have been inferred from geomorphological data and are consistent with modeling efforts. Regional variations in basal temperatures are observed. These could be attributed to fluctuations in ice sheet thickness and proximity to the edge of the ice sheet. No correlation between heat flow and the amplitude of the GSTH variations was observed, leading to the conclusion that the basal temperatures in this region are primarily driven by ice dynamics.",

A 3D-emerging contaminant model has been developed based on Delft3D water quality model and coupled with a hydrodynamic model and a catchment-scale 1D- hydrological and hydraulic model to study the possible fate and transport mechanisms of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in Marina Reservoir in Singapore. The main processes in the contaminant model include partitioning (among detritus, dissolved organic matter and phytoplankton), settling, resuspension and degradation. We used the integrated model to quantify the distribution of the total PFCs and two major components, namely perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in the water, sediments and organisms in the reservoir. The model yielded good agreement with the field measurements when evaluated based on the datasets in 2009 and 2010 as well as recent observations in 2013 and 2014. Our results elucidate that the model can be a useful tool to characterize the occurrence, sources, sinks and trends of PFCs both in the water column and in the sediments in the reservoir. Thisapproach provides a better understanding of mechanisms that influence the fate and transport of emerging contaminants and lays down a framework for future experiments to further explore how the dominant environmental factors change towards mitigation of emerging contaminants in the reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Surface mining is a common method of accessing coal. Blasting of overburden rock allows access to mineable ore. In high-elevation environments, the removed overburden rock is deposited in adjacent valleys as waste rock spoils. As part of a multi-year R&D program examining the influence of surface mining on watershed hydrological and water quality responses in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, this study reports on how surface mining affects streamflow hydrological and geochemical response at four reference and four mine-influenced catchments. The hydrology of this environment is dominated by snowmelt and steep topographic gradients. Flows were attenuated in mine-influenced catchments, with spring freshet delayed and more muted responses to precipitation events observed. Dissolved ions were an order of magnitude greater in mine-influenced streams, with more dilution-based responses to flows compared with chemostatic behavior observed in reference streams. Stable isotope signatures in stream water suggested that in both mine-influenced and reference watersheds, stream water was derived from well mixed groundwater as annual variability of stream isotope signatures was dampened compared with precipitation signatures. However, deflection of stream isotopes in response to precipitation were more apparent in reference watersheds. As a group, mine influenced catchments had a heavier isotope signature than reference watersheds, suggesting an enhanced influence of rainfall on recharge. Transit time distributions indicate existing waste rock spoils increase the average time water takes to move through the catchment.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic meridional heat transport is thought to have an overall warming effect on global climate due to feedbacks between the ocean, the cryosphere, and the atmosphere. Thus, if anthropogenic warming slows the ocean’s meridional transport of heat, as is widely predicted by climate models, then an expected consequence is a reduced pace of transient climate change. However, many studies treat ocean heat uptake as a passive process whereby the ocean reduces the rate of global warming exclusively by storing heat via altered fluxes at the air-sea boundary, ignoring dynamical ocean changes and their associated radiative feedbacks. Here, we quantify the impact on climate of changes to the ocean’s large-scale circulation in response to a doubling of CO2 in a suite of idealized simulations of a course resolution version of NOAA-GFDL’s CM2.1. In these simulations, we hold ocean velocities, various atmospheric and cryospheric feedback processes, or a combination of each fixed. A comparison of the climate and ocean circulation responses to a doubling of CO2 in these idealized configurations to the freely evolving model reveals the mechanisms by which the ocean circulation-radiative feedback processes operate. Moreover, this comparison exposes the degree to which the ocean and atmosphere’s responses to CO2 forcing are independent. Thus, we begin to answer the question of what climate and circulation responses are missed when an atmospheric model is coupled to a slab ocean, or an ocean model is warmed by a prescribed flux perturbation. As in previous studies, we find that holding ocean velocities fixed increases the rate of atmospheric warming relative to an ocean where the circulation responds dynamically to warming, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. We can attribute the change primarily to a greater shortwave flux out of the top of the atmosphere in the freely evolving simulation relative to the fixed ocean velocities simulations.",

            "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of the population earns their living from agriculture, government expenditures in many countries are being re-directed to the sector to increase productivity and decrease poverty. However, many of these investments are seeing low returns because they are poorly targeted. A geographic tool that accounts for spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in the factors of production would allow governments and donors to optimize their investments by directing them to farmers for whom they are most profitable.\nOne application for which this is particularly relevant is fertilizer recommendations. It is well-known that soil fertility in much of sub-Saharan Africa is declining due to insufficient nutrient inputs to replenish those lost through harvest. Since fertilizer application rates in sub-Saharan Africa are several times smaller than in other developing countries, it is often assumed that African farmers are under-applying fertilizer. However, this assumption ignores the risk farmers face in choosing whether or how much fertilizer to apply. Simply calculating the benefit/cost ratio of applying a given level of fertilizer in a particular year over a large, aggregated region (as is often done) overlooks the variability in yield response seen at different sites within the region, and at the same site from year to year.\nUsing Ethiopia as an example, we are developing a 1 km resolution fertilizer distribution tool that provides pre-season fertilizer recommendations throughout the agricultural regions of the country, conditional on seasonal climate forecasts. By accounting for spatial heterogeneity in soil, climate, market and travel conditions, as well as uncertainty in climate and output prices at the time a farmer must purchase fertilizer, this stochastic optimization tool gives better recommendations to governments, fertilizer companies, and aid organizations looking to optimize the welfare benefits achieved by their investments.",

            "abstract": "The pore-pressure induced hydromechanical effects on a typical two-dimensional fractured domain at 500 m depth below the land surface were studied. The domain contains fracture sets with curved fractures and dead-end fractures. The study investigates the effects of tension and shear failures in the rock matrix and fractures, respectively, as a result of increases in pore pressure. Two in situ stress boundary conditions are considered: an isotropic case SR1 with the two horizontal boundary stresses having the same magnitude and an anisotropic case SR2 with the ratio between these stress components set to be 2. Stress concentration points are found in the rock matrix near fracture endings or between adjacent fractures in close vicinity with each other. The maximum ratios of the maximum to minimum principal stresses found at points over the fractured domain are found to be as much as doubling those at the boundaries of the fractured domain, for both isotropic SR1 and anisotropic SR2 loading cases. Changes in the stress and stress ratio distributions due to increasing pore pressures were then evaluated. It was found that although the maximum principal stress magnitude generally decreases over the fractured domain, there is a significant increase in the magnitude of this stress component at the connections of the existing fractures. Changes in flow paths and permeability of the fractured rock domain due to the induced connections between the existing fractures were also investigated. It was found that because rock matrix cracking and consequent fractures propagation is more prevalent in anisotropic case SR2, these changes are more significant than in isotropic case SR1. It was found that changes in permeability are not significant under changes in pore pressure until the pore pressure reaches 85% of the magnitude of the in situ stresses at the boundaries of the fractured domain.",

The TCIS has been supporting specific science field campaigns, such as the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) campaign and the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) campaign, by creating near real-time (NRT) data visualization portals. These portals are intended to assist in mission planning, enhance the understanding of current physical processes, and improve model data by comparing it to satellite and aircraft observations.\nThe TCIS NRT portals allow the user to view plots on a Google Earth interface. To compliment these visualizations, the team has been working on developing data analysis tools to let the user actively interrogate areas of Level 2 swath and two-dimensional plots they see on their screen. As expected, these observation and model data are quite voluminous and bottlenecks in the system architecture can occur when the databases try to run geospatial searches for data files that need to be read by the tools.\nTo improve the responsiveness of the data analysis tools, the TCIS team has been conducting studies on how to best store Level 2 swath footprints and run sub-second geospatial searches to discover data. The first objective was to improve the sampling accuracy of the footprints being stored in the TCIS database by comparing the Java-based NASA PO.DAAC Level 2 Swath Generator with a TCIS Python swath generator. The second objective was to compare the performance of four database implementations – MySQL, MySQL+Solr, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL – to see which database management system would yield the best geospatial query and storage performance. The final objective was to integrate our chosen technologies with our Joint Probability Density Function (Joint PDF), Wave Number Analysis, and Automated Rotational Center Hurricane Eye Retrieval (ARCHER) tools.\nIn this presentation, we will compare the enabling technologies we tested and discuss which ones we selected for integration into the TCIS’ data analysis tool architecture. We will also show how these techniques have been automated to provide access to NRT data through our analysis tools.",

            "abstract": "The utilization of Borehole Heat Exchanger (BHE) to transfer heat from the shallow subsurface has been a common practice for the Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) system. To represent realistic application scenarios for numerical simulations of such systems, saturated and unsaturated conditions as well as heterogeneous soil properties have to be considered. Analytical solutions such as the Moving Finite Line Source (MFLS) model are not flexible enough to capture the full dynamics of the system. Furthermore, application examples with a high density of installed BHEs exist. There, temperature plumes produced by the individual BHEs may start to interact with each other and lead to lower thermal output.\nTo simulate this interaction, a dual continuum approach has been implemented into the open-source FEM simulator OpenGeoSys (OGS). The model is capable of simulating the temperature evolution around the BHE, with the consideration of both saturated and unsaturated groundwater flow processes in the surrounding soil. Instead of imposing Dirichlet or Neumann type of boundary condition at the location of a BHE, the newly developed model allows the user to specify inflow refrigerant temperature and flow rate as the driving force of heat transport. In a benchmark with homogeneous soil properties and fully saturated condition, temperature evolution predicted by the numerical model has been verified against MFLS analytical solution. In a second benchmark, the model simulated outflow temperature is validated by comparing to field measured data from a Thermal Response Test (TRT), provided by the Korean Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) in Dajeon, South Korea.\nAfter simulating several shallow geothermal scenarios of multiple BHEs operating in close vicinity, we find that the super-imposed MFLS based analytical solution predicts similar temperature distribution, provided the heat extraction from each BHE is relatively low. However, when the heat exchange rate is rather high, as in an aquifer thermal storage scenario, the super-imposed analytical solution cannot predict the fluctuated outflow temperature of the influenced BHE. Therefore in this case it is not applicable. Subsequently, the presented numerical model will be applied to real shallow geothermal site.",

            "abstract": "Pacific oceanic lithosphere has been subducting along the Tonga-Kermadec Trench for at least 28 Myr. The Louisville Ridge Seamount Chain (LRSC) collides with this subduction system at ~26°S and morphologically separates the Tonga Trench and forearc in the north from the Kermadec Trench and forearc in the south. This collision also results in a shallowing of the trench and a shortening of the forearc, primarily due to a region of enhanced subduction erosion. In addition, the southward migration of the LRSC at 180 mm yr-1 causes the forearc of the overriding plate north of the collision zone to shallow by ~2 km and exhibit increased faulting while, south of the collision zone, the overriding and underthrusting plates are undergoing processes and exhibiting structures and the morphology expected of normal Pacific plate subduction.\nIn 2011, a suite of geophysical data was acquired to image crustal and upper mantle structure across the LRSC and Kermadec forearc with the aim of: a) establishing the degree of seamount isostatic compensation and the nature of crustal and sub-crustal support at the northwestern end of the LRSC; b) resolving the flexural state of the overriding and underthrusting plates in regions of normal subduction and at the point of LRSC-collision; and from these c) determining the primary influences on the flexural behaviour and nature of deformation in the underthrusting and overriding plates along the Tonga-Kermadec subduction system.\nFrom the 2011 acquisition, we present swath bathymetry data, multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles, and an initial wide-angle (WA) refraction seismic model across the LRSC and the Kermadec forearc, south of the present-day collision zone, which have been interpreted to reveal the mode and extent of deformation on-going in the forearc prior to and after LRSC collision. We also show how structures on the Kermadec forearc evolve due to normal Pacific plate subduction, and demonstrate how the post-collision lithosphere of the overriding plate recovers after individual seamounts of the LRSC are subducted.",

            "abstract": "Models of trace element partitioning during non-reactive, one-dimensional melt migration predict the decoupling of tracers with different partition coefficients (e.g. La and Sm)(Navon & Stolper 1987, DePaolo 1996 Liang 2008). Such decoupling is often not observed in igneous products at the surface. We propose a numeric melt migration model derived from first principles to aid our understanding of mixing during melt migration in the mantle. We assert that circulation within a porosity wave could provide an explanation for this disparity.\nBuoyancy drives regions of elevated melt fraction through the overlying mantle as porosity waves (Richter & McKenzie 1984, Spiegelman 1993). Within those waves we expect porous flow to lead to the transport and mixing of distinct peridotite-derived lithologies (Kelemen 1997). A consequence of this mixing includes partitioning of trace elements in the partially molten, mixing lithologies.\nWe begin our numeric experiment by imposing a partially molten region in a nearly impermeable background. As the partially molten region rises, the buoyant melt races to the front of the porosity wave. Once the melt reaches the edge of the porosity wave, it encounters an extreme drop in permeability. Though the melt within the porosity wave may move faster than the wave itself, the permeable region confines the melt. Since the melt cannot outrun the porosity wave, it would pool at the edge of the impermeable region. However, the porosity wave continues to rise around the melt. This causes the melt to appear to double back into the more permeable region within the porosity wave. After “turning back”, the buoyant melt hugs the low permeability wall of the porosity wave as it continues to migrate. Near the bottom of the porosity wave the melt changes direction and begins to move upward again. The porosity wave and melt create a convective mixing cell.\nModeled circulation of melt within the porosity wave could explain why the linear decoupling of trace elements is not observed in natural basalts. The relative position of trace elements moving at different velocities changes as the melt migrates upward. The model ­­­shows that increasing distance traveled (i.e. source depth) increases the mixing of tracers. The circulation we model reduces the decoupling of compatible and incompatible elements.",

            "abstract": "While the significance of ultra-fine particle (UFP) deposition onto vegetated surfaces is rarely questioned, how to incorporate leaf attributes into global climate models continues to draw research attention. How leaf dimension and micro-roughness impact UFP collection efficiency is explored here through wind-tunnel experiments across a wide range of broadleaf species. Ilex cornuta with its partially folded shape and sharp edges is shown to be more efficient at collecting UFP than the other flat broadleaf species, but less efficient than the needle-like coniferous species. This finding suggests that UFP collection efficiency is linked to leaf attributes (i.e., dimension and micro-roughness). Analogies to flat-plate boundary layer theory are used to explain these findings, where the laminar boundary layer is assumed to be pinned to the leaf surface. For scaling arguments with maximum simplicity, the solid boundary is flat and possesses a finite dimension and micro-roughness. These simplifications allow explicit description of the area-averaged velocity and diffusivity profiles as a function of leaf dimension and micro-roughness. Further assuming the boundary behaves as hydraulically smooth (roughness elements do not protrude outside the viscous sub-layer), the analysis here shows that longer leaf dimension allows for thicker laminar boundary layers to develop. A thicker laminar boundary layer depth in turn increases the overall resistance to UFP deposition due to an increase in the diffusional path length thereby reducing the leaf-scale UFP collection efficiency. The mean velocity and diffusivity profiles over hydraulically smooth surfaces are not altered by the presence of micro-roughness elements. However, rougher surfaces in hydraulically smooth flow lead to shorter depositing distances (i.e., shorter diffusional path length) from the boundary, which enhances the particle deposition velocity. When the mean micro-roughness height is sufficiently larger than the size of UFP but still embedded within the viscous sub-layer, the dependence of the UFP collection efficiency on the size of UFP vanishes. The proposed flat-plate boundary layer analogy explains the observed features of UFP collection efficiencies onto leaves.",

            "abstract": "Widespread expanding of glacial lakes around the Himalayas, which has led (or will lead) to hazard risks in their downstream valleys due to the potential glacial outburst flood (GLOF), has been widely reported during the past decades. Among all type of glacial lakes, those lakes contacted with the terminals of modern glaciers are generally found experienced most remarkable area increases. That is mostly due to the coupled processes, such as calving, between the lake growths and ice tongue retreats. Thermal absorption and convection of lake water are important for calving at the ice cliff or sub-marine melting under the supra-ponded water bodies. Currently, many larger moraine dammed lakes, e. g., Imja Tsho (Nepal) and Longbasaba Lake (China), are observed undergoing remarkable growths and synchronically with the rapid ice margin collapses due to calving. Some newly formed and rapidly growing supraglacial lakes are also identified on the debris-covered region of Himalayan glaciers, e. g., the Rongbuk Glacier (China), Ngozumpa Glacier (Nepal) and Thorthormi Glacier (Butan), which are speculated to experience accelerated expanding in the near future and finally developing as bigger terminal-calving lakes. However, not all such lake-glacier systems present the same scenes. After experienced the phases of rapid lake growth and terminal retreat, despite the contacting and calving still existing, the positions of the calving lines may be balanced by the positive advances of the ice tongue. We have observed several lakes with stagnation of growth or even shrinkage in lake area as the advance of the calving ice margin. The heterogeneous status of these ice-contacted glacial lakes are mainly due to the different local geomorphology (e. g., slope, lake-basin shape and valley aspect) and glacier characters (e. g., debris cover, velocity and mass balance). These related factors are important for both the prediction of lake and glacier changes and the evaluation of GLOF hazards in the future.",

            "abstract": "The emission of methane (CH4) from rivers is not always included in the greehouse gas budget for inland waters, mainly due to a lack of information available for these systems. Unraveling the dynamics that control fluvial CH4 sources and sinks is critical for understanding the contribution of CH4 to riverine and global carbon budgets. Here, we present estimates of CH4 sources and sinks in numerous large Amazonian rivers during periods of high and low discharge. Calculations based on CH4 flux measurements and isotopic data (δ13CH4) of dissolved CH4 and bubbles in riverbed sediments were performed to assess the sources and sinks of river water CH4. Molecular analysis (qPCR) in river water samples was used to determine methanotrophic bacterial density. Methane-oxidizing bacterial counts were compared to oxidation estimates in order to assess the relationship between methane sinks and in situ bacterial communities. In general, rivers that had an enriched δ13CH4 in the water also had a higher density of methanotrophic bacteria in the water column, illustrating an important control on CH4 availability and flux related to physicochemical factors that control the abundance and activity of methanotrophic bacteria. Further, we observed a distinct relationship between the type of river (e.g. clear, white, or black water) and the flux of methane from the water column.",

            "abstract": "Ecohydrology of dry forest depends on the proportion of rainfall that enters the soil and it is spatial distribution at the patch scale. While the central role of patch scale redistribution has been widely documented, we know less about its response to rainfall intensity and its interplay with site properties (canopy, surface, soil). Here we explore water capture (infiltrated water depth, 24 hours after a rainfall event) and its determinants at the patch scale in a forest stand of the Dry Chaco (33.47 S, 66.44 W, Argentina). Water capture from 4 large rainfall events (>30 mm) was measured along 3 transects (36 m) in 18 regularly spaced (2 m) microsites, complemented by 2 years of hourly TDR moisture measurements in 3 microsites. Twelve canopy, surface and soil variables were characterized at each microsite. As the intensity of rainfall increased across events (9 to 34 mm/h) the heterogeneity of water capture became larger (coefficient of variation from 29 to 53%). Despite the intense internal redistribution of rainfall, net runoff was virtually nil (<3%) for all events, showing high capture at the stand level. Microsite variables influencing water capture changed with rainfall intensity. Canopy and soil litter cover reduced microsite water capture for the lowest intensity event (r=-0.44 and -0.37, respectively), but favor it for the highest intensity one (r=0.44 and 0.39, respectively). On intermediate intensity events water capture was predominantly explained by microtopography (greater capture in low microsites, p<0.05). Frequent TDR measurements supported these results. Water redistribution responds to rainfall intensity, creating different water capture patterns (contrasting effects of microsite conditions) for each rainfall event, an issue that may strongly influence key ecohydrological process such as E/T partition at the stand level. This study expands our perspective on dry forest water capture by quantifying its response to rainfall intensity.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated the stability of the MODerate−resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice−surface temperature (IST) product from Terra and Aqua for use as a climate−quality data record. The availability of climate−quality air temperature data (TA) from a NOAA observatory at Greenland’s Summit station as well as more traditional temperature data from nearby automatic weather stations (AWS) has enabled this high−temporal resolution study of MODIS ISTs. During a >6 year period (July 2008 to August 2014), the Terra and Aqua Collection 5 IST values were compared with contemporaneous average TA values from Summit Station’s nominal 2 m temperature sensor data sets (NOAA TAWO, GC-Net and DMI AWS).\nThis approach has enabled an expected small offset between air and ice sheet surface temperatures (TA > IST) to be investigated over multiple annual cycles. Previous work (Shuman et al., 2014, J. App. Meteo & Clim.) documents a number of factors influencing a progressive ‘cold bias’. This comparison, during 2008−2013, shows that there is a difference of about −0.5°C at the upper end of the NOAA-derived temperature range that increases to as much as −5°C on average at −60°C after some additional cloud filtering of the IST data. The consistency of the comparison results over each year in this study indicates that MODIS provides an alternative platform for remotely deriving surface temperature data, with the resulting IST data most compatible with in situ TA data when temperatures are warm and skies are clear. Finally, the ongoing IST data set should benefit from improved cloud filtering as well as algorithm modifications in Collection 6 to account for the progressive offset from TA at colder temperatures. Additional work will be done when Collection 6 IST data become available.",

We would like to present new technique for interactive visualization of subsurface using Tangible geospatial modeling and visualization system (Tangeoms). It couples a physical, three-dimensional model with geospatial modeling and analysis through a cycle of scanning and projection. Previous applications of Tangeoms were exploring the impact of terrain modifications on surface-based geophysical processes, such as overland water flow, sediment transport, and also on viewsheds, cast shadows or solar energy potential. However, Tangeoms can serve as a tool for exploring subsurface as well. By creating a physical sand model of a study area, removing the sand from different parts of the model and projecting the computed cross-sections, we can look under the ground as if we were at an excavation site, and see the actual data represented as a 3D raster in that particular part of the model. Depending on data availability, we can also incorporate temporal dimension. Our method is an intuitive and natural way of exploring subsurface data and for users, it represents an alternative to more abstract 3D computer visualization tools, by offering direct, tangible interface.",

            "abstract": "Forest harvesting, insects, disease, wildfire, and other disturbances can combine with climate change to cause unknown changes to the amount and timing of streamflow from critical forested watersheds. Southern Alberta forest and alpine areas provide downstream water supply for agriculture and water utilities that supply approximately two thirds of the Alberta population. This project uses datasets from intensely monitored study watersheds and hydrological model platforms to extend our understanding of how disturbances and climate change may impact various aspects of the streamflow regime that are of importance to downstream users. The objectives are 1) to use the model output of watershed response to disturbances to inform assessments of forested watersheds in the region, and 2) to investigate the use of a new flexible modelling platform as a tool for detailed watershed assessments and hypothesis testing.\nHere we applied the RAVEN hydrological modelling framework to quantify changes in key hydrological processes driving peak and low flows in a headwater catchment along the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The model was applied to simulate the period from 2006 to 2011 using data from the Star Creek watershed in southwestern Alberta. The representation of relevant hydrological processes was verified using snow survey, meteorological, and vegetation data collected through the Southern Rockies Watershed Project. Timber harvest scenarios were developed to estimate the effects of cut levels ranging from 20 to 100% over a range of elevations, slopes, and aspects. We quantified changes in the timing and magnitude of low flow and high flow events during the 2006 to 2011 period. Future work will assess changes in the probability of low and high flow events using a long-term meteorological record. This modelling framework enables relevant processes at the watershed scale to be accounted in a physically robust and computational efficient manner. Hydrologic response to hypothetical harvest scenarios may later be used to help guide forest development planning decisions where detailed assessments of hydrological risk are necessary.",

            "abstract": "It is widely expected that global emissions of atmospheric aerosols and their precursors will decrease strongly throughout the remainder of the 21st century, due to emission reduction policies enacted based on human health concerns. However, the resulting decrease in atmospheric aerosol burden will have unintended climate consequences. Since aerosols generally exert a net cooling influence on the climate, their removal will lead to an unmasking of global warming as well as other changes to the climate system. Aerosol and precursor global emissions decrease by as much as 80% by the year 2100, according to projections in four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. We use the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model version 3 (GFDL CM3) to simulate future climate over the 21st century with and without aerosol emission changes projected by the RCPs in order to isolate the radiative forcing and climate response due to the aerosol reductions. We find that up to 1 W m-2 of radiative forcing may be unmasked globally by 2100 due to reductions in aerosol and precursor emissions, leading to average global temperature increases up to 1 K and global precipitation rate increases up to 0.09 mm d-1 (3%). Regionally and locally, climate impacts are much larger, as RCP8.5 projects a 2.1 K warming over China, Japan, and Korea due to reduced aerosol emissions. Our results highlight the importance of crafting emissions control policies with both climate and air pollution benefits in mind. The expected unmasking of additional global warming from aerosol reductions highlights the importance of robust greenhouse gas mitigation policies and may require more aggressive policies than anticipated.",

            "abstract": "Understanding sediment transport processes at the river basin scale, their temporal spectra and spatial patterns is key to identify and minimize morphologic risks associated to channel adjustments processes. This work contributes a stochastic framework for modeling bed-load connectivity based on recent advances in the field (e.g., Bizzi & Lerner, 2013; Czubas & Foufoulas-Georgiu, 2014). It presents river managers with novel indicators from reach scale vulnerability to channel adjustment in large river networks with sparse hydrologic and sediment observations.\nThe framework comprises three steps. First, based on a distributed hydrological model and remotely sensed information, the framework identifies a representative grain size class for each reach. Second, sediment residence time distributions are calculated for each reach in a Monte-Carlo approach applying standard sediment transport equations driven by local hydraulic conditions. Third, a network analysis defines the up- and downstream connectivity for various travel times resulting in characteristic up/downstream connectivity signatures for each reach. Channel vulnerability indicators quantify the imbalance between up/downstream connectivity for each travel time domain, representing process dependent latency of morphologic response. Last, based on the stochastic core of the model, a sensitivity analysis identifies drivers of change and major sources of uncertainty in order to target key detrimental processes and to guide effective gathering of additional data.\nThe application, limitation and integration into a decision analytic framework is demonstrated for a major part of the Red River Basin in Northern Vietnam (179.000 km2). Here, a plethora of anthropic alterations ranging from large reservoir construction to land-use changes results in major downstream deterioration and calls for deriving concerted sediment management strategies to mitigate current and limit future morphologic alterations.",

CS aims to promote and evaluate learning about climate change science among the general public and k-12 students/teachers.\nThe goals of CS are:\n1) Engage teachers, students, and parents in a climate change science communication competition.\n2) Display the winning 6 artworks from K-12 students throughout the LRTA.\n3) Assess the impact of Cool Science on the teaching and learning of climate science in K-12 formal education.\n4) Assess the impact of Cool Science artwork on attitudes, awareness, and understanding of climate change among adult bus riders.\nA naturalistic inquiry employing a mixed methodology approach best describes our research design. The evaluation focuses on providing feedback regarding the potential learning outcomes for the K-12 students who create the media for the project and the general riding public who engage with the student artwork. To identify possible outcomes, data was collected in the several forms: survey, interviews, and online analytics.\nWe see an urgent need to improve both the public’s engagement with climate change science and to the profile of climate change science in formal education settings. The Cool Science (CS) project is an opportunity to bring formal and informal science learning settings together for mutual engagement in the science of climate change. The research that will be presented should be of interest to both informal and formal science educators, art and science educators, and environmental education advocates.",

However, these processes are coupled in nature, and so to develop a more complete understanding of magma ascent dynamics in the crust both need to be taken into account. We present a series of gelatine analogue experiments that use both Particle Image Velocimentry (PIV) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques to characterise the dynamics of fluid flow within intrusions and to quantify the associated deformation of the intruded media. Experiments are prepared by filling a 40x40x30 cm3 clear-Perspex tank with a low-concentration gelatine mixture (2-5 wt%) scaled to be of comparable stiffness to crustal strata. Fluorescent seeding particles are added to the gelatine mixture during its preparation and to the magma analogue prior to injection. Two Dantec CCD cameras are positioned outside the tank and a vertical high-power laser sheet positioned along the centre line is triggered to illuminate the seeding particles with short intense pulses. Dyed water (the magma analogue) injected into the solid gelatine from below causes a vertically propagating penny-shaped crack (dike) to form. Incremental and cumulative displacement vectors are calculated by cross-correlation between successive images at a defined time interval. Spatial derivatives map the fluid flow within the intrusion and associated strain and stress evolution of the host, both during dike propagation and on to eruption. As the gelatine deforms elastically at the experimental conditions, strain calculations correlate with stress. Models which couple fluid dynamics and host deformation make an important step towards improving our understanding of the dynamics of magma transport through the crust and to help constrain the tendency for eruption.",

Current FPAR products have an accuracy of 0.14 compared with total FPAR measurements, and 0.09 compared with green FPAR measurements. They are close to, but have not fulfilled, the accuracy requirement, and further improvements are needed.\nThis study combined a simplified radiative transfer based FPAR model and a refined surface reflectance database for estimation of FPAR from multiple satellite data, namely MODIS, MISR, and Landsat TM/ETM+. This new model improved the phenology curve of vegetation and the accuracy to 0.07 when validating with ground green FPAR measurements. Regional mapping of FPAR around the validation sites were demonstrated at multiple scales. The results showed that the retrieval rates were high and the FPAR distributions were consistent across the scales using this model. The FPAR derived from different satellite data had their distinct advantages. The FPAR retrieved from the multi-angular MISR data had the highest accuracy. The FPAR estimated from Landsat high spatial resolution data had detailed FPAR spatial distributions. The FPAR from MODIS had the highest temporal continuity. Further improvements of FPAR estimates could include the integration of FPAR across multiple scales.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the CO2 processes on land is of great importance, because the terrestrial exchange drives the seasonal and interannual variability of CO2 in the atmosphere. Atmospheric inversions based on CO2 concentration measurements alone can only determine net biosphere fluxes, but not differentiate between photosynthesis (uptake) and respiration (production). Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) could provide an important additional constraint: it is also taken up by plants during photosynthesis but not emitted during respiration, and therefore is a potential means to differentiate between these processes. Solar absorption Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometry allows for the retrieval of the atmospheric concentrations of both CO2 and OCS. Here, we investigate co-located and nearly simultaneous measurements of OCS and CO2 measured at 3 sites via FTIR spectrometers. These northern-hemispheric sites span a wide range of latitudes and all have multiple year time-series. The sites include Ny-Alesund (79°N), Bremen (53°N) and Paramaribo (6°N). We compare these measurements to simulations of OCS and CO2 using the GEOS-Chem model. The simulations are driven by different land biospheric fluxes of OCS and CO2 to match the seasonality of the measurements. The simple biosphere model (SiB-COS) are used in the study because it simultaneously calculates the biospheric fluxes of both OCS and CO2. The CO2 simulation with SiB fluxes agrees with the measurements better than a simulation using CASA. Comparison of the OCS simulations with different fluxes indicates that the latitudinal distribution of the OCS fluxes within SiB needs to be adjusted.",

            "abstract": "Planetary zonal flows can be probed in principle using the tools of helioseismology. We explore this technique using laboratory experiments where the measurement of zonal flows is also of geophysical relevance. The experiments are carried out in a device with a geometry similar to that of Earth's core. It consists of a 60 cm diameter outer spherical shell concentric with a 20 cm diameter inner sphere. Air between the inner sphere and outer shell is used as the working fluid. A turbulent shear flow is driven in the air by independently rotating the inner sphere and outer shell. Acoustic modes are excited in the vessel with a speaker, and microphones are used to measure the rotational splittings of these modes. The radial profile of azimuthal velocities is inferred from these splittings, in an approach analogous to that used in helioseismology to determine solar velocity profiles. By varying the inner and outer rotation rates, different turbulent states can be investigated. Comparison is made to previous experimental investigations of turbulent spherical Couette flow. These experiments also serve as a test of this diagnostic, which may be used in the future in liquid sodium experiments, providing information on zonal flows in hydromagnetic experiments.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and allocation of water supplies are causing water shortages and low flow conditions that threaten aquatic ecosystems around the world. Small mountain streams in Western Canada are experiencing increased water use from small diversion hydropower, increasing population, mining, agriculture, and changing energy extraction techniques. In addition, there are very few gauging sites for baseline water data because of the rugged mountain terrain and cold climate. Baseline data is important due to the sensitivity of small mountain streams to shifts in timing of snow pack melt and mid-winter melting, especially near and in coastal regions. Here we use HBV-EC to simulate the range in future flow in a northern mountain watershed under various climate scenarios and explore the uncertainty induced by different GMC models and downscaling for the Goathorn Creek watershed. To explore the effects of GCM model variability we selected four models (CGCM3, ECHAM5, GFDL-CM2.1, and CSIRO-Mk) and used the TreeGen downscaling method to generate multiple ensembles for emissions scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1) for each GCM model.\nThe calibrated HBV-EC model was sensitive to the climate inputs and produced a 50 percent variation in flows for the 2050’s and 2080’s with the greatest reduction in mean flows by 0.33 m3/s predicted for the 2020’s climate. Although, modeled future discharge is highly variable, some consistent trends are useful for water managers: results suggest spring discharge may occur up to two months earlier (CGCM3, A2 scenario), but was constantly one month earlier for all emission scenarios. This can lead to feasible management strategies such as granting fewer water permits or in areas with high future demand issuing permits with provisions for future storage.",

            "abstract": "The NSF-MARGINS Program funded a decade of research on continental margin processes. The NSF-GeoPRISMS Mini-lesson Project, funded by NSF-TUES, is designed to integrate the significant findings from the MARGINS program into open-source college-level curriculum. The Gulf of California (GOC) served as the focus site for the Rupturing Continental Lithosphere (RCL) initiative, which addressed several scientific questions: What forces drive rift initiation, localization, propagation and evolution? How does deformation vary in time and space, and why? How does crust evolve, physically and chemically, as rifting proceeds to sea-floor spreading? What is the role of sedimentation and magmatism in continental extension?\nWe developed two weeks of curriculum, including lectures, labs, and in-class activities that can be used as a whole or individually. This component of the curriculum introduces students to the Euler pole description of relative plate motion (RPM) by examining the tectonic interactions of the Baja California microplate and North American plate. The plate boundary varies in rift obliquity along strike, from highly oblique and strike-slip dominated in the south to slightly less oblique and with a larger extensional component in the north. This Google Earth-based exercise provides students with a visualization of RPM using small circle contours of the local direction and magnitude of Baja-North America movement on a spherical Earth. Students use RPM to calculate the fault slip rates on transform, normal, and oblique-slip faults and examine how the varying faulting styles combine to accommodate RPM. MARGINS results are integrated via comparison of rift obliquity with the structural style of rift-related faults around the GOC. We find this exercise to fit naturally into courses about plate tectonics, geophysics, and especially structural geology, given the similarity between Euler pole rotations and stereonet-based rotations of structural data.",

            "abstract": "High-latitude blocking (HLB) located near and west of Greenland and in northeastern Siberia is a process that links Arctic processes to mid-latitude weather. HLB lies north of the jet stream and tends to bifurcate or divert the jet stream southward, rather than providing a complete block to the westerly flow. It is differentiated from mid-latitude blocking located in the central Atlantic to Europe and the western Pacific along eddy-driven jet streams. It is important to identify and understand an increase in recent HLB in early winter during the last five years relative to time series since 1948, even though this length is too short to robustly distinguish the influence of Arctic forcing from random events. In the last five early winters (December-January 2009-10 through 2013-14), two record and four other negative Arctic Oscillation atmospheric circulation index events have been observed, with positive Greenland Blocking Indices (GBI, greater 500 hPa geopotential heights) and increased geopotential thickness west of Greenland. Cold air penetrated into the southeastern United States in December 2009 and 2010 and January 2014 related to amplification in the long-wave upper-level atmospheric wind pattern. Northward air flow over Davis Strait acts as a positive feedback to maintain the Greenland air temperature anomalies. Extreme negative GBI were observed in December 2011-January 2012. Increased thickness associated with positive GBI can be a response to external (local sea ice loss, Greenland surface warming, or even equatorial teleconnections) or internal (advection and orientation of the long wave patterns) processes. A similar blocking feature is observed in Siberia/eastern Asia. A Bayesian approach to an Arctic/mid-latitude weather linkage emphasizes the nearly irresolvable uncertainty surrounding causation of recent major weather events; yet it drives scientific understanding of linkages and potential impacts on seasonal forecasting.",

            "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) offers a quantitative approach for comparison of topographic profiles. We have previously compared simple shapes of topographic profiles of rifts and uplifts on Venus and Earth. Although yielding some interesting results, these studies were more qualitative than quantitative. We address this by applying PCA to sets of topographic profiles on the two planets. Doing so yields not only groupings of like features in what we call “PC-space,\" but also the actual shapes of principal component profiles. PC-space consists of a modified ternary diagram showing the relative contributions of the three strongest principal components derived from a particular data set. The first PC profile generally shows a simple broad uplift, while profiles 2 and 3 display more complexity, which we attribute to lithospheric response to loading. Regardless of size of data set, the top three components account for about 95% of the shape of a feature’s profile, so we concentrate our analysis on these three components.\nWe first look at a data set with several forms of uplift – mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts, and continental and oceanic hotspots on Earth, and chasmata and regiones from Venus. Subsets based on the groupings from this original data set are examined. Specifically, the hotspot data set is tested looking at potential differences between oceanic and continental, and Types 1, 2, and 3 as defined by Courtillot. We look for correlations between terrestrial features and venusian chasmata and regiones. The effect of spreading rate on mid-ocean ridge topography is examined and compared to chasmata.",

            "abstract": "Impacts on global food supply are one of the most important concerns in the discussion of stratospheric sulfate geoengineering. Stratospheric sulfate injection could reduce surface temperature, precipitation, and insolation, which could affect agricultural production. We use output from climate model simulations using the two most “realistic” scenarios from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, G3 and G4. G3 posits balancing the increasing radiative forcing from the RCP4.5 business-as-usual scenario with stratospheric sulfate aerosols from 2020 through 2070. The G4 scenario also uses RCP4.5, but models simulate the stratospheric injection of 5 Tg SO2 per year from 2020 to 2070. In total, there are three modeling groups which have completed G3 and four for G4. We use two crop models, the global gridded Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (gDSSAT) crop model and the crop model in the NCAR Community Land Model (CLM-crop), to predict global maize yield changes. Without changing agricultural technology, we find that compared to the reference run forced by the RCP4.5 scenario, maize yields could increase in both G3 and G4 due to both the cooling effect of stratospheric sulfate injection and the CO2 fertilization effect, with the cooling effect contributing more to the increased productivity. However, the maize yield changes are not much larger than natural variability under G3, since the temperature reduction is smaller in G3 than in G4. Both crop models show similar results.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation plays a crucial role in determining active layer depth (ALD) and hence also the extent that permafrost may thaw under climate change. Such influences are multifaceted and include, for example, promotion of shallow ALD by insulation from moss or shading by plant canopies in summer, or trapping of snow in evergreen tree canopies that reduces snow insulation of soil in winter. However, while the role of different vegetation components are understood at a conceptual level, quantitative understanding of the relative importance of different vegetation components and how they interact to determine active layer depth is lacking. In addition, major abiotic factors such as fire and soil hydrological properties will considerably influence the role of vegetation in mediating ALD, though again this is not well understood.\nTo address this we surveyed multiple plots across 4 sites of contrasting vegetation and fire status, including a range of soil moisture and organic matter thickness, in the discontinuous permafrost zone near Yellowknife, NT, Canada. In each plot we measured ALD and a range of vegetation and soil parameters to understand how key characteristics of the understory and canopy vegetation, and soil properties influence ALD. Measurements included moss depth, tree canopy LAI, understory LAI, understory height, vegetation composition, soil organic matter depth, slope and soil moisture. By undertaking these surveys in sites with contrasting hydrological conditions in both burned and unburned areas we have also been able to determine which characteristics of the vegetation and soil are important for protecting permafrost, which characteristics emerge as the most important factors across sites (i.e. irrespective of site conditions) and which factors have site (ecosystem) specific influences. This work provides a major insight into how ecosystem properties influence ALD and therefore also how changes in ecosystems properties arising from climate change may influence ALD and permafrost thaw.",

            "abstract": "In many regions of the worlds, studies of past hydrological variability have to rely on hydrological models either because river gauge measurement is not available or because measurements do not reflect the natural flow due to water diversion or reservoir regulation. However, results from these studies are subject to major uncertainty related to the challenges in quantifying vegetation conditions and evapotranspiration, both of which are important for surface water and energy budgets. This study incorporates satellite remote sensing data for ET and vegetation into the VIC model to improve the model performance in simulating the surface water budget, hydrological seasonality, and timing of hydrological extremes. Using the Connecticut River Basin as an example, and driven with the NASA NLDAS-2 meteorological forcing data, the VIC model has been modified to read in LAI and ET data derived from MODIS among others. The MODIS LAI data provides VIC with the inter-annually varying seasonal cycle of vegetation, and the MODIS ET data replaces the model simulated ET. The data-enhanced model performs significantly better in simulating river discharge, its magnitude, seasonality, timing, soil moisture and its temporal variation. Incorporation of the ET data led to an increase of stream flow correlations between model and observations on the daily and biweekly temporal scales, and the seasonality is better represented on a monthly scale with particular magnitude improvements during the summer when ET is greatest. Incorporation of the LAI data led to improved simulation of inter-annual variability. This joint application of remote sensing and modeling helps quantify the extent to which remote sensing data improves model performance, facilitates a more accurate understanding and attribution of past hydrological variability/changes, and helps characterize the range of model-related uncertainties in future predictions.",

            "abstract": "Sudden Commencements (SCs) have been defined as rapid changes in Earth’s geomagnetic field in response to solar wind drivers such as shocks in the solar wind. SC’s can be further classified as those that are followed by geomagnetic storms, Storm Sudden Commencements (SSC’s), or those that are not followed by storms, Sudden Impulses (SI’s). In this work we concentrate on the general class of SC’s observed in ground-based magnetometer data that can sometimes provide forecasters with a useful indication of an impending geomagnetic storm. We have created a real-time, computationally inexpensive algorithm that assimilates magnetic field data across a wide range of geomagnetic longitudes to identify an SC. In addition to describing this technique, and potential future improvements, we use the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy’s (IAGA’s) non-real-time SC event lists as truth for a quantitative assessment of our algorithm’s performance. We compare the IAGA lists of SC’s to current Space Weather Prediction Center forecaster performance as well as the performance obtained with an automated legacy approach developed by Joselyn (1985). Given observations from ground stations well distributed in geomagnetic longitude, the results demonstrate skill scores comparable to forecasters. We argue that forecasters could use these results, in conjunction with additional information that this algorithm does not currently consider (i.e. data from L1), to improve on current warnings and notifications of SCs and geomagnetic storms.",

The campaign’s goal is to design, implement, and study the efficacy of an OHMM model for free choice science learning about our changing climate. Subway riders represent a diverse and captive audience with most of them spending an average of one hour a day in the subway system. Through the use of specially designed OHMM such as train placards, platform posters, and virtual resources the campaign engages a potential audience of 500,000 riders/day with opportunities to learn climate change science informally.\nThe primary goal of the ScienceToGo.org campaign is to engage, entertain, and educate the adult subway riding community in major U.S. city about climate change as a real, relevant, and solvable local challenge. A naturalistic quasi-experimental inquiry employing a mixed methodology approach best describes our research design with half of the subway system exposed to the project signage (experimental group) and the other half not being exposed to the project signage (control group). To identify possible outcomes, data was collected in the several forms: survey, analytic data associated with website, social media, web app, focus groups, and observations. This campaign is an example of how an individual’s daily routine may be enhanced with an informal science learning opportunity.\nWe see an urgent need to improve both the public’s engagement with climate change science and to the profile of climate change science in formal education settings. The campaign makes deliberate use of humor and fun to engage a public and diverse audience with the serious issue of climate change. The research that will be presented will reveal some of the strengths and weaknesses of this strategy when communicating science to a diverse audience. Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates that humor and fun are effective at engaging riders on mass transit. Mass transit spaces represent a promsing medium for further exploration and development when it comes to informal learning about climate change science.",

            "abstract": "The chemical composition of seawater depends on the sources and sinks of the constituent elements, including those derived from continental weathering and transported by rivers. Glacial melt rivers compose a significant percentage of contributing water in the high latitudes, and potentially impact the overall composition of seawater. The magnitude of the chemical changes glacial melt can have on adjacent seawater depends on the composition of glacial melt, which is directly influenced by the subglacial residence time of meltwater. Long residence times correlate to subglacial water with both high cation concentrations and 234U/238U isotopic compositions. Thus, the residence time of subglacial water and corresponding subglacial geochemistry impacts the 234U/238U composition of proximal seawater and potentially global seawater.\nTo test the influence of subglacial water residence times on seawater chemistry we examined the U-series composition of four outlet glaciers directly connected to the Southern Greenland Ice Sheet located near Narsarsuaq, Ilulissat, Nuuk and Kulusuk, and adjacent seawater at each site. All outlet glaciers in this study are located within three of the five primary drainage basins beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet, each in varying stages of subglacial hydrologic evolution, resulting in unique chemical compositions of meltwater draining from each location. At these four locations we found subglacial water residence time values of 10-1000 years. In regions where the U concentration, 234U/238U isotopic composition and residence times were high (1.01 ppb, 1.263 and ~1,000 years in Narsarsuaq) the adjacent seawater 234U/238U composition was elevated (1.152) compared to regions where the U concentration, 234U/238U isotopic composition and residence times were low (0.05 ppb, 1.008 and ~10 years in Illulisat) the adjacent seawater 234U/238U composition remained around the assumed seawater average (1.145).\nThrough this study we observed a direct impact of Greenland Ice Sheet outlet glacier subglacial residence times on adjacent seawater 234U/238U compositions suggesting that large ice sheet changes on glacial/inter-glacial timescales may have a larger impact on mean seawater 234U/238U compositions than previously hypothesized.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the history of ecosystem ecology many attempts have been made to develop a general principle governing how systems develop and organize. We reviewed the historical developments that led to conceptualization of several goal-oriented principles in ecosystem ecology and the relationships among them. We focused our review on two prominent principles—the Maximum Power Principle and the Maximum Entropy Production Principle—and the literature that applies to both. While these principles have considerable conceptual overlap and both use concepts in physics (power and entropy), we found considerable differences in their historical development, the disciplines that apply these principles, and their adoption in the literature. We reviewed the literature using Web of Science keyword searches for the MPP, the MEPP, as well as for papers that cited pioneers in the MPP and the MEPP development. From the 6000 papers that our keyword searches returned, we limited our further meta-analysis to 32 papers by focusing on studies with a foundation in ecosystems research. Despite these seemingly disparate pasts, we concluded that the conceptual approaches of these two principles were more similar than dissimilar and that maximization of power in ecosystems occurs with maximum entropy production. We also found that these two principles have great potential to explain how systems develop, organize, and function, but there are no widely agreed upon theoretical derivations for the MEPP or the MPP, possibly hindering their broader use in ecological research. We end with recommendations for how ecosystems-level studies may better use these principles.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologists and water resource engineers are simulating hydrologic processes at the continental scale assisted by the advancement of high-performance computing and the accessibility of large-scale climate and hydrologic datasets. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is developing a National Hydrologic Model (NHM) that supports coordinated, comprehensive, and consistent hydrologic model development and simulations of the conterminous United States (CONUS). The goal of this project is to improve model parameterization and ultimately streamflow predictions across the CONUS using remotely sensed data products. The current work will specifically improve estimates of the growing season in the NHM through the integration of satellite-based phenology products developed at the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. Currently, the NHM defines the growing season using one of three temperature-index methods: 1) first and last freezing air temperatures; 2) temperature threshold for a specified begin and end month; and 3) dynamic specification. The USGS/EROS RSP products are based on a timeseries analysis of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors. Using the phenological metrics derived from AVHRR, we define a new growing season parameter set for the CONUS from 1989 to 2013, which ultimately will enhance estimations of daily transpiration rates throughout the model domain. Using default temperature-index based estimates of growing season and RSP derived estimates, we provide statistical evaluation and comparison of the NHM simulations related to growing season. The RSP growing season dates may improve model hydrologic simulations especially in drought periods when water availability, demand, and usage are critical, or in areas where the temperature-index based growing season estimates lack skill, such as some California grasslands which have winter growing seasons.",

            "abstract": "Shale gas production forms an increasing fraction of domestic US energy supplies, but individual gas production wells show steep production declines. Better understanding of this production decline would allow better economic forecasting; better understanding of the reasons behind the decline would allow better production management. Yet despite these incentives, production declines curves remain poorly understood, and current analyses range from Arps’ purely empirical equation to new sophisticated approaches requiring multiple unavailable parameters. Models often fail to capture salient features: for example, in log-log space many wells decline with an exponent markedly different from the -0.5 expected from diffusion, and often show a transition from one decline mode to another. We propose a new approach based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step is gas movement from the matrix to the induced fracture network. The matrix is represented as an assemblage of equivalent spheres (geometry), with low matrix pore connectivity (topology) that results in a distance-dependent accessible porosity profile given by percolation theory. The basic theory has just 2 parameters: the sphere size distribution (geometry), and the crossover distance (topology) that characterizes the porosity distribution. The theory is readily extended to include e.g. alternative geometries and bi-modal size distributions. Comparisons with historical data are promising.",

Spreading is asymmetric, and spreading west of the ridge is dominated by detachment faulting that result in oceanic core complexes with exposed mantle and lower crust. Samples were collected by dredging during the R/V Knorr 205 expedition in the spring of 2013. Samples are from a 60 km by 40 km area, mainly from the west side of the spreading axis. Major and trace element data were obtained by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) on approximately 100 basaltic samples. MORB range in Na2O from 2.5-3.3 wt%, FeO from 8.3-12.8 wt%, SiO2 from 45-52 wt%, TiO2 from 1.0-2.2 wt% at 8 wt% MgO, [La/Yb]C1 values ranging from 0.6 to 2.3 and [La/Sm]C1 values range from 0.55-1.35. The majority of the analyzed samples are LREE enriched. K2O/TiO2 ranges from 0.07 to 0.41 at 8 wt% MgO. Most dredges are relatively uniform in composition, and a few dredges show both LREE enriched and LREE depleted patterns.\nIn contrast to the enriched trace element nature of the basalts, the isotopic compositions fall towards the depleted end of the MORB range with 87Sr/86Sr between 0.70234 and 0.70276, εNd between 8.6 and 11.3, εHf between 15.9 and 19.5 and 206Pb/204Pb ranging from 18.16 to 18.96. These isotopic compositions are among the most depleted in the Atlantic. Trace elements and isotopes are generally correlated with the most incompatible enriched basalts, having the radiogenic Sr and Pb isotopes and unradiogenic Nd and Hf.\nCompared to the asymmetric spreading segment at 13.3°N on the mid Atlantic Ridge (Wilson et al., 2013), the LIL enrichments at 16.5°N are not as strong, and the isotopic compositions are more depleted. We propose that the observed incompatible element enrichments are a direct effect of low extents of melting of the depleted mantle, in agreement with the observed morphology and geology of the segment.\n",

            "abstract": "The ice shelves and glaciers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) are rapidly thinning, especially in the Amundsen Sea (AS) and Bellingshausen Sea (BS). The high basal melting of these small ice shelves is caused by relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) that, based on observations, mainly intrudes via two submarine glacial troughs located at the eastern and central AS continental shelf break. When CDW reaches the grounding line of the fringing glaciers, it melts the glaciers and forms buoyant melt water plumes. As the glacial melt becomes part of the AS shelf circulation, it may cause a freshening of the shelf water locally as well as remotely in the Ross Sea (RS). To test whether the observed freshening of the RS is a consequence of the enhanced basal melting of AS ice shelves, we use Finite-Element Sea-ice/ice-shelf/Ocean Model (FESOM) with a horizontal resolution of 2-10 km on the AS and BS continental shelves. The model is forced with 6-hourly atmospheric data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP-CFSR) for the period 1979-1988. The model results show bottom temperatures in the AS and BS close to observations, and basal melt rates of AS and BS ice shelves consistent with other observation-based estimates. Using several independent virtual passive tracers to identify pathways of the glacial melt, we find that the melt water from the ice shelves in the AS flows towards the Ross Ice Shelf front. After 10 years of simulation, about half of the melt water in the Ross Sea originates from the Getz Ice Shelf. Further, we investigate the sensitivity of the melt water transport into the RS associated with the strength of the basal melt water flux. When this flux is increased by 30%, the transport of glacial melt into the RS more than doubles, supporting the idea that the basal melting of AS and BS ice shelves is one of the main reasons for the freshening of the RS continental shelf.",

            "abstract": "Solute transport in rock subsurface is important in a number of applications such as contaminant hydrology, carbon storage and enhanced oil recovery. Carbonate rock contain most of the world’s oil reserves and potentially hold a storage capacity for carbon dioxide. Pore structure in carbonate rock introduces an additional complexity in the form of bimodal pore size distributions, which leads to complex anomalous transport behavior and poses a significant challenge for accurate predictions.\nWe present a new modeling concept that simulates flow and transport on micro-CT images containing the information on inter- and intra-grain pore space of carbonate rock. Navier-Stokes equations are solved for flow in the image voxels comprising the pore space, streamline-based simulation is used to account for advection, and diffusion is superimposed by random walk.\nFirstly, the model is validated against the experimental NMR measurements in the dual porosity beadpack. Furthermore, the model predictions are made for a number of carbonate rock images which are then classified in terms of heterogeneity of the inter- and intra-grain pore space, heterogeneity in the flow field, and the mass transfer characteristics of the porous media. Finally, we demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the model through an analysis that includes a number of probability density functions (PDFs) measures of non-Fickian transport on the micro-CT images.",

            "abstract": "Most general circulation models (GCMs) exhibit a low bias in cloud cover in the southern oceans, which has a significant impact on the amount of absorbed solar radiation. This, in turn, has been proposed to affect various aspects of the global climate, for example excess in southern hemisphere tropical precipitation, also known as the double inter-tropical convergence zone problem. The southern oceans are strongly influenced by extratropical cyclones, and it was found that the cold sector of these cyclones is one area where models, including reanalyses, do not produce enough clouds.\nBy combining multiple NASA A-train and Terra observations of cloud properties, precipitation, water vapor, temperatures and winds, we explore the processes that produce clouds in midlatitude cyclones. We divide the cyclones into their different sectors and explore the dominant cloud types and their relation with the environment using compositing techniques. For this we use a cyclone database and two different algorithms to detect cold and warm fronts in order to delineate the different sectors of the cyclones. We use the same techniques to analyze model outputs, so we can directly compare observations and models.\nWe will present results on the mechanisms that control cloud production in the post cold frontal region of the extratropical cyclones. By using both passive and active observations, we are able to provide a three dimensional view of these mechanisms. With these results, we then test two GCMs, one that underestimates southern hemisphere clouds and the other that overestimates cloud amounts in this region. We will show how the convection and planetary boundary layer parameterizations and the lower tropospheric moist stability interact and provide a key indicator of GCM post-frontal cloud content in these storms.",

Carr.) near the southern limit of its range, tests the stability of its climate-tree relations over the last few decades, and explores its potential as a hydroclimatic proxy for Crater Lake National Park. We collected tree cores at seven locations around the caldera rim, focusing on hemlock growing at higher elevations (2000-2400 masl). The median length of all ring-width series is 283 years, and the oldest hemlock sample extends back to C.E. 1450. Several types of anatomical anomalies, including frost rings, traumatic resin ducts, false rings, and light late-wood bands were observed within the specimens, the most common feature being a false ring in C.E. 1810. Each set of standardized ring-width measurements has a strong common signal, with between-tree correlations (r-bar) ranging from 0.31 to 0.49. Preliminary analysis suggests hemlock growth across the park is strongly and inversely related to total cool-season precipitation, and is also influenced positively (albeit more weakly) by mean summer temperature. Most sites are significantly and negatively correlated with total December-to-February precipitation (r = -0.41) and total precipitation from December to August (r = -0.48). Compared to other ring-width records exhibiting similar negative responses to winter precipitation, these hemlocks appear to track that specific signal quite clearly and, as a result, these data may be suitable to reconstruct past changes in cool-season moisture in Crater Lake National Park and across the broader southern Cascades.",

We found that peak emissions were coming from two spatially distinct sites in HXR and MW, and in HXR we observed a sudden change between these sites over the second and the third peak.

            "abstract": "The U.S. generates 21 billion barrels/year of coproduced water from oil and gas exploration, which is generally considered waste water. Growth in unconventional oil and gas production has spurred interest in beneficial uses of produced water, especially in arid regions such as the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. tight oil producer. Produced waters have variable chemistries, but generally contain high levels of organics and salts. In order to evaluate the environmental impact, treatment, and reuse potential, there is a need to characterize the compositional variability of produced water.\nIn the present study, produced water samples were collected from 12 wells across the Permian Basin. Compositional analyses including coupled gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy were conducted. The samples show elevated benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylene, alkyl benzenes, propyl-benzene, and naphthalene compared to other heteroaromatics; they also contain complex hydrocarbon compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Van Krevelen diagrams show an increase in the concentration of heteroaromatic hydrocarbons with increasing well depth. The salinity, dominated by sodium-chloride, also increases with depth, ranging from 37-150 g/L TDS. Depth of wells (or producing formation) is a primary control on predicting water quality for treatment and beneficial use. Our results suggest that partial treatment by removing suspended solids and organic contaminants would support some beneficial uses such as onsite reuse, bioenergy production, and other industrial uses. Due to the high salinity, conventional desalination processes are not applicable or very costly, making beneficial uses requiring low salinity not feasible.",

This study shows that positive definite variables, specifically water vapor mixing ratio and temperature, can follow a non-Gaussian distribution and moreover a lognormal distribution. The analyzed 1-degree resolution data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Global Forecast System (GFS) hour zero forecast between January 2, 2005 and December 31, 2005. The data is analyzed spatially and temporally in a seasonal and yearly manner. Results show seasonal shifts in distributions in the Gulf of Mexico and changes when considered over the entire year in the Northern Hemisphere tropical Atlantic. The results are achieved by employing statistical testing procedures which include the Jarque-Bera test, the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, and a composite test which incorporates the results of the former tests. These results indicate the necessity of a Data Assimilation (DA) system to be able to properly use the lognormally-distributed variables in an appropriate Bayesian analysis that does not assume the variables are Gaussian.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds significantly impact the radiative and transport processes of the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. State-of-the-art global models parameterize the formation of cirrus explicitly linking ice nucleation events to the aerosol properties and the cloud-scale dynamics. However most GCMs cannot resolve the scale at which cloud formation occurs. Thus subgrid scale dynamics is typically parameterized by relating the vertical velocity variance, σw, to grid-scale fields. These parameterizations are typically validated against field campaign data for specific locations. However an assessment of the global spatial distribution of σw is lacking, limiting the ability of GCMs to describe cirrus formation. Here the non-hydrostatic version of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System model (GEOS-5) is used to estimate the variance of vertical velocity in GCMs. GEOS-5 was run at cloud-resolving resolutions (~7 km), allowing the explicit calculation of σw. Our results indicate that σw is determined by orographic drag and local convection, and higher over the continents than over the ocean. A recently developed parameterization of σw is also evaluated. Compared to the model results the parameterization is able to reproduce the global distribution of σw for warm cirrus clouds but tends to overestimate σw near the tropopause. Our work provides for the first time an assessment of the global variability in the subgrid scale dynamics leading to the formation of cirrus.",

            "abstract": "The influence of ice-sheet retreat on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability is studied using a transient simulation in NCAR-CCSM3 forced only by the variations of continental ice sheets during the last deglaciation. The most striking feature is an abrupt strengthening of ENSO (by ~25%) at 14 ka BP in response to a significant retreat (an equivalent ~25 m sea-level rise) of the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS). This abrupt intensification of ENSO is caused mainly by a sudden reduction of the equatorial annual cycle through the nonlinear mechanism of frequency entrainment, rathe­­r than by the change in the large-scale tropical coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks (thermodynamic and mean advection dampings, the thermocline, the zonal advection and the Ekman upwelling feekbacks). The decrease of the annual cycle is a result of the reduction of the cross-equatorial SST contrast in the eastern Pacific. The more symmetric SST about the equator can be achieved predominantly by the anomalous easterly from abrupt polarward shift of jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), which propagates to tropical northeastern Pacific Ocean surface and is then reinforced by Wind-Evaporation-SST feedback. The fast sea-ice expansion in the NH induced by ice-sheet retreat could be another factor that contributes to the reduction of the cross-equatorial SST contrast and the intensification of ENSO.",

            "abstract": "It is still disputed topic on subduction history of the Neo-Tethys in the south Tibet. Aitchison et al. ( J. Geol. 2007, 115, 197–213) and Jain (Current Science, 2014, 106, 254-266) suggested that the there was a Jurassic intra-oceanic arc developed within the Neo-Tethys. However, Zhang et al. (JAES, 2013, 80, 34–55) documented that this arc should be a continental margin arc. Present study reports new geochronology and geochemistry of the Sangri Group volcanic rocks which has been believed to be typical products of the Neo-Tethys subduction in the south Tibet. The Sangri Group volcanic rocks are distributed along the southern edge of the Lhasa Terrane on the northern side of the Indus-Yarlung Zangbo suture zone. It consists of the Mamuxia and Bima formations and has long been considered to be Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous in age. We have obtained for the first time zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb ages for the Bima Formation volcanic rocks in Sangri County, Tibet. Two samples yield zircon U-Pb ages of 195 ± 3 Ma and 189 ± 3 Ma, respectively. These data suggest that the volcanic rocks formed during the Early Jurassic and not the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous as previously reported. The volcanic rocks of the Bima Formation are composed dominantly of basalt and andesite enriched in LILEs and LREEs and depleted in HFSEs, showing typical characteristics of arc volcanic rocks. They also show positive εNd (t) (3.19-7.02) values and low initial 87Sr/86Sr (0.703182-0.705489) ratios, similar to the MORB of the Indus-Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites, indicating that the volcanic rocks were derived from a depleted mantle wedge. The magmas of the Bima Formation volcanic rocks were thus generated by the northward subduction of Neo-Tethys as early as 195 Ma. Considering they were coeval with Late Triassic-Early Jurassic felsic intrusions within the Gangdese arc, we conclude two possibilities of the early Jurassic magmatic arc: (1) it was initiated at a juvenile continental margin arc during Late Triassic-Early Jurassic, (2) Sangri group volcanic rocks represented a remnant of an intra-oceanic arc in the Tethyan system, then emplaced into the southern margin of Lhasa terrane. Here we favor the second possibility but further investigation is necessary.",

Recent deployments of dense networks of seismometers enable subspace detection methods to be more broadly applied to intraplate Antarctica, where historically very limited and sporadic network coverage has inhibited understanding of dynamic glacial, volcanic, and tectonic processes. In particular, recent broad seismographic networks such as POLENET/A-Net and AGAP provide significant new opportunities for characterizing and understanding the low seismicity rates of this continent. Our methodology incorporates three-component correlation to detect events in a statistical and adaptive framework. Detection thresholds are statistically assessed using phase-randomized template correlation levels. As new events are detected and the set of subspace basis vectors is updated, the algorithm can also be directed to scan back in a search for weaker prior events that have significant correlations with the updated basis vectors. This method has the resolving power to identify previously undetected areas of seismic activity under very low signal-to-noise conditions, and thus holds promise for revealing new seismogenic phenomena within and around Antarctica. In this study we investigate two intriguing seismogenic regions and demonstrate the methodology, reporting on a subspace detection-based study of recently identified clusters of deep long-period magmatic earthquakes in Marie Byrd Land, and on shallow icequakes that are dynamically triggered by teleseismic surface waves.",

            "abstract": "After passing through Dingo Gap, Curiosity turned south and explored the Kylie outcrop on sols 550 to 555. Kylie is topographically higher (by ~10 meters) than the Kimberley located ~300 m to the south, and shares the same succession of geomorphic units identified in satellite images. Thus, in situ observations at Kylie provided context for the subsequent drilling campaign at the Kimberley. Additionally, comparisons of the stratigraphy exposed at Kylie with stratigraphic sections observed at other locations along the traverse (including Darwin, Cooperstown, and Dingo Gap) enable regional correlations and the development of working hypotheses for the former depositional environments.\nThe sedimentary facies exposed at Kylie include pebble-rich conglomerates and sandstones that vary in bedding orientation and stratification. Exposed on the basin walls is a fining upward stratigraphic succession with a basal pebble conglomerate, flat-bedded sandstone, and a resistant, dark-grey massive to crudely stratified sandstone capping facies. The conglomerate facies forms a prominent bench that rims the western side of the basin. ChemCam data indicate that the pebble-rich conglomerates have mafic and felsic elements and appear similar in composition to the conglomerates previously encountered during the mission. Within the basin, the sedimentary deposits appear to drape pre-existing topography. The most voluminous facies has decimeter-thick south-dipping beds of cross-bedded sandstone that correspond to distinct NE-SW trending linear bands in orbital images. In the southern portion of the basin, these south-dipping cross-bedded sandstones are overlain by thin-bedded, sub-meter cross-bedded sandstone and a poorly exposed, scree-covered butte forming facies. The Kylie deposits are consistent with a complex scenario of dominantly fluvial activity, although the nature and magnitude of flows is still being investigated.",

            "abstract": "Subspace detection is a powerful and adaptive tool for continuously detecting low signal to noise seismic signals. Subspace detectors improve upon simple cross-correlation/matched filtering techniques by moving beyond the use of a single waveform template to the use of multiple orthogonal waveform templates that effectively span the signals from all previously identified events within a data set. Subspace detectors are particularly useful in event scenarios where a spatially limited source distribution produces earthquakes with highly similar waveforms. In this context, the methodology has been successfully deployed to identify low-frequency earthquakes within non-volcanic tremor, to characterize earthquakes swarms above magma bodies, and for detailed characterization of aftershock sequences. Here we apply a subspace detection methodology to characterize recent earthquakes clusters in Oklahoma. Since 2009, the state has experienced an unprecedented increase in seismicity, which has been attributed by others to recent expansion in deep wastewater injection well activity. Within the last few years, 99% of increased Oklahoma earthquake activity has occurred within 15 km of a Class II injection well. We analyze areas of dense seismic activity in central Oklahoma and construct more complete catalogues for analysis. For a typical cluster, we are able to achieve catalog completeness to near or below magnitude 1 and to continuously document seismic activity for periods of 6 months or more. Our catalog can more completely characterize these clusters in time and space with event numbers, magnitudes, b-values, energy, locations, etc. This detailed examination of swarm events should lead to a better understanding of time varying earthquake processes and hazards in the state of Oklahoma.",

            "abstract": "There have been two major fires in the Valles Caldera, located in the Jemez Mountains of Northern New Mexico, within the last three years: the Thompson Ridge fire (June 2013) and the Las Conchas fire (July 2011). During forest fires, contaminants are released from the incomplete combustion of organic matter, from mineral assemblages of the natural soil, and from pre-existing contaminants that have accumulated in biomass and soils. The transport and sequestration of these contaminants is an important factor in determining environmental soil and water quality following fires. Soils containing black carbon (BC) have high sorption capacities for certain contaminants due to its high surface area and cation exchange capacity.\nThe purpose of this project is to quantify the sorption properties of pyrogenic black carbon (PyC), or black carbon formed after the incomplete combustion of organic carbon during forest fires, and soils found in recently burned areas of Northern NM and to determine the environmental impact of soils containing PyC. We used batch equilibrium experiments to determine the sorption properties of BC for selected metals (chromium, lead, and arsenic). Samples tested include naturally occurring soils, concentrated PyC, mixtures of soil and PyC, industrial BC, and a control with low carbon and sorption.\nContaminant concentrations were also measured from the soils sampled in the field site. Preliminary results suggest that industrial BC has the highest sorption capacity for heavy metals and the quickest time to equilibrium. As PyC concentrations in the soil increase, sorption capacity is expected to increase. With complete results, the environmental significance of black carbon in the soil, including how PyC affects the transport of solutes in soils, will be evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field causes channeling of the flow field. Flux concentrates along the paths of the smallest resistance and organizes a network of channels. These channels govern the effective flux through the domain and the fastest Darcy velocities that manages the first arrival times of the contamination. The smallest resistance of such paths is a crucial property for estimation of the flow and transport effective parameters.\nWe developed a methodology to delineate a backbone – a connected set of paths of the smallest resistance – from hydraulic conductivity field only with no flow and transport simulation. From the backbone delineation procedure it is also possible to derive the smallest resistance and number of channels with comparable resistances or evaluate the network structure that can be topologically complex because the channels may split or merge. The thickness of the channels is usually related to the correlation length of the hydraulic conductivity field. These parameters provide an effective estimation of the effective hydraulic conductivity for highly heterogeneous fields where the flow channeling is significant. The path of the smallest resistance also provides the fastest flux and thus is responsible for the first arrival of the contamination.\nIn the current work we present a methodology of backbone delineation, calculation of the smallest resistance and evaluation of the effective parameters and compare the results with effective parameters obtained from direct flow and transport simulation within highly heterogeneous fields with different connectivity. The approach proposed demonstrated a sufficient accuracy of prediction and may be used for a block up-scaling of flow and some parameters of transport in highly heterogeneous media.",

In an effort to understand and monitor how soil moisture effects yields, we used probe data to detect these fluctuations, and relate this variability to satellite derived wetness values. The soil moisture observations provided by probes measurements serve as calibration points to the satellite measurements. The regression equations derived from these relationships, identify the covariance between the quantities. Many of the relationships between the probe data and wetness index were meaningful, and can be used to effectively identify how upper level moisture fluctuates in Northern Kazakhstan during the important period of wheat production. The slope and intercepts of the equations determine the ratio between the two measurements, and the intercept identifies when the soil is effectively dry, relative to the satellite observation. Generally, there were two unique relationships, one for the summer season (June, July and August) and one for May, when there was nominal vegetation covering the surface. Findings from this study were highly significant and can be applied in near real time, in order to monitor the distribution of upper level soil moisture across the northern oblasts of Kazakhstan, where the production of wheat is critical to food security in central Asia.",

            "abstract": "This study investigated a natural analogue for CO2 leakage near the Green River, Utah, aiming to understand the influence of various factors on CO2 leakage and to reliably predict underground CO2 behavior after injection for geologic CO2 sequestration. Advective, diffusive, and eruptive characteristics of CO2 leakage were assessed via a soil CO2 flux survey and numerical modeling. The field results show anomalous CO2 fluxes (> 10 g m-2 d-1) along the faults, particularly adjacent to CO2-driven cold springs and geysers (e.g., 36,259 g m-2 d-1 at Crystal Geyser), ancient travertines (e.g., 5,917 g m-2 d-1), joint zones in sandstone (e.g., 120 g m-2 d-1), and brine discharge zones (e.g., 5,515 g m-2 d-1). Combined to similar isotopic ratios of gas and progressive evolution of brine chemistry at springs and geysers, a gradual decrease of soil CO2 flux from the Little Grand Wash (LGW; ~36,259 g m-2 d-1) to Salt Wash (SW; ~1,428 g m-2 d-1) fault zones reveals the same CO2 origin and potential southward transport of CO2 over 10-20 km. The numerical simulations overtly exhibit lateral transport of free CO2 and CO2-rich brine from the LGW to SW fault zones through the regional aquifers (e.g., Entrada, Navajo, Kayenta, Wingate, White Rim). CO2 travels predominantly as an aqueous phase (Xco2=~0.045) as previously suggested, giving rise to the convective instability that further accelerates CO2 dissolution. While the buoyant free CO2 always tends to ascend, a fraction of dense CO2-rich brine flows laterally into the aquifer and mixes with the formation fluids during upward migration along the fault. The fault always enhances advective CO2 transport regardless of its permeability (k). However, only the low-k fault scenario engenders development of CO2 anticlinal trap within the shallow aquifers (Entrada and Navajo), concentrating high CO­­­2 fluxes (~1,273 g m-2 d-1) within the northern footwall of the LGW fault similar to the field. Moreover, eruptive CO2 leakage at a well (Crystal Geyser) solely appears under the presence of anticlinal trap. Thus, it can be concluded that the LGW fault is likely low-permeable, 0.01 md ≤ kh <0.1 md and 0.5 md ≤ kv < 1 md, which could be used as a good starting point for other studies and further improved.",

The first discovery of CDA related to Saturn was the measurement of nanometer sized dust particles ejected by to interplanetary space with speeds higher than 100 km/s. Their origin and composition was analysed and and their dynamical studies showed a strong link to the conditions of the solar wind plasma flow. A recent surprising result was, that stream particles stem from the interior of Enceladus. Since 2004 CDA measured millions of dust impacts characterizing the dust environment of Saturn. The instrument showed strong evidence for ice geysers located at the south pole of Saturn‘s moon Enceladus in 2005. Later, a detailed compositional analysis of the salt-rich water ice grains in Saturn‘s E ring system lead to the discovery of liquid water below the icy crust connected to an ocean at depth feeding the icy jets. CDA was even capable to derive a spatially resolved compositional profile of the plume during close Enceladus flybys. A determination of the dust-magnetosphere interaction and the discovery of the extended E ring allowed the definition of a dynamical dust model of Saturn’s E ring describing the observed properties. The measured dust density profiles in the dense E ring revealed geometric asymmetries.\nIn the final three years CDA performs exogenous and interstellar dust campaigns, studies of the composition and origin of Saturn's main rings by unique ring ejecta measurements, long-duration nano-dust stream observations, high-resolution maps of small moon orbit crossings, studies of the dust cloud around Dione and studies of the E-ring interaction with the large moon Titan.",

            "abstract": "We present cross-validation of remote sensing observations of methane profiles in the Canadian High Arctic. Methane is the third most important greenhouse gas on Earth, and second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to anthropogenic global warming. Accurate and precise observations of methane are essential to understand quantitatively its role in the climate system and in global change. The Arctic is a particular region of concern, as melting permafrost and disappearing sea ice might lead to accelerated release of methane into the atmosphere. Global observations require spaceborne instruments, in particular in the Arctic, where surface measurements are sparse and expensive to perform. Satellite-based remote sensing is an underconstrained problem, and specific validation under Arctic circumstances is required. Here, we show a cross-validation between two spaceborne instruments and ground-based measurements, all Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS). We consider the Canadian SCISAT ACE-FTS, a solar occultation spectrometer operating since 2004, and the Japanese GOSAT TANSO-FTS, a nadir-pointing FTS operating at solar and terrestrial infrared wavelengths, since 2009. The ground-based instrument is a Bruker Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, measuring mid-infrared solar absorption spectra at the Polar Environmental and Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) at Eureka, Nunavut (80°N, 86°W) since 2006. Measurements are collocated considering temporal, spatial, and geophysical criteria and regridded to a common vertical grid. We perform smoothing on the higher-resolution instrument results to account for different vertical resolutions. Then, profiles of differences for each pair of instruments are examined. Any bias between instruments, or any accuracy that is worse than expected, needs to be understood prior to using the data. The results of the study will serve as a guideline on how to use the vertically resolved methane products from ACE and GOSAT within the High Arctic region.",

            "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to study the effect of settling driven instabilities on sediment removal from hypopycnal plumes. Traditional approaches scale removal rates with particle settling velocity however, it has been suggested that the removal from buoyant suspensions happens at higher rates. The enhancement of removal is likely due to gravitational instabilities, such as fingering, at two-fluid interface. Previous studies have all sought to suppress flocculation, and no simple model exists to predict the removal rates under the effect of such instabilities. This study examines whether or not flocculation hampers instability formation and presents a simple removal rate model accounting for gravitational instabilities. A buoyant suspension of flocculated Kaolinite overlying a base of clear saltwater was investigated in a laboratory tank. Concentration was continuously measured in both layers with a pair of OBS sensors, and interface was monitored with digital cameras. Snapshots from the video were used to measure finger velocity. Samples of flocculated particles at the interface were extracted to retrieve floc size data using a floc camera. Flocculation did not stop creation of settling-driven fingers. A simple cylinder-based force balance model was capable of predicting finger velocity. Analogy of fingering process of fine grained suspensions to thermal plume formation and the concept of Grashof number enabled us to model finger spacing as a function of initial concentration. Finally, from geometry, the effective cross-sectional area was correlated to finger spacing. Reformulating the outward flux expression was done by substitution of finger velocity, rather than particle settling velocity, and finger area instead of total area. A box model along with the proposed outward flux was used to predict the SSC in buoyant layer. The model quantifies removal flux based on the initial SSC and is in good agreement with the experimental data.",

            "abstract": "Calibration and validation play an essential role during the acquisition and processing of satellite data for the Earth Observing System satellites in addition to being an integral part of maintaining scientific values of archived satellite data. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection and Radiometer (ASTER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are two of five sensors onboard the Terra platform – the Earth Observing System flagship. ASTER has a swath width of 60km with 8 bands in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) spectral range with a spatial resolution of 15m (bands 1-3) and 90m (bands 10-14), respectively while MODIS has a swath width of 2300km with 36 spectral bands from visible to infrared spectral range with a spatial resolution of 250m (bands 1-2), 500m (bands 3-7), and 1km (bands 8-36). ASTER is the ‘zoom’ lens and MODIS is the ‘keystone’ instrument for Terra; they provide quantitative measurements of various earth system variables to the scientific and to the broader community. The simultaneous view of the sensors simplifies the intercomparison between them and relies on the use of the Railroad Valley Playa test site to reduce uncertainties caused by spatial heterogeneity and spectral differences in the sensors. The fact that Railroad Valley Playa is a calibration test site for ASTER ensures that ASTER was tasked at a higher rate over this area providing more scenes for the intercomparison. The study compares ASTER L1B data for the three VNIR bands reprocessed with recent calibration updates and MODIS 02 Collection 6 data products for the similar bands. No correction for geometry angle is needed and coincident 3-km by 3-km regions are used to reduce the impact of spatial heterogeneity. A correction for spectral differences between the sensors is applied based on averages of ground measurements of the test site.",

OCCULT-2, an automated pattern recognition code for the extraction of one-dimensional curvilinear features from two-dimensional images, has proved a notable effectiveness in the identification of loop structures in SDO/AIA data. We now present a novel approach for the automatic determination of the mathematical equations describing these structures that relies on the results provided by OCCULT-2. Specifically, our approach implements a generalization of the Hough transform procedure to the recognition of patterns described by algebraic curves. In this method the points determined by OCCULT-2 are transformed into either curves or surfaces in the parameter space and an accumulator procedure is used to optimize the parameter values that recognize the curve in the image space. We validate this procedure against synthetic but realistically simulated data and show its effectiveness in the analysis of a number of SDO/AIA images.",

Meteorological measurements collected at the US-UMB AmeriFlux tower served to force, optimize, and evaluate the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2), while tree census information was used to initialize ED2.\nTo test the influence that representing canopy heterogeneity has on model-tower agreement, we ran a set of ED2 site-level simulations with an increasing number of sub-grid patches. The first simulation, which we call ‘aggregated’, had one large patch explicitly containing all trees. The aggregated canopy represents a case where different size cohorts of each plant functional type are distributed homogeneously throughout the plot with uniform stem density. Six other simulations represented patch-level canopies with varying degrees of heterogeneity, ranging from 5 to 64 sub-plot patches; each patch represented from one to several of the 0.1 ha tree census plots.\nA preliminary comparison of the aggregated and the 20-plot heterogeneous simulations showed that including patch-level heterogeneity in the canopy description improved model prediction quality. For example, compared to the single-patch, aggregated simulation, including 20 sub-plot patches improved model bias in the estimated accumulated 5-year net ecosystem exchange from 17% to 5%, which is smaller than our tower observation uncertainty.\nAs a result of this study, we will identify methodologies that lead to better simulation designs by allowing the user to employ sub-plot census information to evaluate how much detail regarding canopy heterogeneity is needed to most accurately describe the total carbon flux observed in a forest.",

We sampled a series of mineral springs to define fluids derived from Juan de Fuca lithosphere beneath the forearc as the subducting slab dehydrates and densifies with increasing depth. Surface springs above the slab depth of 25–30 km have 3He/4He ratios of ~0.3 (R/RA); above the slab at a depth of ~40 km the ratio is ~4.0; and for springs above the slab at depths of 50–55 km the ratio ranges from ~0.7–1.6.\nThe springs situated trenchward of the forearc mantle corner (FMC; varying from 35 to 43 km deep), yield the lowest ratios, thus indicating only a minor component of mantle-derived helium within spring waters. Springs situated arcward of the FMC yield intermediate (0.8–1.2 RC/RA ) to high (>1.2 RC/RA ) ratios, indicating a significant component of mantle-derived helium. Although helium isotopes do not allow us to differentiate between oceanic and forearc mantle sources, the lowest values are situated above the region that lacks forearc mantle, suggesting that either little slab-derived fluid is released at shallow slab depths, or that forearc mantle is the major source of 3He and acquired as the fluids rise to the surface. Sample sites range from 40 km to more than 200 km from the nearest Cascade Arc volcano. For the closer sites, we cannot rule out that 3He may be partially derived from westward migration of arc related fluids. The highest value occurs ~130 km from the nearest arc volcano, thus likely does not reflect arc related fluids.\nThese preliminary observations provide geologic evidence that slab-derived fluids can migrate through the forearc mantle wedge to the surface even though the mantle is typically considered a sink for fluids owing to serpentinization processes. Likely pathways consist of fractures in the forearc mantle lined with serpentinized material that would serve to seal the fractures from the rising fluids.",

Recent Polar observations at Earth’s bow shock have revealed copious whistlers in the lower-hybrid frequency range [Hull et al., JGR, 2012]. The waves have wavelengths comparable to the ion inertia length and propagate obliquely to both the magnetic field B0 and the shock normal. Earth’s bow shock being supercritical, reflected ions play a fundamental role and, in particular, determine its macrostructure which consists of a foot, a ramp, and an overshoot region. Here, we investigate the possible interaction between the oblique whistlers and the reflected ions in the shock’s foot. The problem considered is characterized by a double anisotropy: one defined by the direction of B0, the other by that of the reflected beam. Let Ψ be the plane defined by these two directions, presumably the magnetic coplanarity plane. The Cerenkov resonance condition reads ω = k Ure sin θbk cos ψvk , where Ure denotes the drift of the beam of reflected ions seen in the solar wind frame, θbk is the angle between the wavevector and B0, and ψvk is the angle between the wavevector and the plane Ψ.\nWe exploit Themis burst mode and its three-axis field measurements in order to simultaneously characterize the whistlers (wavevector direction and module) and the ion beam (velocity direction and module). The resonance condition above is then examined in this light. Modelling the ion beam, we use our electromagnetic dispersion code [see companion paper in this session] to compute the linear characteristics of the oblique whistlers that can be excited and compare them with the observations. Moreover, waveforms and hodograms obtained from an electromagnetic PIC simulation are also compared with Themis measurements.",

            "abstract": "Existing records suggest that Early Cretaceous temperatures were warmer than modern conditions, but were moderate compared to the mid-Cretaceous super-greenhouse. High-latitude marine oxygen isotopes indicate near-freezing polar temperatures, while glendonites and dropstones suggest periodic existence of polar ice. Conventional oxygen isotope paleothermometry is problematic due to its control by both temperature and seawater composition, which is dependent on both global ice volume and more regional hydrologic variations. In order to overcome this limitation, we performed clumped isotope analysis on belemnite rostra of Valanginian age (~140-134 Ma) from localities across a range of paleolatitudes. We find temperatures well above modern values for these sites, but still compatible with sub-freezing poles. Additionally, the oxygen isotopic composition of seawater calculated from these same analyses is remarkably similar to modern values, and differs significantly from modeled Cretaceous seawater. These high oxygen isotope ratios could be the product of isotopic disequilibrium in belemnites, but are more likely to be the result of previously unrecognized basin- or global-scale hydrological factors, or ice sheet growth. Our results therefore argue for a generally warm Valanginian climate but with the potential for significant polar ice.",

The Martian crust (as analyzed by the Gamma Ray Spectrometer) is chlorine-rich with up to 0.8 wt% Cl; while the MER rovers Spirit and Opportunity as well as MSL Curiosity have analyzed rocks with even higher chlorine concentrations [\ne.g., 3\n]. This suggests that any potential fluid flowing through the crust would have high chlorine concentrations and therefore high salinity. Here we investigate the bulk and mineral chemistry of the SNC meteorites to constrain the pre-eruptive chlorine concentrations of Martian magmas as the potential source of chlorine in the Martian crust.\nBulk SNC meteorites have Cl concentrations similar to terrestrial Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts which would suggest a Cl content of the Martian interior similar to that of the Earth [4]. However, based on Cl/La ratios, the Martian interior actually has 2-3 times more Cl than the Earth [5]. This is also reflected in the composition of Cl-rich minerals within the SNC meteorites [5, 6] and suggests that the pre-eruptive parental magmas to the SNC meteorites were Cl-rich. Eruption and degassing of such Cl-rich magmas would have delivered Cl to the Martian crust, thereby increasing the salinity of any fluids within the crust.\n[1] Rothschild L.J. and R.L.

This archive represents the first record of marine metazoan community ecology, and a comparison to a well-established biotic proxy (Foraminifera), through the climatic and oceanographic events of the most recent deglaciation. The high-resolution seafloor archive reveals strong coupling between orbital and millennial climatic episodes and the structure of shallow ocean ecosystems. Changes in the density and diversity of molluscs and foraminifera exhibit clear associations with climatic events that mark the deglacial episode, including rapid expansions and contractions of the Oxygen Minimum Zone and development of chemosynthetic bacterial mat communities. Molluscans occur discontinuously in only 28% of the sediment sequence, whereas foraminifera occur throughout. Multivariate statistical analyses of the community ecology assist with the interpretations of the multi-species paleoecological data and of processes that caused the variability. A surprising dominance of molluscan extremophiles (sulfidic Astrys permodesta and hypoxic Lucinoma aequizonatum) during cool, well oxygenated intervals reveals how such forms can thrive during inferred brief ephemeral extreme events. Hydrographic variability and bottom water flow, as well as the growth of benthic bacterial communities, determine where such extremophile communities dominate.",

We reconstructed pO2 since the emergence of land plants in the Ordovician following the approach of Tappert et al. [1], and using the published δ13C record of fossil resins (amber), coals and dispersed terrestrial organic matter. For most of this time, atmospheric pO2 was considerably lower (pO2 ~ 10-21%) compared to today (pO2 = 21%). Secular variations in pO2 must reflect changing amounts of burial of organic matter and sulfides. We observe a strong correlation between pO2 calculated from land plants, and the strontium and lithium isotopic compositions of marine carbonates. The marine Sr isotope record reflects secular changes of continental weathering and climate driven by tectonic activity. Synchronicity of pO2 with the marine strontium isotope record implies that tectonic processes, including orogeneses and the formation of associated sedimentary basins, not only control the rate of weathering and volume of sedimentation, but also the amount and proportion of the biomass that is buried on geological timescales.",

Earth Planet. Sci. Lett (2013) 364, 59). A possible source of these regions is the enrichment of lower mantle minerals with iron. As of yet the effect of iron on the elasticity and density of lower mantle minerals at lower mantle conditions is unknown.\nIn this study we used molecular dynamic simulations to study iron (both ferric and ferrous) substitution into the magnesium (silicate) oxide structures that are most commonly found in the lower mantle- perovskite, post-perovskite and ferropericlase- at the pressures (136 GPa) and temperatures of the CMB (3000-4000 K). The effect of temperature in the simulation is profound with very different temperature derivatives between iron-rich and iron-poor substances leading to different results statically and thermally. All iron species have a roughly linear relationship between properties and iron concentration allowing comparisons to be drawn with ULVZs and expected parameters to be calculated. The substitution of iron causes a large decrease in the oxide velocities with a particularly pronounced shear wave decreases. At a density increase of 10% from a lower mantle background we find that Vp decreases are around 5-12% and Vs decreases are around 10-20% for all iron structures. Thus Vp decreases in ULVZs are easily accounted for with iron substitution but Vs decreases in ULVZs are larger than would be expected from iron substitution. This can be seen in the dLnVs:dLnVp ratios which reach a maximum of 3.5 with iron substituted structures but remain around 2 at appropriate densities which is smaller than the expected 3.",

LAI indicating phenological development of vegetation is an important state variable for modeling land surface processes. The comparison of long-term data sets is based on two recently available data sets both derived from AVHRR time series. The LAI 3g data set introduced by Zaichun Zhu et al. (2013) is developed from the new improved third generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI3g) and best-quality MODIS LAI data. The second long-term data set is based on the 8 km spatial resolution GIMMS-AVHRR data (GGRS-data set by Propastin et al. 2012). The GGRS-LAI product uses a three-dimensional physical radiative transfer model which establishes relationship between LAI, vegetation fractional cover and given patterns of surface reflectance, view-illumination conditions and optical properties of vegetation. The model incorporates a number of site/region specific parameters, including the vegetation architecture variables such as leaf angle distribution, clumping index, and light extinction coefficient. For the application of the model to Kazakhstan, the vegetation architecture variables were computed at the local (pixel) level based on extensive field surveys of the biophysical properties of vegetation in representative grassland areas of Kazakhstan. The comparison of both long-term data sets will be used to interpret their quality for scientific research in other disciplines.\n",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt is the primary water source in the Western United States and mountainous regions globally. Forecasts of streamflow and water supply rely heavily on snow measurements from sparse observation networks that may not provide adequate information during abnormal climatic conditions. In this regard, remote sensing can be used to monitor snow covered area (SCA), which we hypothesize can be used in conjunction with terrain information to estimate spatially explicit snow depth (SD). Small-scale terrain variability can be considered a proxy for the snow holding capacity of the ground. SCA should be more sensitive to changes in snow depth for smooth, or low variable terrain, and less sensitive to rougher terrain. To this end, we have developed a method that is not expected to depend on repeated climatic conditions because it accounts for the static accumulation capacity rather than dynamic processes. In preliminary investigations, a LiDaR dataset from 2010 from Green Lakes Valley, Colorado, USA (Harpold et al. 2014) was used to relate snow depth with fSCA and the sub-pixel terrain variability. Snow depth (dependent variable) and fSCA (independent variable) were aggregated from 1 meter to 30 meters from the LiDaR snow depth product while terrain variability metrics such as the coefficient of variation of elevation were calculated using the 900 1-meter elevation pixels inside each 30 meter pixel. Single linear regression of SD fit with fSCA explains 38% of the variability with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.36 m, but the goodness of fit increases to an average of 53% with MAE of 0.25 m as the data is binned by elev-cv; this may indicate that SD-SCA relationships vary by terrain type (slope, aspect, etc.). Further analysis of the scales at which these relationships are applicable and the viability with off-the-shelf DEM and fSCA products is needed. The utility of these relationships is such that snow depth could be estimated above treeline for any set of climatic conditions and could have far-reaching implications for understanding snow distribution and forecasting water supply.",

            "abstract": "Jakobshavn Glacier, West Greenland, has responded to temperature changes in Ilulissat Icefjord, into which it terminates. We collected hydrographic observations inside this silled fjord and from adjacent Disko Bay between 2001 and 2014. In the fjord basin, the summer mean temperature was 2.8 ◦C from 2009 to 2013, excluding 2010, when it was 1 ◦C cooler. Despite this variability, summer potential densities in the basin were in the narrow range 27.20 ≤ σθ≤ 27.31 and basin water properties matched those of Disko Bay in this density layer each summer. This relation has likely held since at least 1980, implying that basin waters from 2009 and 2011-2013 were similar to those in 1998 and 1999, when Jakobshavn Glacier began to retreat, while basin waters as cool as in 2010 were likely last present in the 1980s.\nThe 2010 basin temperature anomaly reflected larger-scale advection into Disko Bay, not local weather variability. This anomaly also shows that Ilulissat Icefjord basin waters were renewed annually or faster. Mooring time series and data from instrumented seals and halibut did not capture the 2010 anomaly but show that the basin and Disko Bay bottom temperatures vary little sub-annually, outside of summer, while fjord velocity profiles from summer 2013 imply a basin renewal timescale of about one month. Model simulations indicate that subglacial discharge from Jakobshavn Glacier could drive renewal of the fjord basin over a single summer, while baroclinic forcing from outside the fjord can not, due to the sill at the mouth. The silled nature of Ilulissat Icefjord therefore makes its renewal dynamics different from Sermilik Fjord, in east Greenland, which is rapidly renewed by external forcing.",

            "abstract": "The current study represents the first efforts to model 3D hydrothermal circulation in fast-spreading oceanic crust, using a network of outcrops patterned after a region of the Cocos plate offshore Costa Rica, where heat extraction is exceptionally high, resulting in heat flow values ~30% of those predicted by conductive lithospheric cooling models. Previous studies of this region attribute the heat deficit to vigorous hydrothermal circulation through basaltic basement outcrops that provide a hydraulic connection between the igneous oceanic crust and the seafloor, resulting in efficient mining of heat by large-scale lateral fluid flow. Seafloor bathymetry indicates that outcrops in this region are spaced 20-50-km apart, although there are likely additional unmapped structures that facilitate recharge and discharge of hydrothermal fluids. The modeled outcrop network consists of 20-km and 40-km square grids, with outcrops located at the corners. We vary the number, size, permeability, and orientation of the outcrops to consider what combination of these parameters achieve the observed pattern and/or quantity of heat loss. Additionally, we consider the effect of aquifer permeability and thickness on the modeled heat flow distribution.\nModel results suggest that extremely high aquifer permeability is required to match the observed heat loss and low heat flow, together with a heterogeneous outcrop permeability distribution. In particular, we find that an aquifer permeability of 10-9 m2 is required to achieve the measured heat flow distribution in this region, which estimates a mean value of 29 ±13 mW/m2 in areas of flat lying basement, overlain by 400-500-m of sediment. In addition to high aquifer permeability, heterogeneous outcrop permeability is required to initiate the hydraulic connection between outcrops, with higher permeability outcrops acting as recharge sites, and lower permeability outcrops as discharge sites.",

ODP Site 1275 recovered tectonically denuded gabbro and troctolite on the west flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (15°45’N). Carbonate veins comprise ~0.15 vol.% of the recovered core, corresponding to CO2 uptake of only 0.075 wt.%. However, troctolite cores are comprised of 0.8 vol.% calcite veins, and individual troctolite samples contain up to 15 vol.% calcite that directly replaced olivine in association with talc.\nCarbonate precipitated from multiple types of fluids during and following denudation. Calcite replaced olivine concurrently with the formation of high-temperature (δ18OSMOW = 11 to 20‰, corresponding to 75-180°C for fluid δ18OSMOW of 0‰) calcite veins in active shear zones. These veins are enriched in LREEs (2-10x chondrite) with strong positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 5 to 500), and have 87/86Sr ratios of ~0.704 and δ13CVPDB ranging from -2 to -5‰. Later veins (70% calcite and 30% aragonite) cut high-T veins. These veins precipitated near seawater temperatures (δ18OSMOW ~ 35.1), and have seawater C and Sr isotopic signatures. Both late calcite and aragonite veins have lower REE contents than high-T veins and have little or no Eu anomalies; aragonite veins have negative Ce anomalies. These low-T veins precipitated in both gabbro and troctolite from seawater with varying degrees of rock interaction. High-T veins and replacive calcite precipitated from a mixture of seawater and high-T hydrothermal fluids, and are common in troctolite but rare in gabbro. Geochemical reaction path modeling suggests that the replacive calcite-talc assemblage in troctolite forms only at high fluid-to-rock ratios. The calcite’s low 87/86Sr ratios, however, indicate that the seawater-derived fluids had exchanged Sr with large volumes of rock. The olivine carbonation may hence result from upflow of deeply rooted fluids during basement denudation.",

Comparing the observed structure in different regions reveals a complexity to mantle plume structure, and their interaction with the over-riding lithosphere, that we are only beginning to understand. Beneath Hawaii, at the top of a near-vertical conduit extending from the lower mantle, we observe two horizontal layers to the present-day plume pancake structure. The first is at ~410 to ~250 km depth, and the second extends from ~150 km to the base of the lithosphere. Beneath Iceland the plume pancake appears to consist of only a single layer from ~200 km to the Moho. Beneath Yellowstone there is also only a single layer pancake, but it fills a layer from 300 km depth up to the Moho. These differences are likely the result of both different source chemistry, and also differences in the over-riding lithospheric structure. In this presentation we will explore the upper mantle structure of all three plumes and the possible explanations for these variations.",

We calculate the detection limit for each case and find the densities of these layers are well above the detection limit, which makes the existence of Na layers up to so high latitudes definitely. Correlation with tides output from GSWM (Global Scale Wave Model) is also analyzed. Evidence has showed that the direct recombination Na+ +e-→ Na + hν may account for the formation of neutral Na layers, similarly as the formation of neutral Fe layers analyzed in Chu et al. [2011], Fe+ +e-→ Fe + hν , which is affected by the semidiurnal tides.",

EarthCube is a working community of over 2,500 scientists and students of many Earth Science disciplines who are looking to build bridges between disciplines. The EarthCube initiative will create a digital infrastructure that connects databases, software, and repositories. A catalog of resources (databases, software, repositories) has been produced by the Research Coordination Network for Paleogeosciences to improve the discoverability of resources. The Catalog is currently made available within the larger-scope CINERGI geosciences portal (http://hydro10.sdsc.edu/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page). Other distribution points and web services are planned, using linked data, content services for the web, and XML descriptions that can be harvested using metadata protocols. The databases provide searchable interfaces to find data sets that would otherwise remain dark data, hidden in drawers and on personal computers. The software will be described in catalog entries so just one click will lead users to methods and analytical tools that many geoscientists were unaware of. The repositories listed in the Paleogeosciences Catalog contain physical samples found all across the globe, from natural history museums to the basements of university buildings. EarthCube has over 250 databases, 300 software systems, and 200 repositories which will grow in the coming year. When completed, geoscientists across the world will be connected into a productive workflow for managing, sharing, and exploring geoscience data and information that expedites collaboration and innovation within the paleogeosciences, potentially bringing about new interdisciplinary discoveries.",

            "abstract": "The 1845 eruption of Hekla Iceland began around 9 am on the 2 of September, with an intense opening phase. The eruption continued until August 1846. Contemporary accounts mention precursor earthquakes and describe darkness in the Land district to the west of the volcano, which was caused by the ~19km high and east-southeast-drifting eruption plume. The accounts also indicate first sighting of the eruption plume at sites some 80 km downwind from the volcano around 10 am and with visible tephra fall at ~11 am. An hour later the tephra fall began to dissipate and had stopped by 3 pm. Three ships of the southeast coast of Iceland report tephra falling on their deck and sails and records of tephra fall are as also known from the Faeroe and Shetland Islands.\nThe initial explosive phase of the 1845 eruption lasted for about one hour, featuring mass eruption rate of ~104 m3 s-1 and produced a well-defined tephra fall sector covering approximately 10000 km2 within the 1 mm isopach. The total volume of the tephra from the initial phase is calculated at ~0.04km3 DRE. The average density obtained from three sets of “100-clast” samples ranges from 560-690 kg m-3. All of these samples exhibit a tight unimodal distribution with a calculated mean vesicularity of 74-79%.. These data also indicate a subtle decrease in maximum and mean vesicularity through the opening phase, from 88% to 82% and 79% to 75% respectively, which coincides with upward decrease in grain size (i.e. intensity) within proximal sections. The initial phase of the 1845 Hekla eruption was short lived and its products are exceptionally well preserved in Icelandic soils. As such it is ideal for studies of vesiculation and fragmentation processes and we will present new data on pumice vesicle size distribution as well as on total deposit grain size distribution.",

Since simulating LSMs at a spatial scale to explicitly resolve the finest resolution processes is computationally expensive, upscaling techniques are used in LSMs to capture effect of subgrid heterogeneity. However, routinely employed linear upscaling techniques that allow LSMs to be simulated at coarse spatial resolution can result in large prediction error. To efficiently predict fine-resolution solutions to LSMs, we studied the application of a reduce order model (ROM) technique known as the “Proper Orthogonal Decomposition mapping method” that reconstructs temporally-resolved fine-resolution solutions based on coarse-resolution solutions for two case studies. In the first case study, we applied POD approach on surface-subsurface isothermal simulations for four study sites (104 [m2]) in a polygonal tundra landscape near Barrow, Alaska. The results indicate that the ROM produced a significant computational speedup (>103) with very small relative approximation error (<0.1%) for two validation years not used in training the ROM. In the second case study, we illustrate the applicability of our ROM approach at watershed scale (1837 km2) model that is substantially more heterogeneous and demonstrate a hierarchical approach to emulating models at spatial scales consistent with mechanistic physical process representation.",

            "abstract": "Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are the most prominent and dramatic vertical coupling process in the middle atmosphere occurring during winter months. However, during the fall transition another vertical coupling process occurs, approximately every second year, which we refer to as the Hiccup. The Hiccup acts like a “mini SSW” and is argued to be caused by the sudden onset of planetary wave (PW) activity in the stratosphere as the background winds become westerly. The average characteristics of zonal wind, temperature and PW activity between 65° and 75°N during the Hiccup are considered using the nudged CMAM30 simulation, representing 30 years of historical data. Additionally, the mesospheric zonal wind results are compared to radar observations in Andenes (69°N, 16°E) for the years 2000 – 2013. The average Hiccup is characterized by a weakening of the zonal wind from the troposphere up to the mesosphere and by a warming in the stratosphere and a cooling in the mesosphere, i.e. similar to a SSW but with a much smaller magnitude. A comparison of the Hiccup and SSW shows similarities and differences between both coupling processes.",

            "abstract": "Properly mapping bed topography and basal conditions in ice-sheet grounding zones is crucial to understanding ice-sheet evolution. Detailed maps of bed topography are needed to properly assess the impact of bed pinning points in grounding-line retreat scenarios. Other processes, including sediment deposition, till compaction, and infiltration of ocean water upstream of grounding via tidal flexure, may also have important effects on grounding-line stability. Ice-penetrating radar is the most commonly used technique to examine ice-sheet grounding zones because it supplies large amounts of useful data comparatively easily. Although mapping the bed topography is relatively straightforward, more-complete interpretations of radar data incorporating information from basal reflectivity and basal-echo phase remain difficult, even with recent advances in radar technology. Here we present a detailed interpretation of radar basal reflectivity at the grounding zone of Whillans Ice Stream, informed using active-source seismic data and dielectric modeling. Our results indicate that basal reflectivity in complex environments must be interpreted with caution, because bed returned power is substantially affected by many possible basal conditions including thin films of various materials (e.g., freshwater, seawater, debris-bearing ice, sediment of varying compaction state), widespread crevasses, and off-nadir reflections. After careful examination of these issues, our data indicate substantial mixing in the shallow water column in a subglacial embayment where several subglacial lakes drain. Basal reflectivity in nearby areas with no subglacial drainage indicates a more abrupt transition along ice flow from ice overlying till to ice overlying seawater. Thus, properly considered, radar basal reflectivity still yields valuable information about grounding-zone conditions, including water properties as the ice begins to float. We conclude by discussing ramifications of this study for interpretation of airborne radar data collected over other grounding zones, including those of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers.",

            "abstract": "The understanding of groundwater circulations into a volcano-detritic edifice is difficult because of the heterogeneous geological formations and the alternating construction and dismantling phases. In Indonesia, most of the groundwater resources are located into these complex volcanic systems. Furthermore, over the world this kind of context is poorly documented. In this study, we used a multi-disciplinary method based on field observations at watershed scale (geology, geomorphology, pumping tests, physico-chemical monthly monitoring over two hydrological years, etc.) and water stable isotope analysis to built a conceptual model of the hydrogeological behaviour of the Merapi volcano located in Central Java. Temperature appears to be a relevant tracer of local and regional groundwater circulations. A numerical model (METIS code) was used to verify the hydrogeological conceptual model. The steady state flow simulations were constrained first by isotope ratios (δ18O) dispersion transport and then by heat dispersion transfer in 2D vertical cross section. The heat spatial distribution and especially the “spring temperature anomaly” have been reproduced. The numerical code allowed us to describe the relation between the geothermal gradient and the relatively cold groundwater circulations provide by the high elevation recharge. Therefore, the results of this study highlight that water temperature offers several advantages as a tracer of groundwater circulations because it is easy, quick, and inexpensive to measure accurately in the field even in volcanic systems under tropical conditions. We show also that a simple but relatively accurate numerical modelling can be achieved when it is constrained by multi-disciplinary study results.",

Because Mars lacks a dipole magnetic field, the solar wind directly interacts with the upper neutral atmosphere to create ‘pick-up’ ions. We will present global maps of escaping O+ pick up ions during different solar cycle phases for multiple IMF conditions using a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and test particle simulation. This study also examines the role of the crustal fields for the different IMF configurations; the remanent crustal magnetic fields, especially in extreme conditions, influence the magnetic topology at Mars and subsequently drive changes in heavy ion atmospheric escape. The results indicate that the escape rate from Mars’ atmosphere can change over an order of magnitude due to the IMF, solar cycle, and crustal field orientation, directly impacting Mars’ climate and our understanding of the processes that influence atmospheric evolution. These results directly support MAVEN, the next Mars Scout, whose primary objective is to understand the evolution of Mars’ atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Many aerosol studies based on remote sensing data reported changes in aerosol properties as a function of distance to cloud and/or cloud cover. For example, most satellite observations show a positive correlation between aerosol optical depth (AOT) and cloud cover. Part of this correlation is due to remote sensing artifacts resulting from (1) our inability to distinguish between aerosols and weak cloud elements, and (2) cloud-related 3D radiative effects. In turn, the correlation between aerosol properties and cloud cover influences aerosol statistics calculated as a function of distance to cloud. Indeed, far-from-cloud aerosol statistics is dominated by data from scenes with lower cloud fractions, while near-cloud aerosol statistics is dominated by data from scenes with higher cloud fractions. From the other hand, part of the near-cloud enhancement in AOT is due to aerosol hygroscopic growth in the humid environment surrounding clouds.\nIn this paper we overview the current understanding of possible remote sensing artifacts. We discuss how these artifacts can be mitigated and corrected by combining observations from several A-train instruments, thus helping to quantify the changes of aerosol properties in the vicinity of clouds.",

Mesoscale processes (e.g. eddies, meandering currents), can transport highly productive waters from the coasts, increasing the downward flux of organic material, a substrate for N-loss, and thus can act as N-loss hotspots in OMZs. However, due to their transient nature, these mesoscale events are difficult to monitor using traditional shipboard observations. We deployed biogeochemical Lagrangian floats in the eastern tropical North Pacific during a research cruise in May/June 2014, where transport of high chlorophyll waters from the coast were inferred from satellite imagery. These Lagrangian floats are automonous platforms with the ability to follow isopycnals and were equipped with a suite of gas tension devices and other sensors to measure N2(g), O2, NO3- and NO2- concentrations. We concurrently collected discrete samples to calibrate and complement float measurements. We present here biogenic N2, i.e. N2 produced by local N-loss processes and derived from measured N2/Ar and δ15N-N2 anomaly, i.e. the difference between δ15N-N2 observed and at equilibrium for in-situ temperature and salinity, during a ~4 weeks Lagrangian experiment. During N-loss, the product (N2) is depleted in 15N because of kinetic isotope fractionation. While biogenic N2 only reached up to ~10 µmol/kg, the δ15N-N2 anomalies were relatively low (down to ~-0.4‰). The δ15N-N2 anomalies are low compared to values always >-0.1‰) for equivalent biogenic N2 in the OMZ of the eastern tropical South Pacific. We will discuss the implication of these results for the global oceanic N budget.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen deposition (Ndep), a consequence of human activities, affects the greenhouse gas (GHG; CO2, N2O and CH4) sink capacity of terrestrial ecosystems. Grasslands play an important role in determining the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere. While they store greater than 10% of terrestrial net primary productivity and sustain up to 30% of the world’s organic C in their soils, grasslands also may be responsible for significant CH4 and N2O emissions. Many fertilization experiments have examined the response of grasslands to N loads of 50 to 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1. However, few studies have been designed to examine ecosystem responses to low N loads (< 20 kg N ha-1 yr-1) which they are likely to experience in the future according to the new IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. This is consistent with the notion that the N saturation threshold at which Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) levels off, or the dose-response relationships between N2O, N-trace gases, CH4, and Ndep in grasslands have not being well characterized. We combined data from grassland ecosystems in major climate zones and biogeochemical modeling (DayCent v. 4.5) to characterize the dose-response relationship between increased Ndep and GHG, and other N-trace gases fluxes and N leaching of these grasslands. We used the synthesized data to evaluate the modeling for above- and belowground NPP, N2O, CH4, and response to N fertilization and climate. We found that in most cases increased Ndep will continue to increase the non-CO2 GHG source strength of grasslands, whereas NEP will saturate at N levels ranging from 10 – 70 kg N ha-1 yr-1depending on the precipitation, fire regime, and/or species composition of the grassland. Given these thresholds, we modeled the potential net GHG sink capacity for the world’s major grassland biomes using several of the IPCC RCP scenarios which include a range of climate and Ndep trajectories. Our results suggest that although global grassland C storage can increase by up to 30% with increased Ndep, the increased non-CO2 emissions significantly reduce the net GHG sink capacity of grasslands. Improved understanding on how grasslands respond to Ndep loads that agree with future scenarios is essential to predicting the role of pastures on the global C and N cycles.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s dual Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft have globally mapped the lunar gravity field at unprecedented resolution; this has enabled the study of craters of all sizes and ages. Soderblom et al. [2014, LPSC abstract #1777] calculated the residual Bouguer anomalies for ~2700 craters 27-184 km in diameter (D). They found that the residual Bouguer anomaly over craters smaller than D~100 km is essentially 0±50 mGal, there is a transition for D~100–150 km, and craters larger than 184 km have a positive residual Bouguer anomaly that increases with increasing crater size. We use the iSALE shock physics hydrocode to model crater formation, including the effect of porosity and dilatancy (shear bulking). We use strength parameters of gabbroic anorthosite for the crust and dunite for the mantle. Our impactor sizes range from 6–30 km, which produce craters between 86–450 km in diameter for pre-impact target porosities of 0, 6.8, and 13.6%. We calculate the free-air and Bouguer gravity anomalies from our models and compare them to gravity data from GRAIL. We find that target porosity has the greatest effect on the gravity signature of lunar craters and can explain the observed ±50 mGal scatter in the residual Bouguer anomaly. We investigate variations of impact velocity, crustal thickness, and dilatancy angle; we find that these parameters do not affect the gravity as significantly as target porosity does. We find that the crater diameter at which mantle uplift dominates the crater gravity is dependent on target porosity, and that it occurs at a crater diameter that is close to the complex crater to peak-ring basin transition.",

            "abstract": "Terraces eroded into sediment (cut-fill) and bedrock (strath) preserve a geomorphic record of river activity. River terraces are often thought to form when a river switches from a period of low vertical incision rates and valley widening to high vertical incision rates and terrace abandonment. Consequently, terraces are frequently interpreted to reflect landscape response to changing external drivers, including tectonics, sea-level, and most commonly, climate. In contrast, unsteady lateral migration in meandering rivers may generate river terraces even under constant vertical incision and without changes in external forcing. To explore this latter mechanism, we use a numerical model and an automated terrace detection algorithm to simulate landscape evolution by a vertically incising, meandering river and isolate the age and geometric fingerprints of intrinsically generated river terraces. Simulations indicate that terraces form for a wide range of lateral and vertical incision rates, and the time interval between unique terrace levels is limited by a characteristic timescale for relief generation. Surprisingly, intrinsically generated terraces are commonly paired, an attribute that is thought to be diagnostic of climate change. For low ratios of vertical-to-lateral erosion rates, modeled terraces are longitudinally extensive and typically dip toward the valley center, and terrace slope is proportional to the ratio of vertical to lateral erosion. Evolving, spatial differences in bank strength between bedrock and sediment reduce terrace formation frequency and length, and can explain sub-linear terrace margins at valley boundaries. Comparison of model predictions to natural river terraces indicates that terrace length is the most reliable indicator of terrace formation by pulses of vertical incision, and may contain the imprint of past climate change on landscapes.",

Variations in dynamic support of the lithosphere, due to transient behavior of the Iceland mantle plume, probably control spatial and temporal water depth variations this region. Pathways and intensities of oceanic bottom currents, together with deposition of contourite drifts, are strongly influenced by changing bathymetry. Here, we combine detailed observations of contourite drift deposits from seismic reflection profiles with a chronology of plume activity, to test the relationships between deep-water circulation, sedimentary drift accumulation and mantle convection. We present multi-channel seismic reflection profiles acquired over Bjorn, Gardar and Hatton Drifts in the Iceland Basin and over the northernmost portion of Eirik Drift, east of Greenland. Depositional hiatuses are easily identified and correlated between these high-quality images and nearby boreholes, which allows us to construct history of sedimentation across the North Atlantic Ocean over the past 5 Ma. We observe kilometer-scale westward-migration of Bjorn Drift, which can be explained by varying current strength and sediment supply, probably moderated by fluctuating dynamic support on overall subsidence. We place these observations into a new continuous 55 Ma record of Iceland mantle plume activity. There is compelling evidence to support the hypothesis that variations in mantle convection deep beneath the plates has profound consequences for deep-water flow and sediment deposition at Earth’s surface.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the feedbacks between surface processes and extensional faulting by coupling a 2D thermo-mechanical rifting model with a landscape evolution law. Long-term climate-tectonic feedbacks are essential in shaping the dynamics of convergent plate boundaries, yet the nature and importance of these feedbacks is not well characterized in extensional settings. Focusing on the evolution of a single rift-bounding normal fault, we show that erosion and deposition can significantly enhance fault life span—i.e., the amount of horizontal extension a fault can accommodate before a new fault breaks in intact lithosphere. In simulations with very slow erosion rates, a typical 15 km-thick brittle layer extends via a succession of crosscutting short-lived faults (2–5 km heave). By contrast, erosion rates on par with or faster than the regional extension rate promote the sequential growth of long-lived faults (heave >10 km). We complement our numerical simulations with a simple force balance model in which we isolate the effect of topography growth on fault evolution. We show that in faulted layers thicker than 10–15 km, fault life span is weakly sensitive to lithospheric thickness and strength, but can be highly sensitive to changes in erosion and deposition rates within geologically relevant bounds. We therefore propose that the major range-bounding normal faults observed in many continental rifts owe their large offsets to erosional and depositional processes rather than to the mechanical properties of the lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate research in Mesoamerica suggests that multidecadal droughts in the late Holocene were a factor in the demise of many pre-Columbian sites. However, our understanding of the spatial patterns of these droughts, and the causal mechanisms underlying them, remains poor. Our research is motivated by two main questions: First, we ask whether there is evidence that late Holocene droughts in Mesoamerica were spatially coherent across broad spatial scales. Second, we ask what mechanisms may be responsible for the patterns of paleoclimate change observed in proxy records. To address our first question, we present a record of late Holocene paleoclimatic change from the maar lake Aljojuca, in the eastern Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. A chronology established via radiocarbon dating shows that the core spans 6,200 cal. years B.P. We use geochemical proxies, in particular oxygen isotopes from authigenic carbonates, to reconstruct changes in lake level. We also draw on previously published lacustrine paleoclimatic records from across Mesoamerica. Using resampling techniques, we evaluate the impact of age uncertainty on estimates of the timing of late Holocene droughts over the past 2000 years. Our initial results suggest evidence of coherent drought in proxy records from the Yucatan Peninsula to highland Mexico between 1300 and 1000 cal yr. B.P., although there are subsequent intervals when proxy records show diverging trends. To address our second question, we use multivariate statistical techniques to explore coupled patterns of variability between Mesoamerican rainfall and remote sea surface temperatures in instrumental data and climate model control simulations (i.e. CCSM4.0’s pre-industrial control simulation). Initial results suggest that low-frequency changes in rainfall may be forced by changes in SSTs in the Pacific or Atlantic basins that alter patterns of moisture transport.",

            "abstract": "The ocean, through its ability to globally redistribute heat and partition carbon dioxide, is believed to play a key role in driving and amplifying climate change during Quaternary glaciations on orbital to millennial timescales. Relatively little is known, however, about changes in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) associated with the Pliocene intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation (iNHG). To help fill this gap in our knowledge we present a new high resolution (~6 ka) record of the Nd isotope composition of the deep North Atlantic between ~3.3 and 2.4 Ma, measured on fish debris at IODP Site U1313 (3426 m, 41°N, 32.5°W). This record represents the first orbital-resolution record of variations in watermass mixing in this region for iNHG independent of changes in the carbon cycle and, in contrast to existing benthic foraminiferal δ13C records for this time interval, our Nd dataset contains evidence for late Pleistocene magnitude incursions of Southern Component Waters to the deep North Atlantic Ocean during key glacial periods through this time. We therefore infer an important role for AMOC variability in amplifying Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles",

            "abstract": "Three cases where advances in mineral thermochemistry provide new insights into geological processes are discussed: (I) Sb-rich fahlores are used to constrain compositions of hydrothermal fluids and processes responsible for Ag-Pb-Zn sulfide ores from three Ag mining districts, Keno Hill, (Yukon, Canada); Julcani, (Angaraes, Peru); Coeur d’Alene, (Idaho, USA), confirming that the Ag initially contained in galena solid solutions was a substantial contributor to the total Ag mined in each of them; (II) Al8/3O4-rich MgAl2O4-Al8/3O4 spinels may have condensed from the primordial solar nebula, with their Al8/3O4 annealed out with cooling, as AgSbS2 is “annealed” out of galena in Ag-Pb-Zn ore deposits. Such spinels may explain inconsistencies between mineral condensation sequences recorded in Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) in carbonaceous chondrites and those calculated assuming spinel was MgAl2O4. A new thermodynamical model and corundum-bearing CAIs, suggest we may anticipate realization of higher temperatures and pressures of canonical condensation than currently in vogue; (III) Fassitic pyroxenes in the composition space CaMgSi2O6 (Di) – CaTiAlSiO6 (Gr) – CaTi1/2Mg1/2AlSiO6 (AlBf) – CaAl2SiO6 (CATS) exhibit at least one prominent gap evident in composition data from CAIs. This may be interpreted as due to the near superposition of the extension of the Di– AlBf gap into this fassaite tetrahedron, with an isolated two-phase region formed by the double intersections of the (Gr+CATS) – AlBf critical curve with the surfaces of constant Ti(Al)-1 exchange potential characteristic of CAIs. A thermodynamic model for fassaites may provide context for critical thinking about CAI petrogenesis, as well as presaging potential refinements to the thermochemical model for pyroxenes in MELTS.",

These facilities, however, can also provide unique benefits when used for interdisciplinary courses and Professional Development programs not directly tied to field research. Located near the southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula, the University of Virginia’s Anheuser-Busch Coastal Research Center (ABCRC) serves as the field station for the Virginia Coast Reserve Long Term Ecological Research Program (VCR-LTER). Along with hosting field trips and short course for subjects like Marine Biology, Aquatic Ecology and Coastal Geology, the ABCRC has recently hosted Professional Development programs for public school Art teachers and a Nature Writing class for college students. These interdisciplinary programs are part of the ABCRC’s participation in the Ecological Reflections Program (\nhttp://www.ecologicalreflections.com/\n) sponsored by The National Science Foundation and the LTER Network, with a goal of tying VCR-LTER data with the Humanities to increase appreciation of coastal environments and the ecosystem services they provide. Participants in these interdisciplinary programs are exposed to cutting edge field research and immersed (often quite literally) in coastal environments while they practice their art forms. The resulting paintings, drawings, nature essays and short stories demonstrate the impacts exposure to natural environments can have on program participants and how these experiences may shape their future works.

TWS from GRACE is applied here to validate different sets of ensemble hindcasts performed with the coupled climate model MPI-ESM that have been prepared within the German Research Initiative on Decadal Climate Prediction (MiKlip) during recent years.\nModerately positive skill scores of the initialized hindcasts are obtained both with respect to the zero anomaly forecast and the uninitialized projections in particular for leadyear 1 in particular in moderate to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Skill scores gradually increase when moving in more recent experiments and also for experiments performed at higher spatial resolution, thereby documenting improvements of the MPI-ESM decadal prediction system during course of the Miklip project.\nAnalyses indicate that the skill changes obtained here reflect in particular changes in the large-scale precipitaiton pattern between the individual experiments, which itself is an important target quantity of the climate prediction. We will explain in this talk how GRACE-based TWS might contribute to the validation of precipitation changes in particular in regions of the world where reliable in-situ observations are sparse.",

            "abstract": "Cumulus clouds have a net cooling effect on the surface radiative balance by reflecting more downwelling solar radiation than absorbing upwelling terrestrial radiation. As boundary layer cumuli form from buoyant, moist plumes ascending from the surface, their growth may be hindered by the turbulent deformation of the plume by wind farms. A natural laboratory to study the impact of wind farms on cumulus formation are the states of Iowa and Nebraska. Despite their prime location for wind resources and similar synoptic forcings, regulatory issues cause these two states to vary vastly in their wind power offerings. In 2013, Iowa ranked 3rd in the nation for total megawatts installed and generates over a quarter of its electricity from wind energy, more than any other state. In contrast, Nebraska has an order of magnitude fewer turbines installed, and less than five percent of the state’s electrical load is wind-generated. This variance in wind power in close proximity makes Iowa and Nebraska a prime area for initial research.\nThis study uses Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible satellite imagery from the summer of 2009 to 2013 to investigate cumulus development in these adjacent states, as the majority of large-scale wind farms in Iowa were completed by 2009. Image reflectances in Nebraska and Iowa are compared to determine the magnitude of cumulus growth. Preliminary analysis indicates a reduction in cumulus development near the existing wind farms; a synoptic investigation of these cases will be completed to determine causality.",

            "abstract": "Debate over long, and short-term climatic impacts of the Mt. Toba super-eruption circa 75ky is often focused on East Africa. A severe drop in anatomically modern human populations has been hypothesized to be synchronous with a volcanic winter caused by the Toba super-eruption. If the Toba eruption caused a volcanic winter in East Africa, climatologically-sensitive ecosystems, such as Lake Malawi and its immediate watershed should show a direct and observable response in the sediment record. Cooler temperatures would cause a reduction of density contrast between epilimnion and hypolimnion waters, allowing for increased mixing and oxygenation of normally anoxic bottom waters. Enhanced mixing would cause noticeable changes in lake fly and algal communities. Cooler temperatures might also affect precipitation and the fire regime in the surrounding watershed. We analyzed two Lake Malawi cores at the finest practical resolution. Core 2A-10H-2 was analyzed in less than 6-year intervals and core 1C-8H-1 in 7-year intervals surrounding the Youngest Toba Tephra (YTT) for microfaunal abundance and variability, sediment composition, and evidence of changes in the occurrence of fires or watershed precipitation. Our analysis included point counts of diatoms and other algae, lake flies, charcoal, and siliciclastics. Changes in microfossil assemblage, variability, and abundance, as well as sediment composition around the YTT in Core 2A and 1C do not indicate that increased mixing or cooler temperatures occurred in either the central or northern basins of Lake Malawi. Similarly, charcoal counts do not suggest a change in fire regime. Our results indicate that at a subdecadal scale there was no substantial response in Lake Malawi or its immediate watershed to the Mt. Toba super-eruption, in contrast to predictions from the volcanic winter hypothesis.",

The benefit of this framework is that its simplicity makes diagnosing problems easier and its efficiency allows us to test a variety of numerical schemes.

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the responses of the Indian monsoon to greenhouse gas (GHG) warming and to aerosol forcing. A baseline for global warming response is established from analysis of the multi-model mean (MMM) of 33 CMIP5 models based on a 140 year integration of 1% per year CO2 experiment. The relative roles of GHG warming and aerosol forcing are assessed based on the 20th century historical runs, under a) all forcing including GHG and aerosols, and b) GHG only. Results show that as a baseline response to CO2 warming, rainfall generally increases over the Asian monsoon land and adjacent oceanic regions, accompanied by local strengthening of the regional meridional cell . However, the monsoon strength as measured by the large-scale wind shear actually weakens due to increased atmospheric moist static stability. The monsoon response to GHG-only forcing in the historical run is quite similar to the baseline. On the other hand, the aerosol effects as inferred from the difference of the all-forcing and the GHG-only runs, strongly contribute to further weakening of the Asian monsoon through an enhancement of the stability effect, in conjunction with aerosol induced reduction in land-sea temperature difference between Eurasia and the surrounding oceans. Comparing model results with observations, we conclude that while CMIP5 model results have provided useful information for better understanding of large-scale remote forcing aspects of aerosol and GHG impacts mainly through SST changes, the models show little skill in simulating the long-term effects of regional climate change in Asian monsoon regions due to the coarse model resolution and poor representation of regional feedback processes.",

Over ocean, it used the physical a-priori database that was originally constructed for TRMM using TRMM PR and TMI to constrain the solution. The physical nature of this database allowed for the expansion to GMI channels although the high frequency channels were not actually constrained (n > 85 GHz) in the physical solution. The database was modified by removing the lowest atmospheric layers for regions with SST and TPW outside the realm of TRMM observations. Over land, the GPM at-launch database was constructed using coincident overpasses of individual radiometers with coincident data from the National Severe Storms Laboratory’s National Mosaic and multi-sensor Quantitative precipitation estimation (NMQ) system. For the retrieval, GMI was assumed to follow the SSMIS channels. With more than 9 months of GMI data collected, this talk will focus on the quantitative improvements that were achieved by using an a-priori database consistent with the channels and resolution of GMI instead of relying on SSMIS channels. The talk will also describe the technique being employed to develop a more physical database that will be implemented approximately 6 months after the one-year anniversary of GPM.",

            "abstract": "Not only will young adults bear the brunt of climate change’s effects, they are also the ones who will be required to take action – to mitigate and to adapt. The Next Generation Science Standards include climate change, ensuring the topic will be covered in U.S. science classrooms in the near future. Additionally, school is a primary source of information about climate change for young adults. The larger question, though, is how can the teaching of climate change be done in such a way as to ascribe agency – a willingness to act – to students? Framing – as both a theory and an analytic method – has been used to understand how language in the media can affect the audience’s intention to act. Frames function as a two-way filter, affecting both the message sent and the message received. This study adapted both the theory and the analytic methods of framing, applying them to teachers in the classroom to answer the research question: How do teachers frame climate change in the classroom? To answer this question, twenty-five lessons from seven teachers were analyzed using semiotic discourse analysis methods. It was found that the teachers’ frames overlapped to form two distinct discourses: a Science Discourse and a Social Discourse. The Science Discourse, which was dominant, can be summarized as: Climate change is a current scientific problem that will have profound global effects on the Earth’s physical systems. The Social Discourse, used much less often, can be summarized as: Climate change is a future social issue because it will have negative impacts at the local level on people. While it may not be surprising that the Science Discourse was most often heard in these science classrooms, it is possibly problematic if it were the only discourse used. The research literature on framing indicates that the frames found in the Science Discourse – global scale, scientific statistics and facts, and impact on the Earth’s systems – are not likely to inspire action-taking. This study indicates that framing may be a useful theory for investigating how climate change is taught and learned in classrooms. In addition, suggestions are made for how to develop effective professional development for teachers to improve their communication of climate change.",

In mountainous regions, solar radiation reaching the land surface is strongly affected by topographic conditions (e.g., terrain slope and aspect) resulting in unevenly distributed solar radiation. This further affects ecohydrological processes including evapotranspiration, snowmelt, and runoff. However, most distributed hydrological models directly use measured or directly interpolated (e.g. IDW) solar radiation as inputs, not accounting for the topographic effects on solar radiation distribution. In this study, we first implemented a solar radiation spatial interpolation scheme to a fully integrated catchment-scale ecohydrological model by taking into account the topographic effects on direct (shading), diffuse (scattering) and reflected solar radiation. The resulting spatial distribution is more realistic than the direct interpolation. We applied the scheme to Marshall Gulch in Arizona, a mountainous catchment at different spatial resolutions. We will present some modeling results to show the topographic effects on solar radiation distribution, snow mass, vegetation growth, and runoff production, as well as the model sensitivity to modeling resolutions.",

            "abstract": "Axial, Brownbear and Cobb Seamounts, located along and to the west of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR), are the most recent volcanic expressions of the Cobb Hotspot. Cobb Seamount is the oldest (3.3 Ma) and furthest from the hotspot source. Cobb exhibits a circular volcanic edifice that rises from ~2800 m at its base to within 34 m of the sea surface. Multibeam bathymetry of Cobb indicates there are wave-cut terraces at the summit, as well as landslide scars along the flanks of the volcano. Brownbear Seamount (0.5-1.5 Ma) has an elongated (N-S) shape, which indicates an interaction of the hotspot plume with the extensional-stress field of the JdF spreading center. Brownbear also has two (~4 km wide) summit calderas which likely formed due to collapse once plate motion moved the seamount west of the magma source. Axial Seamount, in contrast, is the volcanic edifice directly above hotspot plume and is therefore in a constructional phase. Axial also straddles the ridge and because of this exhibits an elongate structure with well defined rift zones forming its northern and southern flanks. Axial also has a single large summit caldera (~8 km wide) which has been the location of two eruptions in 1998 and 2011 which produced extensive lava flows within the caldera and down the south rift zone. We will present multibeam bathymetry of these three volcanoes, and include the results of previous surveys and observations, to infer the evolution of the volcanic construction and destruction processes through time along this seamount chain.",

            "abstract": "In drylands, spatial and temporal rain variability can result from natural climatic cycles, weather patterns, and physiographic factors. In these environments, minor differences in rainfall distribution can invoke significant ecosystem response. The Grand Canyon, Arizona is an iconic dryland environment that receives less than 430 mm of annual rainfall. Recent monitoring of desertification processes at culturally sensitive landscapes in Grand Canyon has examined variability in vegetation, soil crusts, and runoff induced erosion, and identified a lack of knowledge about the nature, drivers and effects of local rainfall variability. We examine rainfall variability using five years of high resolution data collected from 11 weather stations distributed along the Colorado River within Grand Canyon, coupled with 60 years of lower resolution data from National Weather Service Cooperative Observer (NOAA COOP) stations. We characterize spatial and temporal variability in 10-minute rainfall intensity, an important predictor of soil erosion, and daily rainfall depth, an important predictor of biotic cover. We quantify the intensity-daily depth relationship to infer long-term variability in rainfall intensity from the NOAA COOP data that only record rainfall depth. Results confirm findings from previous studies showing a bi-seasonally rainfall pattern with longer duration-lower intensity storms in the cool season and shorter duration-higher intensity storms during the North American Monsoon (NAM).Seasonal differences in rainfall intensity-depth relationships are significant, and suggest NAM storms have greater potential to produce erosion-generating intensities. As NAM rainfall is spatially and inter-annually more variable than cool season rain, yearly rain depths are strongly influenced by NAM fluctuations. These findings will be useful in future efforts to track desertification processes in this and other drylands characterized by complex topography and extreme rainfall heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "Systematic temporal-compositional variations observed in many monogenetic vent eruption sequences (e.g. decreasing incompatible element concentrations, variation in major element and isotopic compositions) may reflect varying extents of crustal contamination (c.f., [1]), or melting and mixing of small-scale mantle heterogeneities (c.f., [2]). During eruption of the Papoose Canyon (PC) monogenetic vent incompatible trace element concentrations decreased a factor of 2, 87Sr/86Sr decreased (from ~0.7063 to 0.7055), and 143Nd/144Nd increased (from ~0.51246 to 0.51258) (c.f., [2]). Blondes et al. (2008) argued that the relatively primitive melt MgO content and apparent presence of mantle xenoliths in the sequence indicate limited melt storage and crustal contamination prior to eruption, and proposed melting and mixing of two distinct mantle components to explain the variations. However, PC olivine phenocryst compositions (Fo# ~76-89) span a wide range, extending to evolved (low-Fo) compositions, and the vast majority of phenocrysts are more evolved than olivines in equilibrium with the host scoria (Mg# ~87-89). In addition, olivine and clinopyroxene from xenoliths within the early sequence have Mg# (73-87) similar to the phenocrysts, and lower than typical mantle peridotites. Sr-Nd isotopic compositions of the xenoliths are similar to the early PC lavas, but less enriched than the host melts. Therefore, the xenoliths are most likely cognate xenoliths derived from fractionated PC magmas. Finally, both phenocryst and xenolith olivines have δ18O (~5.5 to 5.7 ‰) higher than most mantle peridotites (~5.2 ±0.2 ‰), and clinopyroxene trace element abundances indicate derivation from melts with trace element abundances higher than the most enriched PC lavas. In conjunction, these features suggest that the phenocrysts and xenoliths derive from early PC melts that ponded and fractionated and assimilated continental crust, possibly in crustal sills. These melts were drained and mixed with more primitive melts as the eruption began, and the temporal-compositional trends in part reflect decreasing contaminated sill component over time. These results indicate that even “primitive” melts may contain a significant signature of crustal contamination.\n[1] Erlund et al., 2010.\n[2] Blondes et al., 2008.",

            "abstract": "Salt marshes adapt to changes in sea level by means of biogeomorphological feedback. These feedbacks maintain a dynamic equilibrium with sea level, within limits. Reconstructions of sea-level changes derived from salt‑marsh sediment provide a paleo perspective for evaluating these feedbacks and for predicting the ecological effects of future sea-level rise. The Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM) was modified to accommodate long records of sea level and sediment physical and chemical variables derived from high resolution (decadal and decimeter) reconstruction of sea level spanning the late Holocene using foraminifera preserved in North Carolina salt-marsh sediments. Model outputs from a run of nearly 1100-yr show periods of time when the marsh was predicted to be positioned near the top of the tidal frame (inundation time near zero) and times when the marsh was much deeper in the intertidal zone (inundation time of ca. 0.4). An elevation at mean sea level would correspond to an inundation time of 0.5, which is close to the lower limit of the vegetation and is indicative of a marsh that is just forming or, alternatively, a marsh that is on the verge of collapse. The model also indicates that the standing biomass on the marsh surface and sediment organic matter (SOM) content would have varied in harmony with the inundation time. In times past when the inundation time and the opportunity for mineral sedimentation decreased, the sediment organic matter (SOM) content increased. The low SOM concentration near the marsh surface today is consistent with a marsh that is low in the tidal frame. The SOM depth profile is a function of the relative elevation of the marsh, as well as changes in the input of inorganic sediment to the estuary. To effectively manage and preserve valuable salt-marsh ecosystems it is critical to accurately predict their response to projected sea-level changes.",

            "abstract": "Spatial variability of snow accumulation is controlled by terrain type, time, and other factors, and has proven challenging to measure. Yet snow accumulation plays an important role in hydrological and geodetic issues. For example, glacier-wide mass balance estimates rely on sparsely distributed point measurements, under the assumption that spatial variability around each measurement site is negligible. Moreover, errors in accumulation estimates are substantially greater than those in ablation estimates, primarily due to our inability to model the aforementioned variability.\nTo fill this information gap, we used 500 MHz common offset ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to examine the local representativeness of direct point measurements of snow depth used to estimate glacier-wide mass balance at Taku Glacier in Alaska. During summer 2013, we measured snow depths in four dense 120 m square radar grids centered on ground truth snow pits, and also along longitudinal profiles between these pits. We used the results to characterize accumulation variability over multiple length scales in this maritime climate. Processed GPR traces adjacent to our snowpits resolved depths of wet, isothermal snow within the nominal error of the instrument: approximately ± 15cm. Throughout each grid, the interquartile range (IQR) of GPR-estimated snow depths was less than 10cm. This suggests that in this setting a single snow pit adequately represents nominal snow thickness within each grid, and that elevation provides a dominant control on snow accumulation.",

Research has focused on the attachment of E. coli to solids, E. coli transport in percolating water through soil, in overland flow over bare ground or through vegetation, and of E. coli release from cowpats during rainfall. However, E. coli transport from soil under splash erosion has not been well studied. A small scale rainfall experiment was conducted in which E. coli was mixed with simple soils composed either entirely of sand (250-300 µm) or a 9:1 sand-clay mixture. A variation on the conceptual Hairsine-Rose erosion model was applied to the experiment to help understand the transport processes. Although previous research has documented E. coli attachment to dislodged soil during rainfall, the presence of clay in our experiments did not noticeably affect the total amount or timing of E. coli ejected from the soil; we were not able to determine bacterial attachment to the clay. Our findings suggest that best management practices used to reduce the energy of raindrop impact, such as vegetated buffers, are likely effective for reducing E. coli as well.",

Clouds on Titan have been observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft since its insertion into Saturn’s orbit. A semi-automated method is used to detect cloud events in each VIMS cube acquired since July 2004 and statistics are drawn on the location of the clouds and their evolution. It is shown that the cloud activity has decreased at both pole approaching the equinox, while clouds at southern mid-latitudes are still very active. Close to the equinox, rare but intense cloud activity has also been detected in the equatorial area. After the equinox, the cloud activity has almost completely disappeared, except for rare and small cloud patches at northern high latitudes. Those long-term observations are compared with predictions of Global Circulation Models (GCMs) in order not only to better constrain the models, but also to better understand the processes which drive Titan’s weather and how they interact with Titan's surface.",

The frequency of the plasma oscillations, in the range of 2 to 3 kHz provides evidence for dense plasma directly in the range of the ~0.08 cm-3 expected for the very local interstellar medium. Each of these events has plausible triggers in coronal mass ejection (CME) activity in September-October 2011, March 2012, and May 2012, respectively. The CME activity is thought to coalesce into global merged interaction regions (GMIRs) and associated shocks which can propagate through the solar wind and into the interstellar medium. The GMIR-associated shocks are thought to be sources of electron beams that can excite electron plasma oscillations such as those observed by Voyager. The plasma oscillations were predicted as the source of 2-3 kHz heliospheric radio emissions observed by Voyager beginning in the early 1980s, hence, their discovery in the interstellar medium was long-expected. We discuss the methods by which the propagation of the shocks through the interplanetary and interstellar media can be estimated.",

Mapping was based on data acquired from numerous icebreaker and submarine missions to the polar region. The intent was to create a geologic layer overlying the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean. Analysis of subbottom profiler and multibeam bathymetric data in conjunction with sediment cores and the regional morphology rendered from the IBCAO data were used to map different surficial geologic units. For a relatively small ocean basin, the Arctic Ocean reveals a plethora of margin and basin types reflecting both the complex tectonic origins of the basin and its diverse sedimentation history. Broad and narrow shelves were subjected to a complex ice-margin history in the Quaternary, and bear the sediment types and morphological features as a result. Some shelfal areas are heavily influenced by rivers. Extensive deep water ridges and plateaus are isolated from coastal input and have a long history of hemipelagic deposition. An active spreading ridge and regions of recent volcanism have volcani-clastic and heavily altered sediments. Some regions of the Arctic Ocean are proposed to have been influenced by bolide impact. The flanks of the basins demonstrate complex sedimentation patterns resulting from mass failures and ice-margin outflow. The deep basins of the Arctic Ocean are filled with turbidites resulting from these mass-flows and are interbedded with hemiplegic deposits.",

More accurate specification of thermospheric temperature, a key input to current models such as the High Accuracy Satellite Drag Model, can decrease model density errors. This paper improves the model of Burke et al. (2009) to model thermospheric temperatures using the magnetospheric convective electric field as a driver. In better alignment with Air Force satellite tracking operations, we model the arithmetic mean temperature, T1/2, defined by the Jacchia (1977) model as the mean of the daytime maximum and nighttime minimum exospheric temperatures occurring in opposite hemispheres at a given time, instead of the exospheric temperature used by Burke et al. (2009). Two methods of treating the solar ultraviolet (UV) contribution to T1/2 are tested. Two model parameters, the coupling and relaxation constants, are optimized for 38 storms from 2002 to 2008. Observed T1/2 values are derived from densities and heights measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite. The coupling and relaxation constants were found to vary over the solar cycle and are fit as functions of F10.7a, the 162 day average of the F10.7 index. Model results show that allowing temporal UV variation decreased model T1/2 errors for storms with decreasing UV over the storm period but increased T1/2errors for storms with increasing UV. Model accuracy was found to be improved by separating storms by type (coronal mass ejection or co-rotating interaction region). The model parameter fits established will be useful for improving satellite drag forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Climate and human land use are the main drivers of terrestrial ecosystem methane (CH4) emissions. Wetland expansion and contraction, methane production and release, as well as the interactions of methane with the carbon cycle, are processes critical to the examination of climate change mitigation strategies. This study uses the parallel Integrated Biosphere Simulator (pIBIS) and the State-and-Transition Simulation Model (ST-Sim) to simulate the climate-driven and land-use-driven CH4 emissions in the U.S. from 1973 to 2010. The ST-Sim model is used to backcast annual historical wetland cover from 2010 to 1973 based on recent baseline wetland maps (i.e. National Land Cover Dataset and National Wetland Inventory), historical land cover change trends, and probabilistic spatial multipliers. The pIBIS model is used to simulate the change of wetland water table depth and the production, oxidation, and transportation processes of CH4. Simulations are performed at 1-km spatial resolution using Department of Energy super-computing resources. Post-simulation programs are developed to analyze the spatial distribution and temporal trends of CH4 emissions in relation to inter-annual wetland area variation and climate (rainfall and temperature) variation. Relationships between CH4 emission and carbon sequestration and CO2 emission are also analyzed.\nKeywords: climate change, land cover change, land use change, greenhouse gas, biogeochemical model",

Stochastic tools such as the power spectrum, autocovariance function, structure and climacogram have been among the most powerful. However, the common practice of using solely one of them may lead to process misinterpretation. We introduce a methodology that compares these stochastic tools and seeks the optimal one for different scales in terms of minimizing fitting errors. For validation and illustration purposes, we apply this methodology to various fundamental stochastic processes, such as Markovian, Hurst-Kolmogorov and Cauchy type ones. For each one, we produce Gaussian synthetic time series, we estimate the uncertainty of their expected values and finally, we conclude upon the ones with the smallest uncertainty. Furthermore, we apply this method to a real case time-series of high resolution turbulent flow velocities.",

            "abstract": "Tropical rainfall patterns influence the lives of billions of people both north and south of the Equator. Evidence of major ENSO events such as droughts is often recorded in the oxygen isotopic ratios and aerosol concentrations in tropical ice cores. Here we examine unusual events recorded in three ice cores, two (Quelccaya and Coropuna) in the Southern Hemisphere on the Peruvian Altiplano and the third (Dasuopu) located 22,000 km away on the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau at the top of the Himalayas. These records suggest that the unique lower and middle tropospheric air flow over chloride (Cl-) and fluoride (F-) enriched areas upwind of the sites during ENSO events leads to enhanced deposition of these species on these glaciers. Linkages are demonstrated between ice-core chemistry and drought indicators, changes in lake levels, and ENSO and monsoon indices. Two unusual events, in the late 18th and mid-14th Centuries, are marked by abnormally high concentrations of F- and Cl- in at least two of the ice core records. All three records document a drought from 1789 to 1800 CE in which increases in these anionic concentrations reflect the abundance of continental atmospheric dust derived from arid regions upwind of the core sites. The earlier event, apparent only in the Quelccaya and Dasuopu ice cores, begins abruptly in 1343 and tapers off by 1375. The interaction between high frequency El Niños and low frequency shifts in the inter-tropical convergence zone may have resulted in these unusually severe and extended droughts. These “Black Swan” events correspond to historically documented, devastating population disruptions that were in part climate related. The 1789 to 1800 CE event was concurrent with the Doji Bara famine resulting from extended droughts that led to over 600,000 deaths in central India by 1792. Similarly extensive climate disruptions are documented in Central and South America. The mid-14th Century drought is concomitant with major monsoon failures in India, collapse of the Yang Dynasty in China, and the “Black Death” pandemic that eliminated roughly 30% of the global population. Understanding the characteristics and drivers of these historical events is critical for design of adaptive measures for a world with over seven billion people and unprecedented anthropogenic influences on the climate.",

This study will contribute to the observational dataset by providing a comprehensive collection of satellite observations from multiple passive microwave platforms, as well as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar. The case sample consists of 10 years (2003-2012) of developing (348 cases) and nondeveloping (320 cases) disturbances in the Atlantic, East Pacific, and Central Pacific basins. Nondeveloping disturbances are identified as those disturbances that do not exceed an “invest” classification by the National Hurricane Center. Overall this study will offer a detailed analysis of the properties of both convective and stratiform precipitation multiple days before genesis, while also offering a rare opportunity to determine whether the properties of precipitation at, and just prior to, genesis are unique compared to previous days of the pregenesis stage. By evaluating proxies for convective intensity, raining area and proximity to the disturbance center, results may lend support to the hypothesis that genesis is more closely tied to the fractional coverage of precipitation near the center - not to “intense” convection. The study will also determine whether there are significant differences in the properties of precipitation involved in tropical cyclogenesis among the Atlantic, East and Central Pacific basins, as well as across various subregions of the Atlantic basin. Finally, by synthesizing information on the evolution of precipitation properties with PMW-derived measurements of moisture content (and humidity, when available), a specific emphasis is placed on quantifying moistening within the inner core of the developing disturbances and critically evaluating the hypothesis that a progressive humidification of the midlevels is observed as genesis nears.",

Sufficient rain gauge coverage is necessary for the accurate cataloging of precipitation data used in assessing climatic trends, as well as the study of extreme events on a more localized level. Understanding how representative an in-situ gauge is of its surrounding area is imperative in determining adequate network coverage. Factors such as topography and seasonal influences play a vital role in the spatial variability of precipitation, impacting our ability to interpolate data between point measurements. The nearly universal coverage of radar offers a high-resolution approach to the analysis of areas between in-situ rain gauges.\n\nThe spatial correlation among GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network)-Daily gauge precipitation data and Stage IV gridded radar data is examined. Multiple regions of the United States with varying topography are analyzed seasonally in order to observe the effects these features have on correlation of precipitation.

Research indicates that multiple engagement opportunities, such as mentoring, internships, participation in research, and learning communities, among other interventions, increase student success. This is particularly true for first-generation students and those who are members of underrepresented minority populations. However, it is often difficult to provide such a variety of programs at a significant scale, especially for geographically isolated students and those whose schools have fewer resources. To enable this, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) is convening a coalition of organizations to co-design and implement a concept called Geoscience Learning, Engagement And Development (GeoLEAD).\nGeoLEAD will provide a virtual platform as well as a collaborative infrastructure to help engage, retain, and prepare two- and four-year-college undergraduate Earth, ocean, atmospheric, and space science students (including those students who are interested in becoming majors) for the workforce. It will centralize access to the vast array of already existing programs and services that are currently scattered across multiple organizations, support the development of new services and programs, and simplify the search process by recommending bundles of programs and services based on the students’ profiles and interests. This presentation will highlight the research that led to the development of the GeoLEAD concept, including studies of the ways in which undergraduates use online resources for their education. Additionally, other virtual resources for students that are in the development or implementation stage, such as an online poster competition and a virtual student conference, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Deriving the analysis of rainfall data in various mountainous locations, increase in rainfall that is deemed to be induced by the global climate change is obvious in Kyushu district, western Japan. On this point of view, its long term impact on the forest slope stability is analyzed with field investigation and numerical simulation such as finite element method (FEM). On the other hand, the influence of earthquake such as cracks on the slope due to seismic vibration was also analyzed with FEM. In this case, the slope stability analysis to obtain the factor of safety “Fs” is conducted. Here, in case of the Fs > 1.0, the slope is stable. In addition, the slope stabilizing effect of the forest mainly due to the roots strength is evaluated on some unstable slopes. Simultaneously, a holistic estimation over landslide groups is conducted by comparing “Fs” on forest slopes with non- forest slopes.\n Therefore, the following conclusions are obtained:\n 1) Comparing the Fs without increased rainfall from the previous decade and the one with actual rainfall, the former case is 1.04 ~1.06 times more stable than the latter. 2) On the other hand, the forest slopes are estimated to be up to approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more stable than the slope without forest. Therefore, the slope stabilizing effect by the forest is much higher than the increasing rainfall influence i.e. the climate change effect. These results imply that an appropriate forest existence is important under the climate change condition to prevent forest slope degradation.\n3) Comparing with the destabilization of the slope by seismic activities (vibration) due to the reduction of soil strength and \"cracks = slope deformation\" (8~9 % to 30% reduction in Fs even after an earthquake of 490gal), the influence of the long term rainfall increase on slopes (such as 1% decrease in Fs) is relatively small in the study area.",

First, the geometric distortions are corrected using the best digital elevation model available for a given region. Second, the radiometry is adjusted in the affected foreshortening and layover regions using the pixel-area integration approach for radiometric normalization. The RTC process provides improved backscatter estimates that can be used as input for applications such as the monitoring of deforestation, land-cover classification, and delineation of wet snow covered areas.\nRTC products are distributed at two resolutions. RT1 products with a pixel size of 12.5 m are generated from high-resolution and mid-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). RT2 products are generated at a 30 m level for all available DEMs. Layover and shadow masks as well as incidence angle maps are available for both product resolutions. Products cover landmasses generally from 60 degrees northern latitude to 59 degrees southern latitude. An exception to the rule is the inclusion of all of North America. Excluded landmasses are Greenland, Iceland, Antarctica, and northern Eurasia. Since scientists are generally interested in quantitative measurements that are referenced to the ground, products are distributed in σ0 power.

            "abstract": "Coastal wetlands are at the risk of losing their productivity under increasing rates of sea level rise (SLR). Studies show that under extreme enough stressors, salt marshes will not have time to establish an equilibrium and may migrate landward (Donnelly and Bertness 2001; Warren and Niering 1993) or become open water.\nIn order to investigate salt marsh productivity under SLR scenarios, an integrated hydrodynamic-marsh model was incorporated to dynamically couple physics and biology. The hydrodynamic model calculates mean high water (MHW) and mean low water (MLW) within the river and tidal creeks by analysis of simulated tidal constituents. The response of MHW and MLW is nonlinear due to local changes in the salt marsh platform elevation and biomass productivity. Spatially-varying MHW and MLW are utilized in a biologic model that is a two-dimensional application of the Marsh Equilibrium Model (Morris et al. 2002) to capture the effects of the hydrodynamics on biomass productivity and accretion.\nIncluding accurate marsh table elevations into the model is crucial to obtain accurate biomass productivity results. A lidar-derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is corrected by incorporating Real Time Kinematic (RTK) surveying elevation data. Additionally, salt marshes continually adapt themselves to reach an equilibrium, in which there are ideal ranges of relative SLR and depth of inundation to increase biomass productivity (Morris et al. 2002). The inputs of the model are updated using the biomass productivity results at each coupling time step to capture the interaction between the marsh and hydrodynamic models.\nThe hydro-marsh model is used to assess the effects of four projections of SLR (Parris et al., 2012) on salt marsh productivity for the year 2100 for the marine dominated Grand Bay, MS estuary and the fluvial dominated Apalachicola, FL estuary. The results show higher productivity under a low SLR scenario and less productivity under the intermediate low SLR. Most of the salt marshes become flooded and some of them migrate under higher SLR scenarios. These examples show how this tool can be used in any estuarine system to project salt marsh productivity and accretion under sea level change scenarios to better interpret responses and improve restoration and planning management decisions.",

However, the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) significantly varied in on-site and off-site wells.\nThe results of bench-scale testing indicated that a variety of carbon substrates were effective at reducing the DO to levels that were favorable for reductive dechlorination. The lactate amended bioaugmented microcosms showed the highest level of reductive dechlorination, followed by EOS® amended. However, the indigenous microbial population was not able to successfully degrade PCE to ethene. When a microbial consortium including Dehalococcoides was added to the microcosms, complete reductive dechlorination was observed.\nA pair of recirculation wells was installed to inject the carbon source and microbial population into the groundwater. After a push-pull test was performed to evaluate the mobility of the microbial amendment, lactate was injected to promote highly reduced conditions in the groundwater. Once the ORP was less -150 mV, the Dehalococcoides consortium was injected into the groundwater and recirculated using the paired recirculation wells.\nWithin 3 months after carbon substrate injection, more than a 70% reduction in PCE and TCE was observed in the downgradient monitor well. Likewise, there was a significant decrease in ORP in the impacted wells. This presentation will discuss how the amendments impacted the chlorinated solvent concentrations, microbial community and chemistry of the groundwater in the area around the recirculation wells compared to non-impacted wells.",

            "abstract": "Iron formations (IF) preserve a history of Precambrian oceanic elemental abundance that can be exploited to address nutrient limitations on early biological productivity. In 2009 we reported that secular trends in IF Ni/Fe ratios record a reduced flux of Ni to the oceans ca. 2.7 billion years ago, which we attribute to decreased eruption of Ni-rich ultramafic rocks1. We determined that dissolved Ni concentrations may have reached ~400 nM throughout much of the Archean, but dropped below ~200 nM by 2.5 Ga and to modern day values (~9 nM) by ~550 Ma. As Ni is a key metal cofactor in several enzymes of methanogens, its decline would have stifled their activity in the ancient oceans and disrupted the supply of biogenic methane. Here we provide an updated compilation of Ni concentrations and Ni/Fe ratios in Precambrian iron formations based on a greatly expanded (>3 fold) dataset. We frame our rock record compilation in the context of new experiments examining the partitioning and mobility of Ni during simulated diagenesis of Ni-doped iron formation mineral precursors, as well as a fresh look at Ni-Fe scaling relationships in IF vs. modern Fe-rich chemical sediments. While its potential effects on atmospheric oxygenation remains to be fully resolved2, our new results reaffirm the Paleoproterozoic Ni famine, whereby the enzymatic reliance of methanogens on a diminishing supply of volcanic Ni links mantle cooling to the trajectory of Earth surface biogeochemical evolution.\nKonhauser KO, et al.

            "abstract": "The results of the technological breakthroughs in computing that have taken place over the last few decades makes it possible to achieve emergency management objectives that focus on saving human lives and decreasing economic effects. In particular, the integration of a wide variety of information sources, including observations from spatially-referenced physical sensors and new social media sources, enables better real-time seismic hazard analysis through distributed computing networks. The main goal of this work is to utilize innovative computational algorithms for better real-time seismic risk analysis by integrating different data sources and processing tools into streaming and cloud computing applications.\nThe Geological Survey of Canada operates the Canadian National Seismograph Network (CNSN) with over 100 high-gain instruments and 60 low-gain or strong motion seismographs. The processing of the continuous data streams from each station of the CNSN provides the opportunity to detect possible earthquakes in near real-time. The information from physical sources is combined to calculate a location and magnitude for an earthquake. The automatically calculated results are not always sufficiently precise and prompt that can significantly reduce the response time to a felt or damaging earthquake. Social sensors, here represented as Twitter users, can provide information earlier to the general public and more rapidly to the emergency planning and disaster relief agencies. We introduce joint streaming data processing from social and physical sensors in real-time based on the idea that social media observations serve as proxies for physical sensors. By using the streams of data in the form of Twitter messages, each of which has an associated time and location, we can extract information related to a target event and perform enhanced analysis by combining it with physical sensor data. Results of this work suggest that the use of data from social media, in conjunction with the development of innovative computing algorithms, when combined with sensor data can provide a new paradigm for real-time earthquake detection in order to facilitate rapid and inexpensive natural risk reduction.",

            "abstract": "The flux of biologically-produced organic carbon from the surface ocean (the biological pump) plays an important role in maintaining the pCO2 of the atmosphere and the oxygen content within the ocean interior. Evaluating this flux and the mechanisms controlling it are necessary to determine marine carbon cycle feedback to climate change. The three primary methods for determining the biological pump: field measurements, satellite remote sensing, and global climate models suggest different geographic distributions of the flux. The accuracy of model and remote sensing results can be judged against field measurements with the assumption that annual net community production (ANCP) is equal to biological carbon export on time scales of a year or more. Three time-series test cases comparing: satellite-derived carbon export, ANCP determined from oxygen and inorganic carbon mass balances, and sediment trap fluxes, demonstrate the complexities of interpreting satellite data. Field determinations indicate much less geographic variability of the biological pump than satellite-derived fluxes, but annual measurements are not presently sufficient in number or geographic distribution to provide credible calibration. One approach for expanding the number of field estimates of the biological pump is to follow decades of oxygen mass balance studies at ocean time-series stations in which ANCP has been stoichiometrically related to annual net biological oxygen production calculated from models of time-series O2 measurements. Unmanned platforms provide a feasible, affordable method for increasing the number of oxygen time-series locations. About ten percent of the profiling floats of the Argo program have oxygen sensors, but until recently the accuracy of O2 measurements has not been sufficient to determine the air-sea oxygen flux, which is the major term in the upper ocean mass balance. Recent in situ calibration methods for O2 sensors suggest it is now feasible to measure accurate oxygen concentrations that can be used to determine the net annual biological oxygen production, and hence the biological carbon pump, in a wide variety of productivity regimens of the world’s oceans.",

            "abstract": "Thunderstorms emit bursts of energetic radiation. Moreover, lightning stepped leader produces x-ray pulses. The phenomena, their interrelation and impact on Earth's atmosphere and near space are not fully understood yet.\nIn-flight Lightning Strike Damage Assessment System ILDAS is developed in a EU FP6 project ( http://ildas.nlr.nl/ ) to provide information on threat that lightning poses to aircraft. It consists of 2 E-field sensors, and a varying number of H-field sensors. It has recently been modified to include two LaBr3 scintillation detectors. The scintillation detectors are sensitive to x- and gamma-rays above 30 keV. The entire system is installed on A-350 aircraft and digitizes data with 100Msamples/sec rate when triggered by lightning. A continuously monitoring channel counts the number of occurrences that the x-ray signal exceeds a set of trigger levels. In the beginning of 2014 the aircraft flies through thunderstorm cells collecting the data from the sensors. The x-rays generated by the lightning flash are measured in synchronization with the lightning current information during a period of 1 second around the strike. The continuous channel stores x-ray information with less time and amplitude resolution during the whole flight. That would allow x-rays from TGFs and continuous gamma-ray glow of thundercloud outside that 1 s time window.\nWe will give an overview of the ILDAS system and show that the x-ray detection works as intended. Fast x-ray bursts are detected during stepped/dart stepped leader. Data analysis of continuous channel recordings will be presented.",

As part of our NASA funded outreach program, we conducted a test of learning in a portable Discovery Dome as contrasted with learning the same materials (visuals and sound track) on a computer screen. We tested 200 middle school students (primarily underserved minorities). Paired t-tests and an independent t-test were used to compare the amount of learning that students achieved. Interest questionnaires were administered to participants in formal (public school) settings and focus groups were conducted in informal (museum camp and educational festival) settings. Overall results from the informal and formal educational setting indicated that there was a statistically significant increase in test scores after viewing We Choose Space. There was a statistically significant increase in test scores for students who viewed We Choose Space in the portable Discovery Dome (9.75) as well as with the computer (8.88). However, long-term retention of the material tested on the questionnaire indicated that for students who watched We Choose Space in the portable Discovery Dome, there was a statistically significant long-term increase in test scores (10.47), whereas, six weeks after learning on the computer, the improvements over the initial baseline (3.49) were far less and were not statistically significant. The test score improvement six weeks after learning in the dome was essentially the same as the post test immediately after watching the show, demonstrating virtually no loss of gained information in the six week interval. In the formal educational setting, approximately 34% of the respondents indicated that they wanted to learn more about becoming a scientist, while 35% expressed an interest in a career in space science. In the informal setting, 26% indicated that they were interested in pursuing a career in space science.",

            "abstract": "As climate change is realized, the assumption of hydrometeorologic stationarity embedded within many hydrologic models is no longer valid over the Colorado River Basin. As such, resource managers have begun to request more information to support decisions, specifically with regards to the incorporation of climate change information and operational risk. To this end, ensemble methodologies have become increasingly popular among the scientific and forecasting communities, and resource managers have begun to incorporate this information into decision support tools and operational models. Over the Colorado River Basin, reservoir operations are determined, in large part, by forecasts issued by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC). The CBRFC produces both single value and ensemble forecasts for use by resource managers in their operational decision-making process. These ensemble forecasts are currently driven by a combination of daily updating model states used as initial conditions and weather forecasts plus historical meteorological information used to generate forecasts with the assumption that past hydroclimatological conditions are representative of future hydroclimatology. Recent efforts have produced updated bias-corrected and spatially downscaled projections of future climate over the Colorado River Basin. In this study, the historical climatology used as input to the CBRFC forecast model is adjusted to represent future projections of climate based on data developed by the updated projections of future climate data. Ensemble streamflow forecasts reflecting the impacts of climate change are then developed. These forecasts are subsequently compared to non-informed ensemble streamflow forecasts to evaluate the changing range of streamflow forecasts and risk over the Colorado River Basin. Ensemble forecasts may be compared through the use of a reservoir operations planning model, providing resource managers with ensemble information regarding changing future water supply, availability, and reservoir management. Further efforts seek to combine the utility of hydrologic models with a dynamic evapotranspiration component to evaluate impacts due to changes in evapotranspiration rates or develop unique climate patterns with the use of a stochastic weather generator.",

We argue that these changes in communication pose particular challenges for science communication around politically charged issues such as climate change, because they create mini-echo chambers that can feed cultural wars. To overcome these challenges the scientific community must rethink how we engage the public.

In addition to direct applications of these precipitation estimates, they will serve as a crucial reference for cross-calibrating passive microwave precipitation profile estimates from the GPM radiometer constellation. And through the microwave radiometer estimates, the combined algorithm calibration will ultimately be propagated to GPM infrared-microwave multisatellite estimates of surface rainfall.\nThe GPM combined DPR-GMI precipitation algorithm is based upon an ensemble filtering technique. At each DPR footprint location, an initial estimate is made of the distribution of possible precipitation profiles consistent with DPR Ku reflectivity observations and a priori information regarding the intercepts of the assumed size distributions of precipitation particles and parameters describing environmental conditions. This Ku-consistent profile distribution is filtered using coincident DPR Ka reflectivities, the vertical path-integrated attenuation at Ku and Ka bands, and GMI brightness temperature observations. The resulting filtered distribution of precipitation profiles is consistent with all of the available data and a priori information; the mean of the profiles gives the best estimate of precipitation, and the standard deviation is a measure of the uncertainty of that estimate.\nThe DPR-GMI algorithm will be evaluated by comparing estimated reflectivity and precipitation profiles against ground-based polarimetric radar data, and also by checking that the “best fit” precipitation distributions lead to forward radiative model simulations that are generally unbiased with respect to the observations. The impacts of multiple scattering, footprint subgrid-scale variability, representation of precipitation particle size distributions, scattering properties of ice-phase precipitation, and surface characteristics on forward radiative modeling and estimated precipitation will be discussed at the conference.",

            "abstract": "Heavy ions observed near 1 AU, especially in fast solar wind, tend to have thermal speeds that are approximately equal, indicative of a mass proportional temperature. Additionally, observations near 1 AU have shown a streaming of heavy ions (Z>4) along the magnetic field direction at speeds faster than protons. The differential velocities observed are of the same order but typically less than the Alfven speed. Previous analysis of the behavior of ion thermal velocities with Ulysses-SWICS, focusing on daily average properties of 35 ion species at 5 AU, found only a small systematic trend with respect to q2/m.\nUtilizing improved data processing techniques, results from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) onboard the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) shed new light on the thermal properties of the heavy ion population at 1 AU. A clear dependence of heavy ion thermal behavior on q2/m has now been found in the recent ACE-SWICS two hour cadence data set at 1 AU. Examining the thermal velocities of about 70 heavy ion species relative to alpha particles (He2+) shows a distinct trend from equal thermal speed toward equal temperature with increasing q2/m. When examined for solar winds of different collisional ages, the observations indicate the extent of thermal relaxation present in different solar wind types. We explore this collisional dependence with a model for the collisional thermal relaxation of the heavy ions as the solar wind propagates out to 1 AU. This model is used to subtract out the collisional effects seen in the ACE-SWICS data, providing an estimate for the temperature distribution among heavy ions at the corona to be compared to remote sensing observations that have shown that heavy ions are preferentially heated at the corona. We will discuss how this new analysis elucidates the thermal behavior and evolution of heavy ions in the solar wind, along with implications for the upcoming Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions.",

            "abstract": "In this work we perform a tomographic inversion of teleseismic data to investigate the properties of the crust and the uppermost mantle beneath the eastern Tennessee seismic zone (ETSZ). The ETSZ is a major seismic feature located in the southeastern United States. The zone spans portions of eastern Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia and Alabama and is, after the New Madrid seismic zone, the second most active seismic region of the North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Earthquakes in the ETSZ appear to align along a sharp, linear magnetic feature, called the New York-Alabama Lineament (NYAL), which acts as the northwest edge of the seismic zone and is attributed to a strike-slip fault affecting the Precambrian basement.\nA total of 2652 relative P-wave arrival time residuals from 201 teleseismic events recorded at 28 regional seismic station have been extracted from the continuous records using the adaptive stacking code. The three-dimensional model was computed down to 300km. The tomographic images show significant velocity anomalies, confirming complex tectonic evolution and revealing basement features that can be correlated with regional gravity and magnetic anomalies. One of the main features of the three-dimensional model is a significant velocity contrast across the NYAL that extends through the crust and the uppermost mantle, with high velocity anomalies northwest of the NYAL and lower velocities southwest of the NYAL. Our results support the hypothesis that the lineament is a major basement fault associated with a tectonic boundary produced by merging of the southern Appalachian basement with the Granite-Rhyolite basement during the Grenville orogeny.",

            "abstract": "In November 2013, a sequence of earthquakes began in Reno and Azle, TX, two communities located northwest of Fort Worth in an area of active oil and gas extraction. Only one felt earthquake had been reported within the area before the occurrence of probable injection-induced earthquakes at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in 2008. The USGS National Earthquakes Information Center (NEIC) has reported 27 felt earthquakes in the Reno-Azle area through January 28, 2014. A temporary seismic network was installed beginning in December 2013 to acquire data to improve location and magnitude estimates and characterize the earthquake sequence. Here, we present high-resolution relative earthquake locations derived using differential time data from waveform cross-correlation. Cross-correlation is computed using the GISMO software suite and event relocation is done using double difference relocation techniques. Waveform cross-correlation of the local data indicates high (>70%) similarity between 4 major swarms of events lasting between 18 and 24 hours. These swarms are temporal zones of high event frequency; 1.4% of the time series data accounts for 42.1% of the identified local earthquakes. Local earthquakes are occurring along the Newark East Fault System, a NE-SW striking normal fault system previously thought inactive at depths between 2 and 8 km in the Ellenburger limestone formation and underlying Precambrian basement. Data analysis is ongoing and continued characterization of the associated fault will provide improved location estimates.",

            "abstract": "The use of ensemble prediction systems allows for an uncertainty estimation of the forecast. Most end users do not require all the information contained in an ensemble and prefer the use of a single uncertainty measure. This measure is the ensemble spread which serves to forecast the forecast error. It is however unclear how best the quality of these forecasts can be performed, based on spread and forecast error only.\nThe spread-error verification is intricate for two reasons: First for each probabilistic forecast only one observation is substantiated and second, the spread is not meant to provide an exact prediction for the error. Despite these facts several advances were recently made, all based on traditional deterministic verification of the error forecast. In particular, Grimit and Mass (2007) and Hopson (2014) considered in detail the strengths and weaknesses of the spread-error correlation, while Christensen et al (2014) developed a proper-score extension of the mean squared error.\nHowever, due to the strong variance of the error given a certain spread, the error forecast should be preferably considered as probabilistic in nature. In the present work, different probabilistic error models are proposed depending on the spread-error metrics used. Most of these models allow for the discrimination of a perfect forecast from an imperfect one, independent of the underlying ensemble distribution.\nThe new spread-error scores are tested on the ensemble prediction system of the European Centre of Medium-range forecasts (ECMWF) over Europe and Africa.\n",

            "abstract": "Wildland fires are a frequent occurrence in many regions of the world. These fires are the result of interactions between climate/weather, fuels, and people. Our climate and associated day-to-day weather may be changing rapidly due to human activities that may have dramatic and unexpected impacts on regional and global fire activity. Existing studies suggest a general overall increase in area burned and fire occurrence although there is substantial temporal and spatial variability. Even though there are indications that fire severity and intensity are increasing, future trends are more complex due to the non-linear interactions between weather, vegetation and people. Research also showed that coupled with climate change, increasing fire severity is critical to water resources through impacts on runoff and erosion. Climate change, wildland fires, and water are therefore inseparable in future resource management.\nA warmer world means a longer fire season, more lightning activity, and most importantly drier fuels makes it easier for fires to start and spread. Recent research suggests that changes in the jet stream may result in more extreme weather that will lead to more fire activity. Land, fire, and water management will be even more challenging in a warmer world.",

This study shows that there is no unique way to partition temperature change into components associated with individual feedbacks. Alarmingly, different partitioning approaches lead to conflicting conclusions about which processes are important in driving inter-model spread in climate sensitivity. Moreover, covariances between feedbacks is found to play an important yet largely ignored role in determining inter-model spread in climate response. We find, however, that the feedback definition of Held and Shell (2012), which assumes a fixed relative humidity for the baseline climate response, produces results that are more consistent across partitioning methods and are less dominated by covariance terms.",

            "abstract": "Configuration-space models address the intermediate scale ESF structure range from hundreds of kilometers to hundreds of meters. It is well known that ESF structure is comprised of highly-elongated field-aligned striations. Striations are generated by physics-based ESF codes. Moreover, they are visually observable in twilight barium releases and air glow. Configuration-space models are derived from ensembles of field-aligned striations with specified radial profile functions, distributions of scale sizes, and distributions of clustered field-line starting locations. The model is intimately tied to underlying physics. The scale-dependent evolution of a field-aligned local plasma enhancement is a well posed plasma-physics problem. Local striation creation, evolution, and intensity is driven by the convective instability process. Successive bifurcation is often used to describe the Rayleigh-Taylor mechanism.\nThe model makes no prior assumptions that ensure standard spectral decompositions. Indeed, the model shows that there is no possibility of constructing a consistent three-dimensional structure spectrum. The model does show that in planes intersecting field lines well removed from the meridian plane two-dimensional spectra can be constructed. There is a one-to-one relation between the striation size distribution and the index of the corresponding power-law segments. The profile shape controls the texture of the realizations. A critical number of randomly located striations are required to support a well-defined spectral characterization.\nThe configuration space model is defined by a much smaller number of random variables than required to generate a realization of a process with specified spectral characteristics. Thus, it is feasible to generate a three-dimensional realization that can be used to simulate ESF and to interpret planned space-time Cubsat measurements. The theory will be reviewed and examples of model applications presented.",

            "abstract": "Recent summers in the United States have been plagued by intense droughts that have caused significant economic impact to society that could be reduced through seasonal prediction. Skillful seasonal predictions of drought relevant variables are possible due to the slowly varying boundary conditions and their predictability. In particular, during the convective season, when the potential of extreme drought is the highest, the soil moisture can provide a means of predictability through land-atmosphere (L-A) interactions. There has been a significant amount of work in the last decade to better understand the predictability of L-A interactions. In particular, recent work has developed a classification approach that was the basis for a new Coupling Drought Index (CDI) and the development of the Coupling Statistical Model (CSM), which uses a Markov Chain framework to make statistical predictions. The CDI and CSM have been used to understand the predictability of L-A interactions in NCEP’s Climate Forecasts System version 2 (CFSv2) and indicated that there were strong biases in the coupling that produced biases in the precipitation and limited the predictability of drought. Although the CDI and CSM have been useful in understanding L-A coupling and seasonal predictability, the extent to which the classification is influenced by large-scale climate factors (SSTs) is unknown. In this work the CDI and CSM are used to evaluate the NASA GMAO modeling framework through the MERRA reanalysis and AMIP runs using the GEOS-5 model in order to isolate the impact of SSTs on the coupling metrics. The analysis focuses on 1979 to present with a particular emphasis on drought years. In addition to the CDI and CSM, other metrics that diagnose the coupling between the land and atmosphere are also used in order to further assess the CDI and CSM as coupling metrics. These results are also compared with those from previous studies using the CFSv2, in order to understand the extent to which these results are model specific and to provide a better understanding of the impact of land-atmosphere interactions on seasonal prediction.",

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard the EOS-Aura satellite provides information on aerosol optical properties by making use of the large sensitivity to aerosol absorption and dark surface albedo in the UV spectral region. These unique features enable us to retrieve both aerosol extinction optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) successfully from radiance measurements at 354 and 388 nm by the OMI near UV aerosol algorithm (OMAERUV). Recent improvements to algorithms in conjunction with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) carbon monoxide data also reduce uncertainties due to aerosol layer heights and types significantly in retrieved products. We present validation results of OMI AOD against space and time collocated Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measured AOD values over multiple stations representing major aerosol episodes and regimes. We also compare the OMI SSA against the inversion made by AERONET as well as an independent network of ground-based radiometer called SKYNET in Japan, China, South-East Asia, India, and Europe. The outcome of the evaluation analysis indicates that in spite of the “row anomaly” problem, affecting the sensor since mid-2007, the long-term aerosol record shows remarkable sensor stability.

Geochemical studies have been done on nearly 65 beach sediments collected from inter-tidal regions of Amanzi Toti, Isipingo, Bluff, Cutting and southern part of Durban beaches. The study was done in order to unravel the anthropogenic and natural geochemical signals. Total (TTMs) and partially extracted trace metals (PETMs) (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, Zn) in sediments were evaluated along with organic carbon and carbonates. Evaluation of enrichment of geochemical elements were done using contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), ecological risk index (RI) and geoaccumulation index (Igeo) to understand the pollution status of the study area and it indicates that As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn are enriched by two to three folds from the natural background values. Uncontrolled tourism activities have led to increase of certain elements in the Durban beaches. Textural analysis provides the information regarding the dominance of sediments either in sand fraction, mud fraction or gravel. The results indicated that they are dominantly coarse grained except in regions where local river input is observed. Industrial development as well as the mining activities in few locations near the coast has led to increase in the elemental concentrations. Regular monitoring of enrichment levels of trace metals in the sediments is mandatory to assess the beach quality in order to restore them from further enrichment so that the biological system in this region is also preserved.\nKeywords: Tourism, Beach sediments, Trace metals, contamination indices.",

The Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments provide broadband shortwave and longwave radiance measurements. These radiances are converted to fluxes by using scene type dependent Angular Distribution Models (ADMs). This paper describes the next-generation ADMs that are developed for Terra and Aqua using all available CERES rotating azimuth plane radiance measurements. Coincident cloud and aerosol retrievals, and radiance measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological parameters from Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) data assimilation version 5.4.1 are used to define scene type. CERES radiance measurements are stratified by scene type and by other parameters that are important for determining the anisotropy of the given scene type. Anisotropic factors are then defined either for discrete intervals of relevant parameters or as a continuous functions of combined parameters, depending on the scene type. Compared to the existing ADMs, the new ADMs change the monthly mean instantaneous fluxes by up to 5 Wm-2 on a regional scale of 1o latitude by 1o longitude, but the flux changes are less than 0.5 Wm-2 on a global scale.",

Similarly, OMI ozone agrees well with ozone from an average of 73 northern hemisphere Dobson and Brewer stations, and OMI ozone also agrees well with data from the recently launched OMPS ozone nadir mapper on NPP for the two year period of overlap.",

            "abstract": "The Hall et al. (1995) report announcing the discovery of atomic oxygen FUV emission from Europa included a conclusion that the atmosphere was dominated by O2. Over the following 20 years publications referencing the atmosphere accepted this conclusion, and calculations of rates, particularly mass loading of the magnetosphere depended on a composition that was of order 90% O2. Analysis of the Europa emission spectrum in the present work, leads to the conclusion that the O I emission properties were misinterpreted. The interpretation of the source process depends on the ratio of the O I 1356 and 1304 A multiplet emissions (R(4:5) = (I(1356)/I(1304)). The value of R(4:5) never reaches the lower limit for electron impact dissociation of O2 for any of the 7 recorded disk averaged measurements between 1994 and 2013. Analysis of the Cassini UVIS exposures show the 1304 A multiplet to be optically thick, and the emissions are modeled as direct electron and solar photon excitation of O I. The result is a model atmosphere dominated by O I and O II, with neutral density a factor of 100 below the original O2 model. Other considerations show incompatibility with an O2 atmosphere. Deep exposures using the Cassini UVIS EUV spectrograph provide the state of the plasma sheet at Europa. The ion species are identified as mainly outwardly diffused mass from the Io plasma torus with a minor contribution from Europa. Plasma time-constants are of the order of 200 days. Neutral species in the plasma sheet are not measureable. The energy flux in the magnetosphere L-shells are mainly responsible for energy deposition maintaining the plasma sheet. The energy content in the Io and Europa L-shells, as measured, is similar, but the mean radiative cooling rate in the Io plasma torus at the time of the Cassini encounter was 565 femtoergs cm-3 s-1, compared to 7.3 at Europa, reflecting the difference between an active and inactive planetary satellite, particularly considering the fact that most of the radiation at the Europa plasma sheet is from ions that originated at the orbit of Io. The stochastic observational evidence in disk averaged Europa oxygen emission obtained over the 1994 to 2012 period shows no indication of transient events. A significant neutral transient injection in the Europa plasma sheet would take of order year time-scales to relax to steady state",

            "abstract": "Climate extremes have and will continue to cause significant variations of local and regional groundwater hydrology. It is important to understand the effects of climate extremes on groundwater recharge to properly manage water resources. Using the Soil Water Balance Model (SWB) and Maurer’s 1/8-degree daily climatology datasets, this study investigates the dynamics of groundwater recharge of the Ogallala Aquifer in the second half of the 20th century relative to trends of two temperature and six precipitation extreme indices, including consecutive dry days (CDD), consecutive wet days (CWD), heavy precipitation days (ND95), annual total precipitation from heavy precipitation events (TP95), annual total precipitation from wet days (PRCPTOT), annual maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5), annual hot days (TX90) and annual hot nights (TN90). The results show that the highest recharge was about 110 mm yr-1 in eastern Nebraska, followed by central Nebraska and western Kansas, with recharge values of 45 mm yr-1. The range of recharge for the rest of the aquifer area was 0-20 mm yr-1. Temporally, the overall groundwater recharge significantly (p<0.05) increased throughout the Ogallala Aquifer. Spatially, groundwater recharge significantly increased in central Nebraska, eastern Wyoming and parts of northern Texas, while it decreased from southwestern Nebraska to the northern boundary of Texas. The study area experienced enhanced temperature and precipitation extremes over the 50 year period. The changing trends of hot temperatures were not spatially uniform: increasing hot days occurred in the northwestern Ogallala, parts of the central Ogallala, and the entire southern Ogallala; while decreasing hot nights occurred in the northeastern, central, and southern Ogallala. Increases in trends of precipitation extremes were more spatially uniform. Based on spatial non-parameter correlation analysis, increasing precipitation extremes may decrease groundwater recharge in regions with less annual total precipitation, but may increase groundwater recharge in regions with sufficient precipitation. Therefore, policy-makers need to be aware of the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of extreme precipitation events, especially in arid regions.",

Moreover, from a dynamical perspective the extratropical UTLS is highly affected by baroclinic life cycles. Since both the TIL and STE emerge, amongst many other features, during simulated baroclinic life cycles, we study whether there is a relationship between the TIL and STE.\nWe use the non-hydrostatic model COSMO in an idealized mid-latitude channel configuration to simulate baroclinic life cycles. In a first step contributions of individual diabatic processes from turbulence, radiation, and cloud microphysics to the formation of the TIL are analyzed. These results are compared to those from adiabatic simulations in which the TIL forms during the life cycles with the limitation of being less sharp than in observations. Furthermore, passive tropospheric and stratospheric tracers are used to identify STE. Regions of STE are then analyzed with respect to the temporal evolution of the static stability above the tropopause.\nThe results suggest that radiative effects, especially from water vapor, have the largest additional contribution to the TIL formation, while additional individual effects of cloud microphysics are almost negligible. STE occurs in all diabatic simulations but its strength depends highly on how the underlying diabatic process can affect the thermal and dynamical structure in the tropopause region. Weak STE is found when considering cloud microphysics, while STE is stronger in case of using turbulence and radiation. Tropopause-based vertical profiles of the tropospheric tracers show in some cases similarities with observed tracer profiles of CO.",

            "abstract": "We model the evolution of a salt diapir during sedimentation and study how deposition and salt movement affect stresses within the sedimentary wall rocks. We model the salt as a solid visco-plastic material and the sediments as a poro-elastoplastic materials, using a generalized Modified Cam Clay model. The salt flows because ongoing sedimentation increases the average density within the overburden sediments, pressurizing the salt. Stresses rotate within the sediments, such that the maximum principal stress is perpendicular to the contact with the salt. The minimum principal stress is in the circumferential direction, and drops near the salt. The mean stress increases near the upper parts of the diapir, leading to a porosity that is lower than predicted for uniaxial burial at the same depth. We built this axisymmetric model within the large-strain finite-element program Elfen. Because we simulate sedimentation simultaneously with the movement of the salt, our study offers two major achievements distinct from previous work on salt-diapir and sediment interaction: the salt is not kinematically prescribed and the stresses within the basin develop as a function of both the depositional process and the loading from the salt. Our results highlight the fact that forward modeling can provide a detailed understanding of the stress history of sediments close to salt diapirs; this is critical for predicting stress, porosity, and pore pressure in the wall rocks and more generally understanding earth processes related to salt systems.",

Parent involvement is defined as parent participating in the educational processes and experiences of their children. A chi-square analysis was used to analyze data collected from the pre survey and the post survey administered to participants in the workshop. The study revealed all of the individual components of parent involvement were positively and significantly related to educational goals. The study identified various aspects of parent involvement that yielded statistically significant results in affirming that parent involvement attributed to urban student achievement. These findings were particularly helpful for indicating which kinds of parent involvement influenced academic success. Most notably, parent expectations and styles demonstrated a strong relationship with scholastic outcomes. Parent expectations and styles created an educationally oriented ambience that established an understanding of the certain level of support the child needed to succeed academically.

            "abstract": "Lakes are a key feature of arctic landscapes and can be an important component of regional organic carbon budgets. Although numerous, arctic lakes are comparatively under-studied and organic carbon burial rates are not well prescribed. Moreover, it has been proposed that regional warming will increase aquatic production in the Arctic. Here we test this hypothesis using 210Pb-dated sediment cores from SW Greenland, an area that did not warm appreciably during the 20th century. Organic carbon accumulation rates (OC AR) were estimated for 16 lakes that cover a climate gradient from the dry, continental interior to the wetter coastal margin. The study span a range of water chemistries (conductivity values range 25–3400 uS/cm), lake areas (<4–77 ha), and maximum depths (range ~10–50 m); the average OC AR rate (derived from all lakes) corrected for sediment focussing (using the mean 210Pb flux method) was low (<3 g C m^2/yr). Twelve lakes showed an increase in mean OC AR for the time period covered by 210Pb, possibly attributable to global environmental change processes (for example, reactive N deposition) rather than climate warming. There are ca. 20,000 lakes in the study area ranging from ~1 ha to >130 km^2, although over 83% of lakes are <10 ha. The mean post-1950 OC AR (3.5 g C m^2/yr) was extrapolated to all lakes <100 ha and a lower rate of ca. 2 g C m^2/yr to large lakes (>1000 ha) and suggests a regional annual lake OC burial rate of ca. 11 x 10^9 g C/yr after 1950. These burial rates are also compared with estimates of CO2 fluxes from the lakes. The implications of these data and their associated limitations (problems of determining C burial in remote lakes, regional upscaling, in-lake spatial variability, post-depositional mineralization) for regional carbon sequestration by lakes are discussed.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution mesoscale simulations, when applied for downscaling meteorological fields over large spatial domains and for extended time periods, can provide valuable information for many practical application scenarios including the weather-dependent renewable energy industry. In the present study, a strategy has been proposed to dynamically downscale coarse-resolution meteorological fields from Environment Canada's regional analyses for a period of multiple years over the entire Canadian territory. The study demonstrates that a continuous mesoscale simulation over the entire domain is the most suitable approach in this regard.\nLarge-scale deviations in the different meteorological fields pose the biggest challenge for extended-range simulations over continental scale domains, and the enforcement of the lateral boundary conditions is not sufficient to restrict such deviations. A scheme has therefore been developed to spectrally nudge the simulated high-resolution meteorological fields at the different model vertical levels towards those embedded in the coarse-resolution driving fields derived from the regional analyses. A series of experiments were carried out to determine the optimal nudging strategy including the appropriate nudging length scales, nudging vertical profile and temporal relaxation. A forcing strategy based on grid nudging of the different surface fields, including surface temperature, soil-moisture, and snow conditions, towards their expected values obtained from a high-resolution offline surface scheme was also devised to limit any considerable deviation in the evolving surface fields due to extended-range temporal integrations.\nThe study shows that ensuring large-scale atmospheric similarities helps to deliver near-surface statistical scores for temperature, dew point temperature and horizontal wind speed that are better or comparable to the operational regional forecasts issued by Environment Canada. Furthermore, the meteorological fields resulting from the proposed downscaling strategy have significantly improved spatiotemporal variance compared to those from the operational forecasts, and any time series generated from the downscaled fields do not suffer from discontinuities due to switching between the consecutive forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Flocculation is the process in which cohesive sediments amalgamate to form larger aggregates or flocs. The two factors that strongly influence the flocculation of mud are the turbulent shear rate and the suspended sediment concentration. Increases in turbulent shear rate are known to decrease the time to equilibrium and limit floc size. Increases in concentration are typically thought to decrease the time to equilibrium and increase the final equilibrium floc size. In this laboratory study, the effect of concentration on the growth rate and equilibrium size of flocs is systematically investigated. A camera system and image processing program were used to observe and analyze the evolution of flocs created by of a mixture of 80% kaolinite and 20% montmorillonite clay at six different concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/L). Each mixture was first sonicated for 15 minutes before being introduced to a tank of tap water being mixed at an turbulent shear rate of G = 58 s-1. Flocs were then allowed to grow for two hours. During the following hour, a much higher shear rate of G = 1200 s-1 was applied to break the flocs. The shear rate was then reduced back to and maintained at G = 58 s-1 for another six hours. Running the experiments in this way allowed for the observation of floc growth from two different initial particle states at each concentration, resulting in a total of 12 floc growth experiments. The primary conclusions from this set of experiments are: (1) higher suspended sediment concentration is correlated with a higher rate of floc growth, and (2) at equilibrium, the average floc size stabilizes at ≈ 100 µm independent of the initial particle state or the suspended sediment concentration. Therefor, for the sediment mixture tested, the results imply that the effect of concentration on flocculation was restricted to the floc growth rate. This is contrary to what would be predicted using typical mud settling velocity equations.",

            "abstract": "The first part of this work presents results based on the longest series measuring downward shortwave radiation (DSR) available at the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) over Europe. Particular emphasis is placed upon the quality control and homogenization of the dataset, which has been checked for temporal homogeneity by means of different relative homogeneity tests. The mean annual DSR series shows an increase from the 1930s to the early 1950s (i.e. early brightening period), followed by a reduction until mid-1980s (i.e., dimming period), and ending with an increase up to the present (i.e., brightening period). Unfortunately, there exists a substantial gap in direct measurements of DSR as only few stations in Europe provide records before the 1960s. To overcome the lack of direct measurements, the analysis can be supported with other proxy variables more widely measured, such as sunshine duration (SD) records. Thus, in this work we also present the reconstructed DSR variations since late 19th century in Europe based on the SD series over Europe with around one century of records, some of them starting in the 1880s. The reconstructed DSR variations have been estimated by using the relationship found between the SD series and a satellite-derived DSR dataset (0.03 x 0.03 of spatial resolution), provided by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF), during the common 1983-2005 subperiod. The reconstructed records have been validated by using the GEBA series described in the first part of this work. The temporal evolution of the mean DSR annual series since the 1950s is characterized by the well-known dimming and brightening periods. Moreover, an early brightening period is also detected during the first half of the 20th century, although regional differences are observed with areas over Europe where the DSR show no increase in this subperiod. Interestingly, the reconstructed DSR also highlight an absolute minimum in 1912, which should be the signal of the Katmai volcanic eruption (i.e., largest volcanic eruption in the 20th century) as the consequence of the direct effect of the volcanic sulphur aerosols released in the volcanic eruption. The results highlight the suitability of SD records to detect changes in DSR under all-sky and clear-sky conditions (e.g., due to aerosol changes).",

One surprise was the strength of eddy and internal wave signatures observed in movies computed from one-minute averages of high-frequency snapshots (such that gravity waves were averaged out but slicks and variable surface roughness remained). In particular, passing ships left wakes that propagated away at speeds on the order of 0.5 m/s, much slower than gravity waves and presumably surface manifestations of internal waves associated with the time-varying salt-wedge. Thus, these internal ship wakes appear to act as probes of internal stratification dynamics. This paper will explore the time variations of these internal wakes and relate them to corresponding variations in the estuary salt wedge.",

            "abstract": "In later phases of transport in porous media, dispersion might be modelled by Fickian diffusion using an effective diffusion coefficient in the transport equation. Early phases of the transport process are however more difficult to deal with due to non-Fickian behavior. On the macro-scale, modelling of non-Fickian dispersion is complicated by scale dependence and therefore empirical correlations, experiments or numerical simulations on the micro-scale must be employed [1]. A fully resolved solution of the Navier-Stokes and transport equations which yields a detailed description of the flow properties, dispersion, interfaces of fluids, etc. however, is not practical for domains containing more than a few thousand grains, due to the huge computational effort that resolving such geometries would require. Through Probability Density Function (PDF) based methods, the velocity distribution in the pore space can facilitate the understanding and modelling of non-Fickian dispersion [2,3,4].\nOur aim is to model the transition between non-Fickian and Fickian dispersion in a random sphere pack within the framework of a PDF based transport model proposed by Meyer and Tchelepi [5]. In addition to [5], we consider the effects of pore scale diffusion and formulate a different stochastic equation for the increments in velocity space from first principles. To assess the terms in this equation, we performed Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) for solving the Navier-Stokes equation. We extracted the PDFs and statistical moments (up to the 4th moment) of velocity and first and second order velocity derivatives both independent and conditioned on velocity. This data enables us to quantify the fluxes in the velocity space. We observe that the components of velocity fluxes derived through the combination of the Taylor expansion and the Langevin equation, point to a drift and diffusion behavior in the velocity space.",

            "abstract": "Several droughts and floods in Amazonia has occurred in the last years - some of them being classified as the most severe in the last 40 years - and future projections from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate an increase of these extreme events. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the phenomena associated with extreme rainfall events in the Amazon. However, some recent studies have indicated that the basic response of ENSO is dependent on the phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Hence, this study aims to analyze the influence of the MJO on the extreme events over northern South America, and especially over Amazon, in El Niño and La Niña years. We intend to explore the relative importance of the MJO to precipitation anomalies during ENSO events. Extreme events of precipitation over northern South America for the austral summer (November to March) were obtained through a composite analysis of the combinations of ENSO and MJO phases. The results showed that the MJO convection can enhance or weaken the basic response of ENSO on extreme precipitation events. Moreover, the results show that during positive extreme rainfall events (floods) over Amazon there is also an enhancement of the precipitation over the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) when the MJO is active (inactive) in El Niño (La Niña) years. Air circulation at high levels were also analyzed and supports these patterns. Therefore, they suggest that the influence of ENSO may be modulate by the MJO phase. This work contributes to a better understanding of the climate variability and will be helpful for the forecast of ENSO effects on extreme events of temperature and precipitation over South America. Also, this study presents preliminary results of one of the Collaborative Researches in Support of GOAmazon Campaign Science, funding by U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).",

            "abstract": "The wetlands of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska are important breeding areas for geese and are experiencing rapid climate change. Growing seasons now begin earlier but geese have not advanced their breeding enough to match the advancement of spring. Consequently, geese enter a greener system that may be less nutritious than in the past because grasses and sedges have highest nutrient density shortly following emergence. One consequence of this changing phenology is that vegetation consumed by geese and returned as feces may have a different carbon to nitrogen ratio than in the past, which may influence net ecosystem exchange (NEE). We examine the effect of the advancement of the growing season and different arrival times by Brant Geese on NEE. Our study consists of six experimental blocks, each with nine plots. Half of the plots are warmed to advance the growing season. Two plots each receive early, mid, and late season grazing; the remaining two plots are not grazed and there is one control plot. In one block, we monitor NEE hourly with an automatic gas exchange system. In the other blocks, survey measurements of NEE and ecosystem respiration (ER) are made periodically with a portable system. Geese remove considerable vegetation from the system and maintain \"grazing lawns\" <1 cm tall of high quality forage. Plots grazed in the early summer were net sources of C to the atmosphere, releasing ca. 2-4 g m-2 d-1. Non-grazed plots were C sinks of similar magnitude. Grazing had little effect on ER but an advanced growing season enhanced ER in the plots by ca. 0.5 µmol m-2 s-1. We observed a similar advanced growing season effect on NEE that we attribute to enhanced ER. Consequently, the larger influence on NEE in the system is grazing and this influence is through removal of photosynthetic tissue. Grazing by Brant Geese shifts large areas of this coastal wetland to a C source while advanced growing season only reduces the strength of the C sink.",

The practical, non-technical skills that are important for succeeding during these professional development experiences, such as public speaking, project management, ethical practices and writing, transition well and are imperative to the workplace. Thereby, graduates who have honed these skills are more competitive candidates for geoscience employment. Fortunately, the geoscience community recognizes the importance of these professional development opportunities and the skills required to successfully complete them, and are giving students the chance to practice non-technical skills while they are still enrolled in academic programs.\nThe American Geosciences Institute has collected data regarding students’ professional development experiences, including the preparation they receive in the corresponding non-technical skills. This talk will discuss the findings of two of AGI’s survey efforts – the Geoscience Student Exit Survey and the Geoscience Careers Master’s Preparation Survey (NSF: 1202707). Specifically, data highlighting the role played by internships, career opportunities and the complimentary non-technical skills will be discussed. As a practical guide, events informed by this research, such as AGI’s professional development opportunities, networking luncheons and internships, will also be included.",

These electrons may then form a partial source of Saturn's radiation belt which peaks in the range ~2Rs < r ~4Rs. The wave acceleration process depends on the local plasma density and on the distribution of z-mode wave power in frequency and spatial coordinates. In this study we bin the z-mode wave power observed by the Cassini radio and plasma wave science (RPWS) investigation in the region r < 4Rs at Saturn, where the condition fp/fc < 1 can be met (fp = plasma freq., fc = cyclotron freq.). The spatial bins include L-shell (based on a magnetic field model), latitude, and local time. Within each spatial bin we calculate the mean power-versus-frequency profile relative to fc, which can then be analytically fit. One goal of the study is to provide a database for use in quasilinear models requiring the calculation of pitch angle and momentum diffusion coefficients. In this report we present our initial findings.",

Due to the large number of pseudostreamers and their long persistence over multiple solar rotations, their contribution to the solar wind is likely to be substantial.

            "abstract": "Defending society against natural hazards is a high-stakes game of chance against nature, involving tough decisions. How should a developing nation allocate its budget between building schools for towns without ones or making existing schools earthquake-resistant? Does it make more sense to build levees to protect against floods, or to prevent development in the areas at risk? Would more lives be saved by making hospitals earthquake-resistant, or using the funds for patient care?\nThese topics are challenging because they are far from normal experience, in that they involve rare events and large sums. To help students in natural hazard classes conceptualize them, we pose tough and thought-provoking questions about complex issues involved and explore them together via lectures, videos, field trips, and in-class and homework questions. We discuss analogous examples from the students’ experiences, drawing on a new book “Playing Against Nature, Integrating Science and Economics to Mitigate Natural Hazards in an Uncertain World”. Asking whether they wear bicycle helmets and why or why not shows the cultural perception of risk. Individual students’ responses vary, and the overall results vary dramatically between the US, UK, and Germany. Challenges in hazard assessment in an uncertain world are illustrated by asking German students whether they buy a ticket on public transportation – accepting a known cost - or “ride black” - not paying but risking a heavy fine if caught. We explore the challenge of balancing mitigation costs and benefits via the question “If you were a student in Los Angeles, how much more would you pay in rent each month to live in an earthquake-safe building?”\nStudents learn that interdisciplinary thinking is needed, and that due to both uncertainties and sociocultural factors, no unique or right strategies exist for a particular community, much the less all communities. However, we can seek robust policies that give sensible results given uncertainties.",

During the substorm growth phase and early expansion phase, observations of the electron and proton aurora provide the necessary measurements to map magnetospheric boundaries to the ionosphere, in particular the open-closed field line boundary and the nightside transition region, which separates the nearly dipolar inner field line topology from the highly stretched field line region that corresponds to the thin current sheet. In this study we present a statistical analysis of the auroral substorm through the growth and early expansion phase using the open-closed field line and transition region boundaries to provide spatial context to ionospheric observations. Using the THEMIS all-sky imagers we provide a detailed analysis of the location and brightness of the onset and poleward arcs through the substorm growth phase. We also characterize the motion of the aurora, detailing its velocity and direction of motion through the substorm growth phase and early expansion phase. The purpose of this study is to develop a clear and consistent picture of auroral dynamics and morphology during the growth phase, through substorm onset, and during the early expansion phase. Preliminary results demonstrate that substorm auroral onset occurs on closed field lines, that the growth phase is characterized by the equatorward motion of the onset arc and that the motion of aurora features in the onset and poleward arcs during the growth phase is predominantly azimuthal.",

The risk is easily forgotten given the infrequent recurrence of major damaging events, yet the likelihood of a major earthquake in California in the next 30 years is greater than 99%. As our societal infrastructure becomes ever more interconnected, the potential impacts of these future events are difficult to predict.\nYet, the same inter-connected infrastructure also allows us to rapidly detect earthquakes as they begin, and provide seconds, tens or seconds, or a few minutes warning. A demonstration earthquake early warning system is now operating in California and is being expanded to the west coast (www.ShakeAlert.org). In recent earthquakes in the Los Angeles region, alerts were generated that could have provided warning to the vast majority of Los Angelinos who experienced the shaking. Efforts are underway to build a public system. Smartphone technology will be used not only to issue that alerts, but could also be used to collect data, and improve the warnings. The MyShake project at UC Berkeley is currently testing an app that attempts to turn millions of smartphones into earthquake-detectors. As our development of the technology continues, we can anticipate ever-more automated response to earthquake alerts. Already, the BART system in the San Francisco Bay Area automatically stops trains based on the alerts. In the future, elevators will stop, machinery will pause, hazardous materials will be isolated, and self-driving cars will pull-over to the side of the road.\nIn this presentation we will review the current status of the earthquake early warning system in the US. We will illustrate how smartphones can contribute to the system. Finally, we will review applications of the information to reduce future losses.",

            "abstract": "The onset of convection in growing sea ice has been characterized by a critical Rayleigh Number(Ra) of 10, where buoyancy forcing due to brine and seawater density differences overcomes viscous dissipation forces by a large amount. A necessary condition is that the sea ice matrix is also permeable, determined by a brine volume >5%. When the ice warms up in spring or an ice cover freezes back in fall, evidence for brine convection has been inferred from gas and nutrient exchanges. However, computations of Ra in these non-growing sea ice conditions are generally found in the subcritical range, <5. A numerical model of sea ice was constructed to re-examine the convective brine dynamics and whether a new parameterization of the onset of convection can explain these full-thickness convection cases. The hypothesis is that convection may occur at lower Ra if it takes place through macroscopic structural features, such as cm-scale brine channels, instead of a permeable matrix. The sensitivities of Ra to the buoyancy forcing and viscous dissipation parameters used for brine in the two cases, a permeable matrix and a brine channel network, are also examined.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is a key parameter in various disciplines, including hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and mining. Nowadays, there are multiple methods to measure soil moisture. One of the most utilized methods is time domain reflectometry (TDR), which is an indirect method that uses electromagnetic waves to determine the water content of a soil. TDR methods have been widely used because they are non-invasive, easy to use, and have good accuracy in most of the soils. However, a major limitation of current TDR methods lies in the inability to use them in highly conductive saline soils – which are very common in arid and semi-arid regions. TDR methods fail in these soils mainly due to the extremely large signal attenuation along the sensors probes that preclude the detection of the end of the rods, invalidating the use of this methodology. In this work, we propose a new approach to analyze the TDR waveform that enables to use TDR methods at bulk electrical conductivities (BECs) higher than those specified by TDR manufacturers. We assessed the performance of the new approach with a commonly used TDR sensor in sandy soils that had saturated BECs between 1-12 dSm-1. It was found that the traditional methodology it is indeed incapable to estimate soil moisture contents for BECs higher than 4 dSm-1, while the new methodology doubles the actual BEC range with reliable and accurate measures with a maximum error of 6%. These results open a new window of monitoring moisture content in soils where current TDR methods are fairly inaccurate.",

            "abstract": "To investigate CO2 Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in sandstones, we performed 150°C flow-through experiments on K-feldspar rich cores from the Eau Claire Formation. We observed mass transfer processes operating on a range of scales by measuring sample porosity, permeability, and surface area and fluid and solid chemistry. The close agreement between our measured K-feldspar dissolution rates and literature values demonstrate that feldspar-fluid interaction can be confidently modeled using our chosen rate parameters and characterization methods, but other hydrogeochemical processes evolve somewhat less predictably. Specifically, a sandstone core through which CO2-rich deionized water was recycled for 52 days decreased in porosity and permeability and increased in surface area while an Al hydroxide mineral, such as boehmite, precipitated within its pore space. However, two samples subjected to ~3 day single-pass experiments run with CO2-rich NaCl brines generally increased in porosity and surface area and decreased in permeability as K-feldspar was converted to a phase with kaolinite-like stoichiometry. Notably, boehmite remained two orders of magnitude less supersaturated than kaolinite in all samples from all experiments, and we therefore hypothesize that the identity of the secondary phase is related to the presence of NaCl in solution. Regardless of their identity, long-lived secondary phase supersaturations and low measured Al molalities suggest that Al is precipitated at approximately the same rate at which it is released to solution through feldspar hydrolysis. Finally, we note that, although core permeability measurably decreased in all three experiments, the magnitude of these changes is unlikely to impact CO2 injectivity over a CCUS reservoir's lifetime. The observations produced here are critical to the application of reactive transport models to CCUS systems, yet more work will be required in order to improve model predictions.",

            "abstract": "It has been said in the oil and gas industry that fracture modeling and prediction can tell us everything we want to know about the characteristics of hydraulically induced fractures – except their width, length, height, and conductivity. In other words, classical models fail in almost every regard to provide unambiguous knowledge that would enable better predictions of production and better design of stimulation practices. With the advent of microseismic monitoring of stimulations the industry has been given hope that that this may soon change, however information gleaned from these records about the locations, timing, and characteristics of induced events is almost equally ambiguous. Recent analyses are beginning to suggest that energy radiated from fractures as they propagate, usually episodically, and resonate due to pressure pulses, flow turbulence and other sources of energy within the fluid-filled fracture and the wellbore may provide information to determine length, compliance, surface roughness, and other attributes from which the effective length of fractures can be determined both while injecting and after closure as fluid leaks off. This talk highlights the key issues facing the oil and gas and geothermal industries, and provides some examples from recent work to illustrate the extent to which it may be possible to use radiated energy for fracture characterization.",

            "abstract": "Science gateways and scientific workflows occupy different ends of the spectrum of user-focused cyberinfrastructure. Gateways, sometimes called science portals, provide a way for enabling large numbers of users to take advantage of advanced computing resources (supercomputers, advanced storage systems, science clouds) by providing Web and desktop interfaces and supporting services. Scientific workflows, at the other end of the spectrum, support advanced usage of cyberinfrastructure that enable “power users” to undertake computational experiments that are not easily done through the usual mechanisms (managing simulations across multiple sites, for example). Despite these different target communities, gateways and workflows share many similarities and can potentially be accommodated by the same software system. For example, pipelines to process InSAR imagery sets or to datamine GPS time series data are workflows. The results and the ability to make downstream products may be made available through a gateway, and power users may want to provide their own custom pipelines.\nIn this abstract, we discuss our efforts to build an open source software system, Apache Airavata, that can accommodate both gateway and workflow use cases. Our approach is general, and we have applied the software to problems in a number of scientific domains. In this talk, we discuss our applications to usage scenarios specific to earth science, focusing on earthquake physics examples drawn from the QuakSim.org and GeoGateway.org efforts. We also examine the role of the Apache Software Foundation's open community model as a way to build up common commmunity codes that do not depend upon a single \"owner\" to sustain.\nPushing beyond open source software, we also see the need to provide gateways and workflow systems as cloud services. These services centralize operations, provide well-defined programming interfaces, scale elastically, and have global-scale fault tolerance. We discuss our work providing Apache Airavata as a hosted service to provide these features.",

A 3-D interpreted flexural deformation surface of the subducting South China Sea Plate was obtained by removing from the observed bathymetry the effects of sediment loading, isostatically-compensated topography based on gravity modeling, age-related lithospheric thermal subsidence, and residual short-wavelength features. We analyzed flexural bending of 21 across-trench profile sections along the Manila trench and then calculated five best-fitting tectonic and plate parameters that control the flexural bending for each of the across-trench profile sections. Results of analysis revealed significant along-trench variations: The trench relief of the Manila trench varies from 0.8 to 2.2 km, trench-axis vertical loading (-V0) from -0.4x1012 to 1.21x1012 N/m, and axial bending moment (-M0) from 0.005x1017 to 0.6x1017 N. The effective elastic plate thickness seaward of the Manila outer-rise region (TeM) ranges from 30 to 40 km, while that trench-ward of the outer-rise (Tem) ranges from 11 to 30 km. This corresponds to a reduction in Te of 26-63% for the Manila trench. The transition from TeM to Tem occurs at a breaking distance of 50-120 km from the Manila trench axis. The axial vertical loading, bending moment, and the effective elastic thickness of the Manila trench are much smaller than the Mariana trench (Zhang et al., 2014). The contrast in the flexural bending between the Mariana and Manila trenches might be related to the difference in the ages of the subducting plates and other tectonic variables.\nZhang, F., Lin, J., Zhan, W., 2014.

            "abstract": "Recent seismicity in the Tangshan region in North China has prompted concern about a repetition of the 1976 M7.8 earthquake that destroyed the city, killing more than 242,000 people. However, the decay of seismicity there implies that the recent earthquakes are probably aftershocks of the 1976 event. This 37-year sequence is an example of the phenomenon that aftershock sequences within continents are often significantly longer than the typical 10 years at plate boundaries. The long sequence of aftershocks in continents is consistent with a simple friction-based model predicting that the length of aftershock sequences varies inversely with the rate at which faults are loaded. Hence the slowly-deforming continents tend to have aftershock sequences significantly longer than at rapidly-loaded plate boundaries. This effect has two consequences for hazard assessment. First, within the heavily populated continents that are typically within plate interiors, assessments of earthquake hazards rely significantly on the assumption that the locations of small earthquakes shown by the short historical record reflect continuing deformation that will cause future large earthquakes. This assumption would lead to overestimation of the hazard in presently active areas and underestimation elsewhere, if some of these small events are aftershocks. Second, successful attempts to remove aftershocks from catalogs used for hazard assessment would underestimate the hazard, because much of the hazard is due to the aftershocks, and the declustering algorithms implicitly assume short aftershock sequences and thus do not remove long-duration ones.",

            "abstract": "Abstract\nTropical convection is often organized into clusters. But due to the insufficient understanding of the mechanisms behind, description of convective organization is still missing in GCMs, and it is even more challenging to represent its feedbacks on the convection development. To identify the favorable thermodynamical and dynamical large-scale environmental conditions for the convective organization, a 15-yr Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Feature (RPF) database is combined with ERA-Interim reanalysis. Based on sizes and maximum echo top heights, RPFs between 36°S-36°N are classified into shallow isolated, shallow organized, deep isolated and deep organized. Firstly, we show the global distribution of these four types of RPFs, and quantify their contribution to total precipitation. Secondly, in combination with the meteorological variables from the ERA-Interim, we differentiate the environmental properties favoring these four types of RPFs to understand what factors benefit the convective organization. A series of analyses show that moisture convergence at surface, mid-level (700-300hPa) moisture, low-level (1-3km) wind shear and upper level vertical velocity play important roles in clustering the convection. Organized systems occur more likely in the environment with stronger surface moisture convergence, higher mid level relative humidity and strong low-level wind shear. However, there are large regional and seasonal variations in the influences of these factors. Generally, systems are relatively easier to be organized over ocean than over land.",

            "abstract": "In coastal settings, tidally induced surface water-groundwater exchange (tidal pumping) controls nitrate fluxes between sediments and the water column and denitrification rates in shallow sediments. A one-dimensional, coupled fluid flow and solute transport model was used to capture the influence of tidal pumping on redox zonation and nitrate removal in sediments within coastal settings such as tidal rivers, deltas, and marshes. Upwelling groundwater was assumed to be rich in nitrate but low in dissolved oxygen (DO) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Tidal pumping enhances exchange of DO-rich surface water across the sediment-water interface and creates a deep, oscillating zone of aerobic respiration. Relative to non-tidal conditions, denitrification rates are diminished. As redox conditions shift with spring-neap tides, redox gradients should also shift and drive a change in denitrification rates within aquatic sediments.",

            "abstract": "In the 10 years that Cassini has been orbiting Saturn, a wealth of observations have been returned that have probed a wide range of altitudes in Saturn's atmosphere from <1 microbar to roughly 3 bars. Radar and 5-micron VIMS images reveal spectacular cloud structure at the 3-bar level. ISS, CIRS, and VIMS probe the upper troposphere where storms originate. CIRS probes the stratosphere and upper troposphere, while UVIS sounds the stratosphere and mesosphere.\nSome of the highlights include: 1) the Great Northern Storm of 2010-2011. This planet-encircling storm is believed to have originated in the water cloud (P>10 bars) with dramatic effects on the cloud structure in the upper troposphere (0.5 bars), and, quite surprisingly, the generation of localized heated regions in Saturn's stratosphere near 2 mbars. Cassini's full instrument complement was used to study the storm, leading to the detection of fresh ammonia ice in the troposphere and enhanced temperatures and hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, in the stratosphere.\n2) The detection of hurricane-like features at both the North and South Pole of Saturn. These exhibit interesting structure at the spatial resolution of ISS and VIMS, while CIRS has detected enhanced temperatures at both poles.\n3) The persistence of the Northern Hexagon at 79N. This 6-sided feature was detected by Voyager and it has been studied by the full suite of Cassini remote sensing instruments. It is detectable as a warm region at 100 mbars, but there is no thermal signature in the stratosphere.\n4) Seasonal reversal of photochemically produced aerosols. When Cassini arrived at Saturn, the winter northern hemisphere appeared blue, while the southern hemisphere exhibited an orange appearance. Shortly after equinox in 2009, the appearance reversed quite abruptly.\nDuring the last stage of the mission in 2016-2017, Cassini will obtain measurements at very high spatial resolution during the F-ring and Proximal orbits. The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer will directly sample the upper atmosphere, while on other orbits, precise measurements of Saturn's gravity will provide valuable constraints to models of Saturn's interior.",

            "abstract": "A 2008 editorial in Natureentitled “Change in the weather,” it is stated that “a renewed push for scientific research into weather-modification technologies is long overdue.” The editorial continues with “Today's rain-makers struggle with their own credibility issues. They do have well established methods for seeding clouds….. weather-modification supporters face a perceived negative bias in the scientific community….. There has yet to be the definitive experiment that settles exactly how well cloud seeding… works (or not).” The editorial concludes with “Other countries, such as the United States, have simply given up; the most promising experiment in America is run not by the federal government but by the state of Wyoming....which is being evaluated by experts from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). That's the type of targeted and rigorous study that needs to be done in weather modification, but it took Wyoming to do it.”\nThe motivation for weather modification operations is to increase water supply (streamflow) due to increased snowpack. NCAR will complete their evaluation in Fall 2014 that will provide, with uncertainty, the anticipated increase (percent) in snowpack due to cloud seeding. The majority of the cloud seeding for the Wyoming Weather Modification Pilot Project was performed in the North Platte River Basin (NPRB). Researchers from the University of Wyoming, in cooperation with NCAR, analyzed historic meteorological data for the cloud seeding season (November 15th to April 15th) for eight years (2001-2008) to determine “seedable” periods. Using this data combined with the anticipated increase (percent with uncertainty), University of Alabama researchers developed two models (statistical and hydrologic) for the North Brush Creek watershed which is located within the NPRB. The statistical model related snowpack (Snow Water Equivalent) from SNOTEL stations to snowmelt using the Partial Least Squares Regression technique. The hydrologic model selected was the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model at a high spatial (4 km by 4 km) and temporal (daily) resolution. The results of these two models were compared to determine the anticipated increase in streamflow due to weather modification operations.",

Understanding this phenomenon provides important constraints on earthquake dynamics, such as earthquake nucleation, fault frictional properties, slow slip, and stress distributions. Tibi et al. (2003) reported examples of dynamic triggering in deep earthquakes and pointed out their potential to constrain the still-enigmatic faulting mechanisms of deep earthquakes. Here we analyze global earthquake catalogs to systematically search for statistically significant dynamic triggering at depths greater than 300 km. We find that dynamic triggering of deep earthquakes is most pronounced within 3 hours after the master events, and is limited in depth (i.e., triggering of and by shallow earthquakes is not observed). We also observed a significant downward triggering bias. We suggest that these characteristics may be related to deep earthquake rupture directivity and meta-stable olivine wedge structures inside subducted slabs.",

Providing training in scientific communication in some form is thus a necessity for many internship programs, especially those aimed towards academically younger students. In this presentation, we will share some of the experiences we’ve gained from teaching scientific communication workshops to summer interns who range from high school to graduate school. Building on the many years of experience learned through the Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research Science (SOARS) program, course material has been adapted and tailored to students participating in the National Center for Atmospheric Research High-School Internship Research Opportunity (HIRO, now the NCAR PreCollege Internship) and Research Experiences for Community College Students (RECCS, based with Colorado University’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science). SOARS also has experience supporting graduate students towards publication. Weekly communications workshops have served not only to provide necessary scientific skills, but also as a place to gather, reflect, discuss and build community. The unique opportunities and challenges in working with each of these groups will be discussed as part of the larger community discussion of how we can increase diversity in STEM through providing genuine research experiences to diverse and academically young students.",

The eight passes consumed a total of 94 days. For each deep tail pass, the MIMI detectors recorded fluxes that maximized at the center of the plasma sheet. The plasma sheet crossings can be organized using the Arridge bowl model, if a bowl “hinge” distance RH can be assigned. The hinge parameter can be computed for each pass by finding the best-fit to the flux centroids of each pass. For 41-64 keV electrons, RH = 20.8 ± 5.0 RS, although other species and energies give somewhat different hinge distances. The charged particles also exhibit strong planetary period oscillations during the deep tail passes. The oscillations have a mean period of 10.88±0.89 hours, which is very close to the SKR and MAG periodicities measured in the inner magnetosphere. Thus, even at distances approaching ~60 RS down the tail, these periodicities can be recognized.",

In September 2013, flight, satellite and ground-based data was collected in Houston, TX and the surrounding metropolitan area. Over 300 particulate matter filter samples were collected as part of the ground-based sampling efforts, at four sites across Houston. Samples include total suspended particle matter (TSP) and fine particulate matter (less than 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5). For this project, an analytical method has been developed for the pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) of a wide variety of organic tracers and contaminants from quartz fiber filters (QFFs). Over 100 compounds were selected including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes, levoglucosan, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Currently, there is no analytical method validated for the reproducible extraction of all seven compound classes in a single automated technique. Prior to extraction, QFF samples were spiked with known amounts of target analyte standards and isotopically-labeled surrogate standards. The QFF were then extracted with methylene chloride:acetone at high temperatures (100˚C) and pressures (1500 psi) using a Thermo Dionex Accelerated Solvent Extractor system (ASE 350). Extracts were concentrated, spiked with known amounts of isotopically-labeled internal standards, and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry utilizing electron ionization and electron capture negative ionization. Target analytes were surrogate recovery-corrected to account for analyte loss during sample preparation. Ambient concentrations of over 100 organic tracers and contaminants will be presented for four sites in Houston during DISCOVER-AQ.",

The interaction of multiple wakes from CEC devices can affect optimal placement strategy, and issues of environmental impacts on sediment transport and large-scale flow should be examined. Numerical models of four flume-scale experiments were built using Sandia National Laboratories’ Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (SNL-EFDC.) Model predictions were calibrated against measured velocities to estimate flow and turbine parameters. The velocity deficit was most sensitive to αmd, the dimensionless Smagorinsky constant related to horizontal momentum diffusion, and to CPB, the dimensionless partial blockage coefficient accounting for the physical displacement of fluid due to turbine blockage. Calibration to four data sets showed αmd ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 while CPB ranged from 40 to 300. Furthermore, results of parameter estimation indicated centerline velocity data were insufficient to uniquely identify the turbulence, flow, and device parameters; cross-channel velocity measurements at multiple locations downstream yielded important calibration information and it is likely that vertical velocity profiles would also be useful to the calibration effort. In addition to flume scale models, a full-scale implementation of a CEC device at Roza Canal in Yakima, WA was developed. The model was analyzed to find an appropriate grid size and to understand the sensitivity of downstream velocity profiles to horizontal momentum diffusion and partial blockage coefficients. Preliminary results generally showed that as CPB increased the wake was enhanced vertically.",

Surface hoar is a common weak layer type in avalanche accidents in a continental and intermountain snowpack. It is however relatively well understood that aspect plays an important role in the spatial location of the growth, and survival of these grain forms, due to the unequal distribution of incoming radiation. However this factor alone does not explain the complex and often confusing spatial pattern of these grains forms throughout the landscape at larger, mountain range spatial scales.\nIn this paper we present a unique data set including over one hundred days of manual observations of surface hoar at sixteen locations on Pioneer Mountain at the Yellowstone Club in southwestern Montana. Using this wealth of observational data located on different aspects, elevations and exposures, coupled with detailed meteorological observations, detailed site scale observations (e.g. Sky view plots) we examine the spatial variability of surface hoar at this scale, and examine the factors that control its spatial distribution.\nOur results further supports our preliminary work, which shows that small-scale meteorological differences, site scale differences, and local scale lapse rates can greatly influence the spatial variability of surface hoar, over and above that which aspect alone can explain. These results highlight our incomplete understanding of the processes at this large, mountain range scale, and are likely to have implications for both regional and local scale avalanche forecasting in environments where surface hoar cause ongoing instabilities.",

            "abstract": "The NOAA Southeast Nexus (SENEX) project occurred during the summer of 2013 over the southeastern United States and involved studying the interactions between natural and anthropogenic emissions at the nexus of climate change and air quality. As part of the project, a suite of instruments for aerosol and gas–phase species was deployed on the NOAA WP-3D aircraft and models were used to calculate trace gas and aerosol species in the region and along the aircraft flight tracks. Throughout the study, the measured non-refractory submicron aerosol mass was dominated by organic material (58% +/- 9%) with smaller contributions from sulfate (27% +/- 8%), ammonium (10% +/- 3%), nitrate (3% +/- 1%), and chloride (0.1% +/- 0.1%).\nHere we examine the influence of urban emissions on the organic aerosol (OA) mass in regions characterized by higher and lower biogenic emissions. For the air around and downwind of urban areas, OA mass is highly correlated with carbon monoxide (CO), a tracer of anthropogenic emissions as well as an oxidation product of isoprene, a biogenic species. The slope of this correlation is roughly 0.15 micrograms per standard cubic meter per ppbv, which is significantly higher than observed in prior studies downwind of urban areas. The enhancement in OA mass relative to the enhancement in CO is independent of the concentration of biogenic species. In contrast, formaldehyde enhancements are clearly higher in the presence of biogenic species in agreement with the NOAA GFDL AM3 model. Downwind from the urban areas, CO and OA mass were not strongly enhanced relatively to a region-wide enhancement in these species that can only be explained from the accumulation of emissions in the eastern U.S. for several days. Back-trajectories of air parcels with emissions from biogenic and anthropogenic sources will be examined to elucidate the impact of both sources on CO and OA mass.",

It is a statistical regression (Seemann et al 2003 and 2008) developed from an atmospheric profile data base (SeeBor, Borbas et al, 2005) that consists of geographically and seasonally distributed radiosonde, ozonesonde, and ECMWF ReAnalysis data. TPW and UTH are determined for clear sky radiances measured by HIRS (at 20km and later 10km resolution) and MODIS (5km resolution) over land and ocean both day and night.\nThe Space Time Gridding (STG) framework is used to calculate daily and monthly composites of the moisture properties. It has two components. (1) Space gridding where geophysical properties are first filtered based on a set of criteria (e.g. time of day, etc.) and then aggregated into equal-angle grid cells. (2) Time gridding where daily statistics are computed from the aggregate of pixels in each grid cell. Longer–term, such as monthly, statistics are derived from the daily gridded statistics.\nThe HIRS and MODIS TPW and UTH products are binned into a global map of 0.5 degree lat-lon boxes daily, compiled into monthly amounts, and inspected for trends over a 10-year time period (2000-2009). The HIRS and MODIS TPW data is also compared to the NASA NVAP dataset.",

            "abstract": "Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) distributions are transformed by in-cloud processing. This can be chemical: aqueous oxidation; or physical: Brownian scavenging, collision and coalescence. Droplet evaporation then leaves behind the cloud-processed CCN. Chemical processing increases CCN size (lower critical supersaturation; Sc) but does not change CCN concentration (NCCN) (Feingold and Kreidenweis, 2000). Physical processing leads to an increase in size (lower Sc) and decrease of NCCN. These processes are especially important in stratus clouds that cover large areas and persist for long periods. Modified CCN in turn modify cloud droplet spectra. Both chemical and physical processing were observed during the 2005 MArine Stratus/stratocumulus Experiment (MASE) field campaign. Higher concentrations of SO4 and NO3 anions with lower SO2 and O3 were associated with bimodal CCN spectra whereas monomodal spectra had lower SO4 and NO3 and higher SO2 and O3. These are consistent with chemical processing.\nTwo nearby MASE CCN spectra, one bimodal and one monomodal were input to an adiabatic cloud droplet growth model. Model runs at various updrafts (W) show that the low Sc cloud processed mode of the bimodal CCN spectrum augmented droplet activation creating higher cloud droplet concentrations (Nc) for low W characteristic of stratus clouds (Fig. 1a, black). Higher NCCN at low Sc (black data) also increased condensation competition and thus reduced cloud effective S (Seff) (Fig.1b). This increases W importance for determining Nc (Hudson and Noble, 2014). These high NCCN at low Sc and lower Seff of the bimodal CCN spectrum reduce droplet mean diameter (MD; Fig. 1c) and broaden droplet distributions (sigma; Fig. 1d). Increased Nc and decreased MD of chemical processing seems to augment the indirect aerosol effect (IAE) whereas inherently decreased Nc and increased MD of coalescence processing reduces IAE. CCN cloud-processing alters cloud microphysics (Nc, Seff, MD, and sigma) thus affecting IAE and is therefore as influential as CCN sources.\nFeingold, G., and S. Kreidenweis, 2000. J. Geophys.

            "abstract": "Remotely-sensed measurements from space-borne instrumentation have been extensively utilized in order to quantify snow water equivalent (SWE) across the globe, primarily in the form of SWE retrievals derived from passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperature (Tb) measurements. However, the application of these SWE retrieval products is largely limited by wet snow, deep snow, overlying vegetation, depth hoar, ice crusts, sub-grid scale lake ice, snow stratigraphy, and snow morphology. Alternatively, PMW Tb can be integrated directly (i.e., without the need of a SWE retrieval algorithm) into a land surface model as part of a Tb data assimilation (DA) framework. However, it is worthwhile to first decouple non-SWE related signals from the Tb observations prior to assimilation of the SWE-related Tb information. This study addresses two significant sources of SWE-related uncertainties using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) PMW Tb observations. Namely, atmospheric and overlying forest effects are decoupled using relatively simple radiative transfer models. Comparisons against independent Tb measurements collected during airborne PMW Tb surveys highlight the effectiveness of AMSR-E Tb measurements decoupling with the eventual goal of enhancing estimated SWE as part of a PMW Tb data assimilation framework into an advanced land surface model.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has shown solitary waves to be capable of transporting fluids through porous media at rates orders of magnitude faster than predicted from Darcy’s law. Solitary waves are expressed as regions of high fluid pressure and porosity. The waves form and propagate where permeability is a sensitive function of effective stress, fluid pressure approaches lithostatic pressure, and the rate of fluid pressure generation is rapid compared to the rate of fluid pressure diffusion. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the pressure generation rates that can develop in a sedimentary basin over a range of possible geologic conditions so that the potential for solitary wave formation can be assessed. Pressure generation rates were calculated for a generic sedimentary basin by constructing a two-dimensional numerical model that treated sediment deposition, compaction, heat flow, kerogen maturation, hydrocarbon formation, and the flow of water, oil, and gas. The results showed compaction disequilibrium and hydrocarbon formation to be the two principal causes of pressure generation, respectively. Pressure generation rates for typical sedimentary basinal conditions were found to be on the order of 1’s of Pa/year, up to a maximum of ~400 Pa/year under the most favorable pressure generating conditions. These pressure generation rates would be sufficient to form oil-saturated solitary waves but too low to form methane-saturated solitary waves because of the higher rate of methane pressure diffusion compared to oil, due to methane’s lower viscosity. To form methane-saturated solitary waves, pressure generation rates of at least ~1800 Pa/year are needed, which are unlikely to be produced by sedimentary basin diagenetic processes, but could possibly be produced by earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "When weathered oil is transported ashore, such as during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, it can mix with suspended sediment in the surf zone to create heavier-than-water sand and oil agglomerates in the form of mats several centimeters thick and tens of meters long. Broken off pieces of these mats and smaller agglomerates formed in situ (called Surface Residual Balls, SRBs) can cause beach re-oiling months to years after the initial spill. The physical dynamics of these SRBs in the nearshore, where they are larger (cm-scale) and less dense than natural sediment, are poorly understood. In the current study, SRB mobility and seafloor interaction is investigated through a combination of laboratory and field experiments with pseudo-SRBs developed to be physically stable proxies for genuine agglomerates. Formulations for mobility prediction based on comparing estimated shear stress to the critical Shields and modified Shields parameters developed for mixed sediment beds are assessed against observations. Processes such as burial, exhumation, and interaction with bedforms (e.g., migrating ripples) are also explored. The observations suggest that incipient motion estimates based on a modified Shields parameter have some skill in predicting SRB movement, but that other forcing mechanisms such as pressure gradients may be important under some conditions. Additionally, burial and exhumation due to the relatively high mobility of sand grains are confirmed as key processes controlling SRB dynamics in the surf zone. This work has broad implications for understanding surf zone sediment transport at the short timescale associated with mobilizing sand grains and SRBs as well as at the longer timescales associated with net transport patterns, sediment budgets, and bed elevation changes.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between subducted seamounts and earthquakes has remained controversial. Although seamounts are expected to subduct aseismically, they have also been considered to generate large earthquakes. Based on a remarkable case study in Central Ecuador, we show that a subducted seamount can lock the shallow megathrust along its trailing flank preparing for a possible shallow (<20 km), large magnitude (Mw ~7.0) tsunamogenic earthquake, while its leading flank keeps partially creeping along with frequent earthquake swarms and slow slip events (SSE). The erosive Ecuador convergent margin, which basement consists of high velocity (Vp=5 km/s) mafic rocks, is underthrust eastward at 4.7 cm/yr by the rugged Carnegie Ridge. As modeled by global positioning system (GPS) measurements acquired as close as 35 km from the trench axis at La Plata Island, the Central Ecuador margin figures a creeping subduction segment with the exception of a 50 km-diameter locked patch centered over the uplifted La Plata Island region. The 3D geometry of the plate-interface megathrust obtained from 2D-PreStack-Depth-Migration of a grid of multi-channel seismic reflection data collected near La Plata Island reveals a collection of closely spaced peaks that belong to a broad (55 X ~50 km) low-drag shape subducted seamount. The clear spatial correlation between the seamount and the highly coupled zone denotes the seamount as the main cause for both the locked patch and the island uplift. The absence of a seismically imaged subduction channel, the highly jagged seamount-trailing flank and the stiffness of the oceanic margin are found to be the principal long-term characteristics associated with shallow locking of the megathrust. Moreover, the combination of our structural interpretation and inter-seismic coupling map with 14-years of relocated seismicity, and the 2010 SSE and its associated microseismicity allow to propose a new model for the seismogenic behavior of subducting seamounts.",

In the tropics (10N-20N) this variability has regular phase patterns that are consistent with barotropic Rossby waves having northward energy propagation (Farrar, J. Phys. Oceanogr., 2011). Further north, the phase patterns become confused and the variance decreases, but hot spots of coherent variability reemerge in the Gulf of Alaska and south of the Aleutian Islands. Ray-tracing calculations and comparisons with numerical simulations support the conclusion that this remote (and seemingly isolated) variability can indeed be attributed to barotropic Rossby waves generated near the equator and undergoing bathymetric refraction as they propagate northward.",

            "abstract": "The Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) was the Earth’s most recent icehouse climate prior to the Cenozoic. At present, it is generally accepted that the latitudinal gradient in climate conditions was similar to the present icehouse. High-latitude ice sheets occasionally advanced into the mid-latitudes and retreated once more, but the tropics were warmer or similar in climate to the tropics during the Plio-Pleistocene.\nRecently, this idea has been challenged by sedimentological evidence of glaciation and dry weathering in upland areas of the tropics as well as geochemical evidence for cold tropical oceans that is consistent with the sedimentological evidence. These observations challenge current qualitative and quantitative models of Late Paleozoic climate, implying tropical climate may have been up to 15 degrees Celsius colder than the present day at some point during the LPIA.\nHere we consider whether the disparity between evidence for equatorial cold in Pangaea and current models can be explained by explosive volcanic activity associated with events such as the Hercynian orogen or the Kennedy-Connors-Auburn Silicic Large Igneous Province.\nWe find that the necessary radiative forcing for glaciation in low-latitude upland areas could be generated by explosive volcanic activity one to two orders of magnitude greater than the present day, perturbing a baseline climate with mid-latitude glaciation in both hemispheres.\nSuch a forcing would have potentially significant impacts on the carbon cycle and ice sheet dynamics, but these effects are not likely to be unambiguously detectable in the record. Instead, we argue that measurements of mass independent fractionation of S in lacustrine sediments or other deposits sampling meteoric water would be the least ambiguous test of a hypothetical volcanic driver for late Paleozoic cold.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, EAR-1337463.",

            "abstract": "MESSENGER's orbital mission at Mercury led to the discovery of an unusual landform not known from other airless rocky bodies of the Solar System. Hollows are irregularly shaped, shallow, rimless depressions, often occurring in clusters and with high-reflectance interiors and halos. The fresh appearance of hollows suggests that they are relatively young features. For example, hollows are uncratered, and talus aprons downslope of hollows in certain cases appear to be covering small impact craters (100–200 in diameter). Hence, some hollows may be actively forming at present. The characteristics of hollows are suggestive of formation via destruction of a volatile-bearing phase (possibly one or more sulfides) through solar heating, micrometeoroid bombardment, and/or ion impact. Previous analysis showed that hollows are associated with low-reflectance material (LRM), a color unit identified from global color images. The material hosting hollows has often been excavated from depth by basin or crater impacts. Hollows are small features (tens of meters to several kilometers), so their detection and characterization with MESSENGER’s global maps have been limited. MESSENGER's low-altitude orbits provide opportunities for collection of images at high spatial resolutions, which reveal new occurrences of hollows and offer views of hollows with unprecedented detail. As of this writing, we have examined more than 21,000 images with pixel sizes <20 m and incidence angles <85°. Hollows were found in 559 images. Locations of the hollows (e.g., crater floor, rim, central peak, plains) were recorded. Shadow-length measurements were made on 280 images, yielding the depths of 1343 individual hollows. The mean depth is 30 m, with a standard deviation of 17 m. We also explored correlations between the geographic locations of hollows and maps provided by the MESSENGER geochemical sensors (X-Ray, Gamma-Ray, and Neutron Spectrometers), including the abundances of Al/Si, Ca/Si, Fe/Si, K, Mg/Si, and S/Si, as well as total neutron cross-section. No clear compositional trends emerged; it is likely that any true compositional preference for terrain that hosts hollows is obscured by the very large difference in scale between the resolution of the geochemical maps (hundreds of kilometers) and the dimensions of the hollows themselves.",

The catchments represent a range of disturbance extent and hydrological connectivity, including an undisturbed control catchment.\nKey differences in the impacts of slope disturbance on the fluvial export of major ions, and nitrogen from these headwater catchments were observed. The export of ions increased for all streams (disturbed and undisturbed) in response to deep thaw in warm years. However, the impact of physical disturbance was largely limited to increased ion concentrations late in the season when baseflow was driven by rainfall and soil water drainage. In contrast, nitrate (NO3-) concentrations were substantially affected by physical disturbance. A comparison of a disturbed and undisturbed catchment shows the two streams had similar concentrations of all dissolved N prior to slope failure, yet five years following failure, NO3- concentrations in the disturbed watershed were two orders of magnitude higher than in the undisturbed catchment. NO3- was especially high following late season rainfall and isotopic evidence shows that late season NO3-is not from rainfall but microbially produced (mineralized).\nResults indicate that the impact of disturbance on ion and N loads is limited by discharge and hydrological connectivity of the disturbed areas, that the drainage of upper permafrost (soils below normal active layer depth) is the likely source of enhanced ion and mineralized NO3-, and that impacts are evident several years after disturbance.",

            "abstract": "American Indian tribes and tribal confed­erations exert sovereignty over about 20% of all the freshwater resources in the United States. Yet only about 30 Native American (NA) students receive bachelor’s degrees in the geosci­ences each year, and few of those degrees are in the field of hydrology. To help increase the ranks of NA geoscientists,TIGER builds upon the momentum of Salish Kootenai College’s newly accredited Hydrology Degree Program. It allows for the development and implementation of the first Bachelor’s degree in geosciences (hydrology) at a Tribal College and University (TCU). TIGER integrates a solid educational research-based framework for retention and educational preparation of underrepresented minorities with culturally relevant curriculum and socio-cultural supports, offering a new model for STEM education of NA students. Innovative hydrology curriculum is both academically rigorous and culturally relevant with concurrent theoretical, conceptual, and applied coursework in chemical, biological, physical and managerial aspects of water resources. Educational outcomes for the program include a unique combination of competencies based on industry recognized standards (e.g., National Institute of Hydrologists), input from an experienced External Advisory Board (EAB), and competencies required for geoscientists working in critical NA watersheds, which include unique competencies, such as American Indian Water Law and sovereignty issues. TIGER represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on the investments the geoscience community has already made into broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities and developing a diverse workforce, by allowing SKC to develop a sustainable and exportable program capable of significantly increasing (by 25 to 75%) the National rate of Native American geoscience graduates.",

            "abstract": "We relocate a seismic swarm with more than 700 earthquakes that took place between May and June 2006 in the Paricutin volcano area, Mexico inside of the Michoacan monogenetic volcanic field. This seismic swarm was recorded by the project “Mapping the Riviera Subduction Zone” (MARS), a temporary seismic network that was installed in the states of Jalisco, Colima and Michoacán between January 2006 and June 2007. Previously seismic swarms in the area were reported in the years of 1997, 1999 and 2000. For one that took place in the year of 1997 the Servicio Sismologico Nacional deployed a local network in the area, they conclude that the source of the seismicity was tectonic with depths between 18 and 12 km. The episodes of 1999 and 2000 were reported as similar to the 1997 swarm. A previous analysis of the 2006 swarm concludes that the depth of seismicity migrates from 9 to 5 km and was originated by a magmatic intrusion. We did a relocation of this swarm reading all the events and using Hypo71 and the P-wave velocity model used by the Jalisco Seismic and Acelerometric Network; a waveform analysis using cross-correlation method was also carried out. We obtained 15 earthquakes families with a correlation factor equal or greater than 0.79 and composed focal mechanism for each family. These families present a migration in depth beginning at 16 km and ended at 9 km. Our results agrees with a magmatic intrusion, but not so shallow as the previous study of the 2006 swarm.",

These landscapes provide an enormous, but underutilized opportunity for park interpreters and educators to explain some of the most exciting concepts of modern geology. A crucial aspect of doing this is recognizing that many of the rocks and landforms in individual parks are pieces of a huge regional structure. This structure, called the Midcontinent Rift System (MCRS), is a 1.1 billion year old 3000 km (2000 mile) long scar along which the North American continent started to tear apart, just as Africa is splitting today along the East African Rift, but for some reason failed to form a new ocean. Drawing on our experience as researchers and teachers studying the MCRS (Steins) and as an interpreter at Isle Royale National Park (Blavascunas), we seek to give interpreters a brief introduction to MCRS to help them present information about what geologists know already and what they are learning from continuing research. Our goal is to help interpreters visualize how what they see at a specific site fits into an exciting regional picture spanning much of the Midwest.",

            "abstract": "Perennial C4 grasses represent alternatives to corn for the production of ethanol because of low management costs and high biomass production. To evaluate the effects of perennial grasses on the agricultural soils of the Midwest, native switchgrass and a sterile hybrid of the Asian grass Miscanthus were planted at the University of Illinois Energy Farm in 2008. Through five years of growth, above and belowground plant biomass, litter, and soil were compared with soils in plots growing a corn-corn-soy rotation typical of the area. Above- and belowground plant biomass in Miscanthus and switchgrass averaged higher than corn/soy following two years of perennial establishment, with belowground biomass exceeding corn/soy by approximately 5-fold in the year after establishment (2010) and 25-fold by 2012. Measurements of root distribution and turnover rates indicate that roots are the primary contribution of new carbon to soils under perennial crops. Physical fractionation of the soils into water stable aggregates showed 4-14% increases in macroaggregate fractions under perennial crops; the large aggregates are adhered together by organic material and indicative of the increased presence of labile carbon forms like plant roots, fungi, and plant and microbial exudates. Carbon and nitrogen analyses of the fractions show that while overall carbon has not increased significantly in whole soil, soils under perennial grasses are concentrating carbon by 5-17% in the macroaggregates after just 5 years. Native switchgrass roots (buried) and litter (surface-applied) decompose faster than Miscanthus roots and litter, but slower than corn roots and litter buried to simulate incorporation by tillage. Switchgrass soil shows the highest degree of macroaggregate formation, pointing to a high rate of litter and root decomposition and incorporation into soil structure. While macroaggregates are relatively labile soil structures compared to microaggregates and free silt and clay, they offer physical protection to the organic matter and smaller particles contained within them, particularly in soils that are not subject to cultivation. Therefore untilled soils under long-term perennial crop production provide an important environment for the protection of labile carbon.",

            "abstract": "Ensemble-based data assimilation techniques are often applied to land surface models in order to estimate components of terrestrial water and energy balance. Precipitation forcing uncertainty is the principal source of spread among the ensembles which is required for utilizing information in observations to correct model priors. Precipitation fields may have both position and magnitude errors. However current approaches to uncertainty of precipitation forcing in land data assimilation systems often do no more than apply multiplicative errors to precipitation fields. In this presentation we show that an ensemble-based Bayesian approach can be used to produce stochastic replicates of precipitation fields that are conditioned on precipitation observations. We proposes a new ensemble-based approach to characterize uncertainties (in both magnitude (intensity) and phase (location)) associated with precipitation retrieval from space-born instruments. Unlike previous studies, this method derives the error likelihood using an archive of historical measurements and provides an ensemble characterization of measurement error. The ensemble replicates are generated using a stochastic method and are intermittent in space and time. The replicates are concisely described with a low-dimensional and problem-specific set of attributes. The attributes are derived using a novel dimensionality reduction scheme that takes advantage of principle component analysis. A non-parametric importance sampling is formulated in terms of the attribute vectors to solve this Bayesian sampling problem. Results indicate that our ensemble estimation approach is able to provide an improved description of precipitation uncertainties by giving a realistic posterior ensemble that is narrower than the prior.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric O2 increased abruptly around 2.4 Ga in an episode called the Great Oxidation Event, or GOE. Cyanobacteria were producing oxygen well before this time, however (1), so the rise of O2 appears to have been delayed by other factors, most likely a higher flux of hydrogen from Earth’s crust and interior. Changes in volcanic outgassing rates alone cannot be responsible, as the relatively constant C isotope record in marine carbonates would then imply that O2 production should also have been greater (2). Catling and Claire (3,4) have proposed that secular oxidation of the continents was the key factor, leading to a decrease in reduced gases produced during metamorphism. This mechanism seems unlikely, though, because the amount of exposed continental area was small during the Archean (5) and because non-fossil sources of reduced metamorphic gases are also small. A more likely source of hydrogen on the Archean Earth was serpentinization of seafloor, which releases H2 when ferrous iron is oxidized to magnetite. Today, serpentinization of seafloor is a minor H2 source, or O2 sink. The Archean Earth had a hotter mantle, however (6), which should have led to a higher degree of partial melting at the midocean ridges. This, in turn, should have created thick, ultramafic seafloor (7) which should have been prone to serpentinization and H2 release. Gradual secular cooling of the mantle led to thinner, less mafic oceanic crust, thereby decreasing the source of H2 and ultimately triggering the GOE. Thus, the rise of atmospheric O2 on Earth and on Earth-like planets may be directly linked to the temperature of their interiors.\nRefs. [1] Anbar AD, et al. 2007.

            "abstract": "Imaging techniques for the analysis of porous structures have revolutionized our ability to quantitatively characterize geomaterials. For example, digital representations of rock from CT images and physics modeling based on these pore structures provide the opportunity to further advance our quantitative understanding of fluid flow, geomechanics, and geochemistry, and the emergence of coupled behaviors. Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, has revolutionized production of custom parts, to the point where parts might be cheaper to print than to make by traditional means in a plant and ship. Some key benefits of additive manufacturing include short lead times, complex shapes, parts on demand, zero required inventory and less material waste. Even subtractive processing, such as milling and etching, may be economized by additive manufacturing. For the geosciences, recent advances in 3D printing technology may be co-opted to print reproducible porous structures derived from CT-imaging of actual rocks for experimental testing. The use of 3D printed microstructure allows us to surmount typical problems associated with sample-to-sample heterogeneity that plague rock physics testing and to test material response independent from pore-structure variability. Together, imaging, digital rocks and 3D printing potentially enables a new workflow for understanding coupled geophysical processes in a real, but well-defined setting circumventing typical issues associated with reproducibility, enabling full characterization and thus connection of physical phenomena to structure. In this talk we will discuss the possibilities that the marriage of these technologies can bring to geosciences, including examples from our current research initiatives in developing constitutive laws for transport and geomechanics via digital rock physics.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

We use finite element models to simulate a regional system of mantle flow, that includes LPO evolution in olivine polycrystal aggregates tracked along flow paths and anisotropic viscosity tensors based on the LPO. Our first, loosely coupled approach begins with a flow field based on a scalar viscosity. The results are postprocessed to compute LPO by integration along streamlines, and an anisotropic viscosity tensor field is derived from LPO. A new flow field is then computed based on the viscosity tensor field. For this case, the predicted flow field differed in a modest but geologically relevant way from the isotropic case.\n In preparation for incorporating the LPO and effective viscosity calculation directly into the flow code, we have been testing this step separately to assess the sensitivity of the computed tensor to specified deformation parameters. New work explores a power law stress:strain rate relation for the LPO development, upon which the aggregate’s effective viscosity tensor depends. The pattern and amplitude of predicted deviation from isotropic viscosity are stronger than for the previously assumed linear stress:strain rate case, as expected. Initial runs that employ the power law viscosity tensor in updated flow calculations are underway at the time of this writing. In addition to the stress exponent for LPO and the resulting viscosity tensor, flow model parameters that notably impact the predictions include the specified stiffening as asthenosphere cools to lithospheric temperatures and mesh resolution within the axial and the base of lithosphere regions. We will present results for subaxial oceanic spreading center flow and report the outcomes of model parameter testing.",

The plasma boundary conditions are specified from LANL geosynchronous observations. We simulate wave-particle interactions on a global scale as particles drift around the Earth using L and MLT-dependent event-specific chorus and EMIC wave models. The precipitating electron fluxes measured by multiple NOAA satellites are fitted to the equatorial wave measurements made by the EMFISIS instrument on the Van Allen Probes to infer the chorus wave amplitudes on a global scale. The fast dropout of the radiation belts during the October 2012 “double-dip” storm event is investigated and the role of various processes such as outward radial diffusion combined with magnetopause shadowing and enhanced electron precipitation into the atmosphere is evaluated. The simulated cold plasma densities are compared with in situ EMFISIS observations along the Van Allen Probes’ orbits showing good agreement.",

The dataset consists of 1737 events recorded from July 2009 to June 2011 on the 17-station SIGNET broadband seismic array. We use t* spectral decay methods for both P- and S- phases with the clustered locations to highlight locations where significant variations in Q suggest the presence of magma melt. While the presence of a magma sill, at least 2 km depth, is indicated by InSAR and GPS studies, the delineated magma body has not been explored in detail. The lower bound of the proposed magma accumulation is still under question and thus forms the primary target of this research. Melt replenishment and degassing of the magma sill is believed to cause inflation and/or deflation of the caldera floor. Imaging the extent of the magma sill will provide insight into the feeder system and deformation process of the Sierra Negra caldera. Detailed relocation, Qp and Qs inversion, as well as estimates of the scattering attenuation using coda-normalization technique will be presented. The close relationship between seismic attenuation and the thermal state of the magmatic system suggests we can distinguish melt and/or fluid regions within the Sierra Negra plumbing system.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of many microbial ecosystems are determined not only by the response of individual bacteria to their chemical and physical environments but also the dynamics that emerge from interactions between cells. Here we investigate collective dynamics displayed by communities of Thiovulum majus, one of the fastest known bacteria. We observe that when these bacteria swim close to a microscope cover slip, the cells spontaneously aggregate into a visually-striking, two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of rotating cells. Each cell in an aggregate rotates its flagella, exerting a force that pushes the cell into the cover slip and a torque that causes the cell to rotate. As cells rotate against their neighbors, they exert forces and torques on the aggregate that cause the crystal to move and cells to hop to new positions in the lattice. We show how these dynamics arise from hydrodynamic and surface forces between cells. We derive the equations of motion for an aggregate, show that this model reproduces many aspects of the observed dynamics, and discuss the stability of these and similar active crystals. Finally, we discuss the ecological significance of this behavior to understand how the ability to aggregate into these communities may have evolved.",

            "abstract": "The earthquake dynamics can be modelled by employing the spring-block system [Burridge and Knopoff, 1967]. In this approach the earthquake fault is modelled by an array of blocks coupling the loading plate and the lower plate. The dynamics of the system is governed by the system of equations of motion for each block. It is possible to map this system into a cellular automata model, where the stress acting on each block is increased in each time step, and the failing process (frictional slip) is described by stress transfer rules [Olami et al, 1992]. The OFC model produces a power-law distribution for avalanche statistics but it is not capable of producing robust aftershock sequences which follow Omori's law.\nWe propose a nonlinear viscoelastic stress transfer mechanism in the aftershock triggering. In a basic spring-block model setting, we introduce the nonlinear viscoelastic stress transfer between neighbouring blocks, as well as between blocks and the top loading plate. The shear stress of the viscous component is a power-law function of the velocity gradient with an exponent smaller or greater than 1 for the nonlinear viscoelasticity, or 1 for the linear case.\nThe stress transfer function of this nonlinear viscoelastic model has a power-law time-dependent form. It features an instantaneous stress transmission triggering an instantaneous avalanche, which is the same as the original spring-block model; and a power-law relaxation term, which could trigger further aftershocks. We incorporate this nonlinear viscoelasticity mechanism in a lattice cellular automata model. The model could exhibit both the Gutenberg-Richter scaling for the frequency-magnitude distribution and a power-law time decay of aftershocks, which is in accordance with Omori's law. Our study suggests that the stress transfer function may play an important role in the aftershock triggering.\nWe have found that the time decay curve of aftershocks is affected by the shape of the stress transfer function. The stress transfer function of linear viscoelasticity has an time-dependent exponential form, and the corresponding aftershock occurrence rate exhibits an exponential decay. The stress transfer function of nonlinear viscoelasticity has a time-dependent power-law form, this results in a power-law decay of the aftershock occurrence rate.",

            "abstract": "The Tuvalu seamount chain is a Mid-Pacific (4-11oS, 175-179oE) linear volcanic chain that was previously poorly sampled. Absolute plate motion (APM) models predict a long-lived relationship with hotspot activity in French Polynesia. The lack of detailed age data therefore results in a key chronologic gap in the geologic history of this hotspot and current APM models. Depending on the set of assumptions employed, previous APM models have disagreed on which known hotspot chain, if any, the Tuvalu volcanoes are associated with. Based on APM modeling and geochemical affinities (HIMU, 206Pb/204Pb > 20), Konter et al. (2008) argue that Rurutu Island (French Polynesia) represents the modern location of the hotspot that contributed volcanism to the Tuvalu seamounts. This model traces the hotspot chain from Rurutu through the region of modern day Samoa, the Tuvalu seamounts, the Gilbert ridge, and into the North & South Wake islands. This hypothesis suggests that a single HIMU mantle reservoir can exist and remain relatively geochemically consistent over 100 Myrs. On the contrary, the Wessel and Kroenke (2008) APM model suggest the Tuvalu seamounts and N & S Wake are unrelated. This model requires the N & S Wake chains to rotate significantly at the young end of the Gilbert Ridge resulting in a current hotspot location around 13-15oS and 156-155oW, away from any known active volcanism. During the summer of 2013, 25 Tuvaluan seamounts and 9 seamounts near the current Samoan chain were dredged onboard the R.V. Roger Revelle (expedition RR1310). Here we present 43 new 40Ar-39Ar ages covering 19 Tuvaluan seamounts and four seamounts within the Samoan hotspot track. These ages provide insights into the contributing hotspot for Tuvaluan volcanism and provide a new reference frame for constraining Pacific APM models. The corresponding chemical analyses for a subset of these seamounts will be presented by Finlayson et al. (this volume).\nKonter, J. G. et al.

            "abstract": "Since the early Paleozoic, the average bulk δ13C value of marine carbonates has remained relatively positive varying between 0 and +4‰ with distinctive positive excursions that are associated with global changes in the carbon cycle. Unlike the Phanerozoic δ13C data for marine limestones, a major δ13C excursion has been recorded in a globally deposited Neoproterozoic marine dolomite formation, known as the cap dolostone. This excursion with δ13C values ranging systematically between -3 and -5‰ represents a global chronstratigraphic marker used to correlate the end of the major Marinoan glaciation at 636 Ma1. Does this excursion signify a primary seawater value and how might it be interpreted as a primary carbon cycle signal, considering the widespread distribution of the cap dolostone?\nStudies of modern dolomite precipitating environments, such as supratidal sabkhas of Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. and Qatar and coastal hypersaline lagoons of Rio de Janiero State, Brazil, indicate that microbial activity or the biological products, thereof, influence or mediate mineral formation. The precipitating solutions are sourced from normal seawater, which has experienced variable stages of concentration through evaporative processes. Comparison of δ13C values of sabkha dolomite with that formed in the hypersaline lagoons reveals that the former are always rather positive (approx. +2 to +7 ‰), whereas the latter are always negative (approx. -5‰ to -11‰). During very early diagenesis, the original δ13C value of the initial precipitate is not necessarily retained, indicating that synsedimentary processes can alter the carbon signal prior to burial and later diagenesis. However, the potential for very early lithification of microbial dolomite promotes the preservation of original δ13C values, which, thus, can be useful for evaluation of the ancient carbon cycle.\n1Halverson, G.P. et al., 2005.

Metal contaminants enter the food chain via plant uptake from soil and negatively affect human and environmental health. New remediation approaches are needed to lower soil metal contents. To apply these remediation techniques successfully, it is necessary to understand how soil microbes and minerals interact with toxic metals.\nHere we show that microbial Fe(III) reduction initially mobilizes Cd before its immobilization under anoxic conditions. To study how microbial Fe(III) reduction influences Cd mobility, we isolated a new Cd-tolerant, Fe(III)-reducing Geobacter sp. from a heavily Cd-contaminated soil. In lab experiments, this Geobacter strain first mobilized Cd from Cd-loaded Fe(III) hydroxides followed by precipitation of Cd-bearing mineral phases. Using Mössbauer spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, the original and newly formed Cd-containing Fe(II) and Fe(III) mineral phases, including Cd-Fe-carbonates, Fe-phosphates and Fe-(oxyhydr)oxides, were identified and characterized. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy, Cd was mapped in the Fe(II) mineral aggregates formed during microbial Fe(III) reduction.\nMicrobial Fe(III) reduction mobilizes Cd prior to its precipitation in Cd-bearing mineral phases. The mobilized Cd could be taken up by phytoremediating plants, resulting in a net removal of Cd from contaminated sites. Alternatively, Cd precipitation could reduce Cd bioavailability in the environment, causing less toxic effects to crops and soil microbiota. However, the stability and thus bioavailability of these newly formed Fe-Cd mineral phases needs to be assessed thoroughly. Whether phytoremediation or immobilization of Cd in a mineral with reduced Cd bioavailability are feasible mechanisms to reduce toxic effects of Cd in the environment remains to be determined.",

(2013, Proc. SPIE 8867, doi:10.1117/12.2022668) was used to conduct the demonstration. An integrating sphere (IS), linear polarizers and quarter wave plate were used to confirm that the instrument’s spectral response to unpolarized light, to 45° linearly polarized light and to circular polarized light are identical. In all these cases the intensity components Ip = Is where Ip is the component parallel to the object space projected slit and Is is perpendicular to the slit. In the circular polarized case Ip = Is in the time averaged sense. The polarizer and IS were used to characterize the ratio Rθ of the instrument response to linearly polarized light at the angle θ relative to parallel from the slit, for increments of θ from 0 to 90°, to that of the unpolarized case. Spectra of diffusely reflected sunlight passed through the polarizer in increments of θ, and divided by the respective Rθ showed identical results, within the noise limit, for solar spectrum multiplied by the atmospheric transmission and convolved by the Instrument Line Shape (ILS). These measurements demonstrate that unknown polarization in the diffusely reflected sunlight on this small spectral range affect only the slow change across the narrow band in spectral response relative to that of unpolarized light and NOT the finely structured / high contrast spectral structure of the CO2 atmospheric absorption that is used to retrieve the atmospheric content of CO2. The latter is one of the geoCARB mission objectives (Kumer et al, 2013). The situation is similar for the other three narrow geoCARB bands; O2 A band 757.9 to 768.6 nm; strong CO2 band 2045.0 to 2085.0 nm; CH4 and CO region 2300.6 to 2345.6 nm. Polonsky et al have repeated the mission simulation study doi:10.5194/amt-7-959-2014 assuming no use of a geoCARB depolarizer or polarizer. Enabled by measurement of the geoCARB grating efficiencies the simulated intensities Ism include the slow polarization induced spectral change across the band. These Ism are input to the retrieval SW that was used in the original study. There is no significant change to the very positive previous results for the mission objective of gas column retrieval.",

            "abstract": "The energy released during an earthquake includes contributions from seismic radiated energy ER and fracture energy EG, which includes inelastic cracking but not frictional heat generation. Uncertainties in our measurements of ER and stress drop directly affect our estimate of EG, and therefore may bias our understanding of earthquake mechanics. We explore observations of ER from the body-wave far-field velocity source spectrum, and also consider surface-wave contributions to the radiated energy for shallow events. We find that uncertainties in the high-frequency fall-off rate of the source spectrum are the dominant contributor to uncertainties in the scaled radiated energy ER/M0, in contrast to the corner frequency uncertainties that have the largest affect on dynamic stress drop estimates.\nWe investigate the sources of uncertainties that arise from commonly used approaches to remove the path effects from velocity seismograms, i.e., empirical corrections for radiation pattern differences on amplitude and empirical Green’s functions (eGf). Recent dynamic rupture simulations (Kaneko and Shearer, 2014a, 2014b) have highlighted the role of take-off angle, rupture velocity, and source directionality on single-station estimates of stress drop and scaled energy from both P and S source spectra. We thus investigate the likely errors in these parameters that arise in real data from an incomplete sampling of the focal sphere.\nWe re-evaluate ER/M0 estimates for large recent M8.5+ megathrust earthquakes and their uncertainties associated with intrinsic variability in the radiated energy, from removing the path effects, and from incomplete sampling of the focal sphere.",

A case study from California explores how air quality has greatly improved in Los Angeles in the past 20 years, however residents of neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status are still exposed to high levels of air pollutants. Students analyze scientific and health data to develop understanding and expertise in the problem, and are then tasked with developing a cost-benefit analysis of solutions. Gallery walks can be used to connect natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and severe weather, with their human impacts. Students bring their personal experiences with disasters and recovery to analyze how societies should deal with the changing climate and weather risks in their region, the country, or across the world. Town hall meetings allow students to gain expertise and perspective while embodying a role as a particular stakeholder in a climate mitigation or adaptation issue. A successful application of this method is a discussion of whether a resort community should be rebuilt on a barrier island after being destroyed in a category 3 hurricane. Stakeholders which students take on as roles have included climate scientists, homeowners, emergency managers, meteorologists, and others. Including distinct connections to social issues in introductory science courses helps students to not only engage with the material in a deeper way, but also helps to create critical thinkers who will become better citizens for tomorrow.",

            "abstract": "Observational data are used to test the hypothesis that the basic state modulates the dispersion properties of convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs). This hypothesis is based on shallow water theory, which predicts that the zonal speed of propagation of equatorial modes is altered by the equivalent depth and the basic zonal flow. Typical diagnostics of space-time power spectra of cloudiness data reflect the mean behavior of CCEWs in space and time. Here, localized space-time spectra are calculated to investigate how the global spectral peaks vary across the tropics, and how they are affected by the substantial variations in zonal flow observed geographically and by season. The strength of some convectively coupled mode signals are seen to vary widely across the globe, while others show much less dependence on location. For example, Kelvin waves are observed in all sectors, while mixed Rossby-gravity waves only exist with appreciable amplitude over the western and central Pacific. Doppler shifting of the phase speed of CCEWs by the barotropic component of the wind is readily detectable due to both the mean flow and temporally varying extremes in this flow. However, once the Doppler effect is taken into account, the equivalent depths of CCEWs inferred from global power-spectra are surprisingly uniform, both geographically and temporally. There does not seem to be a unique steering level for CCEWs. For instance, the phase speed of Kelvin waves appear to be more influenced by the upper tropopspheric zonal flow, while mixed Rossby-gravity waves respond more to lower tropospheric flow. There are also detectable phase speed and equivalent depth shifts that are consistent with changes in the zonal flow vertical shear. This is particularly evident for equatorial Rossby modes.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing of agroclimatological variables to monitor food production conditions is a critical component of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network portfolio of tools for assessing food security in the developing world. The Decision Support Interface (DSI) seeks to integrate a number of remotely sensed and modeled variables to create a single, simplified portal for analysis of crop growing conditions. The DSI has been reformulated to incorporate more variables and give the user more freedom in exploring the available data. This refinement seeks to transition the DSI from a “first glance” agroclimatic indicator to one better suited for the differentiation of drought events.\nThe DSI performs analysis of variables over primary agricultural zones at the first sub-national administrative level. It uses the spatially averaged rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI), and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to identify potential hazards to food security. Presenting this information in a web-based client gives food security analysts and decision makers a lightweight portal for information on crop growing conditions in the region.\nThe crop zones used for the aggregation contain timing information which is critical to the DSI presentation. Rainfall and ETa are accumulated from different points in the crop phenology to identify season-long deficits in rainfall or transpiration that adversely affect the crop-growing conditions. Furthermore, the NDVI and WRSI serve as their own seasonal accumulated measures of growing conditions by capturing vegetation vigor or actual evapotranspiration deficits.\nThe DSI is currently active for major growing regions of sub-Saharan Africa, with intention of expanding to other areas over the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Europium is fractionated from Sm and Gd during intra-crustal differentiation since Eu (II) strongly partitions into feldspar. Statistical analysis of Sm-Eu-Gd concentrations in over 2000 samples from the continental crust reveal that the bulk continental crust has a negative Eu anomaly. Samples include (1) shales, loess, and tillites which represent upper continental crust (n = 415); (2) amphibolite facies rocks, which represent the middle continental crust (n = 1325) and (3) granulite facies rocks (n = 845), which represent the lower continental crust. The upper and middle continental crust have a significant negative Eu anomaly, while the lower continental crust has a significant positive Eu anomaly. The Eu deficit in the upper and middle continental crust, however, cannot be compensated by the Eu excess in the lower continental crust, leaving the bulk continental crust with a negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.81 ± 0.04, 95% conf.). Since the building blocks of the continental crust (mantle-derived basalts or tonalitic slab melts) do not possess a negative Eu anomaly, removal of lower continental crust, which is the only crustal reservoir enriched in Eu, is required during crustal evolution. A mass balance model of the continents, based on Sm-Eu-Gd systematics, indicates that at least 2.2–3.0 crustal masses may have been added back to the mantle over Earth history via lower crustal recycling.",

            "abstract": "Water vapor plays an important role in the energetics of the Arctic. We demonstrate that the bulk of the poleward moisture transport by transients across 60N is driven by extreme transport events. These events are shown to be closely related to two types of Rossby wave breaking (RWB) – anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and cyclonic wave breaking (CWB). Using a RWB tracking algorithm, we determine that these two types can account for 47% of the total poleward moisture transport by transients across 60\n∘\nN in winter and 37% in summer.\nAdditional analysis suggests that the seasonality of this RWB-related moisture transport is determined equally by the strength of RWB transport, and the frequency of RWB occurrence. The seasonality of RWB occurrence is, in turn, dictated by the seasonal variation of the latitude of the jet-streams – AWB (CWB) related transport occurs more frequently when the jet is shifted poleward (equatorward).\nThe interannual variability of RWB-related transport across 60N in winter is shown to be strongly influenced by climate variability captured by ENSO and the NAO. In the positive (negative) phase of ENSO, AWB transports less (more) moisture through the Bering Strait and CWB transports more (less) through Canada. In the positive (negative) phase of the NAO, AWB transports more (less) moisture through the Norwegian Sea and CWB transports less (more) along the west coast of Greenland. These results highlight how low-frequency climate variability outside of the polar region can influence Arctic water vapor by modulating extreme synoptic transport events.",

On 8th January 2013 at 14:16 UTC (16:16 local time) a moderate earthquake (Mw= 5,7) occurred between the south of Gokceada and southwest of Bozcaada Islands in the North Aegean Sea. The earthquake was felt at a wide area. Especially felt in the NE Greece and NW Turkey surrounding areas, such as felt at Canakkale, Marmara Region and Northern Aegean coast as well as to Athens. The epicenter coordinates were calculated as 39.646N-25.483E and the focal depth was 8.4 km. according to the Kandilli Observatory & Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI). After main shock, in the first 40 hours 160 aftershocks were determined with magnitudes Ml=1.6 -5.0. The area is defined as the continuation of the branch of North Anatolian Fault (NAF) inside the Aegean Sea. Fault plane solution determined by this study shows that the earthquake occurred because of the rupture of an NE-SW oriented strike slip fault segment. The aftershocks distribution also supported the rupture of the NE-SW oriented fault.\nApproximately 17 months after, second big earthquake occurred in the same area. On 24th May 2014, at 09:25 UTC (12:25 local time), a powerful Ml=6.7 (Mw=6.8) earthquake hit Greece and Turkey, in Aegean Sea, 87 km W of Canakkale, and and several tens of people were injured in this hit in Greece and Turkey. This earthquake has been largely felt in Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Balkans. After this earthquake, 576 aftershocks were determined with magnitude range M=0.9- 4.8 in first 96 hours. The main-shock occurred on a fault with a NE-SW strike, where the largest portion of the energy was released towards these directions. Therefore the earthquake was felt strongly in Canakkale-Istanbul and Marmara region. In this study we calculated focal mechanism solutions with first motion direction of P wave and moment tensor solutions for main-shock and important aftershocks (M>4.0). Moment tensor solutions show generally strike-slip faulting. The fault which caused earthquake, is thought to be a branch of North Anatolian Fault Zone in the North Aegean Sea.",

            "abstract": "The cost of fighting large wildland fires in the western United States has grown dramatically over the past decade. This trend will likely continue with growth of the WUI into fire prone ecosystems, dangerous fuel conditions from decades of fire suppression, and a potentially increasing effect from prolonged drought and climate change. Fuel treatments are often considered the primary pre-fire mechanism to reduce the exposure of values at risk to wildland fire, and a growing suite of fire models and tools are employed to prioritize where treatments could mitigate wildland fire damages. Assessments using the likelihood and consequence of fire are critical because funds are insufficient to reduce risk on all lands needing treatment, therefore prioritization is required to maximize the effectiveness of fuel treatment budgets. Cost-effectiveness, doing the most good per dollar, would seem to be an important fuel treatment metric, yet studies or plans that prioritize fuel treatments using costs or cost-effectiveness measures are absent from the literature. Therefore, to explore the effect of using costs in fuel treatment planning we test four prioritization algorithms designed to reduce risk in a case study examining fuel treatments on the Sisters Ranger District of central Oregon. For benefits we model sediment retention and standing biomass, and measure the effectiveness of each algorithm by comparing the differences among treatment and no treat alternative scenarios. Our objective is to maximize the averted loss of net benefits subject to a representative fuel treatment budget. We model costs across the study landscape using the My Fuel Treatment Planner software, tree list data, local mill prices, and GIS-measured site characteristics. We use fire simulations to generate burn probabilities, and estimate fire intensity as conditional flame length at each pixel. Two prioritization algorithms target treatments based on cost-effectiveness and show improvements over those that use only benefits. Variations across the heterogeneous surfaces of costs and benefits create opportunities for fuel treatments to maximize the expected averted loss of benefits. By targeting these opportunities we demonstrate how incorporating costs in fuel treatment prioritization can improve the outcome of fuel treatment planning.",

The dry bias over the Indian landmass in the mean monsoon rainfall is one of the major concerns.\nOur analysis shows a possible bias in the co-evolution of convection and sea surface temperature in CFSv2 over the equatorial Indian Ocean. It is also found that the simulated large scale vertical heat source (Q1) and moisture sink (Q2) over the Indian region are biased relative to observational estimates. We posit a possible explanation for the dry precipitation bias over the Indian landmass in the simulated mean monsoon on the basis of the biases associated with the simulated ocean-atmospheric processes and the vertical heating structure.\nWe further run the CFSv2 model in Superparameterized framework (in T62 resolution) to explore the response of the systematic biases observed in a convection parameterized CFSv2 climate simulations. The incorporation of the superparameterization technique shows reduction of a few systematic biases observed in the traditional convection parametrized CFSv2 model; the highlights are the reduction of the cold tropospheric temperature bias, dry bias of ISM precipitation and underestimation of the synoptic scale variance .\nBased on the reduction of systematic biases in the superparameterized framework as compared to convection parameterized CFSv2, we propose superparameterization technique as one of the possible routes towards better simulation of the global climate.",

Coastal submergence was emulated using a ‘bathtub model’ and rising sea level associated with an atmospheric temperature increase of +1 oC to +4 oC (see Levermann et al. [1]).\nSimulation results are organized into seven regions, each representing an area of common vulnerability characterized in this study as high (9% to 30% land loss), higher (16 to 68% land loss) and highest (48% to 97% land loss). This grouping provides a logical basis for establishing or re-enforcing collaboration based upon a common threat and the utility of shared technical and financial resources.\nOur bathtub model assumes Florida terrain is simply submerged as the shoreline migrates across a static landscape without change in the physical and biological materials subject to marine transgression. However, geologic studies of past and present Florida shorelines indicate the rate of rise is as important as the magnitude when predicting coastal response. To determine the utility of the bathtub model as a representative simulation of Florida’s response to future sea level rise, we considered Florida’s coastal response to varying rates of sea level rise over the last 14,000 years. Available data clearly demonstrate predicted rates of sea level rise will result in widespread submergence; the rate of rise will be too fast to be offset by the stabilizing forces of biogenic or physical sediment accumulation. Hence the magnitude of land loss and associated shoreline retreat in each of the seven Florida regions – and likely other coastal zones in the southeast U.S. – will be solely a function of topographic elevation and can therefore be reasonably forecast using a bathtub model.\nWhile our focus is on Florida’s coastal counties, we recognize in some regions the effects of sea level rise will extend further inland. In these areas, the regional boundaries could be expanded to include adjacent non-coastal counties. However, differences in the perception of risk and associated vulnerability between coastal and inland counties may complicate timely collaboration.\n",

            "abstract": "Epeirogenic histories of highland areas have confounded geophysicists for decades, as there are few records of paleoelevation in eroding highlands. However, preserved basaltic lava flows record paleoelevation in the size distributions of vesicles at the tops and bottoms of flow units. Although the bubbles have identical mass distributions at top and base, they are subject to different total pressures (sizes) due to differences in overburden. Two factors control the size of bubbles at the base of the flow: atmospheric pressure and lava weight. Thus, the atmospheric pressure-dependence of vesicle size can be expressed by the ratio of vesicle size modes at the top and bottom of a flow. The atmosphere’s paleopressure can thus be determined and a paleoelevation can then be calculated. Knowing the elevation at which the rock formed, its age, and its present elevation, the amount of uplift or subsidence can be determined, providing a history of tectonic uplift or subsidence of the locality. The total error bounds of the method are estimated to be ±400 m, which is sufficient only for major epeirogenic trends, such as that seen previously on the Colorado Plateau, and now in Mongolia.\nThe mechanisms that led to the high elevations of the Hangay Plateau in central Mongolia are not clear. As part of a broader collaborative project to better understand the tectonics of this part of Asia, we collected samples from several flows from throughout the Hangay Plateau. Results suggest that the Hangay Plateau experienced uplift of over 1 km in the last 10 Ma., corresponding to an average uplift rate of about 140 m/Ma (see graph below, with intercept within error bounds of 0,0). A flow sampled from the adjacent northern Gobi Desert indicates a paleoelevation of only a few hundred meters (no significant recent uplift), suggesting that the Gobi has experienced a different recent tectonic history from the Hangay Plateau. The uplift history of the Hangay, in addition to the composition of its lavas, geomorphology of the region, drainage pattern history, and other proxies, bears on possible mechanisms for uplift of this part of central Asia, which we are now evaluating.",

            "abstract": "A condition that initiates macropore flow at the land surface is the application of water faster than it can infiltrate into the soil matrix material. Sometimes this is taken to require ponding, but accumulated evidence shows preferential flow to be commonplace when wetness is less than saturation and when macropores are not completely filled. Examples include water flowing into shrinkage cracks or funneled into macropores by hydrophobic surface material. A more inclusive criterion is that macropore flow is generated when the water application rate exceeds the infiltrability of a small area associated with a macropore.\nA new model based on this criterion considers the representative elementary area (REA), as would be appropriate for measurement of field-scale infiltrability, to be divided into a mosaic of functional sub-areas (FSA). A single value of matrix infiltrability characterizes each FSA. The REA as a mosaic of FSAs is hydraulically represented by a characteristic distribution of infiltrabilities. During rainfall or irrigation, each FSA absorbs water into its soil matrix material up to the rate of its matrix infiltrability. Water applied in excess of this infiltrability is assumed to flow into a macropore within or adjacent to the FSA, becoming preferential flow. Especially if crusted or hydrophobic, an FSA can generate preferential flow even during low-intensity rainfall when other FSAs are absorbing all incident water into the matrix. The total flux of preferential flow at given depth is the sum of contributions from all FSAs. In this way the characteristic distribution of FSA infiltrabilities controls the field-scale partitioning of matrix and macropore flow as an emergent phenomenon.\nIllustrative case studies use field-measured data concerning water application rate and preferential flux. Results show this model can quantitatively represent observations of preferential flow occurring in relatively dry soils or at modest rainfall intensities.",

            "abstract": "Denudation and magmatism are distinct characteristics of Large Igneous Provinces, such as the Northwest Australian volcanic margin. Unfortunately, its temporal and spatial extent is poorly defined. Here, I present a simple isostatic model relating denudation to plume induced lithospheric thinning and underplating to delineate the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous Exmouth mantle plume. This upwelling was centered on a highly extended and subsided continental fragment known as the subsea Sonne/Sonja Ridge area and includes the Cuvier Margin (CM) and Cape Range Fracture Zone (CRFZ). The region is characterized by ~3 km denudation and ~ 500 m tectonic uplift, with erosion products acting as provenance for the Early Cretaceous Lower Barrow delta. Partial melting of the plume generated an underplate, characterized as a high velocity body (HVB) on seismic data. Denudation analysis indicates that only ~40 % of the HVB is melt related, with the effective underplate ~ 4 km thick at the plume centre, decreasing in the outer regions. Widespread plume induced convective lithospheric thinning set the boundary conditions for subsequent extension related magmatism and breakup in the Valanginian, as recorded by subsidence analysis of exploration wells. Hot plume derived material flowed to regions under extension, initiating additional magmatism now observed as SDRs (Seaward Dipping Reflectors series), initially thick magmatic crust, followed by normal ocean spreading in the Hauterivian. After initial upwelling, the thermal plume can be traced in a western direction as a hotspot to the Quokka Rise in the mid Cretaceous, before terminating after 35 – 50 Ma of activity. These findings suggest that most volcanic margins are generated by plume upwellings that are relatively passive features, with uplift consisting of a combination of plume induced convective lithospheric thinning and underplating. Melt migration and mantle heating subsequently lower stresses and facilitate breakup.",

            "abstract": "Historically, quantification with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has been limited to the ability to matrix match both standards and samples. This can prove problematic when a particular matrix matched standard is not readily available. Liquid standard addition has been shown1-4 as an alternative technique for quantification that does not require matrix matching; however, further fundamental study is needed especially considering the different mass flow rates delivered to the plasma from traditional pneumatic nebulizers and laser ablation itself.\nIn this work, the authors combine a specialized low-flow desolvating nebulizer system with LA-ICP-MS. This nebulizer system efficiently removes water vapour, thereby significantly reducing oxide based mass spectral interferences. For the instrument setup, the output from the laser is combined with the dried aerosol from the nebulizer system prior to entering the ICP-MS source. By using two sources of dry aerosol, mixing efficiency is improved whilst minimising plasma power lost to solvent (water vapour) processing.\nThe method was applied to both USGS Green River Shale and an Arkansas Womble Shale. The results showed a number of elements that were correctly quantified using the technique as compared to reference values.\n",

            "abstract": "The Cenozoic Qilian Shan--the widest thrust belt on the Tibetan Plateau--exposes a record of early Paleozoic subduction-accretion associated with closure of the Qilian Ocean as the Qaidam microcontinent converged with North China. Despite decades of intense research, there is little consensus regarding the nature of the Qilian orogen (e.g., subduction polarity or number of arcs). For example, are the scattered ophiolite-bearing mélange complexes in the Qilian Shan the result of multiple arcs colliding along several suture zones in the Paleozoic or Cenozoic thrust duplication of a single Paleozoic suture zone? A major problem is that existing hypotheses neglect Cenozoic reorganization of the earlier tectonic framework, and the coupling between Paleozoic and Cenozoic structures has yet to be systematically investigated. To address this issue, we examine the Paleozoic Qilian Shan in the context of Cenozoic deformation. We conducted detailed field mapping (~1:50,000), balanced cross-section construction and restoration, U-Pb-Th zircon geochronology, Th-Pb dating of monazite inclusions in garnet, thermobarometry, and whole-rock geochemistry across the central Qilian Shan and in the Hexi Corridor foreland near Jinchan, where the North China craton abuts directly against the Qilian orogen. Successions of juxtaposed amphibolite facies Proterozoic gneiss (T: 725 ± 53°C, P: 7.9 ± 0.9 kbar), Cambrian oceanic material (U-Pb zircon ages: 530-520 Ma), and Ordovician-Silurian arc-derived granite (U-Pb zircon ages: 475-445 Ma) are exposed in the hanging walls of south-directed Cenozoic thrusts that place this basement over younger strata. A regionally correlative unconformity at the base of Carboniferous-Triassic strata is duplicated by this deformation and is used as marker horizon in our restoration. Initial estimates indicate a minimum post-Triassic shortening strain of ~42-45% across the range. By removing this deformation on mapped faults and adhering to observed field relationships, we are able to restore the pre-Cenozoic configuration of the Qilian orogen. Our observations are consistent with a single south-dipping Cambrian-Silurian subduction-collision zone, while the present-day apparent multitude of sutures can be explained as the direct result of Cenozoic deformation and duplication.",

However, due to uncertainties and coarse spatial resolution, models are unable to provide reliable information on local climate effect. Evidence on local temperature effects of forests from field observations is limited within a small spatial range, which is insufficient to address global forests with high heterogeneity. In this study, we present new evidence acquired from satellite observations to investigate how forest affects local temperature through biophysical mechanisms from a global perspective. Results show tropical forest has strong cooling effect throughout the year. Northern/southern temperate forests have weak/moderate cooling, peak in summer but weak in winter. Boreal forest has significant warming effect in particularly in winter. A diurnal asymmetric feature is observed at most forests, which is daytime cooling and nighttime warming relative to open land. The spatiotemporal patterns are largely a consequence of the competing effects of albedo and evapotranspiration, which also depend on climate conditions especially humidity and snow. Our study reveals biophysical mechanisms have consistent impact on local climate in terms of temperature with those large-scale impacts from climate models. This information could be used to inform forest management at local level and possible climate effects of the ongoing land use activities of forestry.",

            "abstract": "We examine spatial and temporal patterns of microseismic events in an underground mine. Our objective is to address three key questions: Where does the seismicity occur? Why does it occur in these locations but not elsewhere? And what triggers it? We take advantage of waveform similarity by performing multiplet analysis based on the double-difference technique to obtain highly accurate relative locations. Seven vertical receiver boreholes that surround the area under investigation have recorded microseismic data during a month, thus providing a good azimuthal coverage. A minimum crosscorrelation level of 85% is used to detect 21 multiplet groups, which represents 60% of the total seismicity. The largest groups are located close to the main shaft and tunnels at orebody levels, thus we postulate seismicity is facilitated by the potential of subsidence if we assume a compacting earth and hoop stresses acting on the vertical shafts. Surprisingly, most events only occur during certain hours of the day but do not relate to blasting. They correlate with scheduled operations of rock removal. Therefore, it is likely they have been triggered by the transportation of the debris along the main shaft instead of blasting, as we initially expected. Given that seismicity is present around the main shaft but absent close to the second air shaft, we conclude that for seismicity to occur both a favourable stress state must exist, as well as additional external forces, causing dynamic triggering. This analysis provides more insight into anthropogenic processes and their roles as major initiators of seismicity during dynamic stress transfer thereby facilitating identification of hazardous areas in mine settings.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have used vegetation indices (VIs) and land surface temperature data derived from visible and near infrared (VNIR) sensors to study land surface phenology (LSP) and land surface seasonality (LSS). Here, we describe the synergistic use of passive microwave and VNIR data to characterize LSP and LSS in croplands. We combined passive microwave air temperature from AMSR-E with two VIs—NDVI and EVI—from MODIS to study cropland dynamics from 2003-2010 in the major grain production areas of Northern Eurasia. Using MODIS IGBP 0.05o land cover type 1 percentage data, we selected a total of 49 AMSR-E pixels at 25km spatial resolution in Ukraine (UA=14), Southern Russia (RU=24) and Northern Kazakhstan (KZ=11). Convex quadratic (CxQ) models fitted by site to growing degree-day (GDD) as a function of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) yielded high coefficients of determination (0.88≤ r2 ≤0.98). Deviations of GDD from the average CxQ model by site corresponded to peak VI for negative residuals and low VI at beginning and end of growing season. These patterns are understandable in terms of changes in the surface energy balance: higher latent heat flux during times of actively growing vegetation and higher sensible heat flux during periods of lower canopy evapotranspiration. Modeled thermal time to peak, i.e., AGDD at peak GDD, showed a strong inverse linear trend with respect to latitude with r2 of 0.92 for RU and KZ and 0.81 for UA. Lower latitude sites (≤48° N) that grow winter grains show either a longer unimodal growing season or a bimodal growing season; whereas, higher latitude sites (>48° N) where spring grains are cultivated show shorter, unimodal growing seasons. All sites show distinct seasonality in both GDD and VIs. Over the 8 year study period, some exhibit shifts between unimodal and bimodal LSP patterns. Regional heatwaves that devastated grain production in 2007 in UA and 2010 in RU and KZ appear anomalous from average models of GDD and VIs.",

            "abstract": "Early warning of the timing and locations of malaria epidemics can facilitate the targeting of resources for prevention and emergency response. In response to this need, we are developing the Epidemic Prognosis Incorporating Disease and Environmental Monitoring for Integrated Assessment (EPIDEMIA) computer system. EPIDEMIA incorporates software for capturing, processing, and integrating environmental and epidemiological data from multiple sources; data assimilation techniques that continually update models and forecasts; and a web-based interface that makes the resulting information available to public health decision makers. The system will enable forecasts that incorporate lagged responses to environmental risk factors as well as information about recent trends in malaria cases. Because the egg, larval, and pupal stages of mosquito development occur in aquatic habitats, information about the spatial and temporal distributions of stagnant water bodies is critical for modeling malaria risk. Potential sources of hydrological data include satellite-derived rainfall estimates, evapotranspiration (ET) calculated using a simplified surface energy balance model, and estimates of soil moisture and fractional water cover from passive microwave radiometry. We used partial least squares regression to analyze and visualize seasonal patterns of these variables in relation to malaria cases using data from 49 districts in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Seasonal patterns of rainfall were strongly associated with the incidence and seasonality of malaria across the region, and model fit was improved by the addition of remotely-sensed ET and soil moisture variables. The results highlight the importance of remotely-sensed hydrological data for modeling malaria risk in this region and emphasize the value of an ensemble approach that utilizes multiple sources of information about precipitation and land surface wetness. These variables will be incorporated into the forecasting models at the core of the EPIDEMIA system, and. future model development will involve a cycle of continuous forecasting, accuracy assessment, and model refinement.",

Giovanni (Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization ANd aNalysis Infrastructure) offers a variety of data summarization and visualization to users that operate at the data center, obviating the need for users to download and read the data themselves for exploratory data analysis. However, the NLDAS data has proven surprisingly resistant to application of the summarization algorithms. Algorithms that were perfectly happy analyzing 15 years of daily satellite data encountered limitations both at the algorithm and system level for 35 years of hourly data. Failures arose, sometimes unexpectedly, from command line overflows, memory overflows, internal buffer overflows, and time-outs, among others. These serve as an early warning sign for the problems likely to be encountered by the general user community as they try to scale up to “Big Data” analytics. Indeed, it is likely that more users will seek to perform remote web-based analysis precisely to avoid the issues, or the need to reprogram around them. We will discuss approaches to mitigating the limitations and the implications for data systems serving the user communities that try to scale up their current techniques to analyze Big Data.",

            "abstract": "All authigenic mineral and organic molecule stable isotopic proxies are complicated by the fact that meteoric-derived waters evaporate. As a consequence, it can be difficult to distinguish changes in paleotopography from changes in paleohydrology/climate across a given stratigraphic interval. Yet, what on the surface appears as a problem can instead be viewed as an opportunity: integrated paleotopographic-hydroclimatic reconstructions using multi-proxy methods. Using a combination of modern isotope hydrology data, evaporation experiment results, Quaternary authigenic mineral records, and both high-resolution and low-resolution Neogene proxy records, we show that the effects of evaporation on stable isotopic proxies follow quantitative empirical patterns that result from well known kinetic/disequilibrium fractionation. Results from the western U.S. cordillera and the New Zealand Southern Alps suggest that laminated lacustrine carbonates preserved in the geological record are particularly attractive archives of paleohydrology and local water balance. When combined with other proxies and atmospheric circulation/climate models, such high-resolution ‘snap-shots’ of paleohydroclimatic conditions facilitate a more complete and integrated understanding of the coupled evolution of topography and hydroclimate over tectonic time scales in these two highly debated orogenic systems.",

The validation reference data consisted of fourteen sample sites acquired from the fire_cci project and the remaining new samples sites generated from a densification of the stratified sampling for North America.

            "abstract": "There are several proposed precursors to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that may provide the ability to predict ENSO as much as one year in advance. Some of these precursors are associated with stochastic forcing from extratropical atmospheric variability. Two examples are the seasonal footprinting mechanism (SFM) and the Pacific meridional mode (PMM). Both of these ENSO precursors are thought to be forced by the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), a north-south sea level pressure dipole in the north Pacific. Additionally, both the PMM and SFM are thought to impact the tropics through wind evaporation SST feedbacks and have a correlation with ENSO up to one year in advance.\nThese two precursors are discussed interchangeably throughout the literature and various indices used to define them co-mingle them. As a result, whether they are independent of each other or are part of the same process has not been investigated. The research presented is focused on untangling the relationship between the PMM, SFM, NPO, and ENSO using observational datasets and model simulations. Observational results demonstrate that these two mechanisms are different, are forced by different atmospheric circulations, and result in different manifestations of ENSO. Modeling results highlight the extent to which climate models can simulate these relationships and their impact on the simulation of ENSO.",

The aim of this research is to derive storage-discharge relationships using streamflow recession hydrograph analysis for watersheds located throughout California. Regression analyses are performed to evaluate empirical storage-discharge parameters as a function of physical watershed parameters and catchment hydrologic characteristics. We illustrate how such regional empirical evaluations provide functional relationships consistent with historic literature to develop parameters for surface-subsurface interaction in fine-resolution land surface models for California.",

            "abstract": "The tsunami forecast tool developed by the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (NCTR) provides real-time tsunami forecast and is composed of the following major components: a pre-computed tsunami propagation database, an inversion algorithm that utilizes real-time tsunami data recorded at DART stations to define the tsunami source, and inundation models that predict tsunami wave characteristics at specific coastal locations.\nThe propagation database is a collection of basin-wide tsunami model runs generated from 50x100 km “unit sources” with a slip of 1 meter. Linear combination and scaling of unit sources is possible since the nonlinearity in the deep ocean is negligible. To define the tsunami source using the unit sources, real-time DART data is ingested into an inversion algorithm. Based on the selected DART and length of tsunami time series, the inversion algorithm will select the best combination of unit sources and scaling factors that best fit the observed data at the selected locations. This combined source then serves as boundary condition for the inundation models.\nDifferent combinations of DARTs and length of tsunami time series used in the inversion algorithm will result in different selection of unit sources and scaling factors. Since the combined unit sources are used as boundary condition for inundation modeling, different sources will produce variations in the tsunami wave characteristics. As part of the testing procedures for the tsunami forecast tool, staff at NCTR and both National and Pacific Tsunami Warning Centers, performed post-event forecasts for several historical tsunamis. The extent of variation due to different source definitions obtained from the testing is analyzed by comparing the simulated maximum tsunami wave amplitude with recorded data at tide gauge locations. Results of the analysis will provide an error estimate defining the possible range of the simulated maximum tsunami wave amplitude for each specific inundation model.",

Current research indicates that this may not always be valid for positive-definite variables such as water vapor. With the recent publication of variational schemes for mixed-distributions that are designed for lognormal-distributed random variables, the goal of this research is to quantify the quality of satellite retrievals with a synthetic test case. To do this the CIRA 1-Dimensional Optimal Estimator (C1DOE), a 1DVAR satellite retrieval system, now includes a transform approach as well as a lognormal version of the cost function. Since a Gaussian distribution has the trait that its’ mean, median, and mode are all the same, it is believed that the lognormal distribution may be better suited for skewed variables because it will solve for the mode explicitly. To test this hypothesis lognormal-distributed values for mixing ratio are created and used as the true solution then randomly perturbed with synthetic noise to be retrieved with Gaussian, transform, and lognormal retrieval systems.

            "abstract": "Decades of satellite observations have shown that the solar wind that forms the heliosphere consists of two distinct types: the so-called fast and slow. The fast wind originates back at the Sun in long-lived open field regions observed as “coronal holes” in X-Ray images, but the source of the slow wind has long been an issue of intense debate. Due to its observed location in the heliosphere, its plasma composition, and its variability, many models for the origin of the slow wind postulate that it is a result of the release of closed-field plasma onto open field lines. In the recent S-Web model we proposed that the slow wind originates at a dynamic boundary region between open and closed flux in the solar corona. Consequently, the detailed structure of the open-closed magnetic boundary and, most important, the dynamics of this boundary are essential for determining the properties of the slow wind and of the heliosphere, in general. The three important magnetic topologies of the open-closed boundary in the corona and their consequences for the inner heliosphere will be discussed. Furthermore, recent simulations will be presented revealing the dynamics of this boundary and demonstrating that these dynamics can account for the observed properties of the slow wind. The implications of our results for understanding the corona-heliosphere connection and especially for interpreting observations from the upcoming Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions will be discussed.\nThis work was supported by the NASA TR&T and SR&T Programs.",

Our objective is to understand how variations in precipitation intensity and frequency, tectonic uplift rates, and topographic relief affect the magnitude and composition of organic matter deposited along this margin. To examine the possible tectonic and climatic factors influencing the land-ocean relationship of Cascadia during the late Holocene, we measured the organic carbon content, carbon-nitrogen ratio, stable isotopic compositions of organic carbon, yields of lignin-derived and lipid-derived constituents, and mineral surface area of collected sediments from box, kasten and piston cores. Decreases in several organic constituents revealed a potential preferential degradation of marine organic matter over time. Lignin phenol abundances oscillated downcore, pointing towards changes in the provenance of terrigenous organic matter transported to this site. Primary component analysis (PCA) illustrated distinct marine and terrestrial organic matter-dominated segments of the record, which will be correlated to eustatic, tectonic and climatic forcings over the late Holocene.",

            "abstract": "The goal of SOCRATES is to quantify the critical role of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) in the climate system. The mission would provide, for the first time, the suite of measurements required to quantify stratosphere/troposphere exchange (STE) pathways and their contribution to UTLS composition, and to evaluate the radiative forcing implications of potential changes in STE pathways with climate change. The discrimination and quantification of STE pathways requires simultaneous measurement of several key trace gases and aerosols with high precision, accuracy, and vertical resolution. Furthermore, aerosol and clouds, often present in the UTLS, complicate the measurement of trace gases. The SOCRATES sensor is a 23-channel Gas Filter Correlation Radiometer (GFCR), referred to as GLO (GFCR Limb solar Occultation), with heritage from HALOE on UARS, and SOFIE on AIM. GLO measures aerosol extinction from 0.45 to 3.88 µm, important radiatively active gases in the UTLS (H2O, O3, CH4, N2O), key tracers of STE (HCN, CO, HDO), gases important in stratospheric O3 chemistry (HCl and HF), and temperature from cloud top to 50 km at a vertical resolution of 1 km. Improved pointing knowledge will provide dramatically better retrieval precision in the UTLS, even in the presence of aerosols, than possible with HALOE. In addition, the GLO form factor is only a few percent of that of HALOE, and costs for a constellation of GLO sensors is within the cost cap of a NASA Venture mission. The SOCRATES mission concept is an 8-element constellation of autonomous CubeSats, each mated with a GLO sensor, deployed from a single launch vehicle. The SOCRATES/GLO approach reaps the advantages of solar occultation: high precision and accuracy; robust calibration; and high vertical resolution, while mitigating the sparse coverage of a single solar occultation sensor. We present the SOCRATES science case, and key elements of the SOCRATES mission and GLO instrument concepts.",

            "abstract": "High-frequency (several hundred kilohertz) multibeam echo-sounder (MBES) systems have the potential to provide complete coverage of large areas (km2) of the bed, rapidly (mins to hrs), at high resolution (cm2), and with high positional accuracy (cm). Here, we explore the use of MBES data to estimate grain-scale roughness of submerged riverbed sediment. There are two broad approaches: 1) using digital elevation models constructed from depth soundings, and 2) using acoustic backscatter. We discuss the relative merits of both approaches using examples from data collected on the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyons, Arizona, USA.\nThe primary advantage of acoustic backscatter over topography from soundings, for the purposes of sediment classification, is the potential to distinguish between sediment at a higher resolution. This is because soundings are point measurements, whereas a recorded backscatter magnitude is the integral of backscattered sound from all scatterers in the insonified area. In addition, this acoustic return contains information about both the roughness and the hardness/impedance of the sediment. The statistics of backscatter magnitudes alone are found to be a poor discriminator between sediment types perhaps because, using our 400 kHz system, the scattering regime changes from Rayleigh (sound scattering by particles smaller than the sound wavelength) for fine sand, to geometric (scattering by larger-than-sound-wavelength particles) for substrates coarser than sand. However, simple measures derived from backscatter power spectra (namely, the variance, integral lengthscale, and the intercept and slope from a power-law form - see Figure) are found to distinguish between patches of sand, gravel, cobbles and boulders. Using this dependence, we present a new data-driven approach to classify grain-scale roughness, developed by comparing the spectral properties of backscatter with bed-sediment observations using geo-referenced underwater video.",

While these volatiles may be located near the surface, access to them will likely require subsurface sampling, during which it is desirable to monitor the volatile content. In a simulation of such activities, a multilayer lunar simulant was prepared with differing water content, and placed inside a thermal vacuum chamber at Glenn Research Center (GRC). The soil profile was cooled using liquid nitrogen. In addition to the soil, a drill and infrared (IR) spectrometer (~1600-3400 nm) were also located in the GRC chamber. We report the spectral observations obtained during a sequence where the drill was repeatedly inserted and extracted, to different depths, at the same location. We observe an overall increase in the spectral signature of water ice over the duration of the test. Additionally, we observe variations in the water ice spectral signature as the drill encounters different layers.",

The lightning flash rate is proposed here to be proportional to the convective available potential energy (CAPE) times the precipitation rate. Using observations, the product of CAPE and precipitation is found to explain the majority of variance in the time series of total cloud-to-ground lightning flashes over the contiguous United States (CONUS) on timescales ranging from diurnal to seasonal. The observations reveal that storms convert the CAPE of water mass to discharged lightning energy with an efficiency of about 1%. This proxy can be applied to global climate models, which provide predictions for the increase in lightning due to global warming. Results from 11 GCMs will be shown.",

            "abstract": "Climate-change impacts on species distributions will be especially complex in mountain systems with steep environmental gradients and heterogeneous landscapes. In the western US, projected climate conditions include rising temperatures, decreased snowpack, and increased moisture deficits, all of which will impact species distributions at high elevations. Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis; WBP) is a keystone species in subalpine environments and one that is highly vulnerable to projected climate trends. In the past two decades, WBP populations dramatically declined as a result of bark beetle infestation, blister rust, high-severity fires, and drought. Species-niche modeling used to map future WPB distributions is based on the relation between present-day occurrence and bioclimatic parameters. While these models capture the realized niche, the full niche space inferred from paleo-observations appears to be much larger. To assess a broad range of bioclimatic conditions for WPB, we examined its response to past changes in climate, fire activity, and species competition. General additive modeling of pollen/charcoal data from the Greater Yellowstone area indicate that WBP reached maximum population size and distribution ~12,000 -7500 years ago and declined thereafter. Population dynamics tracked variations in summer insolation, such that WBP was most abundant when summer temperatures and fire frequency were higher than at present. Competition from lodgepole pine after ~10,000 years ago limited WBP at middle elevations. Paleoecological data indicate that the fundamental WBP niche is considerably larger than assumed, and simulations that project the demise of WBP in the next 50 years are probably too dramatic given WPB’s ability to thrive under warm conditions and high fire activity in the past. Management strategies that reduce biotic competition and nonnative pathogens should help increase the future resilience of WBP and other subalpine species.",

Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that current ESMs substantially underestimated the forest responses to drought. This underestimation is likely resulted from the fact that ESMs utilize carbon-based metrics of plant health to predict mortality, while our recent findings show that the universal signal of drought-caused tree mortality lies in the plant hydraulic function failure. To better predict vegetation dynamics under drought and vegetation feedbacks to climate, we developed a global model of plant hydraulic failure within a land model of DOE-Sponsored ESM, CLM(ED). The hydraulic model has been evaluated at our site level observations in New Mexico and will be evaluated against remote sensing estimates at regional to global scales. We expect that our hydraulic failure model will substantially improve the ESM performance in predicting global cycle response to drought.",

            "abstract": "Ice core records reveal episodes of rapid atmospheric CO2 rise and Δ14C excursions during deglaciation. Recent evidence suggests that this CO2 was sequestered in deep and intermediate waters during glacial periods and then released to the atmosphere due to changes in ocean circulation. Scenarios involving a more efficient biological pump and reduced ventilation of Southern Ocean deep waters have been cited as likely methods for glacial carbon storage (Sigman and Boyle, 2000). A more efficient biological pump calls on increased CaCO3 compensation as a buffer for reduced deep ocean alkalinity along with increased nutrient supply and primary production as a method of sequestering carbon from the surface ocean to the deep ocean (Marchitto et al., 2005). Modeling studies suggest that reduced ventilation of Southern Ocean waters due to increased sea ice cover and reduced upwelling is the dominant mechanism for carbon storage with a smaller contribution from the biological pump (Joos et al., 2011; Toggweiler., 2006). This study further examines the issue of changes in ocean ventilation by providing records of paired benthic and planktonic foraminiferal 14C ages from the deglacial sections of Eastern Equatorial Pacific marine sediment cores TR163-23 and TR163-18 at 2730 and 2030 meters depth, respectively. An Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) sourced record of ventilation aids in the constraint of carbon previously sequestered through the Southern Ocean during periods of enhanced brine rejection and increased sea-ice extent (Marchitto et al., 2007; Pahnke et al., 2008; Keeling and Stephens, 2001). North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) production has also been found to vary on millennial time scales reaching as far south as 8°N during glacial periods (Leduc et al., 2010). However, both cores used in this study are sufficiently deep and far enough south (0.41°N, 92.16°W and 2.81°N, 89.85°W) to avoid intrusion of NPIW that might obscure the AAIW signal.",

After one year, they are encouraged to reapply as interns, where they work on their own research project. Students who have successfully completed their intern year can reapply as fellows, where they conduct an independent research project such as an honors thesis. Students present their research at a Symposium through posters (trainees) or talks (interns and fellows). Interns and fellows help organize program activities and serve as peer mentors to trainees.Multi-tiered programs that build a pathway toward graduation have been shown to increase student retention and graduation success.\nOutreach. Undergraduate researchers rarely feel like experts when working with graduate students and faculty. For students to develop their identity as scientists, it is essential that they be given the opportunity to assume the role as expert. Engaging students in outreach is a win-win situation. Students gain valuable skills and confidence in sharing their research with their local community, and the public gets to learn about exciting research happening at UH.\nProfessional Development. Each month, the Scholars meet to develop their professional skills on a particular topic, such as outreach, scientific presentations, interviewing, networking, and preparing application materials for jobs, scholarships and summer REUs. Students are strongly encouraged to participate in summer REUs on the mainland US, both to gain independence and as a testing ground for graduate school.\nIn December, qualitative and quantitative evaluation results will be shared to demonstrate the effectiveness of this model in increasing student retention and graduation success.",

            "abstract": "Stream depletion is the reduction in flow rate in a stream due to pumping in an aquifer that is hydraulically connected to the stream. The amount of stream depletion is related to the pumping rate, the distance between the well and the stream, and the hydraulic properties of the aquifer and streambed. If the conductance of the streambed sediment is high, water is exchanged easily between the aquifer and the stream, leading to high stream depletion; while if the sediment has low conductance, water cannot be exchanged easily, so stream depletion is lower. While sediment transport occurs continuously in natural stream channels, features of the channels create patterns of sediment transport behavior that lead to alternating reaches of higher conductance and lower conductance. Furthermore, these patterns of streambed heterogeneity vary temporally due to scour and deposition during high flow and low flow periods. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that temporal variations in heterogeneity patterns lead to exaggerated amounts of stream depletion. Specifically, if a well is pumping near a stream stretch that alternates between periods of high conductance and periods of low conductance, the amount of stream depletion during the high conductance periods will be higher than the amount of stream depletion that would be expected if the streambed sediment permanently had high conductance. Similarly, the amount of stream depletion during the low conductance periods will be lower than the amount of stream depletion that would be expected if the stream bed sediment permanently had low conductance. This behavior results from the cumulative effect of the temporally-varying conductance on drawdown in the aquifer in the vicinity of the stream. More drawdown occurs during periods of low conductance than during periods of high conductance. Thus, when a period of high conductance follows a period of low conductance, the drawdown in the aquifer near the stream, and therefore the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and the stream, is larger than it would be if high conductance was assumed for the entire simulation. Consequently, stream depletion during the high conductance period is higher if the streambed conductance varies temporally than if it is always high.",

In addition to the geographical distributions of the precipitation systems and intense convection with global coverage from 65oS-65oN, the differences between radar and passive microwave precipitation retrievals are examined in different types of precipitation systems over land and ocean in the tropics and mid-high latitudes respectively. These statistics are compared to the 16-year climatology from TRMM V7 products in tropics. We also examine the differences between diurnal variations of precipitation and convection in tropics and in mid-high latitudes. Due to the process of calibrations of the instruments and the algorithms at the early stage of the mission, these preliminary results have large uncertainties. However, they could provide some guidance to improve the algorithms.",

            "abstract": "A few scientific groups convincingly demonstrated that the magnetic fields induced by the lunar semidiurnal (M2) ocean flow can be identified in magnetic satellite observations. These results support the idea to recover M2 magnetic signals from Swarm data, and to use these data for constraining lithosphere and upper mantle electrical conductivity in oceanic regions. Induction studies using ionospheric and magnetospheric primary sources with periods of about one day are sensitive to mantle conductivity at a few hundred kilometers depth because of the inductive coupling between primary and induced sources. In contrast, using oceanic tides as a signal allows studying shallower regions since the coupling is galvanic. This corresponds to global electric sounding. In this study we perform global 3-D EM numerical simulations in order to investigate the sensitivity of M2 signals to conductivity distributions at different depths. The results of sensitivity analysis are discussed, and comparison of the modelled M2 signals with those recovered by Comprehensive Inversion from one year of Swarm data is presented.",

            "abstract": "Soil is the most important long-term sink for carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems, containing more C than plant biomass and the atmosphere combined. However, soil has historically been under-represented in C cycling literature, especially in regards to information about subsurface (>1.0 m) layers and processes. Previous research has indicated that Andisols with large quantities of noncrystalline, variable-charge minerals, including allophane, imogolite, and ferrihydrite, contain more C both in total and at depth than other soil types in the Pacific Northwest. The electrostatic charge of variable-charge soils depends on pH and is sometimes net positive, particularly in acid conditions, such as those commonly developed under the coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest. However, even soils with a net negative charge may contain a mixture of negative and positive exchange sites and can hold some nutrient anions through the anion exchange capacity. To increase our understanding of the effects of variable-charge on soil organic matter stabilization, deep sampling is under way at the Fall River Long-Term Soil Productivity Site in western Washington. This site has a deep, well-drained soil with few rocks, which developed from weathered basalt and is classified as an Andisol of the Boistfort Series. Samples have been taken to a depth of 3 m at eight depth intervals. In addition to analyzing total soil C, these soils will be analyzed to determine functional groups present, cation exchange capacity, anion exchange capacity, and non-crystalline mineral content. These data will be analyzed to determine any correlations that may exist between these mineralogical characteristics, total soil C, and types of functional groups stored at depth. The most abundant organic functional groups, including carboxylic and phenolic groups, are anionic in nature, and soil positive charge may play an important role in binding and stabilizing soil organic matter and sequestering C.",

We have compared the characteristics of solar proton events during cycles 21 – 24, including peak-intensity, fluence, spectral and compositional signatures. As of July 2014, a total of 72 cycle-24 events have met the NOAA criterion >10 protons/cm2-sr-s for >10 MeV proton intensities at either GOES, STEREO-A, or STEREO-B, including 33 at GOES. Most were observed at multiple longitudes. Compared to the first 5.7 years of cycles 22 and 23 the number of near-Earth GOES-class SEP events in cycle 24 is reduced by ~40%, and the total fluence of >10 MeV protons is a factor of ~4 lower. At >100 MeV the cycle 23 fluence is lower by a factor of >7. The two STEREOs make it possible to test whether Earth was simply in an anomalous location. There are also significant compositional differences between cycles 23 and 24 in abundance ratios such as Fe/O and Fe/H. We discuss factors that may have affected the intensity, spectra, and composition of SEPs during cycle 23, including the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind properties, CME and shock properties, and seed particle abundances.",

Their successors for the GRACE-FO mission are under manufacturing and will fly in 2017. Finally, the GOCE mission has proved the interest of gradiometer for a direct measurement of the gravity field.\nNow, ONERA proposes a new design of accelerometer, MicroSTAR, for interplanetary mission. It inherits of the same technology but with reduced mass and consumption. It has been proposed in several missions towards outer planets in order to test the deviation to the relativity general over large distance to the sun (with the addition of a bias rejection system). But the same instrument could be interesting to improve our knowledge of the planetary gravitational potential field, allowing a better understanding of the planet interior composition. The success of using accelerometer for geodesy mission could be imported in the planetary science.\nThe paper will present the accuracy achievable on the gravity potential field according to different accelerometer configurations (one accelerometer, one gradiometer arm or a complete 3-axis gradiometer). Then, the instrument will be described and the integration of the instrument inside an interplanetary probe will be evoked.",

For example, estimates of carbon stocks and stock change in FIA are reported as the official United States submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. While the main effort in FIA has been focused on aboveground biomass, soil is a critical component of this system. FIA sampled forest soils in the early 2000s and has remeasurement now underway. However, soil sampling is repeated on a 10-year interval (or longer), and it is uncertain what magnitude of changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) may be detectable with the current sampling protocol. We aim to identify the sensitivity and variability of SOC in the FIA database, and to determine the amount of SOC change that can be detected with the current sampling scheme. For this analysis, we attempt to answer the following questions:\n1) What is the sensitivity (power) of SOC data in the current FIA database?\n2) How does the minimum detectable change in forest SOC respond to changes in sampling intervals and/or sample point density?\nSoil samples in the FIA database represent 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth increments with a 10-year sampling interval. We are investigating the variability of SOC and its change over time for composite soil data in each FIA region (Pacific Northwest, Interior West, Northern, and Southern). To guide future sampling efforts, we are employing statistical power analysis to examine the minimum detectable change in SOC storage. We are also investigating the sensitivity of SOC storage changes under various scenarios of sample size and/or sample frequency. This research will inform the design of future FIA soil sampling schemes and improve the information available to international policy makers, university and industry partners, and the public.",

An extended network of ground-based instruments, balloon-borne profilers, and remote sensing instruments supported the in-situ airborne measurements made by the NASA aircraft in capturing the structure and evolution of the daytime BL.\nThe Millersville University Atmospheric Research and Aerostat Facility (MARAF) is one of many assets deployed for DISCOVER-AQ. Central to MARAF is a heavy-lift-capacity tethered balloon (aerostat) used to obtain high resolution profiles of meteorological variables, trace gases, and particulates in the BL. The benefit of including a tethered balloon is that it can fill a data void between the surface and the lowest altitudes flown by the aircraft and provide critical time-height series for ground-based remote sensing instruments in the layer below their first range gate. MARAF also includes an acoustic sodar with RASS, MPL4 micropulse Lidar, 4-meter flux tower, rawinsonde system, and a suite of trace gas analyzers (O3, NOx/NO2/NO, CO, and SO2), 3-wavelength nephelometer, and particle sizers/counters spanning the range from 10 nm to 10 microns. MARAF is capable of providing a detailed and nearly continuous Eulerian characterization of the surface layer and lower BL, and with proper FAA airspace authorization, can be deployed both day and night.\nThree case studies will be presented that incorporate the MARAF into the combined assets of DISCOVER-AQ to better characterize: 1) bay breeze convergence, recirculation, and ramp-up events in Edgewood, MD in July 2011; 2) aerosol transport over Central Valley, CA in January 2013; and 3) multiple sea-bay breeze interactions with a 200-plus ppbv O3 plume downwind of Houston, TX. These observations show a complex BL response to transformational air mass interactions not often captured by other instrument platforms or resolved by operational numerical models. In addition, this paper will report on the benefits of using MARAF for research training.",

In this study, total cloud cover trends provided by different global databases have been compared among them for the Mediterranean region, and for the period 1984-2005. Specifically, databases from surface observations, several satellite projects (ISCCP, CLARA, PATMOS-x) and reanalysis products (ERA-Interim, MERRA, NCEP-DOE) have been chosen. Simulations from 44 climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) corresponding to the historical scenario have been compared against the observations. All databases were interpolated to a 2° × 2.5° resolution grid before performing comparisons and statistical analyses. Overall, there is a relatively good agreement between the time evolution of total cloud cover provided by most of the satellite and reanalysis products, as well as from surface observations, with a mean decrease of around 1% per decade over the period 1984-2005. In addition, the historical climate model simulations also indicate a decrease of cloud cover, although with a lower magnitude as compared with observations.",

            "abstract": "Disposal of excessive runoff or treated sewage into wadis and ephemeral streams is a common practice and an important hydrological problem in many Middle Eastern countries. While chemical and biological properties of the injected treated wastewater may be different from those of the receiving aquifer, the density contrast between the two fluids can be small. Therefore, studies of the fluid interface for variable density fluids or water intrusion are not directly relevant in many Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) problems. Other factors, such as the transient nature of injection and lack of detailed aquifer information must be considered. The disposed water reaching the water table through the vadose zone creates groundwater mounds, deforms the original water table, and develops finite-size convex-concave lenses of treated water over receiving water. After cessation of infiltration, these mounds flatten, water levels become horizontal, and infiltrated water becomes fully embedded in the receiving aquifer. The shape of the treated water body is controlled by the aquifer parameters, the magnitude of ambient flow, and the duration, rate, and cyclicity of infiltration. In case of limited aquifer data, advective transport modeling offers the most appropriate tools for predicting plume shapes over time, but surprisingly little work has been done on this important 3D flow problem. We investigate the lateral and vertical spreading of infiltrated water combining techniques of spatial velocity analyses by Zlotnik and Ledder (1992, 1993) with particle tracking. This approach allows for evaluating the geometry of the plume and the protection zone, the flow development phases, and other temporal and spatial effects and results can be used in conditions of limited data availability and quality.

            "abstract": "The reservoir’s outflow is controlled by reservoir operators, which is different from the upstream inflow. The outflow is more important than the reservoir's inflow for the downstream water users. In order to simulate the complicated reservoir operation and extract the outflow decision making patterns for California’s 12 major reservoirs, we build a data-driven, computer-based (“artificial intelligent”) reservoir decision making tool, using decision regression and classification tree approach. This is a well-developed statistical and graphical modeling methodology in the field of data mining. A shuffled cross validation approach is also employed to extract the outflow decision making patterns and rules based on the selected decision variables (inflow amount, precipitation, timing, water type year etc.). To show the accuracy of the model, a verification study is carried out comparing the model-generated outflow decisions (“artificial intelligent” decisions) with that made by reservoir operators (human decisions).\nThe simulation results show that the machine-generated outflow decisions are very similar to the real reservoir operators’ decisions. This conclusion is based on statistical evaluations using the Nash-Sutcliffe test. The proposed model is able to detect the most influential variables and their weights when the reservoir operators make an outflow decision. While the proposed approach was firstly applied and tested on California’s 12 major reservoirs, the method is universally adaptable to other reservoir systems.",

            "abstract": "The NE margin of the Tibetan Plateau, as a particularly important area to understand the mechanism of plateau formation, is characterized by large transpressional arcuate faults. There is debate on the amount of Quaternary sinistral displacement on the major Haiyuan Fault. Previously unrecognized systemic asymmetrical valleys have developed between the Haiyuan and Xiangshan faults. Southeast tilting and sinistral displacement on the NE side of the Haiyuan Fault resulted in SE migration of large rivers and asymmetrical widening of their valleys, leaving a systematic distribution of tilted strath terraces along the their NW sides. Where asymmetrical widening created by tilting kept pace with sinistral displacement, rivers have not been deflected, and the increase in valley width downstream from the fault should equate to total lateral displacement since river formation (e.g. Yuan River, a 7 km asymmetrical valley with a c. 2.2Ma paleomagnetic age). Where river deflection and asymmetrical valley growth are coeval, valley width is less than total horizontal displacement (e.g. Hebao River, a c. 2.1km asymmetrical valley with c. 2km deflection). All rivers north of the Haiyuan Fault converge to cut across the Xiangshan Mountains as a gorge. Northeast thrusting of the upthrown side of the Xiangshan Fault has resulted in degradation and related strath terrace formation as the valleys asymmetrically widened. A probable earthquake-induced landslide caused by movement on the Xiangshan Fault in latest Pleistocene blocked the gorge causing aggradation along all rivers and their tributaries. Deposition terraces were formed after the landslide dam was breached. Together with previous research on the Xiangshan Fault, it is concluded that there has been c.7km of Quaternary sinistral displacement on the Haiyuan and Xiangshan faults along the NE margin of the Tibetan Plateau since the formation of rivers that intersect them.",

The controls on N2O production from these guilds are generally known and include species interactions and a range of environmental factors (e.g., oxygen concentrations, organic matter stoichiometry, substrate availability, mineralization rates). Here we attempt to parse out the conditions controlling N2O production using a trait-based microbial model that predicts N2O production by representing the physiology and ecology of nitrifiers and denitrifiers, and the N2O consumption pathways of heterotrophic bacteria. Following successful application of the standalone microbial model to predict nitrification and denitrification rates and associated N2O fluxes, we ran the model with output from the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) to examine N2O production across spatial and temporal scales, during rainfall events and under global change scenarios (e.g., increased temperature and nitrogen deposition). We discuss our output with respect to what is understood about the complexity of belowground ecosystems and how our approach can help constrain the global N2O budget.",

            "abstract": "To mitigate climate change, governments at multiple levels are developing policies to decrease anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The City of Portland (Oregon) and Multnomah County have adopted a Climate Action Plan with a stated goal of reducing emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The transportation sector alone accounts for about 40% of total emissions in the Portland metropolitan area. Here we show a new street-level model of on-road mobile CO2 emissions for the Portland, OR metropolitan region. The model uses hourly traffic counter recordings made by the Portland Bureau of Transportation at 9,352 sites over 21 years (1986-2006), augmented with freeway loop detector data from the Portland Regional Transportation Archive Listing (PORTAL) transportation data archive. We constructed a land use regression model to fill in traffic network gaps with traffic counts as the dependent variable using GIS data such as road class (32 categories) and population density. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model was used to estimate transportation CO2 emissions. The street-level emissions can be aggregated and gridded and used as input to atmospheric transport models for comparison with atmospheric measurements. This model also provides an independent assessment of top-down inventories that determine emissions from fuel sales, while being an important component of our ongoing effort to assess the effectiveness of emission mitigation strategies at the urban scale.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus is an essential element in terrestrial organisms and thus characterizing the occurrences of phosphate phases at the martian surface is crucial in the assessment of habitability. The Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometers onboard Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity discovered a variety of primary and secondary phosphate phases allowing direct comparisons across the three landing sites. The Spirit rover at Gusev Crater encountered the “Wishstone/Watchtower” class of P-rich (up to 5.2 wt% P2O5) rocks interpreted to be alkaline volcanic rocks with a physical admixture of ~10 to 20% merrillite [Usui et al 2008]. These rocks are characterized by elevated Ti and Y and anomalously low Cr and Ni, which could largely reflect the nature of the protoliths: Evolved magmatic rocks. Many of these chemical signatures are also found in pyroclastic deposits at nearby “Home Plate” and in phosphate precipitates derived from fluid interactions with these rocks (“Paso Robles” soils). The Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum recently analyzed a ~4 cm clast in a fine-grained matrix, one of numerous rocks of similar appearance at the rim of Endeavour Crater. This clast, “Sarcobatus,” has minor enrichments in Ca and P relative to the matrix, and like the P-rich rocks at Gusev, Sarcobatus also shows elevated Al and Ti. On the same segment of the Endeavour rim, subsurface samples were found with exceptional levels of Mn (~3.5 wt% MnO). These secondary and likely aqueous deposits contain strong evidence for associated Mg-sulfate and Ca-phosphate phases. Finally, the Curiosity traverse at Gale crater encountered P-rich rocks compositionally comparable to Wishstone at Gusev, including elevated Y. Phosphorous-rich rocks with similar chemical characteristics are prevalent on Mars, and the trace and minor element signatures provide constraints on whether these are primary deposits, secondary products of physical weathering, or secondary products of chemical weathering.",

In Disko Bay, West Greenland, changes in the flow regime and calving behavior of Jakobshavn (Ilulissat) Isbræ have altered the size and distribution patterns of icebergs, though how these changes manifest beyond the fjord sill where they impact coastal navigation has not yet been quantified. Satellite coverage of this area is relatively frequent, but manual analysis of iceberg coverage in each image is prohibitively time consuming. We are developing an algorithm to automatically delineate icebergs in optical imagery and provide detailed information about their size and location.

            "abstract": "40 beach water and sediment samples were collected from the inter-tidal zones of tourist beaches of Huatulco in the State of Oaxaca, South Western part of Mexico. The samples were collected in an aim to know the concentration pattern of metals (Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, Co, Mn, Fe, As, Hg) in sediments and microplastics. Physico-chemical parameters like temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total dissolved solids, salinity and redox potential. Collection of samples was done during the peak season in April 2013. Our results from water samples indicate that the physico-chemical conditions of the beach water have been altered due to human activities in large numbers. The bioavailable metal concentrations indicate that enrichment of Pb, Cd, Cr and As and it is also supported by the higher values observed from the calculation of enrichment factor and geoaccumulation index. The higher values in the sediments is either due to natural sources like chemical weathering of rocks and external sources, which points to high tourism, agricultural activities in the region. Identification of micro-plastics was done through SEM photographs, indicating the type of plastic wastes deposited into the beach regions which can indicate the density, durability and the persistence level in the sediments. Eventhough the enrichment of metals and modification of beach water quality is observed, care need to be taken to avoid further damage to the coastal ecosystem.\nKeywords: Tourism, Beach sediments, Beach water, Micro plastics, Trace metals, Contamination indices, Huatulco, Mexico.",

            "abstract": "The Southeast United States (SEUS) is unique in its atmospheric chemistry and the difficulty of models in reproducing observed ozone (O3) (Fiore et al, 2009). Unlike the Western U.S., O3 variability is more heavily influenced by anthropogenic impacts than background sources such as wildfires, foreign transport, and stratospheric intrusions (Zhang et al, 2011). In addition, the SEUS has biogenic VOC emissions, important O3 precursors, which are among the highest in the world. We use observations from the SEAC4RS campaign over the SEUS in summer 2013, interpreted with the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, to evaluate the factors controlling O3 in this region. We use the GEOS-Chem model version v9-02 with significant updates, including improved treatment of isoprene nitrates (Lee et al, 2014), revised yields of MVK and MACR (Liu et al, 2013), improved treatment of isoprene epoxides (Bates et al, 2014), and faster deposition of isoprene oxidation products. The model significantly over predicts the observed O3, particularly in isoprene-rich, low-NOx regions. Properly capturing the fate of the isoprene peroxy radical (RO2) is essential to modeling O3 during the campaign. The amount of NOx in the SEUS is mainly driven by anthropogenic emissions with a smaller contribution from lightning and soil NOx, in addition to the amount of NOx recycled by isoprene nitrates. The variability in the amount of HOx available in the model can be influenced by the recycling of OH assumed in the GEOS-Chem chemical mechanism. We use the ratio of measured isoprene hydroxyperoxide (ISOPOOH) to isoprene nitrates (ISOPN) to constrain the modeled branching between the RO2 + HO2 and RO2 + NO2 pathways. Based on this ratio, we find that the RO2 + HO2 pathway is underestimated in our current chemical mechanism. Moreover, our NOx emissions may be overestimated by comparison with satellite tropospheric NO2 columns. We increase the importance of the RO2 + HO2 pathway with the inclusion of HONO chemistry inferred from Li et al, 2014 and explore improvements to our NOx emissions inventories. Our improved treatement of the processes controlling O3 production in this region, together with our constraints on the fate of isoprene RO2, significantly reduces the high surface bias in modeled ozone against aircraft, sonde, and surface observations.",

            "abstract": "Recent field study reviews on the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) found significant underestimation from fossil fuel industry and husbandry. The 2014 COMEX campaign seeks to develop methods to derive CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) from remote sensing data by combining hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and non-imaging spectroscopy (NIS) with in situ airborne and surface data. COMEX leverages synergies between high spatial resolution HSI column abundance maps and moderate spectral/spatial resolution NIS.\nAirborne husbandry data were collected for the Chino dairy complex (East Los Angeles Basin) by NIS–MAMAP, HSI–Mako thermal-infrared (TIR); AVIRIS NG shortwave IR (SWIR), with in situ surface mobile–AMOG Surveyor (AutoMObile greenhouse Gas)–and airborne in situ from a Twin Otter and the AlphaJet.\nAMOG Surveyor uses in situ Integrated Cavity Off Axis Spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) to measure CH4, CO2, H2O, H2S and NH3 at 5-10 Hz, 2D winds, and thermal anomaly in an adapted commuter car. OA-ICOS provides high precision and accuracy with excellent stability.\nNH3 and CH4 emissions were correlated at dairy size-scales but not sub-dairy scales in surface and Mako data, showing fine-scale structure and large variations between the numerous dairies in the complex (herd ~200,000-250,000) embedded in an urban setting. Emissions hotspots were consistent between surface and airborne surveys. In June, surface and MAMAP data showed a weak overall plume, while surface and Mako data showed a stronger plume in late (hotter) July. Multiple surface plume transects using NH3 fingerprinting showed East and then NE advection out of the LA Basin consistent with airborne data. Long-term trends were investigated in satellite data.\nThis study shows the value of synergistically combined NH3 and CH4 remote sensing data to the task of CH4 source attribution using airborne and space-based remote sensing (IASI for NH3) and top of atmosphere sensitivity calculations for Sentinel V and Carbon Sat (CH4).",

            "abstract": "In Saturn's magnetosphere, periodic fluctuations are observed in Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), auroral emissions, magnetic field, electron density, and energetic particle fluxes. We have extended previous Cassini investigations at Saturn by characterizing periodicities in additional plasma and magnetic field properties in Saturn's middle magnetosphere near the equatorial plane. It is customary to model perturbations in the middle magnetosphere as if they rotate rigidly, but we find that this assumption does not work well for all properties of interest and that the phase dependence of the perturbations may vary with radius and local time. We use a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation [Jia et al., 2012], which generates a rotating pattern of field aligned currents centered at 70° invariant latitude in Saturn's southern ionosphere that impose periodic variations on the entire magnetosphere, to understand how the changing size and shape affects the observed properties. In particular, we find that the dayside magnetopause roughly follows the 80 invariant latitude field lines as they move in and out. We identify three different modes of magnetospheric periodicity linked to rotation (spinning), compression (breathing), and north-south motion (flapping). All have the same ~10.7 hour period, but impose significant changes at phases that depend on the plasma property considered and the location of the measurement. Multiple modes acting concurrently can produce distinctly non-sinusoidal waveforms of the variations of plasma parameters through a rotation cycle. Within limitations of data coverage, we find good agreement between the simulation and the data in the rotation phase modulation of magnetic pressure, plasma pressure, and density perturbations.",

            "abstract": "Previous work identified a riparian meadow in the Rocky Mountains where streamside box elder (Acer negundo) trees did not use stream water, the most reliable and readily available source. A follow-up study showed that the water used by trees appears to be more evaporatively enriched than all available measured sources, including stream water, precipitation-derived soil water, and groundwater. While it is unlikely that there is a missing pool of water these trees are accessing, they may be tapping into a distinct subset of the bulk soil water available, possibly derived from much colder and older snowmelt. In this study, we investigated whether snowpack sublimation and subsequent melt water may impart an enriched isotopic signature that persists throughout the following growing season in less-mobile soil water pools. Profile samples of the snowpack, bulk melt water, and early season soil lysimeter water were collected throughout the winter and analyzed for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes. As snow began to melt in the spring, water samples for isotope analysis were taken from soil profiles, stream water, groundwater, and stems. Although sublimation likely occurred at the site, such processes did not impart an evaporative isotope enrichment on the snowpack throughout the season. Both snow pack and melt water remained closely tied to the local meteoric water line as they infiltrated soil. These findings suggest that snowpack sublimation processes preceding melt water infiltration are not the source of evaporative enrichment in tree water at our site.",

            "abstract": "Sediment particle motions on steepland hillslopes often are patchy, intermittent and rarefied. Such motions include particle skittering from rockfall, particle ravel, downslope dispersal of soil material due to tree throw and the activity of fossorial animals, soil slips, and transport by surface flows, particularly following fire. We may envision these as motions that start from the soil surface and then return to it after some finite time. Travel distances can be much larger than the soil thickness. Unless explicitly treated at the transport 'event' scale, the discontinuous qualities of these sediment motions in steeplands are at odds with continuum formulations of the sediment flux and the Exner equation of conservation as normally envisioned. The necessary averaging volumes and timescales are too large. Alternatively, the entrainment form of the Exner equation, when cast in probabilistic terms, provides a framework for describing the averaged effects of patchy, intermittent motions on the land surface. The formulation is mass conserving, \"nonlocal\" and scale independent, and it therefore does not require an averaging volume. However, there is a tradeoff. One must specify, based on theory or measurements, an ensemble distribution of particle travel distances that is to be considered a signature of the operative transport processes and extant hillslope conditions. Transport events (specifically, sediment travel distances) occurring over a specified interval of time represent \"samples\" drawn from this ensemble distribution. Predictions of changes in land-surface elevation are then statistically expected values, with associated uncertainty that depends on the frequency of transport. A growing set of field-based and high-resolution DEM measurements suggests that the nonlocal formulation is consistent with observed (one-dimensional) hillslope profiles in steeplands. We are extending the formulation to two-dimensional topography; initial results suggest a rich behavior that is unlike that predicted by local formulations of transport. Because of its general, scale-independent form, the basic formulation is virtually identical to the entrainment form of the Exner equation used in describing bed load sediment transport.",

            "abstract": "Fast convective transport in the plasma sheet is more prevalent in the premidnight (dusk) sector relative to postmidnight. Ionospheric convection exhibits related asymmetries – more flux typically circulates in the dusk cell than in the dawn cell, and the nightside convection pattern is rotated clockwise when viewed over the North Pole. We show, using global simulations of the solar wind–magnetosphere–ionosphere interaction, that the electrodynamic interaction between Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere produces asymmetries resembling observed distributions in plasmasheet flows and ionospheric convection (Figure, center panel). The primary causal agent in the simulations is a meridional gradient in ionospheric Hall conductance which, through Cowling polarization, regulates the distributions of i) electrical currents flowing within and between the ionosphere and magnetotail and ii) the nightside reconnection rate and resulting dawn-dusk distribution of plasma sheet fast flows. The asymmetry disappears in the simulation when the Hall conductance is taken to be uniform (left panel), and it reverses when the conductance is artificially depleted at auroral latitudes (right panel). The coupling between meridional currents and electric fields in the ionosphere and axial currents and electric fields in the plasmasheet is demonstrated by a simple model for non-ideal coupling of field-aligned currents flowing between the plasma sheet and the region of enhanced ionospheric conductance straddling the nightside convection throat.",

Miyamoto Crater is a 160-km impact crater to the southwest of the MER Opportunity rover landing site and marks the furthest southwestward extent of the Meridiani Planum materials, which bury approximately half of the crater. Existing high resolution geologic maps within our study region are available only for specific landing site locations, while lower resolution maps provide a more basic context for larger scale Meridiani Planum or Margaritifer Terra processes. We utilize CRISM high resolution FRT sequences (20m/pixel) and MSP strips (200m/pixel) of the D2300 and BD2100 parameters in order to help distinguish map units. We are producing a regional cross section, which ties candidate landing sites (west rim deposits, east Margaritifer chloride, and Opportunity Rover site) to a common geologic timeline. We determine map unit stratigraphy (relative ages) from superposition and cross cutting relationships we find in our 3D mosaic. We are building this regional mosaic from CTX and HiRISE imagery we overlay on HRSC DTM sequences. We discuss periods of aqueous alteration, deposition, and erosion throughout the mapped region to explain the mineralogic stratigraphy and geomorphology.",

            "abstract": "Simulations which integrate both climate physics and the processes by which climate variations are imprinted in and sampled from paleoclimate archives may facilitate differentiation of the climate signal from random and systematic sources of uncertainty. We simulate the former using a newly developed efficient water-isotope-enabled atmospheric GCM, SPEEDY-IER (Molteni, 2003, Dee et al., submitted), and the latter using a toolbox of proxy system models (PSMs, Evans et al., 2013), synthesized, organized and coded within a self-consistent framework (Dee et al., in prep). SPEEDY-IER is forced with SSTs from the Last Millennium PMIP3 integration of the CCSM4 model (Landrum et al., 2012); relevant climate and isotope variables are extracted from the GCM simulation and used to drive PSMs. Through comparing simulated climate fields to simulated observations, we evaluate the extent to which linear and univariate calibrations on local temperature are valid, given bias in the simulated SST, moisture divergence, and associated isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation. Taking this a step further, PSMs that incorporate the physical, biological, structural, and time-uncertain aspects of each proxy system help to explicitly quantify the errors accompanying the assumption of linear univariate response of proxy systems to climate forcing.\nWe demonstrate the utility of the PSM toolbox with an integrative multi-PSM simulation spanning a realistic pan-tropical pacific proxy network of tree-ring cellulose, speleothem, and ice core oxygen isotopic composition (δ18O). The multi-PSM simulation is used as a testing ground to assess the robustness of frequently invoked teleconnections relating tropical SSTs to terrestrial hydroclimate proxies. By exploring modeled connections between ocean climate and the proxies (both by individual proxy class and for the entire network), we identify which tropical SST signals can be captured by the proxy network, track the individual contribution of sensor, archive, and observational proxy system sub-models to the distortion of the original climate signal, and leverage the PSM framework to investigate why some signals may be filtered out of the final observations.",

            "abstract": "In a mixed-grass prairie near Cheyenne, WY, we conducted a 7-year climate change experiment with factorial manipulations of air temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide (dubbed the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment experiment; PHACE). Carbon dioxide treatments were ambient (~390 ppm) and elevated (~600 ppm), implemented with Free-Air CO2Enrichment (FACE) technology. Temperature treatments were ambient and warmed (+1.5°C during the day and +3°C at night), maintained by a Temperature Free-Air Controlled Enhancement (T-FACE) system. Using the first three years of data, Morgan et al. (2009) reported that elevated CO2 stimulated plant production, regardless of the temperature treatment and especially in years when ambient soil moisture was low, likely due in part to the positive effect of CO2 on soil moisture that is mediated by plant physiological responses to elevated CO2 (e.g. reduced stomatal conductance). Here, we report the effects of elevated CO2, warming, and interannual weather variability (and their interactions) on plant productivity and soil moisture using the full 7-year dataset. Preliminary analyses show: 1) evidence of a persistent effect of both CO2 and warming on soil moisture (positive and negative, respectively) and indications that the effect of each treatment on soil moisture varied with soil depth and with time within the growing season, and 2) evidence that effects of both CO2 and warming on productivity are temporally dynamic, due to a combination of interannual weather variability, shifts in plant community composition, and diverse responses of different plant functional types and species to the treatments. Finally, to identify how plant physiological processes mediated the impact of CO2 and warming on plant productivity and soil moisture, we will briefly describe the response of plant traits to the treatments (e.g. leaf gas-exchange, leaf drought tolerance, depth of water uptake from soil). Collectively, our results suggest that decadal scale experiments (and longer) will be required to better understand the impacts of climate change in semi-arid grasslands and other ecosystems with inherently large interannual variability in weather, productivity, and community composition.",

Detailed analysis of this evolution entails tracing magnetic field lines, an operation which is not time-efficient on a single processor. By utilizing a graphics card (GPU) to trace lines in parallel, conducting such analysis is made feasible.

Project partners participating in this effort include the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Crow Wing Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD), Cass County, and other local partners. These watersheds are located in the Northern Lakes and Forest ecoregion of Minnesota and drain to the Upper Mississippi River. To support the Pine and Leech Lake River WRAPS, watershed-scale hydrologic and water-quality models were developed with Hydrological Simulation Program–FORTRAN (HSPF). The HSPF model applications simulate hydrology (discharge, stage), as well as a number of water quality constituents (sediment, temperature, organic and inorganic nitrogen, total ammonia, organic and inorganic phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand, and algae) continuously for the period 1995-2009 and provide predictions at points of interest within the watersheds, such as observation gages, management boundaries, compliance points, and impaired water body endpoints. The model applications were used to evaluate phosphorus loads to surface waters under resource management scenarios, which were based on water quality threats that were identified at stakeholder meetings. Simulations of land use changes including conversion of forests to agriculture, shoreline development, and full build-out of cities show a watershed-wide phosphorus increases of up to 80%. The retention of 1.1 inches of runoff from impervious surfaces was not enough to mitigate the projected phosphorus load increases. Changes in precipitation projected by climate change models led to a 20% increase in annual watershed phosphorus loads. The scenario results will inform the implementation strategies selected for the WRAPS.",

            "abstract": "Microphysical growth processes of diffusion, aggregation and riming are incorporated analytically in a steady-state snow growth model (SGM) to solve the zeroth- and second- moment conservation equations with respect to mass. The SGM is initiated by radar reflectivity (Zw), supersaturation, temperature, and a vertical profile of the liquid water content (LWC), and it uses a gamma size distribution (SD) to predict the vertical evolution of size spectra. Aggregation seems to play an important role in the evolution of snowfall rates and the snowfall rates produced by aggregation, diffusion and riming are considerably greater than those produced by diffusion and riming alone, demonstrating the strong interaction between aggregation and riming.\nThe impact of ice particle shape on particle growth rates and fall speeds is represented in the SGM in terms of ice particle mass-dimension (m-D) power laws (m = αDβ). These growth rates are qualitatively consistent with empirical growth rates, with slower (faster) growth rates predicted for higher (lower) β values. In most models, β is treated constant for a given ice particle habit, but it is well known that β is larger for the smaller crystals. Our recent work quantitatively calculates β and α for cirrus clouds as a function of D where the m-D expression is a second-order polynomial in log-log space. By adapting this method to the SGM, the ice particle growth rates and fall speeds are predicted more accurately. Moreover, the size spectra predicted by the SGM are in good agreement with those from aircraft measurements during Lagrangian spiral descents through frontal clouds, indicating the successful modeling of microphysical processes.\nSince the lowest Zw over complex topography is often significantly above cloud base, the precipitation is often underestimated by radar quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE). Our SGM is capable of being initialized with Zw at the lowest reliable radar echo and consequently improves QPE at ground level.",

It is characterised by a continental climate and located in a rainshadow setting. Pine-dominated forests dominate. The region is prone to frequent fires and mountain pine beetle outbreaks. Several surface sediment cores and an overlapping Livingstone sediment core were collected from centrally-located Scum Lake and analysed for pollen, charcoal and insect remains. During the early-Holocene warm-dry interval, a non-arboreal vegetation community dominated by grass and sage dominated and surface fire disturbance was frequent. Model predictions suggest that non-arboreal vegetation may expand in this region in the future, suggesting that the fire regime will likewise change as in the early-Holocene. In the mid-Holocene, pine, possibly Pinus ponderosa, increased in abundance, suggesting that a surface fire regime persisted at that time. Pinus contorta pollen increased in the late-Holocene, representing the establishment of the modern forest and mixed/crown fire regime. Fire return intervals typically ranged between 20-100 years, consistent with tree-ring based observation (40-70 years). Analyses of the surface cores revealed that identifiable mountain pine beetle remains were rare, suggesting that alternative approaches may be required to assess to insect disturbance through time.",

            "abstract": "Heavy rainfall during 9 – 13 September 2013 induced about 1100 debris flows in the foothills and mountains of the northern Colorado Front Range. Eye-witness accounts and fire-department records put the times of greatest landslide activity during the times of heaviest rainfall on September 12 – 13. Antecedent soil moisture was relatively low, particularly at elevations below 2250 m where many of the debris flows occurred, based on 45 - 125 mm of summer precipitation and absence of rainfall for about 2 weeks before the storm.\nMapping from post-event imagery and field observations indicated that most debris flows initiated as small, shallow landslides. These landslides typically formed in colluvium that consisted of angular clasts in a sandy or silty matrix, depending on the nature of the parent bedrock. Weathered bedrock was partially exposed in the basal surfaces of many of the shallow source areas at depths ranging from 0.2 to 5 m, and source areas commonly occupied less than 500 m2. Although 49% of the source areas occurred in swales and 3 % in channels, where convergent flow might have contributed to pore-pressure build up during the rainfall, 48% of the source areas occurred on open slopes. Upslope contributing areas of most landslides (58%) were small (< 1000 m2) and 78% of the slides occurred on south-facing slopes (90°≤ aspect ≤270°).\nThese observations pose challenges for modeling initiation of the debris flows. Effects of variable soil depth and properties, vegetation, and rainfall must be examined to explain the dominance of debris flows on south-facing slopes. Accounting for the small sizes and mixed swale and open-slope settings of source areas demands new approaches for resolving soil-depth and physical-properties variability. The low-moisture initial conditions require consideration of unsaturated zone effects. Ongoing fieldwork and computational modeling are aimed at addressing these challenges related to initiation of the September 2013 debris flows.",

We measured the cloud response to fire aerosols using aerosol data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and cloud fraction data from the morning and afternoon overpasses of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Considering the same cloud scene from the morning and afternoon satellite observations permitted us to observe the temporal relationship between clouds and aerosols. Level 2 data from thirty-five individual scenes during the fire season (December) between 2006 and 2010 were analyzed to quantify changes in MODIS cloud fraction from morning (10:30am local time) to afternoon (1:30pm local time) in the presence of different morning aerosol burdens (from MISR). We controlled for the local meteorology by analyzing thirty-five scenes from November, when fire activity and aerosol optical depth were low, but cloud fraction and meteorological conditions were similar to the fire-season. High fire-driven aerosol optical depth (AOD) was associated with reduced cloud fraction in both the raw and meteorologically-normalized data. Fire aerosols reduced the relative cloud fraction in all sky conditions, but the effects were progressively larger in high-AOD conditions. We also analyzed temporal changes in several meteorological variables from the ECMWF ERA-Interim dataset, in an effort to understand mechanisms for cloud decimation. Initial results suggest a direct negative impact of fire aerosols on atmospheric stability and convectivity. Our results provide observational evidence of the semi-direct cloud-aerosol effect in tropical regions, and suggest a positive feedback loop between anthropogenic burning and cloudiness.",

            "abstract": "Researchers from the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED) published “The Psychology of Climate Change Communication: A Guide for Scientists, Journalists, Educators, Political Aides, and the Interested Public” in 2009. This landmark guide provided climate change communicators a synthesis of the social science research that was pertinent to understanding how people think about climate change and how the practice could be improved.\nIn the fall of 2014 this guide will be rereleased, with a new title, and in a partnership between CRED and ecoAmerica. The updated guide addresses how and why Americans respond in certain ways to climate change and explains how communicators can apply best practices to their own work. The guide, which includes research from a range of social science fields including psychology, anthropology, communications, and behavioral economics, is designed to be useful for experienced and novice communicators alike. Included in the guide are strategies to boost engagement, common mistakes to avoid, and best practices that organizations around the world have used to meaningfully engage individuals and groups on climate change.\nThe proposed presentation will provide an overview of the main findings and tips from the 2014 climate change communication guide. It will provide a deeper look at a few of the key points that are crucial for increasing audience engagement with climate change including understanding how identity shapes climate change, how to lead with solutions, and how to bring the impacts of climate change close to home. It will highlight tips for motivating positive behavior change that will lead people down the path toward solutions. Finally, it will address the benefits and challenges associated with producing a communication guide and insight into synthesizing social science research findings into a usable format for a variety of audiences.",

In terms of detection, the active observations provide precise separation of cloudy from clear\nsky and precipitating from nonprecipitating clouds. In addition, they offer a unique quantification of\nprecipitation water path (Wp) in warm clouds. They also provide an independent quantification of Wc that is\nbased on an accurate surface reference technique, which is an independent arbiter between the two passive\napproaches. The results herein establish the potential for CloudSat and CALIPSO to provide an independent\nassessment of bias between the conventional passive remote sensing methods from reflected solar and\nemitted microwave radiation. After applying a common data filter to the observations to account for\nsampling biases, AMSR-E is biased high relative to MODIS in the global mean by 26.4gm\u00012. The RMS\ndifference in the regional patterns is 32.4gm\u00012, which highlights a large geographical dependence in the\nbias which is related to the tropical transitions from stratocumulus to cumulus cloud regimes. The\ncontributions of four potential sources for this bias are investigated by exploiting the active observations: (1)\nbias in MODIS related to solar zenith angle dependence accounts for \u00012.3gm\u00012, (2) bias in MODIS due to\nundersampling of cloud edges accounts for 4.2gm\u00012, (3) a wind speed and water vapor-dependent\n“clear-sky bias” in the AMSR-E retrieval accounts for 6.3gm\u00012, and (4) evidence suggests that much of the\nremaining 18gm\u00012 bias is related to the assumed partitioning of the observed emission signal between\ncloud and precipitation water in the AMSR-E retrieval. This is most evident through the correlations between\nthe regional mean patterns of Wp and the Wc bias within the latitudes of 30°N and 30°S, suggesting that\nthe assumption of a regionally invariant cloud/precipitation partitioning in the AMSR-E algorithm is the\nlikely causal factor.",

During the propagation phase, a free-gas/hydrate reaction front propagates toward the seafloor, elevating salinity and temperature to three-phase (gas, liquid, and hydrate) equilibrium. After the reaction front breaches the seafloor, the temperature gradient in the gas chimney dissipates to background values, and salinity increases to maintain three-phase equilibrium. Ultimately, a steady state is reached in which hydrate formation occurs just below the seabed at a rate necessary to replace salt loss. We show that at the Ursa vent in the Gulf of Mexico, the observed salinity and temperature gradients can be simulated as a steady-state system with an upward flow of water equal to 9.5 mm yr−1 and a gas flux no less than 1.3 kg m−2 yr−1. Many of the world's gas vents may record this steady-state behavior, which is characterized by elevated temperatures and high salinities near the seafloor.",

            "abstract": "Numerous global magnetospheric studies on electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves have revealed the typical wave properties observed throughout the Earth’s magnetosphere. The observed trends in the wave properties at various geocentric distances and local time sectors, although in general agreement, elude satisfactory explanation without further details on the ambient plasma properties, the low-energy (few to ~100 eV) ions in particular. Recent studies also described techniques to deduce the presence and properties of low-energy ions and the application of such a technique to THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) data has revealed the typical low-energy ion compositional properties throughout the Earth’s magnetosphere. Motivated by the recent work on EMIC waves and low-energy ion composition, we analyze typical wave cases observed at each local time sector by the THEMIS satellites and apply the composition techniques or the statistical low-energy ion composition data to constrain the low-energy components in modeling of each wave case in the context of linear hot plasma theory. We find that the observed waves are modeled well with hot plasma theory and both are fully consistent with the composition of the ambient plasma. Our results suggest that combined ion composition and wave measurements are critical for further assessment of the effects of the waves on energetic particles. In the cases we report on here, we find the waves could resonantly interact with electrons at energies in excess of 2 MeV and therefore do not have an effect on the dominant trapped electron population.",

            "abstract": "To understand how terrestrial ecosystems respond to global climate change, colleagues have globally measured the energy, water and carbon dioxide flux densities (F) over various vegetations by the eddy covariance (EC) method. However, the process of F calculation and the method of quality control and quality assurance (QCQA) are complex and site specific. Moreover, instantly maintaining remote EC flux measurement sites against instrumentation problems and administrative difficulties is laborious. To overcome these issues, particularly those of realtime F monitoring and prompt site management, FluxPro was created.\nFluxPro is consisted of three functional systems: 1) gathering system that transports EC measurements from various sites to the FluxPro management server; 2) cooking system that computes F and its frictional uncertainty (ε) together with micrometeorological variables (V); and 3) serving system that presents the above two results as charts to be distributed over the internet in realtime. Consequently, FluxPro could become an appropriate system in realtime-multi-site management, since it not only to automatically monitors F with ε and V but also continuously surveils EC sites, providing copious information and an email alert system.

Recent insights on the plant uptake of atmospheric COS suggest that plant uptake is the largest component of the global COS budget and that COS may provide a powerful new tool for partitioning sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2 at regional to global scales. However, alternative sources and sinks of COS must also be accounted for to minimize the uncertainty of this carbon cycle tracer approach. Here we focus on direct and indirect sources of atmospheric COS from anthropogenic activities. We construct bottom-up gridded inventories of anthropogenic COS sources and compare these to previous estimates that were based on relatively sparse emissions data. Furthermore, we simulate COS concentrations with an regional atmospheric chemistry model to show the influence of these alternative source estimates in relation to plant uptake at a range of surface and airborne monitoring sites.

The high level of complexity and spatial heterogeneity of such systems is challenging and requires knowledge of the typical geometry of karstic features.\nWe present an exhaustive characterization of Golgotha Cave, SW Western Australia, based on an extensive LIDAR measurement campaign. The cave is developed in Quaternary age aeolianite (dune limestone) and contains speleothem records. We collect 30 representative 3D scan images from this site using FARO Focus3D, a high-speed 3D laser scanner, to visualize, study and extract 2D and 3D information from various points of view and at different scales. In addition to LIDAR data, 32 automatic drip loggers are installed at this site to measure the distribution and volume of water flow.\nWe perform mathematical morphological analyses on the cave ceiling, to determine statistical information regarding the stalactites widths, lengths and spatial distribution. We determine a relationship between stalactites diameter and length. We perform tests for randomness to investigate the relationship between stalactite distribution and ceiling features such as fractures and apply this to identify different types of possible flow patterns such as fracture flow, solution pipe flow, primary matrix flow etc. We also relate stalactites density variation with topography of the cave ceiling which shows hydraulic gradient deviations. Finally we use Image Quilting, one of the recently developed multiple-point geostatistics methods, with the training images derived from LIDAR data to create a larger cave system to represent not only the caves that are visible, but the entire system which is inaccessible. As a result, an integral geological model is generated which may allow other scientists, geologist, to work on two different levels, integrating different speleothem datasets: (1) a basic level based on the accurate and metric support provided by the laser scanner; and (2) an advanced level using the image-based modelling.",

            "abstract": "Trends in atmospheric aerosol particle loading have gained increased attention in recent years due to their impact on Earth’s radiation budget and global climate change. Past studies have examined this topic through aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations derived from passive satellite sensors such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR). However, such passive sensors acquire only column-integrated measurements and thus can provide no insight into the vertical distribution of any AOD trends they might detect. Yet knowledge of aerosol vertical distribution and trends are critical for studies involving aerosol climate impacts and air quality. Using seven and a half years (June 2006 – December 2013) of aerosol profile data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), we investigate trends in CALIOP-derived AOD at various altitudes throughout the atmospheric column. This differs from existing CALIOP-based climatological studies that focus solely on the mean state of aerosol vertical distribution. Daytime and nighttime analyses are decoupled to account for differences in the vertical structure of the troposphere, and detection sensitivity of CALIOP, between the two regimes. The results of this study are presented globally and for selected regions. Of particular interest are North Africa and Asia, as these are areas with frequently high AOD and have also exhibited trends from passive sensor observations.",

IceBridge data reveal a ~1500 m deep, ~1000 km long bedrock trough under the main trunk of Recovery Ice Stream. We extend the lake activity time series to 2012 for the three lower lakes using IceBridge data: one lake underwent a large deflation between 2009 and 2011; another lake, which had been continuously filling between 2003 and 2010, started to drain after 2011. Hydrologic connections among the lakes appear to be direct and responsive. We reproduce the lake activity using a simple subglacial water model. The hydrologic system beneath Recovery Ice Stream is controlled by unusually pronounced bedrock topography (and not ice surface topography, as is the case for most Antarctic systems studied to date). We discuss potential causes of non-steady hydrologic behavior in major Antarctic catchments.",

            "abstract": "The San Joaquin Valley of California covers 4 million hectares of farmland and produces $25 billion of agricultural products annually, but its average annual rainfall ranges from only 130 mm in the south to 330 mm in the north and nearly all occur in the winter. On the east side of the valley, irrigation water is mostly derived from the Sierra snow melt. On the west side, water is imported from the northern part of the state through the Sacramento Delta and a network of canals and aqueducts. Ground water is also used for both east and west sides of the valley to supplement surface water sources, especially during droughts. After years of intense irrigation, a number of water supply and water quality issues have emerged. They include groundwater overdraft, land subsidence, water contamination by agricultural drainage laden with selenium, salinity buildup in soil and water, nutrients contamination from fertilizers and livestock production, competition for water with megalopolis and environmental use and restoration. All these problems are intensified by the effect of climate change that has already taken place and other geological hazards, such as earthquakes that can bring the water supply system to a complete halt. In addition to scientific and technical considerations, solutions for these complex issues necessarily involve management planning, public policy and actions. Currently, they include furloughing marginally productive lands, groundwater recharge and banking, water reuse and recycle, salinity and nutrient management, integrated regional water management planning, and public education and outreach. New laws have been enacted to better monitor groundwater elevations, and new bond measures to improve storage, infrastructures, and reliability, have been placed on the public ballot. The presentation will discuss these complex water issues.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 350 was the first in the rear part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana intra-oceanic arc. The morphology of the Izu rear arc is dominated by a series of ~16 – 3 Ma basaltic to rhyolitic seamount chains up to ~50 km long, which strike at a high angle to the arc front, and differ from arc front rocks by being more similar to averaged continental crust (i.e. enriched in alkalis, Ba, Th, U and LREE). Site U1437 lies at 2117 mbsl in a ~20 km-wide volcano-bounded basin between the Manji and Enpo rear arc seamount chains, ~90 km west of the arc front.\nSite U1437 was drilled to 1804 mbsf. The section is much more mud-rich than expected, with ~60% tuffaceous mud for the section as a whole, 89% in the uppermost 433 m, and high sedimentation rates of 100-260 m/my for the upper 1300 m. The proportion (40%) and grain size of tephra are much smaller than expected for an intra-arc basin, composed half of ash/tuff, and half of lapilli tuff of fine grain size. These were deposited by suspension settling through water and from density currents, in relatively distal settings. Volcanic blocks are only sparsely scattered through the lowermost 25% of the section (1320 to 1804 mbsf), which includes hyaloclastite, in situ quench-fragmented blocks, and a rhyolite peperite intrusion (i.e., proximal deposits). The lowest biostratigraphic datum is ~6.5 Ma at 867 mbsf; the lowest paleomagnetic datum ~9 Ma is at ~1300 mbsf; nannofossils at ~1400 mbsf indicate a range of 10.97–11.85 Ma; and rhyolite peperite at ~1390 mbsf has yielded a preliminary U-Pb zircon concordia intercept age of 13.6 +1.6/-1.7 Ma. Alteration resulted in destruction of fresh glass below ~750 mbsf, but minerals are less altered. Our preliminary interpretation is that arc front vs. rear arc sources can be distinguished in the upper (relatively distal) 1320 m, while the lower (proximal) 25% of the section may be heterogeneous, suggesting that the rear arc magmas only fully compositionally diverged after ca. 13 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Despite the broad interest in determining the topographic and climatic histories of mountain ranges, the evolution of California’s Sierra Nevada remains actively debated. Prior stable isotope-based studies of Sierra Nevada have relied exclusively on hydrogen isotopes in kaolinite, hydrated volcanic glass and leaf n-alkanes. Additional constraints from the oxygen isotope composition of phyllosilicates increase the robustness of findings from a single isotope system and allow for the reconstruction of paleotemperatures. Here, we reconstruct the temperature and elevation of the Early Eocene Sierra Nevada using the oxygen isotope composition of kaolinitized granite clasts from the ancestral Yuba and American Rivers. We evaluate the possible contributions of hydrogen isotope exchange by direct comparison with more robust oxygen isotope measurements. Next, we utilize differences in the hydrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation in kaolinite to constrain paleotemperature.\nOxygen isotope geochemistry of in-situ kaolinites indicates upstream (eastward) depletion of 18O in the northern Sierra Nevada. δ18O values ranging from 11.4 – 14.4 ‰ at the easternmost localities correspond to paleoelevations as high as 2400 m when simulating the orographic precipitation of moisture from a Pacific source using Eocene boundary conditions. This finding is consistent with stable isotope studies of the northern Sierra, but oxygen isotope based paleoelevation estimates are systematically ~500 – 1000 m higher than those from hydrogen-based estimates from the same samples. Kaolinite geothermometry from 16 samples measured in duplicate or triplicate produce an average Early Eocene temperature of 24.2 ± 2.0 °C (1s). This kaolinite temperature reconstruction is in agreement with paleofloral and geochemical constraints and general circulation model simulations from Eocene California. Our results confirm prior hydrogen isotope-based paleoelevations and further substantiate the existence of a hot and high Eocene Sierra Nevada.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of repeat-pass satellite-based surface altimetry over much of Antarctica, approximately 130 new subglacial lakes have been discovered entirely from observations of surface uplift and subsidence; these are commonly referred to as “active lakes”. In contrast to the ~160 lakes detected by radar sounding (“RES” lakes), which are typically in mountains bedrock terrain near the ice divide and static with residence times spanning millenia, active lakes are typically located in fast flowing ice streams far from the divides, and have short residence times. To understand how water transfers through active lake systems we have developed a new model based on earlier theoretical work and informed by lake-volume estimates inferred from of ice surface displacements detected by satellite radar and laser altimetry. We find that although the overall pattern of filling and drainage is similar to that for ice dammed lakes in alpine regions via channels thermally eroded into the ice that then creeps shut as water pressure declines, Antarctic lake drainage is better simulated by invoking a channel mechanically eroded into the underlying sediment. The necessity of an erodable deformable substrate to explain lake drainage suggests that the distribution of active lakes is an indicator for the presence of sediment. Furthermore the process of lake drainage appears quite sensitive to the composion and strength of the underlying till. We explore these possibilities by testing the model on subglacial lakes in both East and West Antarctica, including Recovery Glacier and MacAyeal Ice stream.",

Prior studies have used observed surface deformation (InSAR, GPS, or lake rebound measurements) to constrain numerical models of lower crustal and mantle relaxation to infer depth-dependent viscosity structures. However, four separate studies have inferred four different viscosity structures, highlighting non-uniqueness and other issues that plague in situ rheology studies. Here we combine the postseismic and lake unloading processes into a single self-consistent study to reduce non-uniqueness issues and determine whether a single Newtonian viscosity structure can explain all of the observations. We use finite element models to show that all of the observational constraints can be explained by a Newtonian rheology beneath Western Nevada marked by a strong lower crust at a depth of 20-30 km with a viscosity of at least 5x1020 Pa s and a strong mantle lid at a depth of 30-40 km with a viscosity of at least 5x1019 Pa s overlying a relatively weak upper mantle of order 1018 Pa s. Our ability to fit both postseismic and lake unloading by a single Newtonian viscosity structure may be a result of the limited resolution of the data sets, none of which record expected transient behavior early in the unloading processes.",

Urbanization occurs alongside urban population growth, as cities expand to meet the demands of increasing population. Consequently, there is a need for remote sensing research to detect, monitor, and measure urbanization and its impacts on the biosphere. Here we used MODIS and Landsat data products to (1) detect urbanization-related land cover changes, (2) investigate urbanization-related impacts on land surface phenology (LSP) across rural to urban gradients and (3) explore fractional vegetation and impervious surface area regionally across the US Great Plains and within 14 cities in this region. We used the NLCD Percent Impervious Surface Area (%ISA) and Land Cover Type (LCT) products from 2001, 2006, and 2011 for 30m classification of the peri-urban environment. We investigated the impacts of urbanization-related land cover change on urban LSP at 30m resolution using the NDVI product from Web Enabled Landsat Data (\nhttp://weld.cr.usgs.gov\n) with accumulated growing degree-days calculated from first-order weather stations. We fitted convex quadratic LSP models to a decade (2003-2012) of observations to yield these phenometrics: modeled peak NDVI, time (thermal and calendar) to modeled peak, duration of season (DOS), and model fit. We compared our results to NDVI from MODIS NBAR (500m) and we explored the utility of 4 µm radiance (MODIS band 23) at 1 km resolution to characterize fractional vegetation dynamics in and around urbanized areas. Across all 14 cities we found increases in urbanized area (>25 %ISA) exceeding 10% from 2001-2011. Using LSP phenometrics, we were able to detect changes from cropland to suburban LCTs. In general we found negative relationships between DOS and distance from city center. We found a distinct seasonal cycle of MIR radiance over cropland LCTs due to the spectral contrast between bare soils and green vegetation. ",

Arches National Park is near an identified ‘hotspot’ of N pollution in the Southwest U.S. There is real concern regarding how the area’s drylands will respond to elevated deposition. Yet, our understanding of potential responses remains poor. Uncertainties persist regarding how these systems will hold and cycle additional N, and how N inputs will affect other aspects of biogeochemistry. We used a field fertilization experiment in Arches NP to explore three questions: 1) does added N stay within soil and for how long; 2) are N additions primarily utilized by native grass and the soil microbial community; and 3) is N leaving the system as gas (NOx, N2O) or in leached forms? Results indicate added N remained in the plots even 90 days after fertilization: soil NO3- concentrations were consistently elevated and were related to the amount of fertilization. Significant amounts of N left the system through leaching and as gas (N2O and NOx); in particular, NOx losses were greater in the plots receiving 8 kg N/ha/yr relative to the control plots, a pattern that matched soil NO3- concentrations. While treatment effects were significant, soil moisture was the strongest control over gas efflux rates, and we observed significant interactions between fertilization treatment and soil moisture at the time of sample collection. These data support the idea that N strongly interacts with rainfall patterns to regulate pulse-driven losses of excess N. There was no treatment effect in foliar N concentrations, but treatment effects on soil P concentrations and microbial biomass stoichiometry suggest that N addition has a broad influence on other biogeochemical dynamics. Data suggest that this arid, low N ecosystem passes a threshold of ecological change at low levels of N, although much of the additional N is relatively quickly lost from the system.",

            "abstract": "This study documents changes in the seasonality of tundra vegetation productivity and its associated climate variables using long-term data sets. An overall increase of Pan-Arctic tundra greenness potential corresponds to increased land surface temperatures and declining sea ice concentrations. While sea ice has continued to decline, summer land surface temperature and vegetation productivity increases have stalled during the last decade in parts of the Arctic. To understand the processes behind these features we investigate additional climate parameters.\nThis study employs remotely sensed weekly 25-km sea ice concentration, weekly surface temperature, and bi-weekly NDVI from 1982 to 2013. Maximum NDVI (MaxNDVI, Maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), Time Integrated NDVI (TI-NDVI), Summer Warmth Index (SWI, sum of degree months above freezing during May-August), ocean heat content (PIOMAS, model incorporating ocean data assimilation), and snow water equivalent (GlobSnow, assimilated snow data set) are explored. We analyzed the data for the full period (1982-2013) and for two sub-periods (1982-1998 and 1999-2013), which were chosen based on the declining Pan-Arctic SWI since 1998.\nMaxNDVI has increased from 1982-2013 over most of the Arctic but has declined from 1999 to 2013 over western Eurasia, northern Canada, and southwest Alaska. TI-NDVI has trends that are similar to those for MaxNDVI for the full period but displays widespread declines over the 1999-2013 period. Therefore, as the MaxNDVI has continued to increase overall for the Arctic, TI-NDVI has been declining since 1999. SWI has large relative increases over the 1982-2013 period in eastern Canada and Greenland and strong declines in western Eurasia and southern Canadian tundra. Weekly Pan-Arctic tundra land surface temperatures warmed throughout the summer during the 1982-1998 period but display midsummer declines from 1999-2013. Weekly snow water equivalent over Arctic tundra has declined over most seasons but shows slight increases in spring in North America and during fall over Eurasia. Later spring or earlier fall snow cover can both lead to reductions in TI-NDVI. The time-varying spatial patterns of NDVI trends can be largely explained using either snow cover or land surface temperature trends.",

            "abstract": "Western Alaska is a remote region populated by small communities situated in low-lying coastal environments that are sensitive to variations in local relative sea level (RSL). RSL is the measurement of sea level relative to the local ground surface. Quantification of RSL variation requires measuring vertical velocities for both tectonic motion (onshore component) and the ocean surface (offshore component). Tide gauges in conjunction with tidal benchmarks record RSL, but in Western Alaska these datums are of short duration and too sparsely distributed both temporally and spatially to be able to accurately project RSL trends. Satellite altimetry is not suited for near shore estimates, but is used in this study because of the limited tide gauge coverage both spatially and temporally.\nDuring the summers of 2013 and 2014, campaign GPS surveys of geodetic benchmarks were undertaken to produce statistically significant velocity measurements of the tectonic component of sea level change for the Seward Peninsula, Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, and Alaska Peninsula. Occupations of tidal benchmarks were also collected to compare historic tidal records from the mid-1900s to more recent data. Preliminary results from the GPS survey suggest regional subsidence of approximately 1-2 mm/yr of the Seward Peninsula, which supports one of the current glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models available for Western Alaska. The vertical velocity of the tectonic component and the satellite derived mean sea level trend will be coupled to produce a model of RSL change in Western Alaska that will be used to aid local communities in the development of adaptation strategies for changing coastal environments.",

            "abstract": "Studies now agree that the time- and range-dependence of globally averaged PKP precursor amplitudes in the 0.7 to 2.5 Hz frequency band can be explained by weak (0.1% r.m.s.) small-scale (~6 km) velocity heterogeneity distributed throughout the lowermost mantle. Individual recordings of PKP precursors, however, exhibit significant variability about the global average. We cull from our global dataset particular regions with dense source or station coverage to look for smooth changes in precursor amplitudes. We also perform slant stacks on longer-period (1 to 10 s) precursors recorded by continental-scale arrays to distinguish between source- and receiver-side scattering.\nTo address the question of larger-scale heterogeneity in the lithosphere and mantle, we compare long-period seismic records (17 to 150 s) with SPECFEM3D GLOBE synthetics. We find that the data exhibit more power between the main phases (e.g., P, PP, S), which may be explained by greater intermediate-scale (50 to 200 km) heterogeneity than accounted for by 3D global tomography models. In order to confidently model the amplitude stacks of the long-period records, we test the particle-based \"seismic phonon\" method against computationally intensive SPECFEM3D_GLOBE solutions. For an isotropic source at 20 km depth and a fractally heterogeneous earth (bandlimited from 50 to 3000 km), the two methods produce reasonably similar synthetics. This agreement strengthens our confidence in the phonon method at periods below 30s.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes exhibit both deterministic and nondeterministic behavior. Deterministic behavior is controlled by length and time scales such as the dimension of seismogenic zones and plate-motion speed. Nondeterministic behavior is controlled by the interaction of many elements, such as asperities, in the system. Some subduction zones have strong deterministic elements which allow forecasts of future seismicity. For example, the forecasts of the 2010 Mw=8.8 Maule, Chile, earthquake and the 2012 Mw=7.6, Costa Rica, earthquake are good examples in which useful forecasts were made within a solid scientific framework using GPS. However, even in these cases, because of the nondeterministic elements uncertainties are difficult to quantify. In some subduction zones, nondeterministic behavior dominates because of complex plate boundary structures and defies useful forecasts. The 2011 Mw=9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake may be an example in which the physical framework was reasonably well understood, but complex interactions of asperities and insufficient knowledge about the subduction-zone structures led to the unexpected tragic consequence. Despite these difficulties, broadband seismology, GPS, and rapid data processing-telemetry technology can contribute to effective hazard mitigation through scenario earthquake approach and real-time warning. A scale-independent relation between M0 (seismic moment) and the source duration, t, can be used for the design of average scenario earthquakes. However, outliers caused by the variation of stress drop, radiation efficiency, and aspect ratio of the rupture plane are often the most hazardous and need to be included in scenario earthquakes. The recent development in real-time technology would help seismologists to cope with, and prepare for, devastating tsunamis and earthquakes. Combining a better understanding of earthquake diversity and modern technology is the key to effective and comprehensive hazard mitigation practices.",

The array consisted of 20 broadband OBSs, and 5 temporary broadband seismographs deployed on nearby islands from February 2012 to February 2013. The OBS water depths were limited to 6 km or less, so they were deployed surrounding the trench and 5 hydrophones were deployed in the water column near the trench axis. Preliminary results indicate that seismicity in the incoming plate begins about 120 km west of the trench axis, with the highest seismicity levels found near the trench axis itself. Many of the incoming plate earthquakes locate near large fault scarps identified in seafloor bathymetry. In the forearc, Mariana shallow thrust seismicity begins where the plate interface is at 15-20km depth. There is a strong contrast in velocity structure across the trench, which causes difficulty in determining precise locations and depths. Further work will clarify the depths and focal mechanisms of the recorded earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between a mantle plume and a subducting plate depends on 1) the relative position of the plume relative to the subducting plate, and 2) the relative \"strength\" of the slab compared to that of the plume. To study such an interaction, we are using three-dimensional laboratory models of a compositional plume within the vicinity of an entirely dynamically driven but fixed slab. We introduced a dimensionless number to calibrate the relative \"strength\" of the slab compared to that of the plume that is the ratio of the buoyancy flux of the slab by that of the plume. Here we describe the style of the interaction for three positions of the plume relative to the fixed slab, and for a plume buoyancy flux that was fixed and chosen to be about 20 times lower than the slab’s flux. In nature, this would be equivalent to consider a subducting plate of relatively narrow width (1000 km) and moderate buoyancy flux (20000 kg/s. e.g. Manila slab) impacting on the geometry and dynamics of a mantle plume of modest buoyancy flux (1000 kg/s. e.g. Canary plume). Under these conditions, we show that 1) rising plumes can be dragged either away or towards a slab in rollback motion by the mantle return flow, 2) the plume motion can vary from slight deflection to rotation, and 3) significant flattening of the plume can occur. Yet, no extreme impact of subducting plates on plumes is to be observed. To this end, the slab/plume buoyancy flux ratio needs to vary. For instance, in the case of plumes initiated at the apex of the slab tip and at a larger slab/plume buoyancy flux ratio, a plume head can detach from its conduit. Conversely, for the same initial slab/plume geometry but at a smaller slab/plume buoyancy flux ratio, a front plume head can be dragged down into subduction. The question that remains to be answered is at which buoyancy flux ratios occur the transitions from head detachment to \"simply\" head sucked towards the trench to head plume being subducted. This is currently being studied in our laboratory.",

            "abstract": "Due to near-surface salinity stratification, it is problematic to compare satellite-measured surface salinity within the first few centimeters (skin-layer) of the ocean with Argo-measured top-level salinity at 5 m, or with ocean models that do not resolve the skin layer. Although an instrument can be designed to measure the surface salinity, a global scale measurement is currently not available. A regional model can be configured to have a vertical grid in centimeters, but it would be computationally prohibited on a global scale due to time step constraints. Here, we propose an extended surface salinity layer (ESSL) within a global ocean circulation model to diagnose skin SSS without increasing the computational cost, while allowing comparable solutions with both satellite and Argo salinity at the respective depths within the corresponding uncertainty limits. Cross-comparisons with Aquarius and Argo data show that the gridded Aquarius surface salinity has a much stronger seasonal variability than the gridded Argo top-level salinity at 5 m or 10 m, particularly in regions of high precipitation variability, suggesting strong near-surface vertical salinity stratification. The near-surface stratification is well reproduced by the proposed ESSL model. In comparisons with data-assimilated HYCOM results, the ESSL provides much stronger seasonal variability of SSS, similar to the Aquarius observations. The ESS also provides a useful reference for the global mean SSS to constrain the global calibration constants in Aquarius SSS retrieval.",

On this date, a dome formed on the small summit crater during the previous few days, collapsed generating block-and-ash flows. The event was preceded by almost twelve months of seismic activity, which continued afterwards for several more months. In a previous work (Zamora-Camacho et al., 2007; Pure Appl. Geophys. 164, 39–52) we analyzed the seismic activity occurred from 20 March, 1998 to 31 March, 1999. However the seismicity related to the activity did not dwindled down to pre-eruptive levels until January 2000. In this work we present the results of our analysis of the period March-December 1999, which completes the sequence of events related to the eruption. This analysis is of importance because constitutes the most complete study of the seismicity of an eruptive period of Colima volcano, in the sense that we determined most of the events recorded by the seismic net (RESCO) and located all of those that were amenable to location. The whole period of seismic activity consisted of more than 11,000 events of which 1156 belonging to the period March-December 1999 were located. Of this group 1082 have magnitude (Mc) between 1 and 3.5 and depths mostly in the 0-10 km range.",

            "abstract": "Energetic particle injections (EPIs) are the sudden enhancement of ~10s to ~100s of keV electrons and or ions in the near-Earth plasma sheet and inner magnetosphere. EPIs are known to be associated with substorm activity and reconnection in the magnetotail, though there are still many outstanding questions and competing theories concerning their exact nature (formation and evolution). Here, we focus on multipoint observations of EPIs at L < 10. We present several cases of individual or multiple EPI events observed by spacecraft from the THEMIS, Van Allen Probes, GOES, POES/MetOp, and LANL-GEO constellations. These cases have been chosen to showcase both the benefits of understanding EPIs as well as the challenges in interpreting multi-point observations of EPI events. EPIs are considered potentially important contributors to the seed populations of ring current particles and electrons in the outer radiation belt. Furthermore, due to the temperature anisotropy inherent in drifting bunches of enhanced fluxes of energetic ions and electrons, EPIs also potentially play an important role in electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) and whistler-mode chorus wave growth and activity. Thus, it is beneficial to the inner magnetospheric community to study EPIs and better define their role in dynamics of the ring current and outer radiation belt particle populations. However, interpreting multi-point observations of EPIs includes a variety of challenges, which we also outline and discuss here using example cases for supporting evidence. These challenges include: determining the location and width of the injection boundary in MLT and how this may change as a function of L-shell; timing analysis of EPIs observed by multiple spacecraft and drift echoes observed by the same spacecraft considering global field mapping of pitch-angle dependent drift shells; and considerations of energy- and/or pitch angle-dependent boundaries (e.g., Alfven layers, the plasmapause, and bifurcated drift shells).",

            "abstract": "Deep extratropical convection that overshoots the altitude of the tropopause is a process that has important implications both for chemistry-climate interactions through stratosphere-troposphere exchange and for hazardous weather at the Earth’s surface. Notably, convective injection of copious amounts of water vapor into the lower stratosphere has direct and significant impacts on the radiation budget and consequently, climate. In this study, the sensitivity of cross-tropopause transport and UTLS structure in extratropical convection to the choice of numerical model resolution in simulations of explicitly-resolved convection (i.e., no convective parameterization) is examined. For an observed case of overshooting convection, the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW-WRF) model is run for all possible combinations of three horizontal (3-km,1-km,333-m) and vertical (600-m,300-m,150-m) resolutions. Although the model is successful in simulating overshooting convection and cross-tropopause transport in each case, the depth and magnitude of troposphere-to-stratosphere transport is found to decrease with refinement in the vertical dimension and increase with refinement in the horizontal dimension. In addition, modifications to the altitude of the tropopause and the simulated depth of the convective storms show important sensitivities. Notably, the accuracy in the depth of the simulated storm is primarily dependent on vertical resolution. Recommendations for future modeling studies of extratropical convection and cross-tropopause transport will be given.",

Processes that are included are land ice mass changes and terrestrial storage changes with associated gravitational, rotational and deformational effects, steric/dynamic changes, atmospheric pressure loading and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). The study focuses on the mean linear trend of regional sea-level rise between 1961 and 2003. It is found that on a regional level the explained variance of the observed trend is 0.87 with a regression coefficient of 1.07. The observations and models overlap within the 1\u001bσ uncertainty range in all regions. The main processes explaining the variability in the observations appear to be the steric/dynamic component and the GIA.

            "abstract": "We have studied ion dynamics during a substorm by using a coupled fluid-kinetic approach. The UCLA global magnetospheric model was applied first and its results in a region encompassing a magnetotail reconnection site and earthward propagating dipolarization fronts was selected as input state for a full kinetic simulation based on the iPic3D code [1]. The coupling is one-way: the MHD result is used to create a full kinetic initial state by using the approach described by [2] and to force the boundary conditions. The kinetic results are not fed back into the MHD run. This approach previously has been shown [3] to provide correctly the large scale picture for a kinetic approach when the duration of the kinetic run is not so long as to alter significantly the macroscopic state captured by MHD.\nHere we focus especially on the ions. The electrons were described in [3]. Three aspects are analyzed. First, the ions are accelerated during the event and we track the localization of the energy exchanged, separating the contributions to the directed energy and those to the thermal energy. Second, we consider the ion motion to identify the regions where the finite Larmor radius effects violate the drift approximation and the frozen-in condition, thereby identifying the ion diffusion region. Our approach follows individual electrons and ions fully kinetically and no approximation is made in the particle orbit, so our code is equipped to study accurately the regions where the drift approximation is valid. Finally, we consider the ion distribution as a possible source of instabilities, focusing especially on temperature anisotropy instabilities and on the firehose instability.\nThe novelty of the approach is this kinetic study is done for a specific substorm by using the global state of the magnetosphere as provided by a global MHD simulation. This differs sharply from previous approaches based on analytical approximations such as the Harris or the (quasi)-parabolic equilibria.\n[1] S.Markidis, G. Lapenta, Rizwan-uddin, Math.

            "abstract": "Fault-zone trapped waves (FZTWs) are observed at a square seismic array consisting of 40 intermediate-period stations deployed adjacent to the Calico Fault (CF) in Mojave Desert, California for teleseismic earthquakes and used to characterize the deep structure of fault damage zone. In the previous study, traveltimes inverse, FZTWs generated by explosions and local earthquakes, and InSAR observations have been used to document the seismic velocity structure of the CF zone, within which velocities are reduced to ~40% in the center of a 1.5-km-wide compliant zone along the fault strike and extending to 5-6 km depth at the array site [Cochran, et al., 2009]. In order to better address the deep portion of the CF beyond the depth coverage of local earthquakes, we use FZTWs recorded at this array atop the CF for teleseismic earthquakes which have great promise for providing unprecedented constrains of the depth extension of fault-zone damage structure because the FZTWs arise from teleseismic waves incident at the fault bottom at deep level. We examined the data from 72 M≥6 teleseismic earthquakes recorded at the Calico array, and identified significant FZTWs with much larger amplitudes and longer wavetrains starting ~5-s after the first-arrivals at stations located within the compliant zone along the CF strike than those registered at farther stations for teleseismic earthquakes occurring at great depths with less surface wave affect. We interpret observed FZTWs being formed by S-waves converted from P waves at the Moho (~30-km depth) and entering the bottom of the CF. The FZTWs from teleseismic earthquakes show consistent longer wavetrains (~12-s) than those (3-8-s) recorded at same stations for local earthquakes at shallow depths, indicating that the CF low-velocity compliant zone likely extends throughout much of the seismogenic zone as a result of the portion of energy expended during rupture in historical earthquakes to drive cracking and yielding of rock and development of fault systems. We simulate observed FZTWs for teleseismic events as plane waves coming from the Moho and incident at the bottom of the CF in terms of a waveguide model combined with the fault damage structure at shallow depth obtained in the previous study to achieve a better constraint on the depth extension of the low-velocity damage zones along the CF.",

Applying citizen science to projects involving environmental issues such as water can also serve the greater community. However, the success of these projects in delivering on their promise of scientific outreach and community education, as well as robust scientific data, is not a given.

            "abstract": "Pool-riffle formation in low-sinuosity mountain streams is thought to occur through at least two different mechanisms: (1) a transient flow obstruction converges flow, drives pool development and results in an upstream and downstream riffle, (2) variations in channel or valley width set up converging and expanding zones of flow, which leads to pool and riffle development, respectively. These two mechanisms require a width gradient which is not always present, or obviously so along all pool-riffle channel reaches. We propose a third formative mechanism to account for nearly uniform channel width profiles which depends on a spatially discrete and strong change in the bed surface grain size distribution that is characterized as coarse and perhaps better sorted than prevailing conditions. We are testing each of these formative mechanisms plus a no forcing alternative with physical experimentation and numerical modeling. We will present initial observations and findings from our work, focused on addressing the following three questions: (a) does each formative mechanism result in pool-riffle pair development? (b) if a pool-riffle pair forms, are the associated perturbations to the flow and sediment transport fields sufficient for development of additional pool-riffle pairs? and (c) are resultant morphologies comparable in terms of geometries?",

The landslide, approximately 8.5x107 m3, is continuously deforming and poses great hazard to life and properties near the populated area. In order to investigate three-dimensional structures of the landslide and its internal fractures, scientists deployed a dense seismic array consisting of 19 broadband sensors and 5 electromagnetic profiles for two weeks. Seismic studies include thickness of the sediment from the H/V spectral ratio method and identification and relocation of micro-seismicity. During the seismic deployment, broadband seismic stations recorded 3 M>3 earthquakes and many small local events within 30 km of the array. Seismic data from these earthquakes are also used to constrain the sediment thickness of the landslide. The electromagnetic approaches involve high-density-resistivity method and transient electromagnetic (TEM) method. Results from both seismic and electromagnetic studies will be compared to and calibrated by borehole observations. Our preliminary results show a sediment thickness of 20~50 m and a low resistivity layer underneath the sediment, which may be related to water-bearing material. We also indentified and relocated some possible microseismic events. More details will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Recent mass losses from the grounded Antarctic Ice Sheet have been associated with changes in its floating ice shelves, but the duration and variability of these changes is so far undocumented. Using data from three overlapping satellite radar altimetry missions (ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat) we construct a record, at high spatial and temporal resolution, of ice-shelf height changes for the 18-year period 1994-2012. The record reveals a complex pattern of ice-shelf height change resulting from the varying impacts of the Antarctic oceans and atmosphere on the ice sheet. We show that Antarctica-wide average ice-shelf height increased moderately up until ~2003 and then declined rapidly after ~2006. The Amundsen Sea ice shelves have experienced persistent surface lowering since the beginning of the record, with mean values ranging from ~-10 cm/year (Pine Island) to ~-30 cm/year (Dotson). Lowering is more rapid at the deep grounding lines than at the shallower ice shelf fronts, consistent with thermal erosion driven by warm Circumpolar Deep Water flowing under the ice shelves. On the eastern Antarctic Peninsula, surface lowering starts at the northernmost portion and develops southwards, consistent with a response to the observed trend of atmospheric warming. Contrary to previous ICESat-based estimates from 2003-2009, the Wilkes Land ice shelves show a positive rate of height change with a regional mean value over +3 cm/year. Although relatively stable with average rates of +0.5-2 cm/year, the three largest ice shelves (Ross, Filchner-Ronne and Amery) show large interannual and spatial variability. Our 18-year-long dataset demonstrates that results from single satellite missions, with typical duration of a few years, are insufficient to draw conclusions about long-term response of ice shelves to changes in oceanic and atmospheric conditions.",

Although farmers are encouraged to avoid manure or fertilizer application before runoff events, the implications of these management choices remain largely unquantified. We conducted soil box experiments to test how manure application timing and temperature or moisture conditions impact SRP concentration in runoff. We found that SRP concentrations dropped off exponentially over time, and that higher temperatures accelerated the decline in SRP in overland runoff over time. During the first runoff events after manure application, infiltration depth prior to runoff was not a primary driver of SRP concentrations.

This research seeks to elucidate an understanding of autogenic and allogenic signatures on stratigraphy through morphodynamic modeling of aggradation and avulsions of the Brazos River in conjunction with climate and sea level changes throughout Holocene time. Backwater length scales are hypothesized to propel autogenic responses of the Brazos system by dictating the loci of aggradation, which back-step and fill the valley as sea level rises. The backwater length scale and sea level covary, thus inducing an intrinsic, but historically complex, relationship between autogenic and allogenic processes that is sought to be discerned using the morphodynamic model presented herein. We simulate Brazos fluvial evolution via changes in fluid flow, sediment transport, and bed topography under the influence of allogenic perturbations. The results are used to characterize and quantify the stratigraphic evolution of the Brazos incised valley fill and are readily comparable to numerous previous studies of the system. The infill model is informed by grain size data collected from modern deposits and by modern channel dimensions. This research attempts to link rising Holocene sea level with a backwater length scale which coincides with the extent of back-stepping aggradation within the Brazos incised valley. Modeling responses to perturbations of the Brazos fluvial system can be applied, more holistically, to predict future coastal dynamics and to inform interpretations of paleo-fluvial systems and hydrocarbon reservoirs.",

During the traverse route between coastal S16 point (69 02'S, 40 03'E, 580m a.s.l.) to inland Dome Fuji (77 22'S, 39 42'E, 3,810m a.s.l.), the snow stake observations every 2 km have been carried out from 1993. Yearly net snow accumulations from S16 to Dome Fuji were calculated. Heavy, modern and light snow events were observed. They were different in way accumulating spatial pattern depending on places. The yearly accumulation rates were compared with seasonal change of AAO-index (SAM). As a result, yearly accumulation rate and AAO-index showed the positive correlation.\nSurface snow samplings were conducted every 10km along the traverse route. Generally, the snow surface features are classified into three regions.\n(1) the coastal region: smooth surface, high snow accumulation\n(2) the katabatic slope region: rough sastrugi surface and smooth glazed surface\n(3) the high plateau region: smooth surface, little snow accumulation\nThe chemistry of surface snow changes from the coast to inland. Furthermore, the chemical properties of snow are different for each surface at the same area. We can classify the surface snow with fresh drifting snow, deposited drift snow, soft and hard surface snow, sustrugi, surface hoar and so on. The value of each isotope ration and ion concentration greatly varied. Sometimes, snow might deposit thick equally. But the deposited snow was redistributed by the wind. When the snowstorm occurred, the blowing snow started to deposit in a certain opportunity. As for it, the area was not the uniform. It is necessary to discuss inhomogeneity of the depositional condition quantitatively.",

            "abstract": "Reservoirs behind dams act as deposition sites for much of the bed-material load being transported by rivers. As a result, the water exiting dams is relatively free of sediment and the river flow is well below the transport capacity for bed-material. Because of this, rivers flowing downstream from dams tend to erode into their beds. This occurrence is well documented in gravel-bed rivers, but has not been as completely studied in sand-bed channels, such as the lower Trinity River, Texas. Sediment mining from the bed of a gravel river acts to coarsen the surface layer until the armoring shuts off any further bed erosion. This armoring control on the sediment discharge is not effective in a sand bed river. The abundant supply of sediment in a sand bed alluvial river results in a unique response: the river bed is scoured until sediment transport capacity is reached. In the lower Trinity River the consequences of this scouring and bed-sediment mining are channel bed lowering, channel wall steepening, and reduced rates of lateral migration, as well as bed-sediment coarsening and deflation in the total volume of sediment constituting bars. The process of bed incision produces a convex long profile for the river segment influenced by the dam. After 40 years of impoundment the channel immediately downstream of the dam has incised five to seven meters and dam-influenced adjustments to the geomorphology of the river are observed for 50 to 60 river kilometers downstream. The channel downstream of this zone appears unaffected by the dam. Over time the river bed continues to erode and the zone of dam influence expands downstream. In this paper we present a one-dimensional morphodynamic model that estimates the adjustment in channel profile elevation through time due to the dam’s retention of sediment. Model output matches the field measurements of physical changes to the river channel. Results of the model and physical observations explain the sediment transport dynamics associated with the lower Trinity River downstream of Livingston Dam.",

            "abstract": "With the advent of satellite-borne and ground-based radar and radiometers, it is now possible to observe ice cloud processes with unprecedented global coverage, simultaneously and at multiple frequencies. Unlike with liquid water, ice is nonspherical. Because of this asymmetry, in-cloud ice can sometimes have a preferred orientation. Instead of the particles orienting randomly, these particles may align roughly parallel to the horizon due to dynamical forcings. As such, this means that radar and radiometer observation angle relative to vertical / nadir must also be considered when recovering information from these instruments.\nTo gain a preliminary understanding of these effects, angle-dependent single scattering properties (i.e. scattering and backscatter cross-section) are first determined using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). Several particle morphologies are considered, including bullet rosette aggregates [Nowell, Liu and Honeyager 2013], dendritic snowflakes, sector snowflakes and bullet rosettes [Liu 2008]. Early profiles are constructed, showing the change in backscatter and scattering cross-sections as a function of radar observation angle and degree of alignment in the ensemble.\nTo make a more physical model, it is not assumed that all hydrometeors are either fully randomly oriented or fully aligned. It is expected that transition regions occur in clouds, with partial alignment. We use an ensemble von Mises-Fisher distribution to examine these alignment effects. Finally, the model is to be validated against dual-frequency radar retrievals (Ka and W-Band) using ARM scanning-mode radars. By examining clouds at multiple angles and multiple frequencies as they move over the radar site, it is possible to determine the hydrometeor canting distribution. Observations will be used to develop a model for where hydrometeor alignment effects are expected to occur, and to determine the impact hydrometeor alignment has on existing zenith and nadir-pointing radar.",

            "abstract": "Flood prediction in poorly monitored catchments is among the greatest challenges faced by hydrologists. To address this challenge, an increasing number of studies in the last decade have explored methods to integrate various existing observations from ground and satellites. One approach in particular, is the assimilation of satellite soil moisture (SM-DA) into rainfall-runoff models. The rationale is that satellite soil moisture (SSM) can be used to correct model soil water states, enabling more accurate prediction of catchment response to precipitation and thus better streamflow. However, there is still no consensus on the most effective SM-DA scheme and how this might depend on catchment scale, climate characteristics, runoff mechanisms, model and SSM products used, etc.\nIn this work, an operational SM-DA scheme was set up in the poorly monitored, large (>40,000 km2), semi-arid Warrego catchment situated in eastern Australia. We assimilated passive and active SSM products into the probability distributed model (PDM) using an ensemble Kalman filter. We explored factors influencing the SM-DA framework, including relatively new techniques to remove model-observation bias, estimate observation errors and represent model errors. Furthermore, we explored the advantages of accounting for the spatial distribution of forcing and channel routing processes within the catchment by implementing and comparing lumped and semi-distributed model setups.\nFlood prediction is improved by SM-DA (Figure), with a 30% reduction of the average root-mean-squared difference of the ensemble prediction, a 20% reduction of the false alarm ratio and a 40% increase of the ensemble mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. SM-DA skill does not significantly change with different observation error assumptions, but the skill strongly depends on the observational bias correction technique used, and more importantly, on the performance of the open-loop model before assimilation. Our findings imply that proper pre-processing of SSM is important for the efficacy of the SM-DA and assimilation performance is critically affected by the quality of model calibration. We therefore recommend focusing efforts on these two factors, while further evaluating the trade-offs between model complexity and data availability.",

            "abstract": "Mayon is one of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines with 49 known historical eruptions from 1616 to 2010. A phreatic explosion took place at Mayon on 7 May 2013 that killed five climbers. During the explosion, a very long period seismic event with a peak frequency of 0.4 Hz was recorded by three broadband seismometers. Our frequency-domain waveform inversion solution of the event in the frequency range 0.1-0.6 Hz is consistent with a subhorizontal tensile crack and a vertical single force at a shallow location beneath the summit crater. The source time functions obtained by the waveform inversion are band-passed forms (filtered source time functions; FSTFs), which may be distorted from the source time functions without filters (deconvolved forms of the source time functions; DSTFs). To estimate the DSTFs, we assumed several simple trial functions as candidates for the DSTFs and applied a band-pass filter of 0.1-0.6 Hz to them. A comparison with the FSTFs suggested that the DSTFs of both the crack and single force are better approximated by an impulse-type function than by a step-type function. The estimated DSTF of the crack showed inflation followed by deflation, whereas that of the single force suggested a downward impulse. The inflation of the crack may be attributed to boiling of underground water and its deflation can be attributed to discharge of water vapor. The downward force may be understood as the counterforce of the explosion. Our results suggest that only a portion of the crack wall was destroyed by the explosion. We present a model of repeated explosions in which an explosion can occur once the fragmented portion of the crack is sealed by precipitation of clay minerals or hydrothermal secondary deposits. This model may explain the absence of clear precursory signals before the 2013 explosion.",

While the mere identification of astronomical rhythms is a crucial first step in many deep-time paleoceanographic investigations, accurate evaluation of often subtle amplitude and frequency modulations are required to: (1) robustly constrain the linkage between climate and sedimentation, and (2) evaluate the plausibility of different theoretical astrodynamical models. The availability of a wide range of geophysical, lithologic and geochemical data from multiple sites drilled at Demerara Rise – when coupled with recent innovations in the statistical analysis of cyclostratigraphic data – provides an opportunity to hunt for the most pristine record of Cretaceous astronomical rhythms at a tropical Atlantic location. To do so, a statistical metric is developed to evaluate the “internal” consistency of hypothesized astronomical rhythms observed in each data set, particularly with regard to the expected astronomical amplitude modulations. In this presentation, we focus on how the new analysis yields refinements to the existing astrochronologies, provides constraints on the linkages between climate and sedimentation (including the deposition of organic carbon-rich sediments at Demerara Rise), and allows a quantitative evaluation of the continuity of deposition across sites at multiple temporal scales.",

Using the NOAA/ GFDL global climate models and observations from multiple platforms, we investigate the radiative perturbations due to the 20th Century sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol emissions and the resultant impacts on surface temperature, tropical precipitation, Indian monsoon, hemispheric circulation, and atmospheric and oceanic heat transports. The influence of the aerosol species has many contrasts with that due to the anthropogenic well-mixed greenhouse gas emissions e.g., the asymmetry in the hemispheric climate response, but is subject to larger uncertainties. The aerosol forcing expected in the future indicates a significant control on the 21st Century anthropogenic climate change in Asia.",

            "abstract": "Differential thermal heating of land and ocean and heat release into the atmosphere are important factors that determine the onset, strength, duration and spatial distribution of large-scale monsoons. A global and seasonal assessment of land surface process (LSP) effects on the monsoon system has been made based on general circulation models (GCM) coupled to different benchmark land models, which physically represent either comprehensive, or partial, or minimal LSP representations. Observed precipitation is applied as constrain and differences in simulation error are used to assess the effect of the LSP with different complexity. The AGCM results indicate that the land/atmosphere interaction has substantial impact on global water cycle, while the monsoon regions have had strongest impact at intraseasonal to decadal scales. Among monsoon regions, West Africa, South Asia, East Asia, and Amazon regions have largest impact while some monsoon regions have less impact due to strong air/sea interactions and narrow land mass. LSP reduces the annual precipitation error by 58% over global monsoon regions, about 35% observed precipitation. The partial LSP effect (excluding soil moisture and vegetation albedo) reduces annual precipitation error over monsoon region that equals to about 13% of observed precipitation. It has also been suggested that LSP contribute to the abrupt jump in latitude of the East Asian monsoon as well as general circulation turning in some monsoon regions in its early stages.\nThe LSP effects have also been assessed in the land use land cover change experiment. Based on recently compiled global land-use data from 1948-2005, the GCM simulation results indicate the degradation in Mexico, West Africa, south and East Asia and South America produce substantial precipitation anomalies, some of which are consistent with observed regional precipitation anomalies. More comprehensive studies with multi-models are imperatively necessary.",

            "abstract": "Increasing energy consumption and rapid urbanization have many important and poorly understood consequences for the hydrologic cycle in urban and suburban areas. Wide use of fossil fuels for transportation and heating releases isotopically distinctive water vapor that contributes to the overall water vapor budget in varying, usually unknown, concentrations. The use of long term, high resolution isotopic measurements can help determine different sources and proportions of water vapor at various time scales.\nWe present two months of high-resolution water vapor isotope measurements coupled with CO2 concentrations and co-located meteorological observations from December 2013 – January 2014 in Salt Lake City, UT. Periods of atmospheric stagnation (cold-air inversions) show a buildup of CO2 from baseline values of 420 ppm to as high as 600 ppm and an associated decrease in water vapor deuterium-excess values from a baseline of approx. 10‰ to values as low as -10‰ (where d = δ2H - 8*δ18O, in per mil units). We suggest that the strong relationship between CO2and d during inversion periods is driven by the build-up of fossil fuel combustion-derived water vapor with very low d values (≤ -150‰). Based on our measurements of its isotopic composition, combustion-derived water vapor could contribute as much as 15% to the total water vapor budget during inversion periods. We present evidence of this effect at both the multi-day scale and the diurnal scale, where periods of increased automobile use and home heating can be identified. This study provides the first isotopic evidence that accumulation of water of combustion can be identified in boundary layer water vapor, suggests that an appreciable fraction of boundary layer vapor can be derived from combustion under certain atmospheric conditions, and indicates that the distinctive d values of combustion-derived vapor may be a useful tracer for this component of the atmospheric water budget in other urban regions.",

The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which constructing a low crested weir adjacent to Port Canaveral can improve flushing in this region. The Banana River a 50 km long sub-basin of the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), located on the central-east coast of Florida in Brevard County between Cape Canaveral and Merritt Island. Although Banana River has an outlet to the ocean through the Port Canaveral locks, the locks remain closed when there is no passing vessel resulting in limited circulation, long flushing time and poor water quality. Recent high mortality events of different species, e.g. dolphins, manatees and pelicans in the lagoon ecosystem, can be linked to the decline in the water quality. ADCIRC is used to simulate the hydrodynamic properties of the study area and determine the 2D depth-averaged velocity field for two separate cases: one with only tidal and another with both tidal and meteorological forces considered. Simulations are run, first to establish the baseline hydrodynamics of the unmodified system, and then to predict the effects of modifying the domain. Passive particles are placed in the Banana River portion of our domain, and the movement of these particles is tracked using LPTM for both cases. Flushing and residence time are then computed. Results indicate an improvement in flushing in both the Banana River and the central Indian River Lagoon, driven by an induced southerly current. In the portion of the Banana River to the south of the port complex, tidal flushing time is significantly reduced for the case of modified domain. In this southern region the flushing time based on 50% renewal time, is decreased from 100 days down to 15 days, after the addition of the weir to the domain.",

            "abstract": "We have studied two recently acquired multichannel seismic profiles across the Reed Bank area, South China Sea. A detailed seismic interpretation coupled with drilling data has proved the occurrence of a wide distributed carbonate platform, developed between the Late Oligocene and the Early Miocene (32 Ma - 20 Ma). The top of these carbonates is an important regional unconformity, corresponding to a strong and continuous seismic reflector. An age of ~20 Ma is inferred for this reflector, acting as a regional unconformity marking the cessation of seafloor spreading with an erosional/non-depositional hiatus, spanning 3 or 4 m.y. The time interval during which the carbonate platforms formed is concurrent with the opening of the South China Sea. The reconstruction of the tectonic subsidence in this area has shown a decrease in rate of subsidence during the drifting stage (32-17 Ma), indicating that the whole Reed Bank area was in a tectonically stable and shallow water environment for more than 10 m.y., favoring the development of shallow water carbonates. With a sharply increased subsidence rate after the end of spreading (17 Ma) and a continuously increased sea level, the carbonate platforms were drowned and died, except some structural highs with reef buildups, where the carbonate sedimentation continued to Middle Miocene. We suggest that delayed tectonic subsidence in Reed Bank area might have been related to a secondary mantle convection under the rift lasting more than about 10 m.y.\nKey words: carbonates, Reed Bank area, tectonic subsidence, mantle convection, sea level changes, South China Sea",

The robotic spacecraft arrived in 2004 after a 7-year flight from Earth, dropped a parachuted probe named Huygens to study the atmosphere and surface of Saturn’s big moon Titan, and commenced making astonishing discoveries that continue today. Icy jets shoot from the tiny moon Enceladus; Titan’s hydrocarbon lakes and seas are dominated by liquid ethane and methane, and complex pre-biotic chemicals form in the atmosphere and rain to the surface; 3-dimensional structures rise above Saturn’s rings, and a giant Saturn storm circled the entire planet. Cassini’s findings at Saturn have also fundamentally altered many of our concepts of how planets form around stars.\nThe Solstice Mission continues to provide fundamental new science as Cassini observes seasonal and temporal changes, and addresses new questions that have arisen during the mission thus far. The mission’s grand finale occurs in 2017, with 22 inclined orbits between the innermost D ring and the upper portions of Saturn’s atmosphere, enabling unique gravity and magnetic field measurements of the planet, unprecedented determination of the ring mass, some of the highest resolution measurements of the rings and Saturn, and in situ observations in a completely new region around the planet. Highlights from 10 years of Cassini’s ambitious inquiry at Saturn will be presented along with the remarkable science that will be collected in the next three years.\nCassini-Huygens is a cooperative undertaking by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian space agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, ASI).\nThis work was carried out in part at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA.

            "abstract": "The western United States faces distinct challenges such as persistent drought, dwindling water resources amidst an expanding population, and climate-sensitive alpine environments. The complex terrain of the region compounds these challenges. The Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC), one of six National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) university-based regional climate centers, has been providing climate services since 1986 that support the unique needs of stakeholders in the mountainous region of the western U.S. This includes meteorological data, tools, and products for thousands of stations across the West, and gridded data products, such as based on PRISM for example, that are used for drought assessment among other needs. WRCC and partners have developed numerous web-based tools and products to support decision-making and research pertinent to the West. Changing climate and variability along with the diverse physical and human geographies of the western U.S. require continuous advancements in climate knowledge and applications development. Examples include the need for tools and model downscaling that support and inform adaptation, mitigation and resiliency planning; web-based analytics that would allow users to interact and explore temporal and spatial data and relationships, and products from new satellite sensors that can provide higher resolution information on soil moisture and vegetation health given the sparseness of in-situ observations for the vastness of the West. This presentation provides an overview of some insights, opportunities and challenges of providing current and future climate services in the West.",

            "abstract": "There are strong ties between land use and sediment yield in watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of sediment yield to land-use compositions and spatial configurations in watersheds. However, one issue with the use of conventional statistical methods to address relationships between land-use compositions and spatial configurations and sediment yield is multicollinearity. This paper examines the combined effects of land-use compositions and land-use spatial configurations of the watershed on the specific sediment yield of the Upper Du River watershed (8,973 km2) in China using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The land-use compositions and spatial configurations of the watershed were calculated at the sub-watershed scale. The sediment yields from sub-watershed were evaluated using SWAT model. The first-order factors were identified by calculating the variable importance for the projection (VIP). The results revealed that the land-use compositions exerted the largest effects on the specific sediment yield and explained 61.2% of the variation in the specific sediment yield. Land-use spatial configurations were also found to have a large effect on the specific sediment yield and explained 21.7% of the observed variation in the specific sediment yield. The following are the dominant first-order factors of the specific sediment yield at the sub-watershed scale: the areal percentages of agriculture and forest, patch density, value of the Shannon’s diversity index, contagion. The VIP values suggested that the Shannon’s diversity index and contagion are important factors for sediment delivery.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) is a ubiquitous mixture of soluble organic components. Since DOM is produced from the terrestrial leachate of various soil types, soil may influence the chemistry and biology of freshwater through the input of leachate and run-off. The increased temperature by climate change could dramatically change the DOM characteristics of soils through enhanced decomposition rate and losses of carbon from soil organic matter. In addition, the increase in the N-deposition affects DOM leaching from soils by changing the carbon cycling and decomposition rate of soil decay. In this study, we conducted growth chamber experiments using two types of soil (wetland and forest) under the conditions of temperature increase and N-deposition in order to investigate how warming and nitrogen addition influence the characteristics of the DOM leaching from different soil types. This leachate controls the quantity and quality of DOM in surface water systems. After 10 months of incubation, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased for almost samples in the range of 7.6 to 87.3% (ANOVA, p<0.05). The specific UV absorption (SUVA) values also decreased for almost samples after the first 3 months and then increased gradually afterward in range of 3.3 to 108.4%. Both time and the interaction between time and the temperature had the statistically significant effects on the SUVA values (MANOVA, p<0.05). Humification index (HIX) showed the significant increase trends during the duration of incubation and temperature for almost the samples (ANOVA, p<0.05). Higher decreases in the DOC values and increases in HIX were observed at higher temperatures, whereas the opposite trend was observed for samples with N-addition. The PARAFAC results showed that three fluorescence components: terrestrial humic (C1), microbial humic-like (C2), and protein-like (C3), constituted the fluorescence matrices of soil samples. During the experiment, labile DOM from the soils was consumed and transformed into resistant aromatic carbon structures and less biodegradable components via microbial processes. Both time and the temperature presented the statistically significant effects on DOM characteristics of soil samples while the N-addition exhibited the insignificant difference among the samples.",

            "abstract": "To increase understanding of the future changes of the East Asian monsoon (EAM) under the current global warming background, we turn to investigate the EAM during the mid-Cretaceous (~90Ma), which is one of the warmest greenhouse climate episodes of the Phanerozoic. Utilizing the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.03 from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), we simulate the global climate in the mid-Cretaceous, and some results can well match with some geological evidences. New indices of monsoon based on the seasonal/annual precipitation ratios are defined, and they can represent modern EAM well. Upon these indices, the simulation results demonstrate that the East Asia has been a typical monsoon region during the mid-Cretaceous, and then the mid-Cretaceous EAM were analyzed and compared with the modern EAM. According to the spatial pattern of the EAM index, the EAM region was divided into two subregions: East Asian low-latitude monsoon (EALM) and East Asian mid-latitude monsoon (EAMM). The mid-Cretaceous EALM was comparable to the modern one, as well as the summer and winter monsoon intensities. However, the monsoon index was reduced obviously in the mid-latitudes of East Asia, which indicates that the mid-Cretaceous EAMM was not as significant as modern. Thorough the analysis on the climatology in the EAMM region, the mid-Cretaceous summer/annual precipitation ratio was smaller than modern, while the winter/annual precipitation ratio was greater. This difference between the mid-Cretaceous and modern EAMM shows that the summer and winter monsoon intensities both weaken and that the uneven distribution of precipitation in different seasons is alleviated in the mid-Cretaceous world, therefore the mid-Cretaceous EAMM is a weaker system.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake brought a broad and unprecedented increase in seismicity in northern Honshu, Japan, including a high occurrence rate of moderate-size earthquakes in and around Tokyo, where five M>7 earthquakes struck in the past 400 years. Immediately after the Tohoku-oki earthquake, the seismicity rate in the Kanto seismic corridor beneath Tokyo jumped ten-fold and then decayed for 6-12 months, after which it steadied at three-to-two times the pre-Tohoku rate (continuous at least until the end of July, 2014). The time series of the seismicity does not fit by a simple Omori-decay formula and not observed in a typical off-fault aftershock sequence. To well explain the rate increase and its unique time dependency, we employ rate and state dependent Coulomb model incorporating not only the coseismic stress step but also stressing rate change. In the model, coseismic static stress changes are calculated onto the nodal planes of 338 pre-mianshock focal mechanisms as proxies for potential nucleation sites. We found ~80% were brought closer to failure by the M=9.0 mainshock and M=7.9 aftershock with the mean increase of 1 bar. We then use the histogram of the stress changes with plausible rate/state parameters to reproduce the seismicity time series following the method of Toda et al. (2012). Because the Kanto seismicity did not decay back to the pre-Tohoku rate, we included a 3-times higher stressing rate after the Tohoku mainshock. The origin of the higher post-Tohoku-oki stressing rate is likely explained by postseismic creep. Both on land GPS data (Ozawa et al., 2012) and repeating earthquakes (Uchida and Matsuzawa, 2013) inferred a significant postseismic after-slip on up-dip extension of the upper Pacific slab. We speculate that gradual stress transfer on deeper plate interface from such a transient shallow postseismic creep is responsible for the unique long-lasting off-fault seismicity beneath Tokyo.",

The region’s Pleistocene environment has been interpreted as cool and moist, with boreal forest. A competing interpretation envisioned cold, dry, semidesert conditions. Pebble- to boulder-sized ventifacts with a wide suite of erosional forms provide evidence for strong Pleistocene wind action, which occurred when the land was sparsely vegetated allowing an abundance of abradants to be easily entrained and transported. Although commonplace, ventifact presence and utility in paleoenvironmental reconstruction is ignored. Most ventifacts occur on upland surfaces and attest to stability in this part of the region’s otherwise low-relief landscape, and their subsequent disarrangement provides clues to geomorphic processes and landscape evolution. Ventifacts progressed downslope along upper valley-side slopes largely by gravitational mass movement, particularly under periglacial conditions. Development of eolian features such as pavement einkante, scallops, and weathering pit modification can evolve only where sustained wind velocities are very high and sand sources are abundant. Pine Barrens ventifacts provide evidence that desert-like conditions prevailed. Some ventifact surfaces are covered with a silica glaze or an iron-enriched metal film, or both, indicating multiple episodes of wind abrasion. Coating study holds much promise for future dating and climate reconstruction investigations.",

            "abstract": "The joint security of water, food, and energy systems is an urgent issue everywhere, and strong drivers of development and land use change, exacerbated by climate change, require new knowledge to achieve integrated solution using a nexus-based approach to assess inter-dependencies. Effective research-based decision support tools are essential to identify the major issues and interconnections to help in implementation of the nexus approach. The major needs are models and data to clearly and unambiguously present decision scenarios to local cooperative groups of farmers, electric energy generators and water officials for joint decisions. These can be developed by integrated models to link hydrology, land use, energy use, cropping simulation, and optimization with economic objectives and socio-physical constraints. The first step in modeling is to have a good conceptual model and then to get data. As the linking of models increases uncertainties, each one should be supplied with adequate data at suitable spatial and temporal resolutions. Most models are supplied with data by geophysical scientists, such as hydrologists, geologists, atmospheric scientists, soil scientists, and climatologists, among others. Outcomes of a recently-completed project to study the water-energy-food nexus will be explained to illuminate the model and data needs to inform future management actions across the nexus. The project included a workshop of experts from government, business, academia, and the non-profit sector who met to define and explain nexus interactions and needs. An example of the findings is that data inconsistencies among sectors create barriers to integrated planning. A nexus-based systems model is needed to outline sectoral inter-dependencies and identify data demands and gaps. Geophysical scientists can help to create this model and take leadership on designing data systems to facilitate sharing and enable integrated management.",

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that many US researchers face increasing competition in chasing after federal support that has not kept pace with inflation, the good news is that private support is on the rise. A growing number of wealthy individuals are investing in research areas that reflect their deeply-held passions as their personal philanthropy. They typically are unafraid to take risks, abhor bureaucracy, and nimbly cross disciplinary boundaries. Many put their personal imprimatur on the direction and operation of the ventures that bear their names. However, private funding is not a replacement for federal funding. It is not coordinated. Absent adequate federal support, gaps can develop: between and within fields, in the balance of exploratory, basic, applied, and translational research, and in the support of scientific talent at different levels of training or institutions of different types. The private share remains small and cannot compensate for significant losses in federal dollars. For these reasons, it is important that scientists and philanthropists make the case to our political leadership that private funding does not replace public support. Private funding is and always has been a huge boon to the scientific enterprise. Universities and researchers have for more than a century been successfully merging public and private funds to profit from the advantages of each funding source, accelerate scientific discovery, and benefit humanity. Given the many causes that could engage the attention of these philanthropists, we are fortunate that so many have chosen to give back to society through the geosciences.",

            "abstract": "A larch forest in eastern Siberia was characterized by the presence of two distinct stories, the overstory with a small leaf area index (LAI) and a dense understory with a relatively large LAI. To understand the roles of the over- and understory in forest-atmosphere water exchange, canopy conductance (Gc), a critical parameter used in determining the energy and mass exchange, was calculated based on latent heat flux above the overstory and understory, measured separately. Results showed that Gc for the overstory (Gco) and understory (Gcu) experienced different seasonal fluctuations. Gco was smaller than Gcu during periods of leaf expansion and leaf fall and showed an increasing trend until one month after the onset of leaf expansion. In contrast, a sharp decrease in Gco was observed immediately before onset of leaf fall. Furthermore, Gco was slightly larger than Gcu during the fully foliated period. A simple model using solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit (D) as inputs successfully reproduced the Gc in fully foliated periods with acceptable accuracy. Furthermore, both the understory and overstory in this study have a large reference Gc (Gc at D = 1KPa) than their counterparts of other boreal forests and would not be able to sustain a constant leaf-soil water potential difference as D increases. We speculated that this confers the forest with an advantage allowing it to be able to sustain carbon assimilation during large D days and thus provides for the survival of the ecosystem during the short growing season at this site.",

            "abstract": "Clumped isotope thermometry involves the determination of formation temperatures of carbonates from the fraction of isotopologues containing multiple rare isotopes (oxygen-18 and carbon-13). At high temperatures, the abundance of these isotopologues should be stochastic. At lower temperatures, there is a tendency for heavy isotopes to form bonds with each other.\nHowever, spectroscopic determination of isotope ratios with high precision is difficult in solids, and so 13C-18O bond abundance is not measured in the solid phase. Instead, analysis of carbonates is performed using gas source mass spectrometry, by reacting the carbonate samples with phosphoric acid and measuring the evolved CO2 gas. As an oxygen atom is lost during the conversion of CO32- groups to CO2, this reaction is hypothesized to result in mineral and acid digestion temperature-dependent fractionation. In order to quantify this fractionation between CO32- and CO2, this experiment seeks to determine acid fractionation factors for carbonate samples of varying composition by randomizing samples through intense heating and comparing analyte CO2 measured composition to the expected composition for a stochastically distributed sample. From this analysis, future carbonate measurements can be calibrated to account for acid digestion fractionation.",

We take the fluctuation amplitudes to have a log-Poisson distribution and incorporate into the model a new phenomenology of scale-dependent dynamic alignment. The log-Poisson distribution in our model is characterized by two parameters. To calculate these parameters, we make use of three assumptions: that the energy cascade rate is independent of scale within the inertial range, that the most intense coherent structures at scale lambda are sheet-like with a volume filling factor proportional to lambda, and that most of the cascade power arises from interactions between exceptionally intense fluctuations and much weaker fluctuations. We then compute the scalings of the power spectrum, the kurtosis, higher-order structure functions, and three different average alignment angles. These scalings appear to be consistent with a number of results from direct numerical simulations, as well as recently published solar-wind observations.",

However, the degree of Dryland degradation is unknown with estimates ranging from 10 to 80%. To address this issue we studied the question of how much of above-ground NPP (ANPP) is being appropriated by the US's commercial livestock herd. We compared satellite-derived estimates of US rangeland above-ground NPP (ANPP) in the National Park System (NPS) to grazed US rangelands outside the parks from 2000 to 2012. This provided a test of the hypotheses that NPS ANPP > Rangeland ANPP and NP NPP < Rangeland NPP at low to moderate levels of grazing due to grazing optimization. We found that federally managed wilderness areas had greater productivity than the surrounding rangelands with an estimated mean removal of 58% of NPP by livestock and probably fire, and other land management practices over the 13-year period.",

            "abstract": "The Los Tuxtlas region is an area in the eastern Mexican State of Veracruz, located over the Tuxtla volcanic field and surroundings. This field is composed of 353 distinct cones, 4 large composite volcanoes, and 42 maars. Eruptive activity in the TVF began in the late Miocene, underwent a quiescent period approximately 2.6-0.8 Ma, and continues into historic times with the most recent eruptions occurring at San Martín Tuxtla volcano in 1640 and 1793. Due to the historical occurrence of these eruptions, the volcano is considered hazardous. Although no casualties were derived from those eruptions, the population in the area has grown at a fast pace and a similar eruption occurring today would cause enormous social problems. According to INEGI, the country’s organism in charge of demographic studies, there are some 200,000 people settled 20 km around the volcano. Furthermore, since the volcanic field is basaltic, the magma’s transfer time from depth to surface is short, and volcanic eruptions such as that of 1793 occur without much warning time. These aspects point out to the need for an estimation of the effects of a similar eruption in our days. Espindola et al. (2010; JVGR, 197, 188-208) estimated the isopachs of the ash deposited during that eruption of 1793; we used these isopachs to the 1 cm contour to evaluate some of those effects. The 1 cm isopach spans an area of 541 km2 of which 385 km2 is grazing lands and plantations, more than 149 km2 are covered by dense vegetation and 5 km2 are occupied by settlements of various sizes. There are about 34 km of paved roads that are also the main communication access to the southern State of Veracruz. These figures are a basis for the estimation of the cost of the assistance to the region in case of an eruption and the elaboration of plan of contingency in case of eruption.",

            "abstract": "The freshwater-saltwater interface in surface-water bodies along the coast is an important factor in the ecological and socio-economic dynamics of coastal communities. It influences community composition in freshwater and saltwater ecosystems, determines fisheries spawning habitat, and controls freshwater availability for municipal and industrial water intakes. These dynamics may be affected by coastal drought through changes in Vibrio bacteria impacts on shellfish harvesting and occurrence of wound infection, fish kills, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, and beach closures.\nThere are many definitions of drought, with most describing a decline in precipitation having negative impacts on water supply and agriculture. Four general types of drought are recognized: hydrological, agricultural, meteorological, and socio-economic. Indices have been developed for these drought types incorporating data such as rainfall, streamflow, soil moisture, groundwater levels, and snow pack. These indices were developed for upland areas and may not be appropriate for characterizing drought in coastal areas. Because of the uniqueness of drought impacts on coastal ecosystems, a need exists to develop a coastal drought index. The availability of real-time and historical salinity datasets provides an opportunity to develop a salinity-based coastal drought index.\nThe challenge of characterizing salinity dynamics in response to drought is excluding responses attributable to occasional saltwater intrusion events. Our approach to develop a coastal drought index modified the Standardized Precipitation Index and applied it to sites in South Carolina and Georgia, USA. Coastal drought indices characterizing 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and12-month drought conditions were developed. Evaluation of the coastal drought index indicates that it can be used for different estuary types, for comparison between estuaries, and as an index for wet conditions (high freshwater inflow) in addition to drought conditions.",

In March 2014, part of this region near the town of Pisagua experienced anomalous seismic activity, which motivated the deployment of 26 broadband seismometers by ONEMI-CSN (Oficina Nacional de Emergencia del Ministerio del Interior y Centro Sismológico Nacional) just prior to and following the magnitude 8.2 April 1st earthquake. Incoming data from those stations, supplemented by data from 14 broadband permanent stations of the Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) and 9 temporary Iquique Local Network (ILN) stations operating through 2012-2013 are analyzed to create a 3D elastic shear-wave velocity model of the upper 40 km beneath northern Chile using ambient noise tomography. The vertical component of continuous ambient noise is whitened and cross-correlated between 202 station pairs to construct empirical Green’s functions (EGFs) of Rayleigh waves. EGFs with signal-to-noise ratios above 2.0 dB are used to recover group and phase velocities of the fundamental mode between 5 and 40 second periods. The resulting group and phase velocity maps are inverted on a grid with concentrated spacing in the area surrounding Iquique (with a dense network of stations) to generate a 3D shear wave velocity model. The model shows that the upper 40 km beneath this area are characterized by stark contrasts in shear wave velocities marking the major faults, going from 2.5 km/s to 4 km/s in some areas. The shear wavespeeds range between 2-5 km/s throughout the model.",

Sediments uniformly consist of olive grey to grey sandy silts (MH-ML), with clay content ranging from 2-12% (using the Unified Soil Classification System – USCS). Total unit weight varies between 14.1 to 17.4 kNm-3, bulk density 715-2065 kgm-3, water content 43-90+%, and specific gravity 2.5-2.74. Sediments present low plasticity, liquid limits 43-63%, and plasticity indices of 8.7-34%. Measured strength values, friction angle (Ф’) and apparent cohesion (c’), vary between 30-40°, and 0-10 kPa respectively. One slide-adjacent core, and four within-landslide cores present boundary surfaces located at depths of 0.8 to 2.2 meters below the present-day seafloor that are identified by a sharp, colour-change boundary; small increases in sediment stiffness; slight increases in sediment bulk density of 0.1 gcm-3; and distinct gaps in AMS 14C age of at least 25 ka. Compression testing indicates that the sediment above and below the boundary surface is slightly overconsolidated. Triaxial tests indicate a significant increase in the brittleness of the shear response of the sediment with increasing vertical stress, which would cause a progressive increase of pore pressure if the sediment was subjected to cyclic (earthquake) loading. The boundary surfaces are interpreted to represent detachment surfaces or slide plane surfaces. Slope stability models based on classical soil mechanics and measured sediment shear-strengths indicate that the upper slope sediments should be stable. However, multibeam bathymetry data reveal that many upper slope landslides occur across the margin and that submarine landsliding is a common process. We infer from these results that: a) the margin experiences seismic events that act to destabilise the slope sediments, and/or b) an unidentified mechanism regularly acts to reduce the shear resistance of these sediments to the very low values required to enable slope failure.",

            "abstract": "The weather on Oahu is dictated in large part by the orographic forcing by the Ko’olau Mountain range. Using a high-resolution vertical motion diagnostic model with 0.0005° grid spacing, vertical wind speeds are calculated over the island. The model initialization is done with uniform 10 m s-1 winds, with the wind direction gradually varied. The results show that increased vertical motion occurs for winds from 145° in the valleys along the south shore of Oahu and the Waianae Mountains. For northeast trade winds, the Ko’oalu Range ridgeline produces a maximum vertical motion enhancement. As the winds become more northerly, easterly, or southerly, the geometry of the orography increases in importance and preferential locations of upward motion are observed. Comparing the winds from 145° and 25°, the concave headwall structures of the Ko’olaus are shown to play a critical role in the vertical motion. The southerly wind causes enhanced vertical motion along the southern facing arms of the headwalls, and the northerly winds have an identical effect on the northern facing arms. These results are not limited to when the wind is perpendicular to the ridgeline. By forcing the model with sounding winds taken during the Hawaiian Educational Radar Opportunity, the results are consistent with rain showers occurring over the mountains down shear from locations of strongest updrafts.",

Studies assessing long term changes of water quality have been recognized as a key tool for understanding ongoing processes in watersheds and for providing an essential background for evaluation of rapid changes within industrialized and populated urban areas. Unfortunately, only limited studies are available for developing countries such as Malaysia. Thus, a long term study was conducted to evaluate water quality trends at Pencala river basin that has undergone extensive land use changes related to industrial, agricultural and urban activities. Fifteen physical and chemical variables were analysed in river water samples collected every month over a period of 13 years, between 1997 and 2009. The trend study was performed using the Mann-Kendall Seasonal test and the Sen’s Slope estimator. Results revealed that most water quality parameters showed a downward trend for yearly average concentration. The water quality index (WQI) for Pencala River was improved from Class V to Class IV, according to National Water Quality Standards for Malaysia. BOD, COD, NH3-N and SS show trends toward decreasing concentrations over time. The improvements seen in water quality appear to be the result of improved wastewater treatment and other water quality improvement efforts achieved through government initiative. Continued long-term and high frequency monitoring is necessary to establish plans and policies for effective water resources management.",

The main orebody shows in stratoid, small orebody appears in lenticular and vein.In order to predict potential resources, we proposes a combined method of CSAMT and GS technology，and has applied it to the survey of concealed molybdenum deposit in the Baishan.This combind method can explore to larger depths, discriminate anomalies well and has higher resolution to deep objects, thus it is an efficient tool for surveys．By drilling, we found there exsit a hidden granite body in 1400 meters deep of Hami Baishan molybdenum mine, it confirmed that Baishan molybdenum mine is a porphyry molybdenum ore. Cataclastic hornfelsed zone in the coping granite are the product of heat contact metamorphism, the ore materials are mainly derived from deep magma hydrothermal solution. The CSAMT and Gravity Survey were able to reflect the space and intrusive boundary in rough of buried granite body clearly, deep hidden granite showed high-resistivity and high-gravity anomaly and the low-resistivity anomaly distributied around them, drilling verified that 200-2500Ω low-resistivity anomaly range at top of high-resistivity corresponded to the molybdenum ore horizon. Line 15 of southern section shows two low resistance anomaly zone, and the surface of them is corresponding to the granite and intrusive contact parts,inferring it was caused by the fault structure.In granite gravity anomaly is obviously high and the width is about 560m,Δg residual value is 400 × 10-8m/s2. According to the control of drilling works on buried granite and molybdenum bearing location and corresponding resistivity contour lines interval of CSAMT, we inferred approximately the top intrusion boundary of buried granite and predicted the deep molybdenum ore forming space.

Managing water resources is a complex discipline that requires accurate data, which in turn means that the managament of water resources is limited by the availability and quality of these datasets. Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of these key datasets, but is also one that is lacking in large-scale spatial distribution with traditional methods such as Penman-Monteith. This is also a quantity poorly handled at present in regional and global climate models. In order to overcome the limitations imposed by pointwise calculation of ET, a new dataset based on a surface energy balance model METRIC) constrained by MODIS satellite imagery have been developed. A Fully Automated Python implementation of METRIC model was needed and developed to cover the CONUS due to the high computational time for manual processing of METRIC. In this study, the new ET dataset will be used to evaluate the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Community Land Model's (WRF-CLM) as well as NOAH Land Surface Model. CLM and NOAH are the models which is used to understand the processes between land and climate and also climate change, and contains crucial but poorly constrained parameterizations for ET. In this study CLM and NOAH will be coupled with WRF. The WRF model is driven by North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data. The results between Metric ET and WRF-CLM ET and WRF-NOAH ET are different since they use different approaches for obtaining ET. The difference will be checked with statistical approaches. For this study 3 years are selected: A relatively dry year, 2012, a relatively wet year, 2007 and a regular year 2005. The results of this study will improve our understanding of climate-land interactions which will lead to better present simulations and future predictions of water resource-related issues since ET has the biggest consumption in the water budget.",

            "abstract": "About one-half of the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and deforestation accumulates in the atmosphere, where it contributes to global warming. The rest is taken up by vegetation and the ocean. The precise contribution of the two, and the location and year-to-year variability of the CO2 sinks are, however, not well understood. We use a batch Bayesian inversion approach to deduce the global spatiotemporal distributions of CO2 fluxes during 2009-2010. For prior constraints, we utilize fluxes from the CASA-GFED model of the terrestrial biosphere and biomass burning driven by satellite observations and interannually varying meteorology. We also use measurement-based ocean flux estimates, and fixed fossil CO2 emissions. Here, we present results from our inversions that incorporate column CO2 measurements from the GOSAT satellite (ACOS retrieval, filtered and bias-corrected) and in situ observations (individual flask and afternoon-average continuous observations) to estimate fluxes in 108 regions over 8-day intervals. Relationships between fluxes and atmospheric concentrations are derived using the PCTM atmospheric transport model run at 2° x 2.5° (latitude/longitude) resolution driven by meteorology from the MERRA reanalysis. We evaluate the posterior CO2 concentrations using independent aircraft and other data sets. The optimized fluxes generally resemble those from other inversion systems using different techniques, for example indicating a net terrestrial biospheric CO2 sink, and a shift in the sink from tropics to northern high latitudes when going from an in-situ-only inversion to a GOSAT inversion. We show that in this inversion framework, GOSAT provides better flux estimates in most regions with its greater spatial coverage, but we also discuss impacts of possible remaining biases in the data.",

The IGY(1957-1958) spurred development of new optical and chemical instruments for flight on meteorological and sounding rockets. In the early 1960’s, the US Navy developed an Arcas rocket-borne optical ozonesonde and NASA GSFC developed chemiluminescent ozonesonde onboard Nike_Cajun and Arcas rocket. The Navy optical ozone program was moved in 1969 to GSFC where rocket ozone research was expanded and continued until 1994 using Super Loki-Dart rocket at 11 sites in the range of 0-65N and 35W-160W. Over 300 optical ozone soundings and 40 chemiluminescent soundings were made. The data have been used to produce the US Standard Ozone Atmosphere, determine seasonal and diurnal variations, and validate early photochemical models. The current effort includes soundings conducted by Australia, Japan, and Korea using optical techniques. New satellite ozone sounding techniques were initially calibrated and later validated using the rocket ozone data. As satellite techniques superseded the rocket methods, the sponsoring agencies lost interest in the data and many of those records have been discarded. The current task intends to recover as much of the data as possible from the private records of the experimenters and their publications, and to archive those records in the WOUDC (World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre). The original data records are handwritten tabulations, computer printouts that are scanned with OCR techniques, and plots digitized from publications. This newly recovered digital rocket ozone profile data from 1965 to 2002 could make significant contributions to the Earth science community in atmospheric research including long-term trend analysis.",

            "abstract": "Capturing the spatial variability in the flow is essential to any credible modeling effort of the Greenland ice sheet, yet it remains challenging for several reasons. First ice flow results from gradients in gravitational driving stress, making accurate ice thickness measurements indispensable. Second the way the driving stress is balanced between vertical shearing, and basal and lateral drag must be either parametrized or estimated from inversion of surface data. Third solving the Stokes equations is computationally expensive, prohibiting long integration times and/or large scale parameter sensitivity studies. In this work we address the latter two. We demonstrate that much of the observed flow variability can be explained by combing a computationally-efficient hybrid stress balance model, a sliding parametrization that includes the effect of basal effective pressure, and high-resolution ice thickness. We show how uncertainties in ice thickness and basal sliding influence ice discharge through the grounding line. In addition to commonly-used metrics of success such as root mean square error, we validate our modeling efforts by comparing simulated to observed profiles of mass flux through flux gates around the periphery of Greenland. We conclude that the cumulative mass flux across flux gates is an insufficient metric to assess the model's skill to simulate the spatial variability in ice flow.",

            "abstract": "Rift evolution and passive margin formation has been thoroughly investigated using conceptual and numerical models in two dimensions. However, the 2D assumption that the extension direction is perpendicular to the rift trend is often invalid. In fact, the majority of rift systems that lead to continental break-up during the last 150 My involved moderate to high rift obliquity. Yet, the degree to which oblique lithospheric extension affects first-order rift and passive margin properties like surface stress pattern, fault azimuths, and basin geometry, is still not entirely clear.\nThis contribution provides insight in crustal stress patterns and fault orientations by applying a 3D numerical rift model to oblique extensional settings. The presented forward experiments cover the whole spectrum of oblique extension (i.e. rift-orthogonal extension, low obliquity, high obliquity, strike-slip deformation) from initial deformation to breakup. They are conducted using an elasto-visco-plastic finite element model and involve crustal and mantle layers accounting for self-consistent necking of the lithosphere.\nEven though the model setup is very simple (horizontally layered, no inherited faults), its evolution exhibits a variety of fault orientations that are solely caused by the interaction of far-field stresses with rift-intrinsic buoyancy and strength. Depending on rift obliquity, these orientations involve rift-parallel, extension-orthogonal, and intermediate normal fault directions as well as strike-slip faults. Allowing new insights on fault patterns of the proximal and distal margins, the model shows that individual fault populations are activated in a characteristic multi-phase evolution driven by lateral density variations of the evolving rift system. Model results are in very good agreement with inferences from the well-studied Gulf of Aden and provide testable predictions for other rifts and passive margins worldwide.",

Past studies with one-way coupling have yielded useful insight into the future of present-day ice sheets. More recently, studies have used two-way coupling that conserves mass but not energy, in order to better understand possible future equilibrium states of the ice sheets and climate system.\nTwo-way coupling that preserves mass and energy is seen a prerequisite to effective modeling of ice sheet that probably play a significant role in many events in the paleo record: Dansgaard–Oeschger events, Heinrich events, the Younger Dryas. It may also be used to estimate errors inherent in two-way coupled strategies that do not conserve energy.\nThe need for energy conservation puts constraints on the GCM, the ice model, and the design of the coupler. Details of these requirements are presented as they are being implemented in the coupling of GISS ModelE with the PISM and ISSM ice sheet models, via the Glint2 coupler.",

Embedded within the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) (see Maddox et al. in Session IN026) and located at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, SWRC has easy access to state-of-the-art modeling capabilities and proximity to space science and research expertise. By bridging space weather users and the research community, SWRC has been a catalyst for the efficient transition from research to operations and operations to research. In this presentation, we highlight a few unique aspects of SWRC’s space weather services, such as addressing space weather throughout the solar system, pushing the frontier of space weather forecasting via the ensemble approach, providing direct personnel and tool support for spacecraft anomaly resolution, prompting development of multi-purpose tools and knowledge bases (see Wiegand et al. in the same session SM004), and educating and engaging the next generation of space weather scientists.",

            "abstract": "Surface wind stress is considered to be an important forcing of the seasonal and interannual variability of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) volume transports. A recent study showed that even linear response to wind forcing captures observed features of the mean seasonal cycle. However, the study did not assess the contribution of wind-driven linear response in realistic conditions against the RAPID/MOCHA array observation or Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) simulations, because it applied a linear two-layer model to the Atlantic assuming constant upper layer thickness and density difference across the interface. Here, we quantify the contribution of wind-driven linear response to the seasonal and interannual variability of AMOC transports by comparing wind-driven linear simulations under realistic continuous stratification against the RAPID observation and OCGM (MPI-OM) simulations with 0.4º resolution (TP04) and 0.1º resolution (STORM).\nAll the linear and MPI-OM simulations capture more than 60% of the variance in the observed mean seasonal cycle of the Upper Mid-Ocean (UMO) and Florida Strait (FS) transports, two components of the upper branch of the AMOC. The linear and TP04 simulations also capture 25-40% of the variance in the observed transport time series between Apr 2004 and Oct 2012; the STORM simulation does not capture the observed variance because of the stochastic signal in both datasets. Comparison of half-overlapping 12-month-long segments reveals some periods when the linear and TP04 simulations capture 40-60% of the observed variance, as well as other periods when the simulations capture only 0-20% of the variance. These results show that wind-driven linear response is a major contributor to the seasonal and interannual variability of the UMO and FS transports, and that its contribution varies in an interannual timescale, probably due to the variability of stochastic processes.",

            "abstract": "An algorithm is developed to reduce the computational burden of constructing the reduced stiffness and mass matrices for a reduced order groundwater model. A reduced order groundwater model can be developed by projecting the full groundwater model onto a subspace whose range spans the range of the full model space. This is done through the use of a projection matrix. Although reduced order groundwater models have been shown to be able to make accurate estimates of the full model solution at a greatly reduced dimension, the computational cost of projecting the stiffness and mass matrices onto the subspace of the reduced model can be very demanding. To alleviate this difficulty, an algorithm is developed that is able to reduce the effort and cost of constructing the reduced stiffness and mass matrices of the reduced model. The algorithm is based on the concept of approximating the value of a function at some point by use of the first-order Taylor series approximation. The developed algorithm is applied to both a 1-D test case and a 2-D test case. In both cases the algorithm is able to reduce the effort and cost of constructing the reduced order model by several orders of magnitude while losing little to no accuracy.",

These l patterns are compared with the variations of particle precipitating energy flux from TIMED/GUVI under similar geophysical conditions, and also the solar radiation source of the auroral E layer are discussed. Our main conclusions are: (1) the nighttime maximum E-layer electron density presents pronounced longitudinal variations in the auroral zone, which depends on seasons and hemispheres. In local winter of both hemispheres and in northern equinox, maximum electron density is located in most western sectors within magnetic longitudes of 120-360°E. In local summer of both hemispheres and in southern equinox, greater the electron density occurs in a wide longitudinal sector centered at 0°E. (2) Hemispheric asymmetry occurs in auroral E layer electron density in all seasons, including equinox. In local winter, the maximum density of the northern hemisphere is much higher than that of southern hemisphere. In equinox, the longitudinal patterns of the electron density are out of phase between the two hemispheres. (3) The effects of the auroral precipitation are dominant in building the E layer electron density in the auroral zone for all seasons, except in southern summer in sector of 300-90°E MLON, where strong solar radiation takes place.",

            "abstract": "Changes in oceanic heat storage may be partly responsible for the most recent stall (or hiatus) in rising Earth surface temperatures since ~2000 C.E. Instrumental data indicates that this most recent stall is coincident with a phase reversal of the North Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The main locations for this heat exchange with the atmosphere appear to be the tropical and mid-latitude regions of the surface ocean, primarily in the Pacific. We have been investigating poorly understood decadal surface ocean variability in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) region. Despite very sparse instrumental water temperature data in the South Pacific to define the decadal changes at the sea surface and in the upper water column, the available data suggests a disproportionately large role of the Southwest Pacific in decadal-scale changes in heat sequestration. We have generated coral Sr/Ca-derived sea surface temperature (SST) time-series extending back to 1791 C.E. from Fiji, Tonga and Rarotonga (FTR) in the SPCZ region of the subtropical Southwest Pacific and show that decadal-scale SST fluctuations in this broad region are concurrent with the PDO at least since ~1930 C.E. Beginning in the mid-20th century, when more reliable instrumental temperature and ocean heat content data exist, decades of warmer South Pacific subtropical SST co-occur with elevated South Pacific upper ocean (0-700m) heat content. These decadal-scale South Pacific warming events coincide with decadal-scale stalls or plateaus in rising global temperatures. Cross wavelet coherence analysis reveals an increase in the frequency of decadal SST variability from a period near 30 years throughout the 1800s to ~20 years in the later half of the 20th century. Our results provide strong supporting evidence that decadal-scale changes in global surface temperatures are in-part, related to heat storage in the upper water column in the subtropical Pacific. Our results also suggest that decadal-scale stalls in rising global surface temperature are to be expected in the near-future and may be predictable.",

            "abstract": "We have conducted intensive Arctic summertime surveys in recent 5 years to examine temporal variations and spatial distributions of the Pacific-origin Summer Water (PSW) in the Chukchi Borderland (CBL), Arctic Ocean. With the Korean icebreaker Araon, these expeditions lasted for 21 days in 2011, 45 days in 2012, 13 days in 2013, and 25 days in 2014, mostly July to August. It is understood that heat transport of the PSW to CBL is one of the key processes to comprehend the rapid sea ice reduction and changes in water column structure in the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean. We present recent features of PSW’s variations identified from our Arctic cruise data using CTD/XCTD, LADCP, and other measurements. In 2011 summer, the PSW appeared to exist in the eastern flank of the Chukchi Plateau and its signal diminished gradually toward the west. In 2012 summer, the PSW tended to mainly pass through the vicinity of the Northwind Ridge and extended toward the west. In 2013 summer, the PSW with 0.29° C and 30.68 psu was found in the center of the Chukchi Plateau and its layer deepened slightly toward the east. During the cruises in 2011, 2012, and 2013, the PSW was identified in the west of 175° W where it had never been observed previously. In addition, how the spreading of PSW’s pathway and distribution of temperature maximum layer do have an influence on rapid sea ice retreat will be discussed.",

Here, we survey seven years of data from the NASA THEMIS mission and find that KHW occurs at the magnetopause ~21% of the time, regardless of the solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The KHW occurrence rate increases with SW speed and SW Alfven Mach number, but is mostly independent of SW number density and IMF magnitude. The occurrence rate increases with IMF cone angle and maximizes at zero IMF clock angle. However, KHW occurs at a significantly higher rate than expected for southward IMF. KHW may thus be more important for plasma transport across the magnetopause than previously thought, and frequently drive magnetospheric ULF waves.",

            "abstract": "Anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) carry crucial information on the coupling between solar wind and interstellar medium, as well as cosmic ray modulation within the heliosphere. Due to the distinct origins and modulation processes, the spectra and abundance of ACRs are significantly different from that of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Since the launch of NASA’s ACE spacecraft in 1997, its CRIS and SIS instruments have continuously recorded GCR and ACR intensities of several elemental heavy-ions, spanning the whole cycle 23 and the cycle 24 maximum. Here we present a statistical comparison of ACR and GCR observed by ACE spacecraft and their possible relation to solar activity. While the differential flux of ACR also exhibits apparent anti-correlation with solar activity level, the flux of the latest prolonged solar minimum (year 2009) is approximately 5% lower than its previous solar minimum (year 1997). And the minimal level of ACR flux appears in year 2004, instead of year 2001 with the strongest solar activities. The negative indexes of the power law spectra within the energy range from 5 to 30 MeV/nuc also vary with time. The spectra get harder during the solar minimum but softer during the solar maximum. The approaching solar minimum of cycle 24 is believed to resemble the Dalton or Gleissberg Minimum with extremely low solar activity (Zolotova and Ponyavin, 2014). Therefore, the different characteristics of ACRs between the coming solar minimum and the previous minimum are also of great interest. Finally, we will also discuss the possible solar-modulation processes which is responsible for different modulation of ACR and GCR, especially the roles played by diffusion and drifts. The comparative analysis will provide valuable insights into the physical modulation process within the heliosphere under opposite solar polarity and variable solar activity levels.",

            "abstract": "Current Pacific absolute plate motion (APM) models include 2 major, long-lived hotspot tracks: the ~85 Ma Hawaiian-Emperor and the ~76 Ma Louisville tracks. Prior to ~50 Ma, these two hotspot tracks show significant inter-hotspot drift, mainly due to large southern motion of the Hawaiian hotspot [1,2]. A third track would allow for a more robust evaluation of the relationship between APM models and inter-hotspot drift.\nWe present trace element and Pb isotope evidence for a potential third long-lived Pacific hotspot trail—the Rurutu hotspot—anchored in the Cook-Austral Islands. Based on high 206Pb/204Pb ratios, 70-55 Ma volcanism in the Gilbert Ridge has been linked to the Rurutu hotspot [3]. The Gilbert Ridge may continue south into the Tuvalu Islands, where APM models predict that the Rurutu hotspot track captures the change in Pacific plate motion around 50 Ma at the intersection of Tuvalu and Samoa.\nSampling of the deep submarine flanks of atolls and seamounts in Tuvalu and westernmost Samoa took place during the 2013 RR1310 (R/V Roger Revelle) expedition. We present new Pb isotope and HFSE trace element data on 28 samples that support a Rurutu origin for Tuvalu volcanism and confirm HIMU signatures previously observed in 5 Tuvalu samples (206Pb/204Pb >20.1, several >21.0; 87Sr/86Sr < 0.705). Statistical tests indicate that Tuvalu HFSE element ratios show similarities with Cook-Austral HIMU and differences with Samoa EMII volcanism. Low Hf/Nb ratios are often a predictor of HIMU samples (206Pb/204Pb > 20.8). Moderately HIMU compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 20.0) correspond to slightly higher Hf/Nb. In an effort to test if compositional agreement with the Cook-Australs is reflected in an age progression, 40Ar/39Ar ages will be presented by Konrad et al.

            "abstract": "The breakup of the Pangaean supercontinent was one of the most significant events that affected Phanerozoic global tectonics. Heralding this process, and following the Carboniferous maximum stage of continental assembly, was a period in which the southern part of Pangaea (Gondwana) was subjected to a counterclockwise rotation relative to Laurasia. According to tectonic reconstructions, dextral wrench faulting and oroclinal bending in Varsican Europe and eastern Gondwana accompanied this rotation, but direct evidence for dextral strike-slip faulting in the eastern Gondwanan margin has hitherto not been reported. Here we show evidence from a well-preserved fault zone in eastern Australia (Red Rock fault zone), which occurs along the eastern limb of the Z-shaped Texas/Coffs Harbour orocline. Structural observations show evidence for dextral strike-slip faulting, with a reverse kinematic component, along a sub-vertical fault plane oriented NNE-SSW. Direct geochronological data (Rb-Sr and Ar-Ar) from fault gouge samples associated with this fault zone indicate that brittle faulting occurred in the early-mid Permian (288-264 Ma). In addition, oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope geochemistry indicates that the origin of fluids that circulated in the fault zone was associated with a deep crustal source. These results are consistent with independent constraints on the timing of oroclinal bending, supporting the idea that dextral wrench faulting has directly contributed to the formation of the oroclines. We propose a kinematic model for the formation of the oroclines, attributing the early stage of oroclinal bending to subduction rollback and slab segmentation (at ~300-288 Ma) followed by a period of dextral wrench faulting at 288-264 Ma. In the context of Pangaea, our model suggests that the origin of oroclines along the rim of Gondwana was likely associated with bending in response to migrating plate boundaries, and a subsequent tightening of pre-existing curvatures by dextral wrench faulting.",

LMM is able to capture the spatio-temporal profile of MJO along the global tropics in all seasons. With the help of LMM, we clarify the dynamical and thermodynamical structure of the MJO over Malay Peninsula, including the unique \"boomerang-shaped\" feature in the time-height temperature profile identified in previous literature.",

            "abstract": "As part of the SouthEast American Consortium for Intensive Ozone Network Study (SEACIONS) mission, 32 ozonesondes were launched from Forest Park in mid-town St. Louis between 8 Aug and 23 Sept 2013. These launches were supported by concurrent co-located continuous ground level ozone measurements at Saint Louis University’s St. Louis Ozone Garden. During the operation of this site, wildfires from both Idaho’s Beaver Creek (~115K acres) and California’s RIM fire (~258k acres) generated copious amounts of pollution. In addition, widespread agricultural fires in the Midwest were also taking place. To interpret our observations over St. Louis, we used multiple satellite-derived products and retrievals in conjunction with trajectory calculations from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. We examined a blocking high pressure event [Aug 26-30] which led to ozonesonde profile changes resulting from Stratospheric-Troposphere Exchange (STE) in addition to the smoke from the fires. This case study involved two mixed layer O3 enhancements, which could be spotted at multiple sites within the SEACIONS ozonesonde network. Our findings illustrate how satellite measurements can be used to assess the contribution of the transport of pollution from various sources to local air quality.",

            "abstract": "A faintly acidic hot spring named “female Tower” (T=73.5 ℃, pH=6.64 ) is located in the Jifei Geothermal Field，Yunnan province, Southwest China. The precipitates in the hot spring are composed of large amounts of calcite and sulfur, as reveals by XRD analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis show the microbial mats are formed of various coccoid, rod and filamentous microbes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis show that intracellular sulfur granules are commonly associated with these microbes. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) analysis shows that the surface of microbes are mainly composed of Ca, C, O and S. A culture-independent molecular phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the majority of bacteria in the spring are sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. In the spring water, H2S concentration was up to 60 ppm, while SO42- concentration was only about 10 ppm. We suggest that H2S might be utilized by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in this hot spring water, leading to the formation of sulfur granules intracellularly and extracellularly. In the meantime, this reaction increases the pH in ambient environments, which fosters the precipitation of calcium carbonate precipitation in the microbial mats. This study suggests that the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria could play an important role in calcium carbonate precipitation in faintly acidic hot spring environments.",

Since the traditional non-linear parameter calibration will introduce unrelated local optimums, a new non-linear parameter calibration method- the system response parameter calibration method was proposed in the paper. The nonlinear parameter can be linearized by this method which can reduce the un-related local optimums. In this study, the system response parameter calibration method was applied in the Xinanjiang model parameter calibration. The Xinanjiang (XAJ) model was generalized into a system. The changes of model parameters were considered as the input of the system. According to the system response curve caused by the changes of parameters need to be calibrated, the optimal parameters would be calculated using least square estimation based on the observed and calculated discharge. Firstly, the method was tested by an ideal scenario. The results showed that the method can find the given optimums very efficiently. Secondly, the performance of the linearized calibration method in model parameter calibration was studied using real data. The results showed that the system response parameter calibration method was an effective calibration method.",

            "abstract": "Lithifying microbial communities (“microbialites”) have left their signature on Earth’s rock record for over 3.4 billion years and are regarded as important players in paleo-biogeochemical cycles. In this project, we study extant microbialites to understand the interactions between lithification and resource availability. All microbes need nutrients and energy for growth; indeed, nutrients are often a factor limiting microbial growth. We hypothesize that calcium carbonate deposition can sequester bioavailable phosphorus (P) and expect the growth of microbialites to be P-limited. To test our hypothesis, we first compared nutrient limitation in lithifying and non-lithifying microbial communities in Río Mesquites, Cuatro Ciénegas. Then, we experimentally manipulated calcification rates in the Río Mesquites microbialites. Our results suggest that lithifying microbialites are indeed P-limited, while non-lithifying, benthic microbial communities tend towards co-limitation by nitrogen (N) and P. Indeed, in microbialites, photosynthesis and aerobic respiration responded positively to P additions (P<0.05). Organic carbon (OC) additions caused shifts in bacterial community composition based on analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Unexpectedly, calcification rates increased with OC additions (P<0.05), but not with P additions, suggesting that sulfate reduction may be an important pathway for calcification. Experimental reductions in calcification rates caused changes to microbial biomass OC and P concentrations (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively), although shifts depended on whether calcification was decreased abiotically or biotically. These results show that resource availability does influence microbialite formation and that lithification may promote phosphorus limitation; however, further investigation is required to understand the mechanism by which the later occurs.",

            "abstract": "Extraterrestrial life in our Solar System, if present, is almost certain to be microbial. Methods and technologies for unambiguous detection of living or extinct microorganisms are needed for life-detection missions to the Jovian and Saturnian moons, where liquid water is known to exist. Our research focuses specifically on microbial meaningful motion as a biosignature—“waving crowds” at the micron scale. Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) is an excellent tool for unambiguous identification of bacterial and protozoal swimming, even in the presence of turbidity, drift, and currents. The design of a holographic instrument with bacteria scale resolution was described in the previous talk. In this presentation, we will illustrate the design challenges for construction of a field instrument for extreme environments and space, and present plans for scientific investigations at analogue sites for the coming season.\nThe challenges of creating a field instrument involve performance trade-offs, the ability to operate at extreme temperatures, and handling large volumes of data. A fully autonomous instrument without external cables or power is also desirable, and this is something that previous holographic instruments have not achieved. The primary issues for space exploration are identification of a laser and drive electronics that are qualified for the expected radiation environments of the moons around gas giant planets.\nTests in Earth analogue environments will establish performance parameters as well as answer scientific questions that traditional microscopic techniques cannot. Specifically, we will visit a Greenland field site to determine whether or not microorganisms are motile within the brine-filled interior network of sea ice, and if they can be autonomously tracked using the instrument. Motility within the liquid phase of a frozen matrix has been hypothesized to explain how bacteria contribute to the biogeochemical signatures detected in ice, but observational evidence of motility in natural samples at subzero temperatures does not exist. Complementing tests for bacterial motility in ice-brines, we will also test for motility in the subzero waters directly beneath the ice, where motility has long been suspected but also never observed.",

            "abstract": "A high velocity layer (HVL) has been observed at the base of the crust in numerous deployments of temporary broadband seismic experiments in southern Tibet. In receiver functions it appears as a strong phase with positive amplitude 1 to 2 seconds before the Ps converted phase from the Moho. The HVL is first observed north of High Himalaya when crustal thickness approaches ~65 km and it continues uninterrupted beneath the Yarlung-zanbo suture (YZS) and Lhasa block. It is widely distributed laterally but terminates both to the north (at ~31°N) and east (at ~94.5°E) in the eastern Lhasa block. In the western Lhasa block (at ~80°E) it is observed extending beneath the Bangong-Nujiang suture to 34°N. The HVL is generally interpreted as eclogite reflecting high grade metamorphism as pressure and temperature increase with depth and/or as underplated Indian crust.and has potential geodynamic implications.\n We are systematically investigating the HVL at the base of the crust to characterize its depth, thickness, lateral extent, Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs, applying consistent processing across the various datasets where the layer is observed. We first carry out a joint inversion of receiver function and surface wave dispersion observations to determine a lithospheric shear velocity model. Initial results indicate significant complexity as the layer first emerges in the south, gradually increasing in thickness to a maximum of 15km before thinning northward and eventually terminating. The arrival time and amplitude of the converted phase from the layer shows complex variation and azimuthal dependence .\n To further quantitatively explore the HVL properties in detail, we are developing a layer stripping approach using receiver functions and HK stacking methods. . Starting with the lithospheric velocity model,, we create synthetic receiver functions. The Moho related phases in the synthetics are identified, extracted and then subtracted from the observed receiver function. Subsequent HK stacking of the corrected receiver function is then able to resolve the top of HVL without the interference of Moho phases.",

            "abstract": "We describe new geological observations and geochemical data on tectono-sedimentary breccias that formed in hyper-extended domains of the Tethyan rift system. Such breccias are markers of detachment faults in the magma-poor Iberia-Newfoundland and Tethyan rifted margins and document the continuous exhumation of fault surfaces on the seafloor. We focus on a rift-related detachment fault in the most distal Adriatic rifted margin exposed at the interface between the Margna and Malenco nappes in the Eastern Central Alps of SE-Switzerland. These are the first syn-rift breccias along the Jurassic rift related detachment system that document a mixture of both continental and mantle-derived clasts, indicating that hyperextension and the formation of mantle windows are intimately coupled.\n3D mapping of the breccia combined with a 75m long drill core through the hanging and footwall of a detachment fault provide clear evidence that mantle exhumation and breccia formation was coeval. Downhole variations of major and trace elements, and ∂18O isotopes demonstrate m-scale extensive chemical exchange between crustal and mantle rocks.\nThe breccia-mantle contact is made of a m-wide fine-grained metasomatic chl±amph-bearing zone. The breccias on top of the ultramafic rocks are made of mm- to cm-sized amphibole-bearing mantle-derived clasts, continental-derived rounded to elongated cm- to meter-sized blocks, and a fine- to coarse-grained foliated matrix, dominated by chl+bt+fsp+qtz. Amphibole in amphibole-bearing clasts are Cr-Ni-rich, supporting the hypothesis of ultramafic clasts in the polymict breccia. Bulk rock major, minor and trace element data from the serpentinized peridotites to the continental-block bearing breccias show an increase in Al, Ca and elevated LREE. However, amphibole-rich clasts within the mica-rich matrix are very similar in composition to serpentinized peridotites with high Cr, Ni and low LREE, indicating that amphibole rich rocks are previous serpentinized peridotite clasts that are altered to form amphibole blackwalls, presumably related to recrystallization during Alpine metamorphism. We argue that recent findings of eclogite facies brecciation along the subduction interface might be the consequence of inherited brecciation of hyper-extended margins or oceanic core complexes.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 Ms7.0 Lushan earthquake is the strongest event occurred along the Longmen fault following the 2008 5.21 M8 Wenchuan earthquake in China. Based on the a couple of deformation measurements on the surface, including cross-fault baseline, leveling, tilt, strain, gravity and continuous GPS data, we analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics in surface deformations before the Lushan earthquake. The results indicate that (1) since January 2013, significant accelerating compression can be seen from the cross-fault baseline deployed along the Xianshuihe fault; (2) anomalies in the time series of leveling and cross-fault baseline are observed at several sites along Anninghe and Zemuhe faults; (3) most of the leveling records cross the Longmenshan fault with small variations, have the indication of earthquake precursors; (4) the horizontal and vertical GPS displacement rates in the near field are smaller than those in the far field, suggesting there existing a weak area in the source region without significant changes in surface deformation; (5) the annual amplitudes of tilt and gravity in the near-field, extracted by the Fourier transform, are smaller in 2-3 years before the Lushan event. All of these observations can improve our understanding on earthquake nucleation process.",

The NSF-GeoPRISMS Mini-lesson Project, funded by NSF-TUES, is designed to integrate fundamental results from the MARGINS program into open-source college-level curriculum. Three Subduction Factory (SubFac) mini-lessons were developed as part of this project. These include hands-on examinations of data sets representing 3 key components of the subduction zone system: 1) Heat transfer in the subducted slab; 2) Metamorphic processes happening at the plate interface; and 3) Typical magmatic products of arc systems above subduction zones.\nModule 1: “Slab Temperatures Control Melting in Subduction Zones, What Controls Slab Temperature?” allows students to work in groups using beads rolling down slopes as an analog for the mathematics of heat flow. Using this hands-on, exploration-based approach, students develop an intuition for the mathematics of heatflow and learn about heat conduction and advection in the subduction zone environment.\nModule 2: “Subduction zone metamorphism” introduces students to the metamorphic rocks that form as the subducted slab descends and the mineral reactions that characterize subduction-related metamorphism. This module includes a suite of metamorphic rocks available for instructors to use in a lab, and exercises in which students compare pressure-temperature estimates obtained from metamorphic rocks to predictions from thermal models.\nModule 3: “Central American Arc Volcanoes, Petrology and Geochemistry” introduces students to basic concepts in igneous petrology using the Central American volcanic arc, a MARGINS Subduction Factory focus site, as an example. The module relates data from two different volcanoes – basaltic Cerro Negro (Nicaragua) and andesitic Ilopango (El Salvador) including hand sample observations and major element geochemistry – to explore processes of mantle and crustal melting and differentiation in arc volcanism.",

In this study, we performed field experiments under varied sediment supply rates, bedrock surface topographies and grain sizes. We then developed a physically-based model of the cover fraction as a function of the bedrock relative roughness (bedrock hydraulic-roughness over grain size), and tested the sensitivity of the model to changes in bedrock relative roughness and sediment supply.\nThe analytical results show that: 1) the cover fraction is smaller when the bedrock relative roughness is smaller; 2) when bedrock roughness is larger than alluvial roughness (clast-rough bedrock), the cover fraction gradually increases with sediment supply; 3) when bedrock roughness is smaller than alluvial roughness (clast-smooth bedrock), a fully exposed bedrock channel requires a relatively large sediment supply before any alluvial patch is formed, and as supply increases, rapidly transitions to a fully alluvial channel; 4) in the case of clast-smooth bedrock, the transition between a fully exposed bedrock channel and a fully alluvial channel has hysteresis.",

This fluvial sediment is excellent archives of the Himalayan exhumation, tectonic events and mountain building processes. This paper deals with the possible provenance of the middle Miocene to early Pleistocene fluvial sediments along the Karnali River section as well as added some knowledge of the Himalayan orogeny by the means of petrography and detrital zircon U-Pb dating under LA-ICP-MS. The petrographic studies shows the detritus grain of sandstones from the Karnali River section falls on ‘recycled orogeny’ field on QFL plots. The detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological study shows that the sediments were mostly derived from entire three litho units ;Tethys, Higher, and Lesser Himalaya during the time of deposition of Siwalik whereas the erosion process of Lesser Himalayan sediment increased after ~10 Ma. Overall, the combined studies show the mixed type of provenance as seen in the western Himalaya of India.\nKey words: U-Pb geochronology, Provenance, Siwalik Group",

Many methods have been proposed to model the infiltration process, such as Green-Ampt model (GAM) and Richard’s equation. The capillary pressure is often assumed to be constant in the GAM during the infiltration process, and the capillary pressure-saturation curve is assumed unique when applied in the Richard’s equation. However, studies have showed that the capillary pressure-saturation curve depends on the velocity of water movement. The velocity-dependent capillary is called dynamic capillary pressure. In this study, we performed a series of infiltration experiments in sand columns with different types of sands and under different boundary conditions. To show the effects of dynamic capillary pressure, we compared the results of the experiments with the simulations from the GAM and the modified GAM which takes the dynamic capillary pressure into account. We found that the dynamic effects are more significant during the infiltrations in sands with large grain size than the ones with small grain size. In addition, we also showed the dynamic effects of the capillary pressure during the oil infiltration into air-dry and pre-wetted sands.",

            "abstract": "We hypothesize that Quaternary deformation in the Mississippi Embayment in the Central U.S. has been accommodated by faults additional to the New Madrid seismic zone, and that the location of these faults is strongly controlled by paleotectonic structures inherited from the long tectonic history of the North American continent. To test this hypothesis, a 950 km-long high-resolution multichannel marine seismic reflection section was acquired along the Mississippi River to identify and characterize zones of Quaternary deformation in this region.\nHere we present three seismic profiles crossing the Alabama-Oklahoma Transform (AOT) that imaged significant faults. The northern profile images multiple faults striking northwest interpreted as the Arkansas River fault zone. The faults offset the reflectors from the tops of Cretaceous to the Eocene Cane River Formation and likely deform Quaternary strata in the upper 20-30 m. The central profile images a down-to-the-north normal fault, displacing the tops of Cretaceous and Paleocene Midway Group units by ~210 m and ~160 m, respectively, interpreted as the northern edge of the Monroe Uplift, a Late Cretaceous uplift caused by igneous intrusions. The southernmost profile shows a down-to-the-south displacement along a south dipping fault, which offsets the tops of the Cretaceous and the Paleocene-Eocene Wilcox Group ~125 m and ~32 m, respectively. Tilted reflectors in the uppermost Eocene and Quaternary strata suggest very recent activity of this fault.\nThe spatial coincidence of the imaged faults with the AOT strongly argues toward a reactivation of this paleotectonic structure in the present stress field. The new seismic data suggest that the AOT is a deformation zone, spanning as wide as ~80 km, that persisted as a weak zone of the lithosphere controlling the location of Tertiary and Quaternary deformation, as demonstrated by dipping reflectors immediately beneath the Mississippi River bottom, earthquake-induced sand blows, and near-surface faulting in the vicinities. The data also suggest that the AOT may have controlled reactivations of Triassic-Jurassic synrift basement structures, focusing the igneous intrusions during the Late Cretaceous.",

Based on this database, statistical investigations on SAIDs are carried out, including the occurrence location and probability, the solar cycle, seasonal, and diurnal variations, the correlations among SAIDs, field-aligned currents (FACs), and electron precipitation, and the correlations among SAIDs, mid-latitude ionospheric troughs (MITs) and plasmapause (PP). Statistical results show that SAIDs occur mostly at 60.1° invariant latitude and 2230 magnetic local time with a typical half width of 0.57°, move equatorward during high solar activities with large widths, and have two occurrence peaks in spring and fall equinoxes and two valleys in summer and winter solstices. The seasonal variation of SAID latitude has two valleys in spring and fall, and SAID width has a valley distribution with a minimum in summer. SAIDs exhibit a clear day-to-night difference in latitude. The diurnal variation of SAID width has a morning valley and an afternoon peak. The generation mechanism of SAID associated with the electron precipitation and the downward field-aligned current is also supported by the statistics. The polar boundaries of SAIDs overlap with the plasmapause and are more poleward than the polar boundaries of MITs. The arrangement of SAID, MIT, and PP is in such a pattern that PP is the most poleward, MIT is the most equatorward, and SAID is between MIT and PP.",

            "abstract": "Efficiency and equity have been at the center of the climate change policy making since the very first international environmental agreements on climate change, though over time how to implement these principles has taken different forms. Studies based on Integrated Assessment Models have also shown that the economic effort of achieving a 2 degree target in a cost-effective way would differ widely across regions (Tavoni et al. 2013) because of diverse economic and energy structure, baseline emissions, energy and carbon intensity. Policy instruments, such as a fully-fledged, global emission trading schemes can be used to pursuing efficiency and equity at the same time but the literature has analyzed the compensations required to redistribute only mitigation costs. However, most of these studies have neglected the potential impacts of climate change.\nIn this paper we use two integrated assessment models -FAIR and WITCH- to explore the 2°C policy space when accounting for climate change impacts. Impacts are represented via two different reduced forms equations, which despite their simplicity allows us exploring the key sensitivities- Our results show that in a 2 degree stabilization scenarios residual damages remain significant (see Figure 1) and that if you would like to compensate those as part of an equal effort scheme – this would lead to a different allocation than focusing on a mitigation based perspective only. The residual damages and adaptation costs are not equally distributed – and while we do not cover the full uncertainty space – with 2 different models and 2 sets of damage curves we are still able to show quite similar results in terms of vulnerable regions and the relative position of the different scenarios. Therefore, accounting for the residual damages and the associated adaptation costs on top of the mitigation burden increases and redistributes the full burden of total climate change.",

            "abstract": "The work had been funded by NASA HQ's office of Cryospheric Sciences Program.\nRecent observations of the Arctic have shown that sea ice has diminished drastically, consequently impacting the environment in the Arctic and beyond. Certain factors such as atmospheric anomalies, wind forces, temperature increase, and change in the distribution of cold and warm waters contribute to the sea ice reduction. However current measurement capabilities lack the accuracy, temporal sampling, and spatial coverage required to effectively quantify each contributing factor and to identify other missing factors. Addressing the need for new measurement capabilities for the new Arctic regime, we propose a game-changing in-situ Arctic-wide Distributed Mobile Monitoring system called Moball-buoy Network. Moball-buoy Network consists of a number of wind-propelled self-powered inflatable spheres referred to as Moball-buoys. The Moball-buoys are self-powered. They use their novel mechanical control and energy harvesting system to use the abundance of wind in the Arctic for their controlled mobility and energy harvesting. They are equipped with an array of low-power low-mass sensors and micro devices able to measure a wide range of environmental factors such as the ice conditions, chemical species wind vector patterns, cloud coverage, air temperature and pressure, electromagnetic fields, surface and subsurface water conditions, short- and long-wave radiations, bathymetry, and anthropogenic factors such as pollutions. The stop-and-go motion capability, using their novel mechanics, and the heads up cooperation control strategy at the core of the proposed distributed system enable the sensor network to be reconfigured dynamically according to the priority of the parameters to be monitored. The large number of Moball-buoys with their ground-based, sea-based, satellite and peer-to-peer communication capabilities would constitute a wireless mesh network that provides an interface for a global control system. This control system will ensure arctic-wide coverage, will optimize Moball-buoys monitoring efforts according to their available resources and the priority of local areas of high scientific value within the Arctic region. Moball-buoy Network is expected to be the first robust and persistent Arctic-wide environment monitoring system capable of providing reliable readings in near real time",

            "abstract": "Heatwaves are a common feature of Australia’s climate, however their frequency has increased since the mid-20th Century, with trends accelerating since the 1970s. Future projections from climate models indicate that such trends will continue throughout the 21st Century as anthropogenic forcing on the climate system rises. Increasing trends in heatwave intensity and duration over Australia will also result from rises in anthropogenic forcing.\nWhile overall trends in heatwaves are responsive to anthropogenic forcing, a common question often asked by policy makers is “did climate change cause this individual heatwave?” This is an inherently difficult question to answer since any one event is caused by an interaction of meteorological systems, climate variability phenomena, and the background climate state. What can be answered, however, is “did climate change cause and increase in the likelihood of this heatwave?” Employing the method of Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) is pertinent in answering such a question.\nIn this study, we employ the FAR method on a 21-member ensemble of the Community Earth System model, a fully coupled model where each realization differs only in their initial conditions. This allows for a comprehensive sampling of internal climate variability that could plausibly arise under the given forcing. Heatwaves are measured using a predefined framework, accounting for heatwave intensity, frequency, duration, timing and spatial extent. The control run is used to estimate the influence of natural variability only, and we make use of the 21-member historical (1955-2005) and RCP8.5 (2006-2100) ensembles to estimate previous, current, and future FAR values and associated return periods.\nOur results explore FAR analyses on each separate heatwave characteristic at the continental scale, and for southeast Australia. We find that 4 out of 5 heatwave characteristics are already larger than expected from internal variability alone, with FAR values rising considerably throughout the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Steep U-shaped valleys produced by glaciation are eroded by rockfall and pose a risk to humans. Our knowledge of the postglacial erosion of these valleys is limited. In this study, calcareous cliffs covering an area of 5.2 km² are investigated in the deglaciated Lauterbrunnen Valley, Switzerland. Terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scans were collected during 9 field campaigns over 18 months to provide a continuous coverage of most of the valley walls. Results indicate a total of 122 rockfalls with volumes ranging between 0.06±0.01 to 119.34±1.07 m³. These events suggest average cliff retreat rates of 0.04 and 0.08 mm/yr for the east and west valley walls, respectively. Different size groups of rockfall events were correlated with environmental factors (e.g., freeze-thaw cycles (temperature), precipitation and seismicity) using a linear regression with variable lag times of 0-6 months. The highest correlation factor (0.6) is observed for freeze-thaw cycles and rockfall events smaller than 1 m³ with a two month lag time between temperature extremes and rockfall. Frequency-magnitude relationships for rockfall events were calculated to predict less frequent larger rockfall events that did not occur during the observation period. Power law exponents of 0.72, 1.62 and 0.67±0.07 were calculated using linear regression and maximum likelihood approaches, respectively. Calculated exponents are similar to other calcareous rock studies in different settings conducted over different observation durations. In comparison to these studies, we find exponents are more influenced by lithology rather than geomorphic setting (e.g., sea cliff, non-glaciated catchments, deglaciated valley).",

We investigate the spatial drivers of the atmospheric growth rate and the processes controlling them over the exceptional period of 2010-2011. This period was marked by a marked shift from an El Nino to La Nina period resulting in historically high sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Atlantic leading to serious droughts in the Amazon. However, in 2011, unusual precipitation in Australia was linked to gross primary productivity anomalies in semi-arid regions. We use satellite observations of CO2, CO, and solar induced fluorescence assimilated into the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Project (CMS-Flux) to attribute the atmospheric growth rate to global, spatially resolved fluxes. This system is based upon observationally-constrained “bottom-up” estimates from the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDAS), the ECCO2­-Darwin physical and biogeochemical adjoint ocean state estimation system, and CASA-GFED3 land-surface biogeochemical model. The system is used to compute regional tropical and extra-tropical fluxes and quantify the role of biomass burning and gross primary productivity in controlling those fluxes.",

            "abstract": "As development proceeds in the high latitudes, information about interactions between urban influences and the thickness of the active layer above permafrost becomes vital, particularly given the possibility of increasing temperatures accompanying climate change. Permafrost characteristics are often mapped at small geographical scales (i.e., over large areas), at low resolution, and without extensive field validation. Although maps of active-layer thickness (ALT) have been created for areas of relatively undisturbed terrain, this has rarely been done within urbanized areas, even though ALT is a critical factor in the design of roads, buildings, pipelines, and other elements of infrastructure. The need for detailed maps of ALT is emphasized in work on potential hazards in permafrost regions associated with global warming scenarios. \nNorthern Alaska is a region considered to be at moderate to high risk for thaw-induced damage under climatic warming. The Native Village of Barrow (71°17’44”N; 156°45’ 59”W), the economic, transportation, and administrative hub of the North Slope Borough, is the northernmost community in the USA, and the largest native settlement in the circum-Arctic. A winter urban heat island in Barrow, earlier snowmelt in the village, and dust deposition downwind of gravel pads and roads are all urban effects that could increase ALT. A recent empirical study documented a 17 to 41 cm difference in ALT between locations in the village of Barrow and surrounding undeveloped tundra, even in similar land-cover classes.\nWe mapped ALT in the Barrow Peninsula, with particular attention to contrasts between the urbanized village and relatively undisturbed tundra in the nearby Barrow Environmental Observatory. The modified Berggren solution, an advanced analytic solution to the general Stefan problem of calculating frost and thaw depth, was used in a geographic context to map ALT over the 150 km² area investigated in the Barrow Urban Heat Island Study. The Berggren solution performed well for estimating mean values of ALT in rural and urban land-cover classes. Compared to the Stefan solution, it provides highly accurate results and is promising for use in urban environments as a vehicle for mapping fine-scale variations in ALT.",

Independent of different water mass properties planktic carbon isotope records (13C/12C) from across the Nordic Seas show a rather consistent pattern over the course of the Holocene. We present data from a number of sediment cores obtained in the central Nordic Seas which show that carbon isotope values were increasing since the early Holocene. They reached a maximum level between 7 and 6 ka and remained relatively stable thereafter. Ca. 3 ka they rapidly decreased. Benthic carbon isotope records from the central Nordic Seas, close to the present-day convection center of the Greenland Sea, reveal a similar trend as the planktic records. Although of lower amplitude, these bottom water data reflect the development of the regional deep convection in this region. A comparison with other proxy records and modelling results supports this presumption. While the early to late Holocene trend apparently reflect the developing deep convection after the last glacial period, the sudden decrease in the convection strength around 3 ka was most probably triggered by a strong solar irradiance minimum. This, combined with low insolation, caused an expansion of the sea ice over the convection center and enhanced stratification, thereby strengthening the entire halocline system.",

            "abstract": "An accurate representation of the climatology of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system in global climate models (GCMs) has strong implications to the reliability of projected climate change inferred by these models. Our previous efforts have identified substantial biases of ocean surface wind stress that are fairly common in two generations of the CMIP models, relative to QuikSCAT climatology. One of the potential causes of the CMIP model biases is the missing representation of large frozen precipitating hydrometeors (i.e., cloud snow) in all CMIP3 and most CMIP5 models, which has not been investigated. We examine the impacts of cloud snow on the radiation and atmospheric circulation, air-sea fluxes, and explore the implications to common biases in CMIP models using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)-coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM) to perform sensitivity experiments with and without cloud snow radiation effects. This study focuses on the impacts of cloud snow in CESM on ocean surface wind stress and air-sea heat fluxes, as well as their relationship with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and ocean potential temperatures in the Pacific sector. It is found that inclusion of the cloud snow parameterization in CESM reduces the surface wind stress and ocean temperatures including SSTs biases in the tropical and mid-latitude Pacific. These differences in SSTs and wind stress with and without the cloud snow parameterization can be partly attributed to the wind stress differences and the related influence on vertical mixing in the ocean, but cannot be explained by the differences in net air-sea heat fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Models of microbial dynamics coupled to solute transport in aquifers typically require the introduction of a bacterial carrying capacity term to prevent excessive microbial growth close to substrate-injection boundaries. The factors controlling this carrying capacity, however, are not fully understood. Most explanations for the occurrence of a carrying capacity discussed are based on the assumption of a bottom-up control of groundwater ecosystems. An alternative explanation is based on top-down control. Our model considers substrate, bacteria and higher trophic levels, such as grazers or bacteriophages. The dissolved substrate is transported with water flow whereas the biomasses of bacteria and grazers are considered essentially immobile. The one-dimensional reactive transport model also accounts for substrate dispersion and a random walk of grazers influenced by the bacteria concentration. The grazers grow on the bacteria, leading to a negative feedback on the bacteria concentration which may limit the turnover of the substrate.\nA single retentostat model with Monod kinetics of bacterial growth and a second-order grazing shows that the system oscillates but approaches a stable steady state with non-zero concentrations of substrate, bacteria, and grazers. The steady-state concentration of the bacteria biomass is independent of the substrate concentration in the inflow. When coupling several retentostats in a series to mimic a groundwater column, the steady-state bacteria concentrations remain at a constant level over a significant travel distance. The results show that grazing is a possible explanation of the carrying capacity, provided that there is enough substrate to sustain bacteria and grazers.",

            "abstract": "It is puzzling why slow earthquakes occur in hot subduction zones only. We study numerically how antigorite dehydration coupled with slip-induced dilatancy and thermal pressurization affects rupture behavior to solve the above puzzle. Recent related studies actually suggest importance of antigorite dehydration. We assume faulting in a 2D thermoporoelastic medium. The mineral reaction is assumed using a first order Arrhenius law. Nondimensional parameters important in the modeling are Su, Su’ and X’ according to our former study; Su’ and Su are proportional to permeability and increase rate of slip-induced porosity. X’ denotes volume change induced by the reaction. Our calculation shows that moment release rate and fault tip growth rate are smaller for larger values of Su, smaller values of X’ or smaller values of Su’. These two rates are found to be negligibly small compared with the solutions for the dynamic elasticity analysis when Su>1 and X’<0 are satisfied. Slow sustained fault growth occurs for such values of Su and X’. This suggests that Su>1 and X’<0 are satisfied at hot subduction zones; the condition X’<0 is consistent with the reaction expected at hot subduction zones. In cold subduction zones however, antigorite dehydration will occur at depth greater than 60km, with -0.1<X’<0. Our calculation shows that fault growth rate accelerates to the shear wave speed soon after the rupture nucleation for any values of X’ when Su<1 is assumed. However, the moment release rates for negative values of X’ are found to be a few orders smaller than expected by the dynamic elasticity analysis. This occurs because the slip velocity evolution is more pulse-like for larger values of |X’|. In such way, antigorite dehydration could also be the source of a non-negligible fraction of intermediate depth seismicity. The condition Su<1 will be due to the fact that slip-dilatancy is more prohibited at larger depth.",

Both SWOT and AirSWOT employ a Ka-band interferometer to map water surface elevations and extent, but the ability of Ka-band radar to discriminate shorelines and flooded vegetation is not well known. Presumed bright returns from moist soils surrounding surface water bodies have also been speculated to confound interpretation of SWOT/AirSWOT data. The Piute Ponds are a dynamic area of constantly changing water conditions, providing a convenient test site for field studies to assess open water, dry shorelines, vegetation edges, islands, flooded vegetation and soil moisture in conjunction with AirSWOT backscatter and visible/near-infrared camera imagery. Islands were characterized into dry islands and flooded vegetation stands including species such as bulrush (Scripus acutus) and tamarisk (Tammarix ramosissima). Results demonstrate that full water extent can be determined by near-range backscatter returns which are strong for both open water and flooded vegetation. Far-range backscatter returns over open water were unreliable for flooded extent. Comparing near-range and far-range backscatter results to the soil moisture transect shows correlation, however as soil moisture increases, discriminating between wet sediment and water becomes difficult. In sum, first results suggest near-return backscatter results prove most useful in distinguishing open water from non-water, with a strong correlation between soil moisture and backscatter returns.",

            "abstract": "The most important current driver of biodiversity loss is the conversion of natural habitats for human land uses, mostly for the purpose of food production. However, by causing this biodiversity loss, food production is eroding the very same ecosystem services (e.g. pollination and soil fertility) that it depends on. We therefore need to adopt more wildlife-friendly agricultural practices that can contribute to preserving biodiversity. Organic farming has been shown to typically host higher biodiversity than conventional farming. But how is the biodiversity benefit of organic management dependent on the landscape context farms are situated in? To implement organic farming as an effective means for protecting biodiversity and enhancing ecosystem services we need to understand better under what conditions organic management is most beneficial for species.\nWe conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to answer this question, compiling the most comprehensive database to date of studies that monitored biodiversity in organic vs. conventional fields. We also collected information about the landscape surrounding these fields from remote sensing products. Our database consists of 348 study sites across North America and Europe.\nOur analysis shows that organic management can improve biodiversity in agricultural fields substantially. It is especially effective at preserving biodiversity in homogeneous landscapes that are structurally simplified and dominated by either cropland or pasture. In heterogeneous landscapes conventional agriculture might instead already hold high biodiversity, and organic management does not appear to provide as much of a benefit for species richness as in simplified landscapes.\nOur results suggest that strategies to maintain biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services should include a combination of pristine natural habitats, wildlife-friendly farming systems like organic farming, and high-yielding conventional systems, interspersed in structurally diverse, heterogeneous landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Continuous observations of seismic events and seafloor movements were made from May 2013 to March 2014 atop the steeply rising morphological unit (often called the lower trench slope) located about 50 km landward of the trench axis and 50 km seaward of the epicenter of the great 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, where the seafloor is locally dipping to the southeast at 14-15° .\nMeasurements were made with a new Acceleration Ocean Bottom Seismometer (AOBS) system using a triaxial array of nano-resolution accelerometers having ranges of 20 m/sec2, parts-per-billion sensitivity and good long-term stability. Observations were compared to a nearby system that included a broadband seismometer, differential pressure gauge and ocean bottom tiltmeter.\nThe AOBS measures seafloor tilting as a change of acceleration in the absolute gravity field and the records show repeated occurrences of approximately unidirectional tilting either to the northwest or southeast. Rapid (tens of second) tilting was always triggered by strong seismic shaking, including a tilt of 0.0016 radians triggered by an Mw7.1 earthquake 145 km distant from the station. Slow (hours) tilting occurs with much smaller amplitude but in a similar dip direction and is most often recovered by opposite tilting at a slower rate. Records of the nearby tiltmeter in their unsaturated cases showed consistent tilt motions.\nTraditional broadband seismometers and tiltmeters do not have the range to measure strong seismic events and traditional strong motion sensors do not have the sensitivity or stability to make good long-term geodetic measurements. The AOBS can measure both the statically invariant 1g Earth’s gravity vector and the higher frequency components associated with strong seismic shaking. This invariance, in spite of large offsets in each component axis due to tilts, indicates that the observed offsets are real signals of trench slope-related processes. These observations demonstrate the usefulness of AOBS for high-resolution measurements of submarine earthquakes, tilts, slow-slip and perhaps even longer-term events.",

            "abstract": "Recent summer warming has now raised the equilibrium line above almost all ice caps on Baffin Island, resulting in surface lowering and marginal recession everywhere. As cold-based ice recedes it frequently exposes in situ tundra plants that were living at the time ice expanded across the site. Radiocarbon dates for each plant records when cold summers dropped regional snowline below the site, killing the plants, and snowline remained below the site until the collection date. The kill dates also represent the last time that the climate was warm enough to expose the sampling location. Seventy-six vegetation samples collected in 2013 from the Penny Ice Cap region have been dated, with significant age populations at ~0.5, 1.8, 2.3, and 3.6 ka. The absence of ages around ~1, 2, 3, 4.5, and 5.5 ka suggest periods of either no snowline depression or stability. Sixteen vegetation samples returned ages of >45 ka (2 revisited sites from 2010, 14 new). It is postulated that these radiocarbon dead samples were last exposed during the last interglaciation (~120 ka), the last time climate was as warm as present. In addition to plant collections, bedrock exposures at the ice margins were sampled for 26Al/10Be cosmogenic nuclide dating. Seven samples from and around the Penny Ice cap have returned maximum exposure ages from ~ 0.6-0.9 ma and total histories of ~0.6-1.5 ma. In general, samples from the larger Penny Ice Cap exhibited lower amounts of exposure (~20% of total history) than those samples from smaller, localized ice caps (~55%). Radiocarbon dead sites north of the Penny Ice cap experienced significantly more exposure over their lifetimes than their counterparts east of the Penny Ice cap, suggesting significant differences in local and regional land ice fluctuations over the last 2 million years. Utilizing both the method of in situ moss and 26Al/10Be dating provides new insight into both the recent activity and long-term evolution of ice on Baffin Island. In particular these new data help to shed light on how late Holocene coolings affect both large and small ice bodies and how this behavior is represented in the longer-term burial/exposure record contained within the rock surface.",

            "abstract": "A long-term Neoglacial cooling trend, beginning ~6 ka, is well documented across the Arctic and correlates with a monotonic decline in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. However, paleoclimate proxy records point to decadal- to millennial-scale variability superimposed on overall cooling. This climate variability is reflected in the fluctuations of Arctic glaciers over the course of several millennia. The most recent Neoglacial advance, the Little Ice Age (LIA; ~1275–1850 AD), was generally more extensive than pre-LIA advances and thus destroyed most evidence of previous advances. As such, the timing and extent of earlier Neoglacial advances are not well constrained. However, several extant glaciers on Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, are fronted by nested ice-cored moraine sequences in which multiple pre-LIA moraines are preserved. We have generated absolute ages on moraine sequences for Snow Creek and Throne Glaciers using 10Be in moraine boulders. Nine 10Be ages from the two most distal moraine crests at Snow Creek Glacier range from ~1.8 ka to ~5.7 ka, and twelve ages from the two most distal moraine crests at Throne Glacier range from ~1.1 ka to ~4.6 ka. The wide spread of exposure ages in these settings is likely due to the degradation of moraine ice cores and the disturbance of older moraines by younger readvances. Because these processes result in the exposure of new clasts on the moraine post-emplacement, the oldest ages in these datasets likely provide the best estimates for the earliest Neoglacial advances. These data also indicate that in some settings, early Neoglacial alpine glacier advances reached similar extents as their LIA maxima, possibly due to large ice-cored moraines impeding LIA advances. Glacier modeling efforts and complementary lacustrine sediment records will help to unravel the complex Neoglacial history in this region.",

            "abstract": "\"Earth Girl 2: Preparing for the Tsunami\" is an interactive game about making strategic decisions that can directly increase the survival rate in coastal communities during earthquake and tsunami scenarios. Earth Girl is the host and guide in this casual strategy game with social impact, and the player is the protagonist.\nThe game was developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists and game artists at the Earth Observatory of Singapore. Earth Girl 2 is based on real-life situations, with an emphasis on learning preparedness and survival skills. It was inspired by the kids who live in coastal communities throughout Asia, and by the stories told by survivors of recent tsunamis.\nThe action takes place in four main areas: the Market, the Map, the Toolbox, and two dozen game levels with a variety of evacuation scenarios. The gameplay encourages proactive exploration and discovery of these scenarios, with Earth Girl providing knowledge, tips and feedback throughout the game. The basic game play includes: learning about tsunami hazards by talking to people at the market, choosing tools based on a budget, exploring the site and making strategic decisions, and learning from watching the simulation. The level of success of players in this game depends on their strategic decisions which is somewhat tied to their level of interaction with the virtual community. The game is currently being tested with children in Southeast Asian communities and is scheduled for release in late 2014.\nThe presentation will demonstrate aspects of the game (played on an iPad connected to the projector), and will describe some of the challenges and solutions encountered by the interdisciplinary team.",

            "abstract": "Miyake-jima is an active basaltic stratovolcano that is located 200km south of Tokyo, Japan. Its eruption event in 2000 was remarkable in that the large caldera was formed at the summit in approximately one month. During the caldera forming stage, very-long-period (VLP) seismic pulse waves with a duration of about 50-s that were accompanied by the step-like inflation were repeatedly recorded. Based on the broadband seismometer data, the piston model is proposed in which a vertical piston of solid materials in the conduit is intermittently sucked into the magma chamber located 3-5 km beneath the edific. In this study, we used the kinematic displacements from the continuous GPS observation to obtain additonal insights on the source mechanism of the pulse waves.\nWe calculated the kinematic displacements of 15 GPS stations on Miyake-jima that were in operation at that time at 30 sec interval. Then we extracted the displacements associated with each event using 20-hour time window centered at the occurrence of the event, and stacked the whole time series to obtain mean displacement time series.\n The obtained time series contain: 1) step-like displacements associated with the pulse waves, 2) exponential decay following the events with time constant of approximately half-day, and 3) steady linear displacements indicating continuous contraction of the edifice. The type one displacements can be attributed to the simultaneous inflation of an mogi-type spherical pressure source located at the depth of 3.6 km under the edifice, and the opening of the nearby vertical dike whose top is at the depth of 2.3 km. The type two displacements can be interpreted as the pressure adjustment at the type one source by the outflow of the magma driven by the pressure difference between the type one source and surrounding area. The type three displacements can be interpreted as the steady outflow of the magma from the type one source.\n The above results support the ``piston model’’ for the source of the pulse waves. However, it seems that the pressure increases by the collapse of the piston are not adjusted by the steady magma outflow as the ``piston model’’ suggests but by the pressure-driven magma outflow. The steady magma outflow instead seems to be responsible for the long-term shrinkage of the edifice observed at that period.",

However, for the Hellinger software [\nKirkwood et al., 1999\n] to produce stable results, we find that the input data must be abundant and spatially well distributed. Although magnetic anomalies and fracture zone data have been increasingly abundant since the 1960s, some parts of the globe remain too sparsely explored to provide enough data for the Hellinger code to provide satisfactory rotations.\nIn this poster, we present new software to calculate the paleopositions of tectonic plates using magnetic anomalies and fracture zone data. Our method is based on the theory of plate tectonics as introduced by [Bullard et al., 1965] and [Morgan, 1968], which states that ridge segments (ie. magnetic lineations) and fracture zones are at right angles to each other. In order to test our software, we apply it to a region of the world where climatic conditions hinder the acquisition of magnetic data: the Southwest Pacific, between New Zealand and Antarctica from breakup time to chron 20 (c43Ma).\nBullard, E., J.

            "abstract": "Modern climate models are limited to coarse-resolution representations of large-scale ocean circulation that rely on parameterizations for mesoscale eddies. The effects of eddies are typically introduced by relating subgrid eddy fluxes to the resolved gradients of buoyancy or other tracers, where the proportionality is, in general, governed by an eddy transport tensor. The symmetric part of the tensor, which represents the diffusive effects of mesoscale eddies, is universally treated isotropically in general circulation models. Thus, only a single parameter, namely the eddy diffusivity, is used at each spatial and temporal location to impart the influence of mesoscale eddies on the resolved flow. However, the diffusive processes that the parameterization approximates, such as shear dispersion, potential vorticity barriers, oceanic turbulence, and instabilities, typically have strongly anisotropic characteristics. Generalizing the eddy diffusivity tensor for anisotropy extends the number of parameters to three: a major diffusivity, a minor diffusivity, and the principal axis of alignment. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) with the anisotropic eddy parameterization is used to test various choices for the newly introduced parameters, which are motivated by observations and the eddy transport tensor diagnosed from high resolution simulations. Simply setting the ratio of major to minor diffusivities to a value of five globally, while aligning the major axis along the flow direction, improves biogeochemical tracer ventilation and reduces global temperature and salinity biases. These effects can be improved even further by parameterizing the anisotropic transport mechanisms in the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is the water stored on and below the land surface, which includes snow, ice, soil moisture, groundwater, and surface water. TWS is a fundamental component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle given that precipitation (P) reaching the land surface is balanced by evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and the change of terrestrial water storage (TWSC) [P=R+ET+TWSC]. As an integrated measure of surface and groundwater availability, TWS has significant implications for water resources management. The Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas (TP), which are characterized by high elevation, extensive glaciers, permafrost, snowpack, and mountain lakes, is known as the “roof of the world”, the Third Pole, and also the water towers of Asia. Studies of meteorological observations, reanalysis data, and ice core records have suggested a warming trend over the TP in recent decades. Along with the rising temperature, the detected glacier melt, permafrost degradation, and lakes changes in the TP will thus affect the water storage changes and the hydrological cycle in the area. In this study, we examine the spatial-temporal variation of TWS change over the TP through the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and the VIC land surface hydrologic model during 2004-2013. Meanwhile, the spatial-temporal characteristics of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and snow cover as well as the distribution of glaciers, lakes, and frozen soil are analyzed to examine the factors that might be responsible for the TWS changes in the TP. The objective of our study is to achieve a better understanding of the water balance change in the TP under the warming climate. Our work could provide a basis for conservation strategies and policy decisions for the fragile, invaluable eco-hydrological environment in the Tibet Plateau.",

            "abstract": "Cumulus cloud populations remain at least partially unresolved in present-day numerical simulations of global weather and climate, and accordingly their impact on the larger-scale flow has to be represented through parameterization. Various methods have been developed over the years, ranging in complexity from the early bulk models relying on a single plume to more recent approaches that attempt to reconstruct the underlying probability density functions, such as statistical schemes and multiple plume approaches. Most of these \"classic\" methods capture key aspects of cumulus cloud populations, and have been successfully implemented in operational weather and climate models. However, the ever finer discretizations of operational circulation models, driven by advances in the computational efficiency of supercomputers, is creating new problems for existing sub-grid schemes. Ideally, a sub-grid scheme should automatically adapt its impact on the resolved scales to the dimension of the grid-box within which it is supposed to act. It can be argued that this is only possible when i) the scheme is aware of the range of scales of the processes it represents, and ii) it can distinguish between contributions as a function of size. How to conceptually represent this knowledge of scale in existing parameterization schemes remains an open question that is actively researched.\nThis study considers a relatively new class of models for sub-grid transport in which ideas from the field of population dynamics are merged with the concept of multi plume modelling. More precisely, a multiple mass flux framework for moist convective transport is formulated in which the ensemble of plumes is created in “size-space”. It is argued that thus resolving the underlying size-densities creates opportunities for introducing scale-awareness and scale-adaptivity in the scheme. The behavior of an implementation of this framework in the Eddy Diffusivity Mass Flux (EDMF) model, named ED(MF)n, is examined for a standard case of subtropical marine shallow cumulus. We ask if a system of multiple independently resolved plumes is able to automatically create the vertical profile of bulk (mass) flux at which the sub-grid scale transport balances the imposed larger-scale forcings in the cloud layer.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols have been recently paid attention more in environmental research due to their negative effects on air quality, public health, and climate change. The aerosols contain approximately >20–50% carbonaceous components such as organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) (or elemental carbon [EC]) derived from organic compounds, biomass burning, and incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of atmospheric aerosols are strongly dependent on the carbonaceous components. In particular, the BC could significantly affect the regional air quality in the northeastern Asia, because China is one of the foremost BC emission country in the world. Previous studies have mainly focused on the quantification and source identification for carbonaceous aerosols. However, understanding of physical and chemical properties for the carbonaceous aerosols related to environmental contamination and toxicity was still incomplete due to analytical difficulties. This study is addressed to evaluate the contribution of carbonaceous aerosols to air pollution through the surface, mass spectroscopic, and electron microscopic analyses, and determination of chemical composition and structure using the air particulate matter (PM2.5 and >PM2.5) samples.",

            "abstract": "The last deglaciation was marked by intervals of rapid climatic fluctuations accompanied by glacial advances and retreats along the eastern edge of the Laurentide ice sheet. The most severe of these events, the Younger Dryas cold reversal, was accompanied by the major detrital carbonate (DC) event generally referred to as “Heinrich event 0” (H0) in the westernmost and southern Labrador Sea. A detrital carbonate layer was observed in a high resolution marine sediment record from southern Newfoundland and the onset of the event was dated to 11,600 ± 70 cal. yrs. BP (local ΔR = 140 yrs.). A variety of different proxies was applied to investigate the transport mechanisms for deposition of the layer and provenance of the carbonates. Elevated concentrations of dolomite and calcite based on quantitative X-ray diffraction measurements, combined with the presence of several mature petrogenic biomarkers limit the source of the H0 detrital input to Palaeozoic carbonate outcrops in north-eastern Canada. The event is attributed to the rapid ice retreat from the Hudson Strait directly following the warming at the onset of the Holocene. Based on additional proxy data published earlier from the same record, the event succeeded the early Holocene resumption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), indicating that the Hudson Strait meltwater event had probably no significant impact on the AMOC. The detrital carbonate layer can be found in other marine sediment records along the Labrador Current pathway, from Hudson Strait to the Grand Banks and the southern Newfoundland slope. By using the onset of deposition of the carbonates as a time-synchronous marker, the DC layer has great potential for improving marine chronologies of late glacial age in the region and evaluating spatial variations in ΔR values.",

            "abstract": "Coastal foredunes lose and gain sand through marine and aeolian processes, but coastal-evolution models that can accurately predict both wave-driven dune erosion and wind-blown dune growth are non-existing. This is, together with a limited understanding of coastal aeolian process dynamics, due to the lack of adequate field data sets from which erosion and supply volumes can be studied simultaneously. Here, we quantify coastal foredune dynamics using nine topographic surveys performed near Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands, between September 2011 and March 2014 using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The approximately 0.75-km long study site comprises a 30-100 m wide sandy beach and a 20-25 m high foredune, of which the higher parts are densely vegetated with European marram grass. Using a structure-from-motion workflow, the 200-500 photographs taken during each UAV flight were processed into a point cloud, from which a geo-referenced digital surface model with a 0.25 x 0.25 m resolution was subsequently computed. Our data set contains two dune-erosion events, including that due to storm Xaver (December 2013), which caused one of the highest surge levels in the southern North Sea region for the last decades. Dune erosion during both events varied alongshore from the destruction of embryonic dunes on the upper beach to the slumping of the entire dune face. During the first storm (January 2012), erosion volumes ranged from 5 m3/m in the (former) embryonic dune field to over 40 m3/m elsewhere. During the subsequent 11 (spring – autumn) months, the foredune accreted by (on average) 8 m3/m, again with substantial alongshore variability (0 - 20 m3/m). Intriguingly, volume changes during the 2012-2013 winter were minimal. We will compare the observed aeolian supply rates with model predictions and discuss reasons for their temporal variability.

            "abstract": "In 2012 March the Sun exhibited extraordinary activities. In particular, the active region NOAA AR 11429 emitted a series of large coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which were imaged by STEREO as it rotated with the Sun from the east to west. These sustained eruptions are expected to generate a global shell of disturbed material sweeping through the heliosphere. A cluster of shocks and interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) were observed near the Earth, and are propagated outward from 1 AU using an MHD model. The transient streams interact with each other, which erases memory of the source and results in a large merged interaction region (MIR) with a preceding shock. The MHD model predicts that the shock and MIR would reach 120 AU around 2013 April 22, which agrees well with the period of radio emissions and the time of a transient disturbance in galactic cosmic rays detected by Voyager 1. These results are important for understanding the \"fate\" of CMEs in the outer heliosphere and provide confidence that the heliopause is located around 120 AU from the Sun.",

            "abstract": "Plastic deformation of minerals in the Earth’s interior is controlled by diffusion creep (including Coble creep and Nabarro-Herring creep) and dislocation creep. Diffusion creep makes Newtonian rheology and seismic isotropy, whereas dislocation creep makes non-Newtonian rheology and seismic anisotropy. Determination of the dominant creep mechanism in the Earth’s interior is thus essential to understand the geodynamics. Experimental deformation studies on olivine suggested that the dominant creep mechanism in the upper mantle changes from dislocation to diffusion creep at 200-300 km depth [1, 2]. However, those studies may misunderstood the creep rate due to experimental difficulties [3, 4]. It is necessary to independently examine the creep mechanisms in the upper mantle.\nCoble diffusion creep in olivine is controlled by Si grain-boundary diffusion, whereas dislocation and Nabarro-Herring diffusion creeps are controlled by Si lattice diffusion. We have already reported Si lattice diffusion rate in iron-free olivine [3, 4]. In this study, we systematically measured Si grain boundary diffusion rate in forserite aggregates at 1 atm –13 GPa, 1100-1600 K, and bulk water content from <1 up to ~500 wt. ppm using multi-anvil apparatus and ambient pressure gas-mixing furnace. The diffusion profiles, water contents before and after diffusion, and microstructures of the samples were analyzed by SIMS, FT-IR, and TEM, respectively.\nThe activation energy, activation volume, and water content exponent for Si grain boundary diffusion are found to be 245±10 kJ/mol, 1.8±0.2 cm3/mol, and 0.22±0.05, respectively. Our results suggest that 1) pressure does not change the dominant creep mechanism; 2) Coble creep dominates at low temperature whereas dislocation or Nabarro-Herring creep does at high temperature; (3) water effect on olivine creeps are all small. Dislocation creep dominates the entire asthenosphere, namely, the creep mechanism transition at 200-300 km depth does not occur.\n[1] Karato &Wu (1993), Science 760, 771-778.\n[2] Hirth & Kohlstedt (2003) Geophys.

            "abstract": "We present three-dimensional fully kinetic and electromagnetic simulations of the solar wind interaction with lunar crustal magnetic anomalies (LMAs). Using the implicit particle-in-cell code iPic3D, we confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly impacting the lunar surface forming a mini-magnetosphere, as suggested by spacecraft observations and theory. In contrast to earlier MHD and hybrid simulations, the fully kinetic nature of iPic3D allows to investigate the space charge effects and in particular the electron dynamics dominating the near-surface lunar plasma environment. We describe the general picture of the interaction of a dipole model centered just below the lunar surface under various solar wind and plasma conditions, and focus afterwards on the ion and electron kinetic behavior of the system. It is shown that the configuration is dominated by electron motion, because the LMA scale size is small with respect to the gyroradius of the solar wind ions. The dominant LMA interaction mechanism is also highly dependent on the solar wind and IMF conditions. Driven by strong pressure anisotropies, the mini-magnetosphere is also unstable over time, leading to only temporal shielding of the surface underneath. Our work opens new frontiers of research toward a deeper understanding of LMAs and is ideally suited to be compared with field or particle observations from spacecraft such as Kaguya (SELENE), Lunar Prospector or ARTEMIS. The ability to evaluate the implications for future lunar exploration as well as lunar science in general hinges on a better understanding of LMAs.\nThis research has received funding from the European Commission’s FP7 Program with the grant agreement SWIFF (project 2633430, swiff.eu) and EHEROES (project 284461, www.eheroes.eu).

            "abstract": "The Himalaya-Tibet orogen hosts some of the largest modern climate gradients on Earth. Quaternary climate change between glacial and interglacial cycles is an important driver for landscape and ecological change in the region. A common observational approach for documenting climate change is the measurement of modern precipitation, and terrestrial archives of, δ18O. In this study, we investigate variations in Mid Holocene (MH) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate and precipitation δ18O (δ18Op). Paleoclimate model results for 3 time slices are considered including: Pre-industrial, MH and LGM conditions. These experiments bridge spatial and temporal timescales of environmental change over the plateau and provide a means for interpreting observational data sets.\nClimate and precipitation δ18O (δ18Op) variations over the Plateau are investigated using an atmospheric general circulation model equipped with isotope tracking capabilities (ECHAM5-wiso). Simulations are conducted at a resolution of 1.1°´1.1°, with 31 vertical levels (T106 L31). Pre-industrial boundary conditions come from AMIP2. MH and LGM boundary conditions come from a coupled atmosphere-ocean model ECHO-G, with vegetation cover from PMIP (http://pmip2.lsce.ipsl.fr).\nResults are presented in comparison to pre-industrial conditions. More specifically, during the MH surface temperatures were ~0.5 C higher on the central and western plateau and ~0.5 C cooler across the Himalaya. Mean annual MH precipitation was <100 mm/yr higher on the plateau and 300-500 mm/yr higher across the Himalaya. MH δ18Op is 1 per mil depleted on the plateau and 1 per mil enriched across the Himalaya. In contrast, during the LGM surface temperatures were ~2-4 C lower across the Himalaya and Tibet. Mean annual LGM precipitation was 200-600 mm/yr lower over the same region, and δ18Op was 2-4 per mil enriched relative to pre-industrial predictions. The causes for the previous δ18Op changes are discussed in the context of variable vapour source, temperature, precipitation amount, and evaporative recycling. Taken together, these results suggest muted climate change across the plateau during the MH with larger changes occurring during the LGM, possibly due to a weaker monsoon and shorted monsoon period than pre-industrial conditions.",

            "abstract": "Detailed information exists on the surface area of glaciers in Switzerland and long-term mass balance observations are available but because glacial thickness remains elusive and so only a rough estimate of the present ice volume is available. After the successful recording of approximately 1000 km of helicopter ground penetrating radar (GPR) profiles on Swiss glaciers during the last three years, the Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research (SCCER) and the Swiss Geophysical Commission (SGPK) began an initiative to obtain for the first time an accurate estimate of the total ice volume located in the Swiss Alps. Steps towards this goal include the delineation of 3D bedrock topography beneath glacerized regions. The final ice volume estimation will comprise an ice flux computation model constrained by a dense network of helicopter-borne GPR profiles.\nDifferent systems that have been recently tested for acquiring helicopter GPR data in the Swiss Alps include towed systems (the HERA-G+ and the BGR-P30) and rigidly mounted systems of standard commercial GPR ground units (the GSSI and PulsEkko), all operating in the frequency range of 30 to 70 Mhz. Some measurements were ground-truthed using the same GPR antenna systems.\nAnalyses of these data sets revealed a wealth of useful information on the glacier bed topography and some internal structures. For instance, at depths between 30 and 60 m, we often observe zones of low backscattering followed by a more reflective zone. In the glacial accumulation areas these features are interpreted as firn layers, in which the water percolates down to its base.\nThe same test flights also provided useful technical information on the radar installation. For towed systems it is difficult to maintain a constant orientation of the antennas during the flight. In contrast, the rigidly mounted systems do not suffer from the orientation problem, but ringing effects are pronounced. We applied an SVD-based (singular value decomposition) multi-channel filter, which enabled this “system ringing” to be removed. Mostly, ground GPR surveys on coincident lines produce better quality GPR images of the glacier bed. However, it turned out that the orientation of the antennas relative to the glacier may be more important to retrieve good quality GPR data, than the surveying mode (airborne or ground).",

Siling Co is currently the largest closed lake in the central TP with a lake surface area of about 2200 km2 and watershed area of about 45 000 km2. It is reported that the lake surface area has expanded by about 42% from 1972 to 2011. Studies suggest that the surface extents of Siling Co are likely to reflect an increased contribution to the lake’s water balance of glacier melting, as well as the associated increasing precipitation and decreasing evapotranspiration. A hydrologic model combined with a glacier melt scheme can serve as a valuable tool to quantify the contribution of glacier melt water to the lake storage changes. In this study, we establish a hydrologic modeling framework by coupling the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) distributed land surface hydrological model with an energy-balance based glacier-melt model over the Siling Co basin. The contributions from precipitation, glacier melting and evapotranspiration to the water balance of Siling Co are quantified via the model simulations during 1971-2013. This work aims to quantitatively analyze the main causes for the Siling Co growth during recent decades, and better understand the hydrologic response of closed lakes to climate changes in the TP.",

            "abstract": "A seismic and tsunami observation system using seafloor optical fiber had been installed off Sanriku, northeastern Japan in 1996. The objectives of the system are to obtain exact seismic activity related to plate subduction and to observe tsunami on seafloor. The continuous real-time observation has been carried out since the installation. In March 2011, the Tohoku earthquake occurred at the plate boundary near the Japan Trench, and the system recorded seismic waves and tsunamis by the mainshock. These data are useful to obtain accurate position of the source faults and source region of tsunami generated by the event. However, the landing station of the system was damaged by huge tsunami, and the observation was suspended. Because the real-time seafloor observation by cabled system is important in this region, we decide to reconstruct a landing station and install newly developed Ocean Bottom Cabled Seismic and Tsunami (OBCST) observation system for additional observation and/or replacement of the existing system.\nFrom 2005, we have been developed the new compact Ocean Bottom Cabled Seismometer (OBCS) system using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Our system is characterized by securement of reliability by using TCP/IP technology and down-sizing of an observation node using up-to-date electronics technology. In 2010, the first OBCS was installed near Awashima-island in the Japan Sea, and is being operated continuously. The new OBCST system is placed as the second generation of our system, and has two types of observation nodes. Both types have accelerometers as seismic sensors. One type of observation nodes equips a crystal oscillator type pressure gauge as tsunami sensor. Another type has an external port for additional observation sensor by using Power over Ethernet technology. Clocks in observation nodes can be synchronized through TCP/IP protocol with an accuracy of 300 ns (IEEE 1588). A simple canister for tele-communication seafloor cable is adopted for the observation node, and has diameter of 26 cm and length of about 1.3 m. At the present, we are producing a practical OBCST system which has total length of approximately 100 km and three observation nodes. We have a plan to install the practical system in 2015.",

            "abstract": "Heavy summer monsoon rainfall along with typhoon-induced extreme precipitation cause frequent geological hazards that often threaten the human’s safety and property in Taiwan. These geological hazards can be triggered by both natural factors, and/or have become deteriorated by perturbations from more and more human activities ever since few thousand years ago. However, due to the limit of instrumental records for observing long-term environmental changes in Taiwan, few evidence exist for distinguishing the human-induced impacts from natural climate change. Here we report a study on a high quality marine sediment core (MD103264) which were retrieved from the high sedimentation rate area from offshore southwestern Taiwan and present evidence for the long-term climate and possibly human-induced environmental changes since the last glacial. We are using the VIS-NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectrophotometry (DRS) methods to study the cores. Interpreting the VIS-NIR reflectance spectra through the VARIMAX-rotation, principle component analysis (VPCA) helps conducting rapid and inexpensive measurements for acquiring high-resolution biogenic component, clay, and iron oxide mineral compositional data from the cores. We are also using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis, which is also useful in determining the element compositional changes in the core. Our studies aim toward understanding the sediment and element compositional changes that reflect the patterns of changes in precipitation and soil erosion on land since the last glacial to the Holocene, during which the human activities (deforestation, agriculture, and land uses change) may have increased drastically. We will report and interpret the preliminary results of the optical analyses of the core.",

We reconstruct the depositional evolution and the changes in biogeochemical cycles of El Tobar karstic lake, evaluating the response and the resilience of this Mediterranean ecosystem to both anthropogenic impacts and climate forcing during the last 1000 years.\nLake El Tobar (40°32′N, 3°56′W; 1200 m a.s.l.; see Figure), 16 ha surface area, 20 m max. depth and permanent meromictic conditions, has a relatively large watershed (1080 ha). Five 8 m long sediment cores and short gravity cores where recovered, imaged, logged with a Geotek, described and sampled for geochemical analyses (elemental TOC, TIC, TN, TS), XRF scanner and ICP-MS, and dated (137Cs and 10 14C assays). The record is a combination of: i) laminated dark silts with terrestrial remains and diatoms and ii) massive to banded light silts (mm to cm –thick layers) interpreted as flood deposits. Sediments, TOC, and Br/Ti and Sr/Ca ratios identify four periods of increased sediment delivery occurred about 1500, 1800, 1850 and 1900 AD, coinciding with large land uses changes of regional relevance such as land clearing and increased population.\nTwo main hydrological changes are clearly recorded in El Tobar sequence. The first one, marked by a sharp decrease in Mg, Ca and Si concentrations, took place about 1200 AD, and during a period of increasing lake level, which shifted from shallower to deeper facies and from carbonatic to clastic and organic-rich deposition. This change was likely related to increased water availability synchronous to the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age. The second one was a canal construction in 1967 AD when a nearby reservoir provided fresh water influx to the lake, and resulted in stronger meromictic conditions in the system after canal construction, which is marked by lower Fe/Mn and higher Br/Ti ratios. The lake depositional and geochemical cycles, however, recovered quickly after each crisis, showing a strong resilience of the lacustrine system.\nFigure: A) Location; B) Ortoimage; C) Geologic map; D) Bathimetry and main lake inputs/outputs.",

            "abstract": "Wood is a key component in forested streams, playing an important ecological and physical role in creating step-pool profiles, enhancing habitat heterogeneity, retaining organic matter, and changing water velocity. Wood additions can increase surface water-groundwater exchange, increasing in-stream residence times by slowing water velocities and providing high depositional areas for fine particles (i.e. particulate nutrients C, N, P). Thus, wood additions may create biogeochemical hotspots in streams that allow greater potential for local nutrient cycling and processing. The objectives of this research were to determine if added wood enhances in-stream heterogeneity, results in more complex flow paths, increases natural retention of further organic matter and changes geomorphic characteristics of the stream reach. We conducted a conservative solute and fluorescent fine particle tracer injection study in an agriculturally impacted stream with emplaced wood additions to estimate in-stream retention times in the Whatawhata catchment, North Island of New Zealand. Although similar solute peak concentrations were observed at the different in-stream sampling sites, increased retention was observed near to the wood. Both fine particle deposition and retention time was increased near the emplaced log. Fine particles were also analyzed in situ in sediment and biofilms on cobbles throughout the stream reach following the injection. A direct positive correlation was observed between cobble biofilm biomass and particle accumulation within this retention area. In general, the addition of wood to these agriculturally impacted streams enhanced hydraulic complexity and increased the retention of solute and fine particles.",

            "abstract": "The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) Yellowstone Ice Cap was the largest continuous ice body in the US Rocky Mountains. Terminal moraine ages derived from cosmogenic radionuclide dating (e.g., Licciardi and Pierce, 2008) constrain the timing of maximum Ice Cap extent. Importantly, the moraine ages vary by several thousand years around the Ice Cap; ages on the eastern outlet glaciers are significantly younger than their western counterparts. In order to interpret these observations within the context of LGM climate in North America, we perform two numerical glacier modeling experiments: 1) We model the initiation and growth of the Ice Cap to steady state; and 2) We estimate the range of LGM climate states which led to the formation of the Ice Cap. We use an efficient semi-implicit 2-D glacier model coupled to a fully implicit solution for flexural isostasy, allowing for transient links between climatic forcing, ice thickness, and earth surface deflection.\nIndependent of parameter selection, the Ice Cap initiates in the Absaroka and Beartooth mountains and then advances across the Yellowstone plateau to the west. The Ice Cap advances to its maximum extent first to the older eastern moraines and last to the younger western and northwestern moraines. This suggests that the moraine ages may reflect the timescale required for the Ice Cap to advance across the high elevation Yellowstone plateau rather than the timing of local LGM climate. With no change in annual precipitation from the present, a mean summer temperature drop of 8-9° C is required to form the Ice Cap. Further parameter searches provide the full range of LGM paleoclimate states that led to the Yellowstone Ice Cap.\nUsing our preferred parameter set, we find that the timescale for the growth of the complete Ice Cap is roughly 10,000 years. Isostatic subsidence helps explain the long timescale of Ice Cap growth. The Yellowstone Ice Cap caused a maximum surface deflection of 300 m (using a constant effective elastic thickness of 4 km (McQuarrie and Rogers, 1998)). Furthermore, subsidence in the foredeep formed by the weight of the Yellowstone Ice Cap may be responsible for the deep alluviation (30+ m) of the Yellowstone valley and Jackson Hole, with subsequent ice retreat and glacial isostatic adjustment leading to exhumation and incision of these fill packages.",

            "abstract": "Hillslope debris flows are unconfined flows of soil debris that typically start as shallow landslides. They generally start on steep hillslopes and their runout distances are typically much longer than those of shallow landslides that did not transform into flows. Most debris flow research has focused on channelized flows and little is known about the flow properties of hillslope debris flows, yet knowledge of typical flow velocities is necessary to e.g. design mitigation measures. Herein we describe 1:20 scale-model experiments on a laboratory hillslope where we systematically varied event volume, clay content, and water content and measured the inundated area, runout distance, flow depth, and front velocity. The laboratory setup was designed based on a simplified geometry of natural hillslopes and it consists of a 7.5 m long artificially roughened planar slope with a width of 1.2 m and a 4.5 m long upper slope segment of 30° and a shorter lower slope segment of 10°. Sediment-water mixtures of 4 to 20 dm3 were placed in a 0.4 m wide head box centered at the top of the slope and were released by rapidly opening a gate, releasing a flow in a dam-break fashion. The flows typically stopped on the 30° portion of the slope. Front velocities in the transit zone range from less than 0.5 to 3 ms-1, systematically increasing with flow volume (for a given clay and water content). Runout distance also increased with increasing water content. Clay content influenced the runout distance more than the flow velocity, with the distance decreasing as the clay content increased from 5 to 10%. The results, when scaled up to the field using Froude similarity, are consistent with previously published large-scale measurements of artificially-released hillslope debris flows with an initial volume of 50 m3 and with another study where impact velocities were calculated based on damage to buildings. Front velocities are also consistent with velocities calculated using a runout model for debris flows, where the model was calibrated on the runout distance.",

            "abstract": "Global products of leaf area index (LAI) usually show large uncertainties in sparsely vegetated areas. The reason is that the understory contribution is not negligible in reflectance modeling for the case of low to intermediate canopy cover. Therefore many efforts have been carried out on inclusion of understory properties in the LAI estimation algorithms. Compared with conventional data bank method, estimation of forest understory property from satellite data is superior in the studies at global or continental scale during a long periods. However, the existing remote sensing method based on multi-angular observations is very complicated to implement. Alternatively, a simple method to retrieve understory NDVI (NDVIu) for sparse boreal forests was proposed in this study. The method is based on the property that the bi-directional variation of NDVIu is much smaller than that of the canopy-level NDVI. To retrieve NDVIu for a certain pixel, linear extrapolation was applied using the pixels within a 5×5 target-pixel-centered window. The NDVI values were reconstructed from the MODIS BRDF data corresponding to eight different solar-view angles. NDVIu was estimated as the average of the NDVI values corresponding to the position where the stand NDVI has the smallest angular variation. Validation by noise-free simulation dataset yielded high agreement between estimated and true NDVIu with R2 and RMSE of 0.99 and 0.03, respectively. By the MODIS BRDF data, we got the estimate of NDVIu close to the in situ measured value (0.61 vs. 0.66 for estimate and measurement, respectively), and also reasonable seasonal patterns of NDVIu in 2010-2013. The results imply a potential application of the retrieved NDVIu to improve the estimation of overstory LAI for sparse boreal forests.",

For the British Geological Survey (BGS) this means millions of potential reporters of real-time events and in-the-field data capturers, creating a new source of scientific information that could help to better understand and predict natural processes.\nBGS first started collecting citizen data, using crowd-sourcing, through websites and smartphone apps focused on gathering geological related information (e.g. mySoil and myVolcano). These tools ask volunteers to follow a guided form where they can upload data related to geology and geological events; including location, description, measurements, photos, videos, or even instructions on sending physical samples. This information is used to augment existing data collections.\nSocial media provides a different channel for gathering useful scientific information from the public. BGS is starting to explore this route with the release of GeoSocial-Aurora , a web mapping tool that searches for tweets related to aurora sightings and locates them as markers on a map. Users are actively encouraged to contribute by sending tweets about aurora sightings in a specific format, which contains the #BGSaurora hashtag, the location of the sighting, and any comments or pictures. The tool harvests these tweets through the Twitter REST API and places them on the map, enabling the user to generate clusters and heatmaps.\nGeoSocial-Aurora provides scientists with a potential tool for gathering useful data for scientific analysis. It collects actual aurora sighting locations, enabling users to check where the aurora is taking place in real time. This may, in time, help scientists to improve future predictions of when and where auroras are visible.",

            "abstract": "The distributions of dissolved REEs and Nd isotopes are controlled by inputs from land and water mass mixing. We present new data from the Panama Basin in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) extending previous studies in the frame of the German SFB 754 project. The samples were taken following GEOTRACES protocols along a section from close to the Panamanian coast into the deep Panama Basin during FS Meteor cruise M90 in October/November 2012.\nElevated Nd concentrations near 13 pmol/kg are found at the surface, which rapidly decrease to a subsurface minimum of 8 pmol/kg near 100m depth and then increase with water depth reaching maximum values of 18 pmol/kg at 3000 m water depth. However, these deep water concentrations are more than a factor of 2 lower than observed for North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW), which is the prevailing Pacific deep water mass at the sampling locations. All the REEs are depleted compared to NPDW suggesting that efficient uptake and scavenging dominate compared to release from remineralized particles.\nThe surface waters show the most radiogenic Nd isotope values (εNd = +4.3) so far obtained globally. In combination with the Nd concentration maxima at the surface this suggests riverine dissolved and fine grained particulate inputs from southern Panama and Colombia where highly radiogenic volcanic rocks are exposed. Elevated εNd values above -1 in the entire water column are more radiogenic than in NPDW in the Central Pacific and in waters further south in the EEP, which confirms that release of REEs from the sinking volcanogenic material affects the entire water column.\nThese data clearly document that significant inputs from land combined with efficient scavenging and removal in surface and deep waters control the distribution of REEs and Nd isotopes in the Panama Basin and the adjacent EEP (Grasse et al., 2012), which also has important implications for the distribution of other trace metals.",

            "abstract": "GRACE observations of the time dependent gravity field provide a direct measurement of the monthly state of mass and thus monthly total water storage in a catchment. This for the first time allows for a direct comparison of monthly runoff and water storage.\nInvestigations of global scale Runoff-Storage (R-S) relationships for different climatic conditions show distinct periodic characteristics with hysteresis for total water storage.\nFor fully humid tropical catchments hysteresis reveals a time invariant temporal delay from storage to runoff. An adjustment of time lag leads to a linear (R-S) relationship with correlation 0.98. Confirmed by the coherence of Fourier spectra, this allows to characterize this R-S relationship as a Linear Time invariant System (LTI).\nBased hereon, the hypothesis of a R-S relationship characterized by the superposition of linear contributions from coupled/liquid storage and nonlinear contributions from uncoupled storages is investigated by means of remote sensing.\nFor boreal catchments MODIS snow coverage is used to separate total storage into coupled/liquid and uncoupled/solid components either directly by assigning frozen solid storage to the snow covered areas or indirectly by a model based aggregation of snow and liquid according to snow coverage. Both methods show, that the nonlinear part of the R-S relationship can be fully assigned to the uncoupled/solid storage while the relationship of runoff and liquid storage can also be characterized as LTI.\nThis system behavior thus allows for a direct determination of river runoff from GRACE mass or vice versa of water storage from measured runoff for unmanaged catchments, provided that the coupled/uncoupled storage components can be quantified by remote sensing.\nExamples for river runoff time series determined from GRACE mass are presented for Amazon sub-catchments and with the additional integration of MODIS snow coverage also for the boreal catchments of Sibiria and North America.",

The retrieval results have been released as the GOSAT TANSO-FTS SWIR L2 product, and there are two related topics recently.\nFrom mid-June, 2014, the TANSO-FTS has recorded interferograms with the zero-path difference (ZPD) position shifted about 800 fringes from its nominal position to avoid the operation with an unstable condition after the sudden shutdown of GOSAT by solar paddle accident at the end of May, 2014. This brings slightly, but non-negligible lower spectral resolution on the observed spectrum. If the nominal instrumental line shape function (ILSF) is used in the retrieval analysis, a beat structure is appeared in the residual spectrum and the retrieved XCO2 and XCH4 show negative bias. The ILSF considering the 800-fringe bias of the ZPD position is provided by JAXA, and the most of the beat structure are disappeared by using this ILSF. The retrieval accuracy and precision will be evaluated until the presentation.\nOther topic is the evaluation of the sample of the new TANSO-FTS L1B product. JAXA plans to implement following items for SWIR spectrum in the new version; (i) new sampling interval non-uniformity correction (SINUC), (ii) updated non-linearity correction, and (iii) unified spectral resolution to avoid the ZPD position shift. Preliminary evaluation shows that the new SINUC can remove a small bias in the XCO2 and XCH4 due to the scan direction. Further evaluation as well as the latest status of the L2 version up are also presented.",

            "abstract": "Recently, the regional climate model RACMO2 has been updated to the version 2.3. The main physics update consists of an enhanced rainfall to snowfall conversion rate, favouring solid over liquid precipitation at higher temperatures, especially in summer. In the updated RACMO2.3 simulation, SMB anomalies are generated through a feedback mechanism involving increased summer snowfall, surface albedo rise as well as cloud cover reduction, resulting in a subsequent decrease of snowmelt and runoff. When compared against K-transect measurements in western Greenland, these updates improve the modelled surface energy balance and surface mass balance relative to the previous RACMO2 version. In addition, the heavier summer snowfall improves the simulated surface albedo in comparison with stations measurements.\nIn recent years, the surface albedo close to the equilibrium line declined notably in summer due to a prolonged bare ice exposure and a decreasing ice albedo. RACMO2.3 results reveal that this rapid reduction in bare ice albedo is not exclusively driven by surface processes related to melt. A major summer snowfall reduction also plays a role in extending the period of bare ice exposure, in turn lowering surface albedo.",

The process behind this is the resonant backscattering of solar Lyman-alpha radiation from exospheric hydrogen.

Based on a large number of LOSs the 3D exospheric H-density distribution is derived from exospheric Lyman-alpha observations. In the presented analysis we are using data from 2008-2010 (solar minimum) and 2012 (near solar maximum) from the Lyman-alpha detectors (LADs) on the Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers (TWINS) mission to model the 3D hydrogen density distribution under different solar conditions.

The monitoring of this evolution at all relevant scales demands a smart combination of multiple techniques. Here, we compare depth estimates derived from operational optical (Argus video) and microwave (X-band radar) remote sensing with those from jet-ski echo-sounding in an approximately 2.5 km2 large region at the Sand Engine, a 20 Mm3 mega-nourishment at the Dutch coast. Using depth inversion techniques based on linear wave theory, frequent (hourly-daily) bathymetric maps were derived from instantaneous Argus video and X-band radar imagery. Jet-ski surveys were available every 2 to 3 months. Depth inversion on Argus imagery overestimates surveyed depths by up to 0.5 m in shallow water (< 2 m), but underestimates larger water depths (> 5m) by up to 1 m. Averaged over the entire subtidal study area, the errors canceled in volumetric budget computations. Additionally, estimates of shoreline and subtidal sandbar positions were derived from Argus imagery and jet-ski surveys. Sandbar crest positions extracted from daily low-tide time-exposure Argus images reveal a persistent onshore offset of some 20 m, but do show the smaller temporal variability not visible from jet-ski surveys. Potential improvements to the applied depth-inversion technique will be discussed.",

The magnetic multipole components are calculated using the synoptic magnetic field data and the potential field source surface (PFSS) model of the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO). While most solar activity indices such as sunspot number, total solar irradiance, 10.7 cm radio flux, and solar flare occurrence rate are highly correlated with the flux of magnetic quadrupole component, the solar wind dynamic pressure and the geomagnetic activity index, AE, are rather correlated with the dipole and higher-order pole components, respectively. The cyclic variation of the dipole components is out of phase with the solar sunspot cycle and that of the quadrupole component is in phase. It is therefore argued that the temporal correlations of the activity indices with the individual multipole components as found in this study may clarify why some of the activity indices are seemingly out of phase with the sunspot cycle.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of apatite from the Mine Block Intrusion (MBI) of the Lac des Iles Igneous Complex show two pronounced trends in the halogens. Apatite from relatively fresh norite and melanorites from the Pd-sulfide zone contain up to 57 mole % chlorapatite endmember with significant hydroxyapatite component. In contrast, in altered rock (amphibolite and greenschist assemblages) and in the more evolved barren rocks the chlorapatite component is typically less than 10 mole % with wide variation in the F- and OH-endmember components. The latter trend is attributed to Cl loss to degassing and alteration whereas the former is attributed to Cl-enrichment in the ore-bearing rocks. It is suggested that the relatively H2O-rich and intermediate Cl content of the early igneous fluids degassed from the deeper levels of the MBI can explain the high Pd/Pt and Pd/Ir ratios of the deposit. A model is presented in which disseminated Pd-rich sulfide are initially introduced by a high temperature magmatic fluid that also influenced crystallization to produce the gross modal variations of the igneous host rock. This high temperature mineralization event was subsequently modified by the influx of late igneous and country fluids at amphibolite to greenschist conditions.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience data comes in many flavors that are determined by type of data such as continous on a grid or mesh or discrete colelcted at point either as one time samples or a stream of data coming of sensors, but coudl also encompass digital files of any time type such text files, WORD or EXCEL documents, or audio and video files. We present a storage facility that is comprsed of 6 nodes each of speciaized to host a certain data type: grid based data (netCDF on a THREDDS server), GIS data (shapefiles using GeoServer), point time series data (CUAHSI ODM), sample data (EDBS), and any digital data (RAMADAA) plus a server fro Remote sensing data and its products. While there is overlap in data type storage capabilities (rasters can go into several of these nodes) we prefer to use dedicated storage facilities that are a) freeware, and b) have a good degree of maturity, and c) have shown their utility for stroing a cetain type. In addition it allows to place these commonly used software stacks and storage solutiosn side-by-side to develop interoprability strategies. We have used a DRUPAL based system to handle user regoistration and authentication, and also use the system for data submission and data search. In support for tis system we developed an extensive controlled vocabulary system that is an amalgamation of various CVs used in the geosciecne community in order to achieve as high a degree of recognition, such the CF conventions, CUAHSI Cvs, , NASA (GCMD), EPA and USGS taxonomies, GEMET, in addition to ontological representations such as SWEET.",

            "abstract": "This is the second installment in our search for a comprehensive economic model to mitigate climate change due to anthropogenic activity.\nLast year we presented how the unique features of our economic model measure changes in carbon flux due to anthropogenic activity, referred to as carbon quality or CQ, and how the model is used to value such changes in the climate system.\nThis year, our paper focuses on how carbon quality can be implemented to capture the effect of economic activity and international trade on the climate system, thus allowing us to calculate a Return on Climate System (RoCS) for all economic assets and activity.\nThe result is that the RoCS for each public and private economic activity and entity can be calculated by summing up the RoCS for each individual economic asset and activity in which an entity is engaged.\nSuch a macro-level scale is used to rank public and private entities including corporations, governments, and even entire nations, as well as human adaptation and carbon storage activities, providing status and trending insights to evaluate policies on both a micro- and macro-economic level.\nWith international trade, RoCS measures the embodied effects on climate change that will be needed to assess border fees to insure carbon parity on all imports and exports.\nAt the core of our vision is a comprehensive, ‘open-source’ construct of which our carbon quality metric is the first element.\nOne goal is to recognize each country’s endemic resources and infrastructure that affect their ability to manage carbon, while preventing spatial and temporal shifting of carbon emissions that reduce or reverse efforts to mitigate climate change.\nThe standards for calculating the RoCS can be promulgated as part of the Generally Accepted Accounted Principles (GAAP) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to ensure standard and consistent reporting.\nThe value of such insights on the climate system at all levels will be crucial to managing anthropogenic activity in order to minimize the effect on the climate system. Without the insights provided by a comprehensive, standardized and verifiable RoCS, managing anthropogenic activity will be elusive and difficult to achieve, at best.\nSuch a model may also be useful to manage the effect of anthropogenic activity on the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles.",

            "abstract": "The morphology of lava flows depends largely on rheological properties (viscosity, yield strength), which in turn vary with its physical properties (composition, crystal and bubble fraction, temperature). We are investigating how these properties vary in space and time (1) along and across a flow at a particular instant in time, and (2) for a single quantum of magma from vent to final emplacement. Our study area is Pacaya (Guatemala). Its latest effusive eruption begun on January 10th 2014 and produced two lava flows emitted from newly-formed vents, aligned NW-SE across the summit. Flow surface profiles were obtained with a Laser Range Finder, and extensive sampling was conducted on both flows while still active or shortly afterwards. The lavas are basalts (SiO2 = 50-51.5%), the SE flow being slightly more evolved than the NW one. Both flows are less alkali-rich than historical flows, even as recently as 2010. The mineralogy consists of plagioclase, olivine, pyroxenes, and minor oxides. The samples are highly crystalline (~60% phenocrysts + microlites) and considerably vesicular (≥25%, decreasing downflow), with mostly interconnected porosity. The flow velocity, estimated from videos taken in the field, decreased from ~2.8 m/s by the vent, where the flow surface is mostly incandescent pahoehoe, to ~0.5 m/s about 1 km downflow, where the surface is mostly dark `a`a. This velocity decrease is consistent with cooling and crust formation, as well as a decrease in slope from 45° to 4°. The effects of crystallization on the evolution of the 2014 lavas rheology are being investigated through concentric cylinder and parallel plate viscometry, and will be compared to the 2010 data. Lavas erupted in 2010 have a viscosity of ~75 Pa s at their liquidus temperature of ~1260˚C, increasing to ~250 Pa s at ~1240˚C (~25% crystals) and ~800 Pa s at ~1225˚C (~36% crystals). At subliquidus conditions, lava rheology is distinctly non-Netonian, and best fit with a power-law rheology, but yield strengths are low even at high crystal fractions (e.g. ~140 Pa at 42% crystals). Rheological gradients are therefore expected to be very strong even within the incandescent flow interior. Experimental study of the 2014 lavas, combined with observations of their emplacement, will allow us to better understand how evolving rheology affects final flow morphology.",

We measured the chemistry and toxicity of unfiltered runoff resulting from rain events simulated from 5 hours to 111 days after application of CT or asphalt (AS) sealcoat. PAHs and N-heterocycles were measured by GC/EIMS. Toxicity tests were done with Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas exposed 48 hours to undiluted and diluted (1 part runoff 9 parts control water) runoff under ambient lighting. Organisms were then transferred to fresh control water and subjected to a 4-hour pulse of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Concentrations of 2- and 3-ringed PAHs and N-heterocycles in CT runoff, initially high (sum of 6 PAHs, 220 µg/L; sum of 7 N-heterocycles, 904 µg/L), decreased rapidly, whereas concentrations of 4-, 5- and 6-ringed PAHs more than doubled by 7 days after application (sum of 9 PAHs, 378 µg/L) and remained elevated 111 days after application (sum of 9 PAHs, 283 µg/L). Concentrations of PAHs and N-heterocycles in AS sealcoated runoff followed a similar pattern, but were ~10 times lower than those in CT runoff; concentrations in a sample of runoff from unsealed asphalt pavement were near or less than the detection limit. Organisms exposed to samples of undiluted CT-runoff collected during the 36 days following CT sealcoat application (no UVR exposure) experienced 100% mortality. Mortality (as much as 100%) of organisms exposed to the 10% dilution of CT runoff or to undiluted AS runoff occurred only with UVR; mortality of organisms exposed to the 10% solution of AS runoff and UVR was minimal. Results demonstrate that freshly CT-sealed parking lots and driveways are \"hot spots\" of PAH and N-heterocycle contamination and that prolonged \"hot moments\" of toxicity follow CT sealcoat application.",

Typically, most of the volcanoes in Hawaii do not erupt as violently because they seem to be erupting and flowing on a somewhat regularly continuous basis or schedule.\nOur paper is suggesting a method, or many methods, by which the pressure buildup will be limited to substantially lower levels, than those which occur at present, by various procedures, before the actual eruption. We are suggesting that when we tame the highly destructive volcanoes' eruptions, we can reduce the effects which can ground more than a 100,000 flights; as occurred by Mount Eyjofjallajokull, back in 2010.\nIt is critically important to be able to sense, measure, record and analyze the various conditions leading to the volcanic eruption.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridges constitute a fundamental component of the global plate tectonic system. The classical view of ridges is of symmetric system, where plates diverge, generating a mostly passive upwelling immediately underneath the ridge axis. However, observations of mid-ocean ridges draw quite a different picture. At the Southern East Pacific Rise, plate subsidence (related to plate age) occurs at different rates on the Pacific and Nazca plates, implying different rates of accretion on each side of the ridge. At greater depth, the melting region extends much further beneath the Pacific plate than the Nazca plate. Asymmetry is also evident in slow spreading center. For examples, at the 13°N segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, isochrons are more widely spaced on the American side than the European side. Core complexes along the axis are another manifestation of asymmetric accretion at that location.\nIn this contribution, we seek to understand how is the melting system affected by ridge asymmetry. First, we discuss the different ways that an asymmetric ridge may develop. We present an analytical solution of mantle flow in the mantle underneath spreading centers that considers 1) different rates of accretion in on the two plates; 2) migration of the ridge system with respect to the underlying mantle (Couette flow in the asthenosphere); 3) mantle wind (Poiseuille flow in the asthenosphere); 4) different slopes of the lithosphere underneath each plate; and 5) any combination of the above. These solutions assume an isoviscous mantle underneath the lithosphere. Asymmetry in mantle flow is observed in each case. The temperature field associated with each case implies that melting is suppressed by the asymmetric accretion, although deeper processes have little effect on melting. As asymmetric accretion is thought to develop when melt flux to the axis is reduced, there is the possibility of a positive feedback that forces segments to switch between symmetric and asymmetric spreading. However, the effect of asymmetry is reduced in numerical models with temperature-dependent viscosity as the thermally defined slope of the lithosphere counteracts the effect of asymmetric accretion.",

The primary instrument on the CALIPSO satellite is the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), a near-nadir viewing two-wavelength polarization-sensitive instrument. The unique nature of CALIOP measurements make it quite challenging to validate backscatter profiles, aerosol type, and cloud phase, all of which are used to retrieve extinction and optical depth. We exploit the large data set generated by CALIPSO between 2006 – 2013 to determine a multi-year climatology of the properties of Saharan dust, in particular seasonal optical depths, layer frequencies, and layer heights of Saharan dust gridded in accordance with the Level 3 data products protocol. The data are screened using standard CALIPSO quality assurance flags, cloud aerosol discrimination (CAD) scores, overlying features and layer properties. To evaluate the effects of transport on the morphology, vertical extent and size of Saharan dust layers, we compare probability distribution functions of the layer integrated volume depolarization ratios, geometric depths and integrated attenuated color ratios near the source (Lat 0o to 40o Lon -20o to 20o) to the same distributions in the far field or transport region (Lat 0o to 40o Lon -80o to -20o). To evaluate the uncertainty in the lidar ratios, we compare the values computed from dust layers overlying opaque water clouds, considered nominal, with the constant lidar ratio value used in the CALIOP algorithms for dust. We also explore the effects of noise on the CALIOP retrievals at daytime by comparing the distributions of the properties at daytime to the nighttime distributions.",

            "abstract": "Although sediment supply is recognized as a fundamental driver of fluvial processes, measuring how dams affect sediment regimes and incorporating such knowledge into management strategies remains challenging. To determine the influences of damming, tributary supply, and valley morphology and sediment storage on downstream sediment supply in a dryland river, the Bill Williams River (BWR) in western Arizona, we measured basin erosion rates using cosmogenic nuclide analysis of beryllium-10 (10Be) at sites upstream and downstream of a dam along the BWR, as well as from tributaries downstream of the dam. Riverbed sediment mixing calculations were used to test if the dam, which blocks sediment supply from the upper 85% of the basin’s drainage area, increases the proportion of tributary sediment to residual upstream sediment in mainstem samples downstream of the dam. Erosion rates in the BWR watershed are more than twice as large in the upper catchment (136 t km-2 yr-1) than in tributaries downstream of Alamo Dam (61 t km-2 yr-1). Tributaries downstream of the dam have little influence on mainstem sediment dynamics. The effect of the dam on reducing sediment supply is limited, however, because of the presence of large alluvial valleys along the mainstem BWR downstream of the dam that store substantial sediment and mitigate supply reductions from the upper watershed. These inferences, from our 10Be derived erosion rates and mixing calculations, are consistent with field observations of downstream changes in bed material size, which suggest that sediment-deficit conditions are restricted to a 10 km reach downstream of the dam, and limited reservoir bathymetry data. Many studies have suggested that tributary sediment inputs downstream of dams play a key role in mitigating dam-induced sediment deficits, but here we show that in a dryland river with ephemeral tributaries, sediment stored in alluvial valleys can also play a key role and in some cases trumps the role of tributaries.",

Based on field microcosm incubations with 1.2 mM, 20 µM, or no hydrogen, the growth of methanogens at 55°C and 80°C is limited primarily by temperature and hydrogen availability, with ammonium amendment showing no consistent effect on total methane output. The Arrhenius constants for methane production by Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (optimum 82°C) and Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus (optimum 65°C) were determined in pure culture bottle experiments. The Monod constants for hydrogen concentration were measured by growing both organisms in a 2-liter chemostat at two dilution rates; 55°C, 65°C and 82°C; and variable hydrogen concentrations. M. jannaschii showed higher ks and Vmax constants than M. thermolithotrophicus. In the field, hydrogen and methane concentrations in hydrothermal end-member and low-temperature diffuse fluids were measured, and the concentrations of methanogens that grow at 55°C and 80°C in diffuse fluids were determined using most-probable-number estimates. Methane concentration anomalies in diffuse fluids relative to end-member hydrothermal concentrations and methanogen cell concentrations are being used to constrain a 1-D reactive transport model using the laboratory-determined Arrhenius and Monod constants for methane production by these organisms. By varying flow path length and subseafloor cell concentrations in the model, our goal is to determine solutions for the potential depth of the subseafloor biosphere coupled with the amount of methanogenic biomass it contains.",

Now, the BBOBS data is proved to be acceptable for broadband seismic analyses. In these studies, the period range mostly used is about 10 - 200 s, but in longer period range, i.e. geodetic range, is unknown region in the sea floor observation. High mobility of our BBOBS and BBOBS-NX can be a breakthrough to realize the geodetic observation network on the sea floor. Two kinds of attempts to expand observation range toward the geodetic one have been started since 2009, based on our BBOBS technology. One is for detecting vertical displacement by attaching an absolute pressure gauge (APG) in the BBOBS system. The highly stable frequency oscillator within the OBS recorder is adequate for precise pressure measurement of the APG. This BBOBS+APG system has been operated since 2009. In this presentation, we will report results of several test experiments for the tilt observation just beneath the sea floor by using the BBOBS-NX system, as the second one. The tilt is measured by using two horizontal mass position signals of the sensor. The first test observation was performed by using the same sensor of the BBOBS-NX at the land observatory in 2010. The result was comparable with that of the water tube tilt-meter there. After the in situ test for 2 months at the sea floor in the Shikoku Basin in 2012, we started the practical tilt observation at the sea floor off Boso peninsula (KAP3 site) as the feasibility study between April 2013 and April 2014. The deployment and recovery were performed by the ROV. In both observations, a Doppler current profiler was deployed nearby the BBOBST-NX to monitor bottom currents through the observation period. In January 2014, a slow slip event (SSE) occurred near the KAP3 site. The Mw of the SSE is 6.5, and this site seems almost above the area slipped. The tilt data of the BBOBST-NX was processed by removing for the mechanical relaxation and by using the baytap08 program. The result shows recognizable peak started from the late December 2013, but the tilt was not remained after the SSE ended. The maximum tilt is comparable to the theoretical value of a few μ radian.",

            "abstract": "The lack of a high-resolution, long-term Early Cretaceous paleotemperature record hampers a full-scale comprehension, as well as a more holistic approach, to Early Cretaceous climate changes. We present an extended compilation of belemnite-based oxygen, carbon and strontium isotope records covering the Berriasian to middle Albian from the Vocontian Basin (SE France). Integrated with paleontological and sedimentological evidences, this dataset clearly demonstrates that three intervals of cold climatic conditions have taken place during the Early Cretaceous greenhouse world. More specifically, these are taken place during (1) the late Valanginian-earliest Hauterivian, (2) the late early Aptian and (3) the latest Aptian - earliest Albian. Each of these intervals is associated with high amplitude sea-level fluctuations, pointing at transient installations of polar ice caps. As evidenced by carbon isotope positive excursions, each cold episode is associated with enhanced burial of organic matter on a global scale. Moreover, there is a very good match between the timing and size of large igneous provinces eruptions and the amplitude of Early Cretaceous warming episodes. Altogether, these observations confirm the instrumental role of atmospheric CO2 variations in the making of Mesozoic climate change. On a long-term perspective, during the Early Cretaceous, the coupling of global paleotemperature and seawater strontium isotopic ratio is best explained by temperature-controlled changes of continental crust weathering rates.",

            "abstract": "One of the most peculiar features on Saturn moon Enceladus is its so-called tiger stripe pattern at the geologically active South Polar Terrain (SPT), as first observed in detail by the Cassini spacecraft early 2005. It is generally assumed that the four almost parallel surface lines that constitute this pattern are faults in the icy surface overlying a confined salty water reservoir. Indeed, later Cassini observations have shown that salty water jets originate from the tiger stripes [e.g., Hansen et al., Science, 311, 1422-1425, 2006; Postberg et al., Nature, 474, 620-622, 2011].\nMore recently, Porco et al. [Astron. J., 148:45, Sep. 2014] and Nimmo et al. [Astron. J., 148:46, Sep. 2014] have reported strong evidence that the geysers are not caused by frictional heating at the surface, but that geysers must originate deeper in Enceladus’ interior. Tidal flexing models, like those of Hurford et al., Nature, 447, 292-294, 2007, give a good match for the brightness variations Cassini observes, but they seem to fail to reproduce the exact timing of plume brightening. Although jet activity is thus strongly connected to tidal forcing, another mechanism must be involved as well.\nLast year, we formulated the original idea [Vermeersen et al., AGU Fall Meeting 2013, abstract #P53B-1848] that the tiger stripe pattern is formed and maintained by induced, tidally and rotationally driven, wave-attractor motions in the ocean underneath the icy surface of the tiger-stripe region. Such wave-attractor motions are observed in water tank experiments in laboratories on Earth and in numerical experiments [Maas et al., Nature, 338, 557-561, 1997; Drijfhout and Maas, J. Phys. Oceanogr., 37, 2740-2763, 2007; Hazewinkel et al., Phys. Fluids, 22, 107102, 2010].\nThe latest observations by Porco et al. and Nimmo et al. seem to be in agreement with this tidal-induced wave attractor phenomenon, both with respect to tiger stripe pattern and with respect to timing of hotspot activity. However, in contrast to the thin ocean/thick ice sheet model as anticipated in Fig. 12 of Porco et al. (2014), our lab experiments suggest that attractors are generated most efficiently at aspect ratio O(1), implying that distance between stripes might actually approximately directly represent local ocean depth in a thin ice sheet/thick ocean setting.",

            "abstract": "The rapid speedup of Greenland tidewater glaciers over the last decade, and subsequent mass loss, has been attributed to an increase in air temperature and a synchronous increase in ocean temperatures. The warming subtropical waters previously thought to only exist offshore of Greenland, have been observed throughout most Greenland fjords, and have been suggested to play a large role in submarine melting of the floating glacier terminus and subsequent calving. Warm subtropical water can become entrained by subglacial meltwater as it exits from beneath the glacier. As the buoyant subglacial meltwater moves along the glacier terminus to the surface, the entrained subtropical water contributes to terminus melting and subsequent iceberg melting. However, the impact of a meltwater plume on fjord stratification has been difficult to study due to the limited accessibility of the proglacial environment. We collected a mooring record of salinity and temperature from 2010-2013 at 14 m depth in Sermilik fjord, East Greenland (~25-30 km from the terminus of Helheim Glacier). This record shows a temperature deviation from a sinusoidal seasonal trend between June and October each year; temperatures steadily decrease between June and August and warm again over the subsequent two months. We hypothesize there are three factors driving temperature and salinity changes in the surface waters: (1) subglacial meltwater release, (2) glacier calving, and (3) proglacial circulation. In this study we construct a physical model of the proglacial fjord environment. We modify the quantity, duration and depth of subglacial meltwater release to reconstruct the mooring temperature and salinity records. Results of this study illuminate the influence of subglacial discharge and iceberg melt on proglacial fjord dynamics, an important component in understanding ice sheet- ocean interactions in a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "Rapid Arctic warming and sea ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean are widely attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The Arctic warming exceeds the global average warming due to feedbacks that include sea ice reduction and other dynamical and radiative feedbacks. We show that the most prominent annual mean surface and tropospheric warming in the Arctic since 1979 has occurred in northeastern Canada and Greenland. In this region, much of the year-to-year temperature variability is associated with the leading mode of large-scale circulation variability in the North Atlantic, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We show that the recent warming in this region is strongly associated with a negative trend in the NAO, which is a response to anomalous Rossby wave-train activity originating in the tropical Pacific. Atmospheric model experiments forced by prescribed tropical sea surface temperatures simulate the observed circulation changes and associated tropospheric and surface warming over northeastern Canada and Greenland. Experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models with prescribed anthropogenic forcing show no similar NAO-related circulation changes or associated tropospheric warming. This suggests that a substantial portion of recent warming in the northeastern Canada and Greenland sector of the Arctic arises from unforced natural variability.",

The varying concentration of this drug was analyzed in a mature karst spring following a precipitation event. The results show that carbamazepine is an indicator of wastewater entering the system through a fast flow pathway, leading to an increase of the drug concentrations in spring water shortly after a strong rainfall event. The analysis of the breakthrough curve of carbamazepine along with the electrical conductivity signal and major ions chemograph allowed the development of a conceptual model for precipitation event-based flow and transport in the investigated karst system. Furthermore the amount of newly recharged water and the mass of carbamazepine reaching the aquifer system during the event could be estimated using a simple mixing approach. The distance between the karst spring and the potential carbamazepine source was estimated by the combination of results from artificial tracer tests and the carbamazepine breakthrough curve. The assessment of spring responses to precipitation event using persistent drugs like carbamazepine helps assess the effect of waste water contamination at a spring and gives therefore insights to the specific vulnerability of a karst spring.",

Here, we use projections of a cumulative WSI (CWSI) known to influence autumn-winter waterfowl migration to demonstrate the utility of SNOW-17 results. The application of statistically downscaled climate data and a snow model leads to a better representation of lake processes in the Great Lakes Basin, topographic effects in the Appalachian Mountains, and spatial patterns of climatological snowfall, compared to the original GCMs. Annual mean snowfall is simulated to decline across the region, particularly in early winter (December-January), leading to a delay in the mean onset of the snow season. Due to a warming-induced acceleration of snowmelt, the percentage loss in snow depth exceeds that of snowfall. Across the Plains and Prairie Potholes LCC and Upper Midwest and Great Lakes LCC, daily snowfall events are projected to become less common, but more intense. The greatest reductions in the number of days per year with a present snowpack are expected close to the historical position of the -5°C isotherm in DJFM, around 44°N. The CWSI is projected to decline substantially during December-January, leading to increased likelihood of delays in timing and intensity of autumn-winter waterfowl migrations.",

            "abstract": "Serpentine deposits on Mars have generated significant interest because byproducts of serpentinization, H2 and CH4, can be important energy sources for subsurface microbial communities. H2 is produced through Fe2+ oxidation to form magnetite and Fe3+-bearing serpentine. In serpentine, Fe3+ goes into octahedral sites first, then tetrahedral sites [Marcaillou et al., 2011, EPSL]. We use Fe oxidation state and coordination in an Early Ordovician serpentinite in Norbestos, Quebec, as proxies for H2 production and stable isotopes of carbonates to understand past aqueous conditions at the Canadian Space Agency’s 2012 Mars Methane Analogue Mission site.\nRock outcrops were imaged with a visible hyperspectral imager (420-720 nm), and samples were imaged in the laboratory with the same imager and a near infrared imager (650-1100 nm). Other analyses determined major element chemistry (ICP-AES and C analyses), mineralogy (XRD), Fe phases (Mössbauer spectroscopy), and stable isotopes of carbonates.\nFe oxidation state and coordination (tetrahedral vs octahedral) were mapped in samples and outcrops using imaging data. We focused on locations with tetrahedral Fe3+ in serpentine as these are the most serpentinized sites with maximum H2 production. Carbonate samples from ~100-200 m south of a shear zone are enriched in 13C (δ13C up to +16.12‰ vs VPDB) resulting from production of CH4 depleted in 13C in a system closed to C addition but open to CH4 escape. This alteration occurred at elevated temperatures and low water/rock ratios. In the shear zone, lower δ13C values (most < +2‰) positively correlated with δ18O likely result from kinetic fractionation under recent low temperature conditions.\nSpectroscopy suggests that much of this deposit underwent advanced serpentinization to produce significant H2. Isotopic signatures of carbonates precipitated during serpentinization outside the shear zone illuminate the temperatures (elevated) and chemistries of fluids (high Ca2+, low CO2, alkaline) and gases (H2, CH4) in an ancient habitable environment. These results suggest that serpentinites identified on Mars, where there has been limited recent aqueous activity, could preserve evidence of fluid composition and levels of hydrogen production, providing a promising context to search for biosignatures.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency electromagnetic (EM) signals are commonly used in geophysical exploration of the shallow subsurface. Sensitivity to conductivity implies they are particularly useful for inferring fluid content of porous media. However, low-frequency EM wavefields are diffusive, and have significantly larger wavelengths compared to seismic signals of equal frequency. The wavelength of a 30 Hz sinusoid propagating with seismic velocity 3000 m/s is 100 m, whereas an analogous EM signal diffusing through a conductive body of 0.1 S/m (clayey shale) has wavelength 1825 m. The larger wavelength has implications for resolution of the EM prospecting method.\nWe are investigating resolving power of the EM method via theoretical and numerical experiments. Normal incidence plane wave reflection/transmission by a thin geologic bed is amenable to analytic solution. Responses are calculated for beds that are conductive or resistive relative to the host rock. Preliminary results indicate the classic seismic resolution/detection limit of bed thickness ~1/8 wavelength is not achieved. EM responses for point or line current sources recorded by general acquisition geometries are calculated with a 3D finite-difference algorithm. These exhibit greater variability which may allow inference of bed thickness.\nWe also examine composite responses of two point scatterers with separation when illuminated by an incident EM field. This is analogous to the Rayleigh resolution problem of estimating angular separation between two light sources. The First Born Approximation implies that perturbations in permittivity, permeability, and conductivity have different scattering patterns, which may be indicators of EM medium properties.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "Time-lapse geophysical monitoring has significant potential as a tool for reservoir characterization, that is for determining reservoir properties such as permeability. Onset times, the calendar time at which geophysical observations begin to deviate from their initial or background values, provide a useful basis for such characterization. We find that, in contrast to time-lapse amplitude changes, onset times are not sensitive to the exact method used to related changes in fluid saturation to changes in seismic velocities. As a consequence of this, we find that an inversion for effective permeability based upon onset times is robust with respect to variations in the rock physics model. Furthermore, synthetic tests indicate that onset times can be obtained from noisy seismic amplitudes. Testing also indicates that large-scale effective permeability variations can be recovered even if we use onset times\nfrom seismic surveys that are spaced as much as 300 days apart.",

Using combinations of cloud resolving regional model simulations and radar and surface observations obtained during the CINDY2011/DYNAMO/AMIE field campaign, we investigate mechanism of convective cloud triggering and organization at the edge of cold pools. The model simulated cloud population and cold pool statistics compare well with the observations. Comparison of thermodynamics and dynamic conditions at the boundaries of isolated and intersecting cold pools reveals, that deep convection is mainly attributed to larger cloud clusters formed at intersecting cold pool boundaries, as a result of reduced entrainment of environmental air, while stronger sub-cloud layer forced updraft by colliding gust fronts played a secondary role.",

            "abstract": "Abstract\nA case study of return flow over the Gulf of Mexico has been conducted with the intention of determining the value of a single upper-air observation. This case study makes use of a set of upper-air observations collected by the U. S. Coast Guard ship Salvia that followed the trajectory of return-flow air parcels—essentially collecting observations in a Lagrangian frame of reference. A mixed layer model is used to make an ensemble forecast during the outflow phase of the phenomenon—that period when surface-driven buoyancy is the dynamical mechanism that transports moisture and heat into the atmospheric boundary layer. With this low-order nonlinear model, the contributions to forecast uncertainty that stem from initial conditions, boundary conditions, and physical/empirical parameters can be determined separately. These uncertainties serve as input to a three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) data assimilation scheme. Results indicate that the uncertainty in initial conditions dominates the full complement of uncertainties. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the value of a single set of upper-air observations over the Gulf (at a point near the onset of return flow). It is clear from this experiment that observations near the initial onset point significantly improves the forecast of mixing ratio and offers hope for improvement in operational forecasting with a modest increase in resources.",

            "abstract": "PlanetVac is a regolith sample acquisition mission concept that uses compressed gas to blow material from the surface up a pneumatic tube and directly into a sample return container. The PlanetVac sampling device is built into the lander legs to eliminate cost and complexity associated with robotic arms and scoops. The pneumatic system can effectively capture fine and coarse regolith, including small pebbles. It is well suited for landed missions to Mars, asteroids, or the Moon. Because of the low pressures on all those bodies, the technique is extremely efficient. If losses are kept to minimum, 1 gram of compressed gas could efficiently lift 6000 grams of soil.\nTo demonstrate this approach, the PlanetVac lander with four legs and two sampling tubes has been designed, integrated, and tested. Vacuum chamber testing was performed using two well-known planetary regolith simulants: Mars Mojave Simulant (MMS) and lunar regolith simulant JSC-1A. One of the two sampling systems was connected to a mockup of an earth return rocket while the second sampling system was connected to a lander deck mounted instrument (clear box for easy viewing). The tests included a drop from a height of approximately 50 cm onto the bed of regolith, deployment of sampling tubes into the regolith, pneumatic acquisition of sample into an instrument (sample container) and the rocket, and the launch of the rocket. The demonstration has been successful and can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjJXvtQk6no. In most of the tests, 20 grams or more of sample was delivered to the 'instrument' and approximately 5 grams of regolith was delivered into a sampling chamber within the rocket. The gas lifting efficiency was calculated to be approximately 1000:1; that is 1 gram of gas lofted 1000 grams of regolith. Efficiencies in lower gravity environments are expected to be much higher.\nThis successful, simple and lightweight sample capture demonstration paves the way to using such sampling system on either NASA or commercial landers to the Moon, Asteroids, comets, or Mars.",

            "abstract": "Over the past five years, rainfall-triggered landslides have caused over 16,000 fatalities in 65 countries and have resulted in higher annual property losses than any other natural disaster. Yet while hurricanes and earthquakes have global monitoring systems in place to alert disaster response agencies, governments and regional humanitarian groups of potential disasters and related impacts, no such real-time monitoring system exists for rainfall-triggered landslides. This work introduces a new regionally-based system to evaluate landslide hazards in near-real-time through the application of remotely sensed and in situ data. Build upon existing modeling efforts, the landslide hazard assessment and nowcasting system couples satellite precipitation data, a modeled and satellite-based soil moisture product and susceptibility information to improve the characterization of areas that may experience landslide activity. The goal of this system is to better inform decision-making and disaster response agencies on landslide hazards at the regional scale. This system outputs a straightforward, easily-interpreted set of landslide hazard assessment products available in near real-time for the Mesoamerica region that can be used to both identify landslide-prone areas and forecast the potential location and timing of landslide initiation in the future.\nThis research presents the prototype regional model tested over Central America and the Caribbean region using satellite-based information including Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) near real-time rainfall, modeled soil moisture, topography, soils, road networks and distance to fault zones. These variables are integrated within a simple algorithm framework and model outputs provide a probabilistic representation of potential landslide activity over the region. This presentation summarizes the preliminary results of this modeling framework, discusses the utility of these products for landslide hazard characterization, and outlines the path forward for this modeling approach.",

We have managed to tamper with our atmosphere’s gas composition and the climate is slowly remodelling our way of life. Engineers are now expected to be a key part of the solution. Engineering programs have evolved to include new dimensions such as ethics, communication and environment.

How good teachers our future engineers will be? This work take a look at the teaching/learning successes comparing engineering students with students attending an undergraduate program in biology. Methods emphasizing the acquisition of knowledge through lectures and reading assignments are tested along with activities aiming at unraveling the scientific fundamental behind environmental issues and putting forward original solutions to specific problematic.

            "abstract": "Constraining the basal conditions of continental ice sheet is an important step toward improving the projections of the contribution of ice sheets to sea level rise. Inferring basal conditions, and more specifically the friction coefficient, at the ice/bed interface remains challenging due to the lack of direct observations of the sliding of continental ice masses. The most advanced way to derive basal friction is to rely on inverse methods using remotely sensed surface velocities. While efficient, these methods lump all the uncertainties of the model and input data into basal friction in order to reproduce the InSAR derived velocities. Here, we investigate a new approach that consists of using a more physical method to infer basal conditions by relying on a new generation large scale subglacial hydrological model implemented in the ISSM framework (de Fleurian et al 2014). We investigate the calculated effective pressure and its correlation with a pattern of basal drag inferred by an inverse method at the continental scale. We then discuss the ability of the hydrologically derived basal conditions to reproduce the measured surface velocities.",

            "abstract": "The application of coupled detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and (U-Th)/He thermochronology to sedimentary basins has the potential for unprecedented details about grain provenance, depositional age and source and basin exhumation signals. Although several studies have implored this technique, it is underutilized and may prove useful in geologic settings that are traditionally difficult to explore. For example, constraining the depositional age of strata in ancient forearc basins is challenging as many horizons are devoid of fossils and post-burial diagenesis of limestone beds limits biostratigraphic age control. This study applies U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology to clastic rocks from the Cretaceous-Eocene Xigaze forearc basin in southern Tibet to (1) to determine the provenance of forearc basin strata and (2) to constrain a maximum depositional age of stratigraphic horizons using the youngest distinct age group from a sample. In addition, (U-Th)/He thermochronology was applied to a subset of the detrital zircons on which U-Pb ages were previously determined in order to determine the timing of exhumation of Xigaze forearc strata and its source region.\nThe use of young populations of zircons is a good method for age control in the Xigaze forearc basin because magmatism in the source area was more-or-less continuous and the lag time between the youngest zircons in a sample and the time of that samples deposition is likely relatively small. A total of 2,330 zircon grains yielded ages with acceptable precision and concordance for geochronologic interpretation. Together with sandstone petrography, the detrital zircons indicate that the primary source of detritus in the basin from ~113 to 54 Ma was the Gangdese magmatic arc. Analysis of the youngest age component of individual samples reveals a decrease in the youngest ages upsection, consistent with maximum depositional ages that are close to the likely true depositional age based on intervening tuff layers. Double-dated zircon grains from all stratigraphic levels reveal that the basin was buried to > 200°C prior to 26 Ma as all zircons are significantly younger than the depositional age of their stratigraphic horizons. Basin exhumation is constratined to be between 30-17 Ma.",

As the most important site for Phanerozoic crustal growth in the world, the subduction-accretion complexes added ~ 5.3 million km2of material to Asia, half of which may be of juvenile origin (Sengor et al. 1993).The andesitic lavas of Daotenuoer Fms. at Xi-Ujimqin have different trace and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic characteristic from them, these rocks span a SiO2 range of 56.83 ~ 59.17% and MgO of range of 1.21~2.91%, characterized by obviously LREE/HREE fractionation (Ce/YbCN = 11.6 ~ 16.8), strong LILE enrichment and variable Nb-Ta and Sr depletion.

            "abstract": "A megathrust earthquake occurred in Northern Chile in April 1, 2014, 23:46 (UTC) (Mw 8.2), in a region that had not experienced a major earthquake since the great 1877 (~M8.6) event. This area had been already identified as a mature seismic gap with a strong interseismic coupling inferred from geodetic measurements (Chlieh et al., JGR, 2011 and Metois et al., GJI, 2013). We used 48 components of strong motion records belonging to the IPOC network in Northern Chile to investigate the source process of the M8.2 Pisagua earthquake. Acceleration waveforms were integrated to get velocities and filtered between 0.02 and 0.125 Hz. We assumed a single fault plane segment with an area of 180 km by 135 km, a strike of 357, and a dip of 18 degrees (GCMT). We set the starting point of rupture at the USGS hypocenter (19.610S, 70.769W, depth 25km), and employed a multi-time-window linear waveform inversion method (Hartzell and Heaton, BSSA, 1983), to derive the rupture process of the Pisagua earthquake. Our results show a slip model characterized by one large slip area (asperity) localized 50 km south of the epicenter, a peak slip of 10 m and a total seismic moment of 2.36 x 1021Nm (Mw 8.2). Fault rupture slowly propagated to the south in front of the main asperity for the initial 25 seconds, and broke it by producing a strong acceleration stage. The fault plane rupture velocity was in average 2.9 km/s. Our calculations show an average stress drop of 4.5MPa for the entire fault rupture area and 12MPa for the asperity area. We simulated the near-source strong ground motion records in a broad frequency band (0.1 ~ 20 Hz), to investigate a possible multi-frequency fault rupture process as the one observed in recent mega-thrust earthquakes such as the 2011 Tohoku-oki (M9.0).\nAcknowledgments\nStrong motion data was kindly provided by Chile University as well as the IPOC (Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile).",

Seven areas (1226-1, 1226-2, 0101-4, 0105-1, 0105-2, 0107-2, 0107-3) from the coast toward the inland were investigated. The duration of exposure of soil samples to the air depending on the retraction of ice to the inland may affect the microbial activity resulting in the biogeochemical mineral alteration. The multiline of techniques for example, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), wet chemistry analysis including the extent of Fe(III) reduction, and batch experiments of microbe-mineral interaction under the low temperature that mimics the Antarctic condition to understand the mechanism of biogeochemical alteration of clay minerals. Clay minerals of smectite, mica, chlorite and kaolinite were detected in the XRD profiles. The variation of relative amount of clay minerals in the regions indicated that the physical/biological alteration might be different depending on the duration of ice retraction. From the batch experiment using Nontronite (NAu-1), moreover, we confirm that Psychrophilic bacteria (Shewanella sp. isolated from King George Island) reduce structural Fe(III) of clay mineral, and occur structural change of smectite at low temperature (4℃ and 15℃). The present study, therefore, would present the feasibility of biological effects on chemical modification through the structural changes in clay mineral in cold environment and suggest a new pathway of Fe-supply into the Antarctic Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Lake Saint-Jean is the third largest natural lake in Québec (Canada), however very few studies have focused on the basin-scale limnogeology of this lake. An initial very high-resolution seismic survey of Lake Saint-Jean was conducted in 2011, providing more than 300 km of seismic sections throughout the lake. These seismic profiles permitted the identification of numerous depositional units at a basin-scale (Nutz et al., Boreas 2014).\nIn this contribution, we focus on prominent large-scale, high-energy sedimentary features that are rather atypical in lakes: a sand-prone sedimentary shelf, sediment drifts and extensive erosional surfaces. All of these features may be attributed to wind-driven hydrodynamics affecting the central portion of the lake, at depths well below the wave base. Coupling the seismic profiles with a series of sediment cores and recent dating results, we now can propose a detailed characterization of these sedimentary features including age and context of emplacement, as well as the dominant depositional processes at work. Indeed, a numerical simulation of wind-induced bottom-current distribution based on realistic wind regimes was also applied in order to validate our previous wind-forcing interpretation.\nThis research provides a more thorough understanding of depositional processes at the origin of fine-grained sediment accumulations in lakes. The prevalence of wind-driven processes in some lacustrine depositional systems is also addressed through the presentation of a conceptual depositional model well-suited for high-energy, wind-driven water-bodies. This model is of interest to all geoscientists dealing with present-day lake systems (e.g., reservoir lake management) as well as researchers working with paleo-lacustrine records and strata (e.g., bottom lake anoxia, hiatial surfaces, hydrocarbon exploration).",

            "abstract": "Satellite retrievals of cloud optical depth and effective radius are shown to be underestimated in the South Atlantic Ocean, where biomass-burning aerosols typically reside above low-level, liquid water stratocumulus clouds. A radiative transfer model is used to calculate top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectances for a case where an aerosol layer is elevated above a liquid cloud in the South Atlantic Ocean. Both absorbing and scattering aerosols are modeled at varying aerosol optical depths (AOD) at 0.86 μm and 2.10 μm. Optimal estimation methods are used to convert reflectance pairs into a retrieved cloud optical depth and effective radius, similar to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, aboard Aqua satellite) algorithm. Absorbing aerosols lead to an underestimation of the retrieved cloud optical depth by up to 60 – 80%, while scattering aerosols can lead to an over- or underestimate of the optical depth by up to 10%, depending on the cloud thickness. Effective radius retrievals can be over- and underestimated if absorbing aerosols are present, depending on the AOD. Scattering aerosols result in an overestimation of effective radius by up to 0 – 10%. A-Train satellite observations from August 2006 – December 2010 in the South Atlantic Ocean also show that the MODIS biases in cloud optical depth and effective radius are likely affecting retrieved properties and hence retrieved cloud droplet number concentrations when the aerosol layer is vertically separated from the cloud.",

GENESYS was intended for modelling of alpine snowpack, and that work has been the subject of a series of hydrometeorology papers that applied the model to evaluate how climate change may impact water resources for a series of climate warming scenarios through 2100. GENESYS has research modules that have been used to assess alpine glacier mass balance, soil water and drought, forest fire risk under climate change, and a series of papers linking GENESYS to a water temperature model for small headwater streams. Through a major commercialization grant, we are refining, building, adopting, and adapting routines for flood hydrology and hydraulics, surface and groundwater storage and runoff, crop and ecosystem soil water budgets, and biomass yields. The model will be available for research collaborations in the near future. The central goal of this development program is to provide a series of research and development tools for non-profit integrated resource management in the developed and developing world.\nA broader question that arises is what are the bounds of watershed management, if any? How long should our list of “managed” resources be? Parallel work is evaluating the relative values of watershed specialists managing many more resources with the watershed. Hydroelectric power is often a key resource complimentary to wind, solar and biomass renewable energy developments; and biomass energy is linked to water supply and agriculture. The August 2014 massive tailings dam failure in British Columbia threatens extensive portions of the Fraser River sockeye salmon run, millions of fish, and there are concerns about long-term contamination of water supplies for many British Columbians. This disaster, and many others that may occur quickly, or challenges like climate and land use change, require water managers to become much more vigilant in protecting our watershed resources.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost in northern latitudes serves as a potential source of carbon (C) upon thaw. The fate of this and other sources of C in arctic and subarctic regions depends on several factors. This study focuses on the influence of hydrologic processes on dissolved C transport to aquatic systems in permafrost environments. The spatial distribution and depth to permafrost are changing in response to climate as a result of direct (solar radiation) and indirect (vegetation, snow cover, soil moisture, wildfire) changes. Furthermore, permafrost thaw may be accelerated by heat transfer via groundwater flow. Such alterations to permafrost configuration, and resulting hydrogeologic framework, have the potential to modify pathways, residence times, and fluxes of water and dissolved constituents. Lengthened flow paths and increased residence times of soil water and groundwater promotes increased mineralization of terrestrial organic matter and subsurface weathering of carbonates. Intensification of groundwater circulation enhances baseflow to rivers and streams as suggested by both observations and modeling studies. These aforementioned changes result in a downward shift in the relationship between dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration and water discharge, an upward shift in the dissolved inorganic C (DIC) concentration – discharge relationship, and a likely decrease in the fraction of biodegradable organic C transported to aquatic systems. However, the expected magnitude and timing of shifts in hydrology and C are dependent on a variety of factors. Drawing from examples in the Yukon River Basin in Alaska (USA), we offer insight on landscape and hydrogeologic characteristics that influence the vulnerability of northern latitude systems to change with respect to hydrology and aquatic C export.",

The RCE defines an equilibrium state of coupling between the surafce and the atmosphere isolated from any large-scale dependence, which were investigated within the single column model of the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD) coupled to a simple bucket land model. This studies emphasizes the role of low-level cloud and the diurnal cylce of the boundary layer on the final state of the system. In the WTG we investigate the coupling between the surface and the atmosphere during the dry and wet season of the Amazon with the WRF model coupled to the NOAH land-surface model. Large-scale coupling is obtained with the WTG. The dry and wet season demonstrate very fundamental behavior: in the dry season deep convection is generated by radiative cooling in the higher troposhere and is disconnected from the surface. In the wet season the coupling between the surface and the atmosphere is much tighter. We suggest that the WTG is a powerful tool to investigate the coupling between the surface and the atmosphere, which solves two major issues: the limited resolution of convection in GCMs and the lack of large-scale coupling in CRM. Later investigation will look at the effect of deforestation, water table and distance from the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Arctic permafrost soils contain vast quantities of ancient organic matter. Numerous studies have shown extensive permafrost thaw and degradation in the Arctic, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported from the mouths of large Arctic rivers – which are expected to integrate processes and changes occurring through their watersheds – has been shown to be predominantly modern. This raises the question, where is the ancient DOC that is mobilized from permafrost thaw and the deepening of the active layer? This study examines DOC radiocarbon age, biolability and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition via FT-ICR-MS in permafrost thaw streams and the Kolyma River mainstem (Northeast Siberia). Ancient permafrost thaw stream DOC is observed to be highly biolabile particularly in comparison to modern Kolyma River mainstem DOC. In conjunction with this high biolability the permafrost thaw stream DOM exhibits large changes in molecular structure, loss of hydrogen rich (energy rich) aliphatic molecules, and production of molecules in the classical area in van Krevelen space associated with riverine DOM. Modern Kolyma River mainstem DOM conversely appears very stable in bioincubations in comparison to ancient permafrost thaw DOM. Thus the apparent offset between mobilization of ancient permafrost derived organic matter and the current predominantly modern age of DOC at the mouth of major Arctic rivers may be explained due to microbial degradation of permafrost derived DOC within the river’s hydrologic residence time.",

            "abstract": "Thawing of ice-rich permafrost results in irregular, depressed landforms known as thermokarst terrain. The significant subsidence leading to thermokarst features can expand lakes, drain lakes, accelerate thaw, disturb the soil column, and promote erosion. Consequently, it affects many permafrost-region processes including vegetation succession, hydrology, and carbon storage and cycling. Many remote sensing studies identify thermokarst landforms and catalog their ever-changing areas. Yet the intrinsic dynamic thermokarst process, namely surface subsidence, remains a challenge to map and is seldom examined using remote sensing methods.\nInterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique that uses a time-series of satellite SAR images to measure cm-level land surface deformation. We demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of space-borne InSAR data to map thermokarst subsidence at a site located near Prudhoe Bay, on the North Slope of Alaska. A pipeline access road was constructed at this site in the 1970s, and is likely to have triggered the thawing of the region’s permafrost, causing subsequent expansion of thermokarst-landform terrain. Our InSAR analysis using ALOS PALSAR images reveals that the thermokarst landforms in this region have undergone up to 10 cm of surface subsidence each summer from 2007 to 2010. This pilot study demonstrates the application of InSAR to map localized mass movement in permafrost terrain. We also illustrate how the effectiveness and accuracy of InSAR measurements are limited by several factors such as loss of interferometric coherence due to fast changes of ground surface conditions, spatial and temporal resolutions of InSAR data, and difficulty separating long-term and seasonal deformation signals.",

As a result, flux monitoring networks are biased towards flat, homogeneous ecosystems. Here, we discuss both the challenges and opportunities presented by efforts to quantify ecosystem mass and energy fluxes in topographically complex sites. An approach for characterizing advection fluxes that relies on data collected from a single tower is described and applied as a case study in a flux monitoring site located in complex and heterogeneous terrain at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (North Carolina, USA). This site experiences significant nocturnal advection of mass and energy driven by downslope drainage flows, and significant daytime horizontal advection driven by the effects of anabatic and katabatic flow regimes on the flux footprint. While the advection regime at Coweeta may be especially challenging, the approach presented here is also relevant for flatter and more homogeneous sites where advection fluxes may be small but nonetheless non-negligible. Having addressed the methodological challenges presented by advection flows, we discuss novel opportunities associated with efforts to monitor ecosystem fluxes in complex sites. In particular, data from Coweeta are leveraged to highlight how topography buffers the site from mesoscale hydro-climatic variability via its influence on precipitation inputs, air and soil temperature, and vapor pressure deficit. We conclude by stressing that advances in flux measurement methodology now permit flux observation campaigns in complex and heterogeneous sites; furthermore, such data may be quite useful for exploring links between terrain, micro-meteorology, and physiological functioning.",

Meanwhile, developments in the theory of wave propagation, numerical methods and HPC systems have enabled unprecedented simulations of seismic wave propagation in realistic 3D Earth models which lead the extraction of more information from data, ultimately culminating in the use of entire three-component seismograms.\nOur aim is to take adjoint tomography further to image the entire planet which is one of the extreme cases in seismology due to its intense computational requirements and vast amount of high-quality seismic data that can potentially be assimilated in inversions. We have started low resolution (T > 27 s, soon will be > 17 s) global inversions with 253 earthquakes for a transversely isotropic crust and mantle model on Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Cray XK7 \"Titan\" system. Recent improvements in our 3D solvers, such as the GPU version of the SPECFEM3D_GLOBE package, will allow us perform higher-resolution (T > 9 s) and longer-duration (~180 m) simulations to take the advantage of high-frequency body waves and major-arc surface waves to improve imbalanced ray coverage as a result of uneven distribution of sources and receivers on the globe. Our initial results after 10 iterations already indicate several prominent features reported in high-resolution continental studies, such as major slabs (Hellenic, Japan, Bismarck, Sandwich, etc.) and enhancement in plume structures (the Pacific superplume, the Hawaii hot spot, etc.). Our ultimate goal is to assimilate seismic data from more than 6,000 earthquakes within the magnitude range 5.5 ≤ Mw ≤ 7.0. To take full advantage of this data set on ORNL’s computational resources, we need a solid framework for managing big data sets during pre-processing (e.g., data requests and quality checks), gradient calculations, and post-processing (e.g., pre-conditioning and smoothing gradients) where we address the bottlenecks in our global seismic workflow based on ORNL’s ADIOS libraries. We will present our “first generation” model, discuss challenges and future directions in global seismology.",

            "abstract": "The physical mechanism responsible for deep earthquakes has been a puzzle since their discovery by Wadati 85 years ago. Today the three most widely accepted mechanisms are dehydration embrittlement (for depths above about 300 km), ‘anticracks’ in metastable olivine (for deeper events), and thermal runaway. Yet, the puzzle remains: no single mechanism seems satisfactory, and having three mechanisms seems contrary to Occams Razor. Where might we look for observations to help resolve this problem?\n One of the 20thcenturies greatest scientific surprises was when seismic data collected during the Apollo projects proved that the Moon was seismically active at depths of 850-1100 km. These deep moonquakes occurred repeatedly within clusters or “nests”, with occurrence times strongly correlated with solid tides. Although they occur under temperature-pressure conditions highly similar to terrestrial earthquakes at depths of ~120 km, it seems unlikely they are caused by dehydration embrittlement, as there is no subduction on the Moon, and possibly little or no water. Must we propose a fourth mechanism for deep quakes? Or are our explanations for terrestrial deep quakes incorrect?\n The development of plate tectonics was one of the 20thcentury science’s great paradigm shifts; one observation it helped explain was why numerous earthquakes with focal depths exceeding 400 km occurred in the mantle in areas like Tonga where very old, fast-moving plates converged. But some “isolated deep earthquakes” are exceptional; these earthquakes occur separated from neighboring events by hundreds of km. Some, like earthquakes in Spain in 1954 and Colombia in 1970, with Mw exceeding 7.5 are among the largest deep-focus earthquakes known, yet occurred singly without any fore- or aftershocks. What physical mechanism allows such large, isolated earthquakes to occur? The tendency is to focus attention on areas like Tonga where the majority of deep events occur. But understanding rare isolated events is equally important if we hope to understand the physical mechanism.\nFigure.

            "abstract": "Neoproterozoic, and possibly Paleoproterozoic, glaciations represent the most extreme climate events in post-Hadean Earth, and may link closely with the evolution of the atmosphere and life. According to the Snowball Earth hypothesis, the entire ocean was covered with ice during these events for a few million years, during which time volcanic CO2 increased enough to cause deglaciation. Geochemical proxy data and geochemical model calculations suggest that the maximum CO2 was 0.01–0.1 by volume, but early climate modeling suggested that the Snowball was not even close to deglaciation at CO2=0.2. Unless resolved, this discrepancy would be problematic for the Snowball Earth hypothesis.\n\nFirst, I will present results from six GCMs suggesting that positive cloud radiative forcing would likely have warmed a Snowball Earth enough to reduce the CO2 required for deglaciation by a factor of 10–100. Next, I will present results from a cloud resolving model run on a small domain that are consistent with the GCM results and allow us to understand the GCM behavior better. The cloud resolving model produces convection that extends vertically to a similar temperature as modern tropical convection. This convection produces clouds that resemble stratocumulus clouds under an inversion on modern Earth, which slowly dissipate by sedimentation of cloud ice. There is enough cloud ice for the clouds to be optically thick in the longwave, and the resulting cloud radiative forcing is similar to that produced in GCMs run in Snowball conditions. This result is robust to large changes in the cloud microphysics scheme because the cloud longwave forcing, which dominates the total forcing, is relatively insensitive to cloud amount and particle size. Taken together, these results from a hierarchy of models suggest that positive cloud radiative forcing would warm a Snowball Earth enough to allow deglaciation at a CO2 consistent with geochemical data.",

            "abstract": "Deep tectonic tremors have been observed together with signals in the very low frequency (VLF) band from 0.02 to 0.05 Hz, which have been identified as VLF events in limited regions of subduction zones. By stacking broadband seismograms relative to the timing of tremors, we can detect similar signals in all regions where tremors occur in western Japan. These signals are inverted to obtain the moment tensor, and the fault-normal and slip vectors are generally consistent with the geometry of the plate interface and the direction of plate motion. Therefore, these signals are probably radiated by shear slip on the plate interface. The ratio between the seismic energy rate estimated from the tremors and seismic moment rate in the VLF band is almost proportional, with a proportionality constant (i.e., scaled energy) of around 10−10. The spatial distribution of scaled energy may reflect spatial variations in the frequency-dependent characteristics of slow deformation.\nThis method is broadly applicable if abundant data are available. We demonstrate that focal mechanisms can be determined using VLF signals for Cascadia and Mexican subduction zones.",

However, seismic observations show enigmatic features in the deep lower mantle, such as, the sharp boundary on the top of the D″ layer, the anticorrelations between VS and VP, the seismic anisotropy, and the existence of large low-shear-velocity provinces. The mineralogical constitution of the Earth’s mantle is fundamental for understanding the geophysical and geochemical properties of this region. Our recent study using laser-heated diamond anvil cell technology coupled with synchrotron x-ray diffraction in-situ at high pressure-temperature and TEM studies of the quenched sample has demonstrated the disproportionation reaction of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 pv to a nearly Fe-free pv and an Fe-rich H-phase with a previously unknown hexagonal structure at 95 to 101 GPa and 2200 to 2400 K, thus fundamentally changing the geochemistry and geophysics of the bottom half of the lower mantle. We suggest that (Mg,Fe)SiO3 pv may not be the major silicate throughout the lower mantle down to the top of the D\" layer. Instead, interpretations for key enigmatic features in the deep lower mantle require the knowledge of the three-phase P-T-x relationship of pv, ppv, and the H-phase.",

A more complete understanding of the underground structures of the Kaoping area is provided and explains why the surrounding regions in Taiwan experience more earthquakes. Data are based on seismic activity recorded by PANDA for the period 1995 to 1997. The difference between S wave and Sp phase arrival times show that the sedimentary layer is thicker along the west and southwest coast. P wave travel time residuals, high frequency attenuation parameters kappa, and quality factor QP, QSand coda waves confirm this result. We also determined the orientation of the Chaochou fault using the first motion of P-waves arrivals. To the east of the Chaochou fault, stress trends southeast-northwest, while to the west, it trends northeast-southwest. The change of stress trends East and West of Chaochou fault suggest the presence of a highly fluid accretionary wedge in the Kaoping area. The Chaochou fault forms a seismically active tectonic boundary with uplift of the hanging wall leading to westward tilting of the basement of the Kaoping plains. We demonstrate these features are why there are relatively few earthquakes in the Kaoping area. The presence of a highly fluid accretionary wedge is indicated by a thick alluvial layer in the west and southwest Kaoping coast; the Peikung High acts as the indenter that may allow seismic energy to escape and reduce the number of earthquakes in the region.",

            "abstract": "We describe two avenues for constraining the sensitivity of the climate system to external perturbations, using present-day observations. The first is physically motivated, based on recently published work showing that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming. However, this result would be wrong if there were an important feedback in the real world that was missing from all the models.\nThe second approach is based on application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to climate models, to predict the three-dimensional equilibrium response to heating perturbations via a statistical model of the system fitted to data from a control run. We expand on previous applications of this technique for such problems by considering multivariate state vectors, showing that this improves skill and makes it possible to train skillful operators on data records of comparable length to what is available from satellite observations. We also present a new methodology for treating non-stationary processes, in particular the existence of a seasonal cycle, and show that we can obtain similar results with a realistic seasonal cycle as with an idealised non-seasonally-varying case. We focus specifically on the ability to predict how clouds in the model will respond to a forced climate change. Results indicate that the fluctuation-dissipation method may prove to be more useful than previously thought for predicting global forces responses from observed variability, although the skill varies significantly depending on the nature of the forcing perturbation.",

            "abstract": "Density-driven convective activity can significantly accelerate the transformation of the injected CO2 from supercritical or gas phase into liquid phase, thus improving the long-term storage security. It is well known that the convective instability is only caused by the heterogeneity of porous medium. However, we found that numerical perturbation resulted from the spatial and temporal discretization and the convergence criteria will affect the modeling results. Partial simulation results as follows: (1) the increase in vertical permeability (kv) has a strong effect on the convection process compared to the increasing horizontal permeability. The higher kv also can accelerate the downward migration of fingers and the CO2 dissolution; (2) increase in magnitude of medium (porosity and permeability) perturbation promotes the onset of convective activity, but does not affect the evolution of convection. However, for same magnitudes of the medium perturbation, the modification in permeability can lead to a more rapid onset of convective activity than that in porosity; and (3) the geochemical reactions and mineral compositions are important not only to the CO2 dissolution, but also to the dissolution of other species from mineral dissolution, which both can increase the water density. In additional, 3D and 2D modeling results indicated that their effect on the convection onset is similar. The CO2 dissolution rate for the higher-resolution 3D model is greatly slower than that for the higher-resolution 2D model, due to the increase in dimension for 3D model enhances the interaction of fingers. However, we found that once the bottom boundary becomes important, the decrease in CO2 dissolution rate for the 2D model is more significant than that for the 3D model. This is because the more significant interaction of fingers in the 3D model than that in the 2D model delays the downward propagation of fingers and then the impact of the bottom boundary.",

The Rwenzori Mtns evolved along the eastern rift shoulder of the Albertine Rift, rising up to form a striking feature within the rift valley with elevations reaching 5109 m a.s.l. While, the scarcity of volcanic activity in the Western Rift has raised questions about the Rwenzori Mtns origin and how this fits into the general evolution of the Albertine Rift and the EARS.\nDetailed thermochronologic study of Bauer et al., (2013) on the eastern side on Rwenzori Mtns, differentiated it into northern and southern blocks. The northern block cooled faster to ~120 °C in Carboniferous to Permian times. The second cooling event to ~70 °C occurred in Mesozoic time. The third cooling event to surface temperature occurred in the Neogene. While, the southern block shows an earlier onset of cooling at >400 Ma. Temperatures of about 70 °C were reached in Silurian to Devonian times.\nDuring this study, 33 samples were collected from the western side of central Rwenzori. Zircon and apatite fission track and (U/Th)-He techniques were applied on these samples. The apatite fission track data could be divided into three age groups; ~45±11, ~25±5, ~12±2 Ma. These results reveal the difference in thermo-tectonic history between the eastern and western flanks of Rwenzori Mtns and support the tilt uplift geometry hypotheses (e.g. Pickford et al., 1993).\n",

However, difficulties encountered in achieving this coupling have proven non-trivial and include both:\n1) Technical challenges. Ocean and atmosphere model components cannot easily handle dynamic boundaries; land surface model components cannot easily simulate exposed glacial ice, firn evolution, or evolving land surfaces; coupling infrastructure cannot easily accept new earth system components; and ice sheet models typically operate at an order of magnitude higher spatial resolution than climate models and on regional domains, and require very long integrations to reach an equilibrium state.\n2) Scientific challenges. The glaciological modeling and climate modeling communities often work on topics that cover very different spatiotemporal scales; carry out research using very different models and with very different modeling paradigms; and do not consider coupled ice-sheet/climate behavior across the various ice-sheet/climate physical interfaces.\nThese technical and scientific challenges are being tackled within the Community Earth System Model. The resulting coupled architecture (“CESM-CISM”) is now capable of simulating the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) in the climate system. The model includes a relatively sophisticated representation of surface mass balance (SMB), explicit resolution of important ice-sheet climate communication pathways, and prognostic ice dynamics. First results, underpinned by modelled SMB validation, have explored changes in GrIS mean SMB and its variability, partially-coupled GrIS evolution, and emergence of an anthropogenic signal in SMB under RCP8.5 climate forcing. Ongoing work with the evolving CESM-CISM will set the stage for fully-coupled simulations of Greenland in past and future climates, and also for potential integration of the Antarctic ice sheet into a true coupled modeling framework.",

            "abstract": "In climate modeling, an unexpected result is usually wrong, arising from some sort of mistake. Despite the fact that we all bemoan uncertainty in climate, the field is underlain by a robust, successful body of theory and any properly conducted modeling experiment is posed and conducted within that context. Consequently, if results from a complex climate model disagree with theory or from expectations from simpler models, much skepticism is in order. But, this exposes the fundamental tension of using complex, sophisticated models. If simple models and theory were perfect there would be no reason for complex models--the entire point of sophisticated models is to see if unexpected phenomena arise as emergent properties of the system.\nIn this talk, I will step through some paleoclimate examples, drawn from my own work, of unexpected results that emerge from complex climate models arising from mistakes of two kinds. The first kind of mistake, is what I call a 'smart mistake'; it is an intentional incorporation of assumptions, boundary conditions, or physics that is in violation of theoretical or observational constraints. The second mistake, a 'dumb mistake', is just that, an unintentional violation. Analysis of such mistaken simulations provides some potentially novel and certainly interesting insights into what is possible and right in paleoclimate modeling by forcing the reexamination of well-held assumptions and theories.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater use is increasing in many parts of the world due to population pressure and reduced availability of surface water and rainfall. California’s Central Valley and southern Arizona in particular have experienced subsidence in many groundwater basins in recent years due to groundwater overdraft. In order to make informed decisions for adaptation, water resource managers need to know the extent of groundwater depletion, both spatially and volumetrically, and to be able to monitor it over long periods. Water wells provide one solution, but owing to remoteness, funding limitations, a lack of wells, and the difficulty of mandating government monitoring of private wells, less direct methods are necessary. Mapping and monitoring subsidence and rebound from orbit with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) may provide important indicators of groundwater state and dynamics for water resource managers as well as warnings of potential damage to infrastructure.\nWe are working with water resource managers at the California Department of Water Resources to produce and update maps of subsidence ‘hot-spots’ where subsidence threatens to cause irreversible aquifer compaction and loss of groundwater storage capacity.\nIn the future, Germany’s TerraSAR-X, Italy’s Cosmo SkyMed, Japan’s PALSAR-2, Europe’s Sentinels, and NASA’s NISAR offer the promise of extending the time series of observations and expanding this capability to regions of the world with no effective means to monitor the state of their groundwater. This would provide societal benefits to large segments of the global population dependent on groundwater to bridge gaps in surface and rain water supply. As Earth’s climate changes, monitoring of this critical resource will help reduce conflicts over water.\n* Work performed under contract to NASA",

            "abstract": "The records of nitrate concentration and its isotopic composition (δ15N, δ18O and Δ17O) in ice cores are sought to reconstruct past levels of atmospheric NOx, the natural variability in NOx sources, and variations in tropospheric oxidants. However, these practices have been hampered by post-depositional processing of snow nitrate, which alters snow nitrate concentrations as well as its isotopic composition. Snow accumulation rates influence the degree of post-depositional processing. At sites with high snow accumulation rates, such as Summit, Greenland, the degree of post-depositional processing is thought to be minimal. Thus, variations in δ15N(NO3-) in Summit ice cores have been linked to NOx source changes, assuming the conservation of nitrogen isotope signatures during the conversion of NOx to nitrate. However, the marked decrease in δ15N(NO3-) from ~1850 to 1970 observed in Summit ice cores is difficult to explain by the addition of anthropogenic NOx to the natural background, as higher atmospheric δ15N(NO3-) values are frequently observed in polluted regions compared to pristine regions. Alternatively, we hypothesized that this decrease can be explained by changes in atmospheric acidity. Atmospheric acidity influences the partitioning of nitrate in gas- and aerosol-phases, inducing isotopic effects. Increased atmospheric acidity beginning ~ 1850 arising from anthropogenic SO2 emissions leads to elevated gas-phase HNO3 which is depleted in δ15N relative to aerosol nitrate. The preferential transport of HNO3 to the Arctic then leads to a decrease in ice core δ15N(NO3-). This hypothesis is supported by the significant correlation between δ15N(NO3-) and acidity records, and is supported by a model simulation. The result of this study indicates the importance of atmospheric processes to ice core δ15N(NO3-), and suggests that the link between ice core δ15N(NO3-) and NOx sources could be problematic even at high snow accumulation sites. In addition, our δ15N(NO3-) measurements in Summit ice cores expanding to the glacial-interglacial timescale indicate clear evidence of the effects of post-depositional processing, making it even more difficult to link ice core δ15N(NO3-) variations to NOx source changes.",

            "abstract": "Assessments of projected climate change impacts on water resources at local-to-regional scales typically use a combination of numerical models for evaluating the various differences in projected effects resulting from different driving emissions scenarios and different climate models. Regional climate models, used to describe how large-scale changes in the Earth system effect change in the local or regional climate, and hydrologic models, used to describe how changes in local or regional climate effect change in local or regional hydrologic processes, are both typically used in these assessments. However, with both model types, assessments most often include only one or a small number of different models, and inter-model differences are often not constrained to define the uncertainties in the simulations consistently. More generally, the impacts assessment modeling community has focused very intently on characterizing uncertainty in climate projections using multiple climate models and multiple emission scenarios, doing less work to characterize and understand uncertainties in the regional climate and hydrologic models, and their important interactions, for impacts assessment and local-to-regional scale decision-making.\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers is working with partners on a number of projects to help provide fuller characterizations of some previously undescribed uncertainties with the goal of helping inform its local-to-regional applications. Some salient results from those projects include: (1) choice of methods to produce gridded meteorological fields can have effects on projected hydrologic outcomes as large as the climate change signal; (2) many statistical downscaling methods popular in the water management community produce hydroclimate representations with too much drizzle, too small extreme events, and improper representation of spatial scaling characteristics relevant to hydrology; and (3) outcomes depend significantly on subjective decisions made in calibrating hydrologic models, such as the choice of forcing data, the choice of calibration scheme, and the choice of objective function. This presentation will explain these and other results from testing model uncertainties and will suggest possible decision outcomes which can be sensitive to those uncertainties.",

Examples of applications at different scales ranging from the monitoring of small changes at unprecedented level of detail (e.g. sub millimeter-scale deformation under lab-scale conditions) to the detection of slope deformation at regional scale. In this communication we will show the main accomplishments of the Swiss National Foundation project “Characterizing and analysing 3D temporal slope evolution“ carried out at Risk Analysis group (Univ. of Lausanne) in close collaboration with the RISKNAT and INTERES groups (Univ. of Barcelona and Univ. of Alicante, respectively).\nWe have recently developed a series of innovative approaches for rock slope analysis using 3D point clouds, some examples include: the development of semi-automatic methodologies for the identification and extraction of rock-slope features such as discontinuities, type of material, rockfalls occurrence and deformation. Moreover, we have been improving our knowledge in progressive rupture characterization thanks to several algorithms, some examples include the computing of 3D deformation, the use of filtering techniques on permanently based TLS, the use of rock slope failure analogies at different scales (laboratory simulations, monitoring at glacier’s front, etc.), the modelling of the influence of external forces such as precipitation on the acceleration of the deformation rate, etc. We have also been interested on the analysis of rock slope deformation prior to the occurrence of fragmental rockfalls and the interaction of this deformation with the spatial location of future events.\nIn spite of these recent advances, a great challenge still remains in the development of new algorithms for more accurate techniques for 3D point cloud treatment (e.g. filtering, segmentation, etc.) aiming to improve rock slope characterization and monitoring, a series of exciting research findings are expected in the forthcoming years.",

Here we describe derivation and use of spatiotemporally varying fields of multi-modal aerosol size distributions for 60-hour simulations of boundary-layer clouds observed over Oklahoma during the RACORO campaign. Cases include forced as well as freely convecting shallow clouds, and some warm precipitation.

We evaluate this Southern Ocean ASR bias and its climate implications using experiments from one climate model (CESM-CAM5). We hypothesize that the excessive ASR bias in our model is due in part to insufficient supercooled liquid water in parameterized low-level shallow convective clouds. To test this hypothesis, we implement cloud phase diagnostics and compare the climate model with CALIPSO spaceborne lidar observations following Cesana et al. 2013. Guided by the satellite observation comparisons, we complete model experiments in which we increase the amount of supercooled liquid in the detrained condensate from the shallow convection scheme. Finally, we assess the mean state and climate feedback implications of increased supercooled liquid water in the modeled clouds. Our findings show that increasing supercooled liquid water in shallow convective clouds reduces Southern Ocean ASR biases, shifts tropical rain belts, and can alter global mean radiation balance sufficiently to cause runaway global cooling. In summary, Southern Ocean ASR has an appreciable influence on global radiation balance and is an important but challenging target for climate model bias reduction.",

Models and observation indicate that the increased ice discharge causing these losses is driven by a complex ice-ocean interaction in response to increased transport of circum-polar deep water beneath ice shelf cavities.\nGlacier speedups tend to occur as a series of stepwise increases, in some cases separated by a few decades or more. Between such speedups, the spatial pattern of thinning evolves considerably. The spatio-temporal variation of the thinning is important because it determines the rate of grounding-line retreat. For example, if thinning remains concentrated at the coast, grounding-line retreat will occur more rapidly. By contrast, if thinning rapidly diffuses inland, then grounding lines can maintain fixed positions for longer intervals.\nWe applied a shallow-shelf ice flow model to examine the annual- to decadal-scale variation of thinning in response to varying degrees of ocean melting. The results show that the pattern of thinning evolves at annual time scales. Ungrounding initially produces strong speedups near the grounding line accompanied by stretching that concentrates thinning at the coast. This thinning, however, quickly influences flow farther inland. As a consequence, thinning diffuses inland, causing near grounding-line thinning to decline sharply. The rate of ocean melting plays an important role in this evolution. The model results agree well with observations of thinning. In addition to improving our understanding of grounding line dynamics, such models are important for providing the context in which to interpret the relatively short (~20 year) observational record.",

            "abstract": "Arctic lakes are ice-covered nine months of the year during which time greenhouse gases increase in near bottom waters and increased discharge associated with snowmelt supplies additional greenhouse gases and dissolved organic carbon into the lakes. We tested the hypothesis that evasion of greenhouse gases depends on the duration of the mixing period after ice off by quantifying the greenhouse gases produced over the winter, those introduced at snowmelt, and those remaining after stratification set up in five lakes in the Alaskan Arctic whose area ranged from 1 ha to 150 ha. Horizontal CTD and oxygen transects taken in one lake while the lake was ice covered and afterwards illustrated the path of incoming snowmelt water, numerous locations with hypoxia, and gravity current formation due to warming of bottom waters under the ice which also moderated stratification dynamics. Temperature-gradient microstructure profiling prior to and after ice off illustrated limited mixing despite heating when ice was present and winds after ice off. None of the lakes had fully mixed at ice off. The fraction of carbon dioxide emitted in spring depended on intensity of wind, density stratification, and lake morphometry, as described by the Lake number, and time for stratification to set up. We hypothesize that the fraction of methane which evades can be quantified by dimensionless indices which incorporate residence time and reaction times. Use of dimensionless numbers which incorporate hydrodynamics and rates of biogeochemical reactions enable scaling up across the landscape.",

            "abstract": "Water storage can be a viable part of the solution to water conservation. This means that we should include reservoirs. Regardless, one should evaluate all aspects of water conservation principles. Recent drought in California indicates that there is an urgent need to re-visit the techniques used to maintain the water supply-chain mechanism in the entire state. We all recognize the fact that fish and wildlife depend on the streams, rivers and wetlands for survival. It is a well-known fact that there is an immediate need to provide solid protection to all these resources. Laws and regulations should help meet the needs of natural systems. Farmers may be forced to drilling wells deeper than ever. But, they will be eventually depleting groundwater reserves. Needless to say that birds, fish and wildlife cannot access these groundwater table. California is talking a lot about conservation. Unfortunately, the conservation efforts have not established a strong visible hold. The Environmental Protection Agency has a plan called E2PLAN (Narayanan, 2012). It is EPA’s plan for achieving energy and environmental performance, leadership, accountability, and carbon neutrality. In June 2011, the EPA published a comprehensive, multi-year planning document called Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan.

            "abstract": "Large igneous provinces (LIPs), which are commonly associated with supercontinental break-up, are the product of the emplacement of >106 km3 of mafic rocks in less than a few million years. LIP magmatism, in particular continental flood basalt (CFB) volcanism, perturbs global climate on shorter time scales through the radiative effects of degassed SO2 and CO2. On longer time scales, CFBs alter climate through the effect of the high weatherabilty of mafic rocks (5–10 times greater than average continental crust) on global silicate weathering. A link between flood basalt weathering, Rodinia break-up, and Neoproterozoic snowball glaciation has been postulated. Here we present a new compilation of Nd isotope data on Neoproterozoic mudstones from Laurentia, Australia, and South China along with a new seawater strontium isotope record from well preserved carbonates that support this hypothesis. These datasets are consistent with an outsized role of basalt weathering on the global silicate weathering budget during the second half of the Tonian period (~850 to 725 Ma). Along with Os isotope data, they also suggest that an additional pulse of basalt weathering at the end of the Tonian may have initiated the Sturtian snowball glaciation. CFBs have relatively high concentrations of phosphorous. Hence, the drawdown in atmospheric CO2 required to trigger the Sturtian snowball Earth was likely accomplished through a combination of increased silicate weathering rates and enhanced biological productivity driven by greater nutrient supply to the oceans. CFBs were also the likely source of the iron in Neoproterozoic iron formation (IF), all significant occurrences of which are restricted to Sturtian-aged glacial successions. Dramatic declines in εNd following the Cryogenian snowball glaciations are mirrored by stepwise increases in 87Sr/86Sr, reflecting the scouring of the continents by global ice sheets. This continental resurfacing removed the extensive basalt carapace as well as infertile regolith which had developed in the interior of the long-lived supercontinent and eliminated the unique driving mechanism for Cryogenian snowball glaciation.",

            "abstract": "The transition to a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean has attracted much attention, but climate model simulations in CMIP5 vary widely in their prediction of when we will reach a summer ice-free state. To quantify the contribution of internal variability to the spread of projections and to assess the limit of predictability of the year we will reach a summer ice-free Arctic we will present results from the new Large Ensemble with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The CESM is a state of the art climate system model that has shown skill in capturing the observed decline of Arctic sea ice. The CESM Large Ensemble has 30 members for 1920-2100 that only differ through round-of level perturbations in the initial state. It is an unprecedented opportunity to analyze the contribution of natural variability to the simulated climate evolution within one model, as it provides enough ensemble members to characterize the probability distribution of many climate phenomena. Focusing on Arctic sea ice predictability, we find that the individual ensemble members first reach an ice-free Arctic in September (defined as a sea ice extent of 1 million km2) over a period of 21 years (2032-2053), with the majority of the ensemble members first reaching September ice-free conditions in the 5-year period from 2040-2044. This large spread shows the large impact of internal variability on the timing of reaching an ice-free Arctic, which severely limits the predictability of a summer ice-free Arctic we can expect from CMIP-type climate models. In addition to results on the predictability of an ice-free Arctic, we will also present results on the probability of hiatus periods in sea ice loss and of rapid ice loss events (RILEs), based on the CESM large ensemble.",

            "abstract": "We have studied the effect of σ2 on failure characteristics of two crystalline and three clastic rocks subjected to true triaxial stresses. Common to all rocks tested is the rise in both strain localization onset and σ1 at failure (σ1,peak) for a given σ3, as σ2 is elevated beyond its base level (σ2 = σ3). σ1,peak reaches a maximum at some level of σ2, beyond which it gradually declines, approaching its base magnitude when σ2 nears its own maximum. Failure-plane angle with respect to σ1 for a given σ3 also increases with σ2, at least until the maximum σ1,peak is reached.\nWesterly granite (Haimson and Chang, IJRMMS, 2000) and KTB amphibolite (Chang and Haimson, JGR, 2000), exhibited a dramatic σ2 effect: at low σ3 (20-30 MPa), higher σ2 lifted σ1,peak by up to 50% over its base level. At high σ3, the increase in σ1,peak was reduced, but even at σ3 = 100 MPa, maximum σ1,peak in both rocks was over 20% higher than its base level. Failure mode remained brittle throughout the stress range tested, but the onset of dilatancy rose with σ2, as did the failure-plane (shear-band) angle (by up to 20°).\nA gentler effect of σ2 on σ1, peak and failure-plane angle was observed in the clastics, and that effect subsided as porosity increased. In low porosity (φ = 7%) TCDP siltstone (Oku, et al, GRL, 2007), the maximum σ1,peak at σ3 = 25 MPa was about 30% larger than at σ2 = σ3 level, and only 12.5% larger at σ3 = 100 MPa. Failure mode stayed brittle throughout, but shear-band angle increase with σ2 was limited to about 10°, irrespective of σ3 level. An even smaller σ2 effect was observed in Coconino sandstone (φ = 17%) (Ma, PhD thesis, 2014). σ1,peak reached a maximum of about 10% higher than at σ2 = σ3 level; failure-plane angle rise with σ2 was less than 10°. The weakest σ2 effect was found in the high porosity (φ= 25%) Bentheim sandstone (Ma, PhD thesis, 2014). Here σ1, peak reached a maximum of well under 10% higher than its base magnitude, regardless of σ3 level; average failure-plane angle rise with σ2 was below 10°. Failure at σ3 = 150 MPa was along a compaction band(s) normal to σ1, regardless of σ2. Both Coconino and Bentheim underwent dilatant failure at low σ3, shifting to compactive failure at high σ3 levels. But σ2 also affected the failure mode: compactive failure at σ2 = σ3 gradually reverted to a dilatant mode as σ2 was raised.",

            "abstract": "When detected, seismic anisotropy can potentially be an indicator of mantle flow and thus can help us discriminating different geodynamical processes and competitive thermo‐chemical convective models of the Earth’s interior. However, the imaging and interpretation of global anisotropy is challenging. For example, Ferreira et al. (2010) reported that a data misfit reduction of only around 2% is obtained when lateral variations in radial anisotropy in global tomographic inversions are included compared to inversions only allowing 1-D variations in anisotropy. This small misfit reduction is comparable to the effect on data misfit of using different crustal corrections, thereby indicating a strong influence of the crust in the models. We discuss new high-resolution (degree 35) inversions for models of 3-D isotropic and radially anisotropic shear-wave velocity in the whole mantle incorporating crustal thickness perturbations as model parameters in the inversions to properly consider crustal effects. We use a massive data set of over 43 million surface-wave and 420,000 body-wave measurements from several published studies with complementary sensitivities to Earth’s structure. It includes relatively short period group velocity data down to T~16 s that constrain crustal thickness. We find that the various datasets used are highly complementary, allowing us to achieve good resolution in isotropic structure in the whole mantle and throughout the upper ~1,400 km of the mantle for anisotropic structure. Our images of isotropic structure share common features with previous 3-D S-velocity models, such as high-velocity anomalies beneath cratons and subduction zones. The anisotropic models are consistent with various persistent features in previous regional studies of radial anisotropy and show some peculiar features near subduction zones in the transition zone. We discuss these features and their potential implications, as well as the challenges and outlook for the next generation of global 3-D anisotropy models.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations from station ALOHA have framed a new paradigm about the dynamic nature of subtropical ocean gyres. These vast regions are now known to vary physically and biologically, over a range of timescales, with important implications for the export of carbon to the deep ocean. In the largest of these gyres, the North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG), primary production has increased in recent decades despite a reduction in nutrient supply to surface waters. This is thought to be the result of a shift in plankton community structure from mostly eukaryotes to mostly dinitrogen-fixing prokaryotes. It remains uncertain, however, whether the recent plankton community domain shift can be linked to cyclical climate variability or a long-term global warming trend. To establish historical trends, we analyzed nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) isotopic records preserved in the skeletons of extraordinarily long-lived, proteinaceous deep-sea corals, which feed on, and therefore serve as a proxy for, exported productivity. Specimens of Hawaiian gold coral (Kulamanamana haumeaae) were collected from the Hawaiian archipelago and sampled across the skeletal growth rings to generate high-resolution (5 yr), millennial-length records of “bulk” δ15N and δ13C. After a millennium of relatively minor fluctuation, δ15N decreased by up to 2 per mil between 1850 and the present. Analysis of amino-acid-specific δ15N on a subset of the samples, combined with isotopic mass balance between nitrate and nitrogen fixation, implied a 17 to 27 % increase in nitrogen fixation as the underlying cause for the observed trends. This interpretation is supported by analysis of the δ13C of essential amino acids, which serve as isotopic fingerprints of primary producer origin. Together, these independent lines of evidence describe a domain shift from a dominantly eukaryotic to dinitrogen-fixing prokaryotic plankton community. This shift has been ongoing since the end of the Little Ice Age, concurrent with increasing temperatures in the northern hemisphere, and most likely the result of increasing stratification and nutrient limitation in the NPSG. These results highlight the value of novel paleo-archives combined with amino-acid-specific isotope methods in addressing unresolved problems in marine biogeochemistry and climate change.",

To further evaluate the influence of seawater temperature on elemental and isotopic incorporation during biomineralization, A. islandica shells were grown at constant temperatures under two regimes during a 16-week period from March 27 to July 21, 2011. Seawater from the Darling Marine Center in Walpole, Maine was pumped into temperature and flow controlled tanks that were exposed to ambient food and salinity conditions. A total of 20 individual juvenile clams with an average shell height of 36 mm were stained with calcein (a commonly used biomarker) and cultured at 10.3 ± 0.3 °C for six weeks. After this, shell heights were measured and the clams were again stained with calcein and cultured at 15.0 ± 0.4 °C for an additional 9.5 weeks. The average shell growth during the first phase of the experiment was 2.4 mm with a linear extension rate of 0.40 mm/week. The average shell growth during the second phase of the experiment was 3.2 mm with an extension rate of 0.34 mm/week. Average salinity values were 30.2 ± 0.7 and 30.7 ±0.7 in the first and second phases of the experiment, respectively. Oxygen isotopes from the cultured seawater were collected throughout the experiment and provide the basis for establishing if shells grew in oxygen isotopic equilibrium. Elemental ratios (primarily Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) in the aragonitic shells were determined via laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), while stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios were measured using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Continuous sampling within and across the temperature conditions (from 10 °C to 15 °C) coupled with the calcein markings provides the ability to place each sample into a precise temporal framework. The results from these culture experiments will provide insight on biomineralization processes in A. islandica and further establish the utility of this archive in environmental studies.",

            "abstract": "In this work, we use the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (Nu-WRF) model to study the effect of absorbing aerosol (dust and black carbon) on the short-term predictability (1-7 days) of the South Asian monsoon rainfall and cloud system. Two sets of 7-day forecasting experiments were conducted with and without aerosol radiative forcing. Each set consists of 34 7-day forcasts with initial conditions from daily reanalysis and GEOS-5 aerosol distribution (only for aerosol run) from June 11- July 14, 2008. Comparing the aerosol and no-aerosol runs, we find that aerosol-monsoon coupling induces a complex interaction among direct, indirect and semi-direct effects, strongly mediated by atmospheric dynamical feedbacks, resulting in substantial changes in the spatial and temporal distributions and magnitudes of the surface and atmospheric radiation balance, atmospheric stability, and moisture convergence. The net effect is a non-local system-wide response of monsoon rainfall and cloudiness, with respect to the region of maximum aerosol loading, characterized by a northward shift of the monsoon rain and cloud systems toward the Himalaya foothills, and eastern shift towards the Bay of Bengal, and reduction in rainfall over central India, consistent with the EHP hypothesis. The possible impacts of aerosol on diurnal cycle and modulating wet and dry monsoon spells will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The 22 March 2014 landslide near Oso, Washington rapidly moved a large volume of material (~8 million m^3), resulting in the efficient generation of seismic waves that were recorded over 350 km away. Analysis of these seismic signals significantly improves our understanding of the dynamics and timing of events. In contrast to the double couple mechanism of earthquakes, at long periods, the equivalent mechanism of a landslide is a single force. Inversion of the long-period waves for the forces exerted on the earth by the landslide yields a time-series that peaks at nearly 10^10 N and lasts ~1.5 minutes. This result, when combined with higher-frequency wave analysis, eyewitness reports, and field observations, implies a complex failure sequence. The earliest force pulses begin before the buildup in high-frequency energy, suggesting the slide began coherently before transitioning within a minute into the highly disrupted and destructive debris-avalanche flow that killed 43 people. This transition may have been due to a collapse of additional material that loaded the material downslope.\nSeismically observable “aftershock” landslides continued for weeks. The first and largest occurred a few minutes after the main failure sequence, and was followed by 15 more over the next ~4 hours that were observable at the closest seismic station (11 km away). Three USGS “spiders” equipped with GPS and seismic sensors were deployed by helicopter 10 days later as part of a monitoring effort. Due to their proximity, these seismometers detected signals from even minor collapses, some visually identified by human observers. This augmented network revealed interesting temporal patterns in the post-slide activity, which was dominated by sloughing of material from the headscarp, but also creep of the upper block of the failure mass at a rate of about 1 cm/day. This study shows the value of seismic analysis in landslide investigations to provide timing constraints and help improve our understanding of landslide dynamics.",

In fact, Los Humeros, is the third more important geothermal field in Mexico.\nIn this work, we used InSAR to estimate the surface deformation on the caldera, aiming to contribute to its modeling and to help preventing subsidence related hazards on the geothermal field and surroundings.\nOn this study, we calculated 34 interferograms from 21 SAR images of the ENVISAT European Space Agency Mission. The analysis of the interferograms, allow us to detect, decorrelation of the interferometric signal increased, when time spans were greater than 70 days. Also, for those with good signal correlation, the atmospheric signal dominated the interferogram, masking completely the deformation. Moreover, residual orbital ramps were detected, in some of the calculated interferograms. An algorithm capable to remove all the interferogram signal contributions but the deformation related, has been implemented.\nResulting deformation and its correlation with several variables like the geology, the hydrogeology and the seismic records, were analysed through its integration in a Geographic Information System.",

            "abstract": "We study the effect of a thermal forcing confined to the midlatitudes of one hemisphere on the eddy-driven jet in the opposite hemisphere. We demonstrate the existence of an “interhemispheric teleconnection,” whereby warming (cooling) the Northern Hemisphere causes both the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and the Southern Hemispheric midlatitude jet to shift northward (southward). The interhemispheric teleconnection is effected by a change in the asymmetry of the Hadley cells: as the ITCZ shifts away from the Equator, the cross-equatorial Hadley cell intensifies, fluxing more momentum toward the subtropics and sustaining a stronger subtropical jet. Changes in subtropical jet strength, in turn, alter the propagation of extratropical waves into the tropics, affecting eddy momentum fluxes and the eddy-driven westerlies. The relevance of this mechanism is demonstrated in the context of future climate change simulations, where shifts of the ITCZ are significantly related to shifts of the Southern Hemispheric eddy-driven jet in austral winter. The possible relevance of the proposed mechanism to paleoclimates is discussed, particularly with regard to theories of ice age terminations.",

Solar flares commonly occur in active regions where these sunspots exist therefore boosting the p-mode power. In our current study of analyzing p-modes in the chromosphere we study the time evolution of acoustic p-mode oscillation data taken from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Hα, and investigate the p-modes across the frequency band (1 < ν < 8.33 mHz). This study entails three active regions directly over sunspots, with accompanying flaring activity from two solar flares, occurring on June 13th and July 12th, 2012. Our analysis utilizes time series data to create Fourier power spectra of individual pixels spatially resolved around the flare region, to study the frequency bands. We then study how the frequency distribution evolves temporally by constructing a Power Map Movie (PMM) of the regions. From these PMMs we can take a survey of the chromospheric oscillations for each frequency band. We found that the intensity of the flare has an effect on the behavior of the p-modes within different frequency bands. The suppression of power was observed in dark anomalous structures within the PMMs and in other regions there was an observed boost in power due to flaring activity.",

            "abstract": "Existing global and continental scale river models, mainly designed for integrating with global climate model, are of very course spatial resolutions and they lack many important hydrological processes, such as overbank flow, irrigation diversion, groundwater seepage/recharge, which operate at a much finer resolution. Thus, these models are not suitable for producing streamflow forecast at fine spatial resolution and water accounts at sub-catchment levels, which are important for water resources planning and management at regional and national scale. A large-scale river system model has been developed and implemented for water accounting in Australia as part of the Water Information Research and Development Alliance between Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and CSIRO. The model, developed using node-link architecture, includes all major hydrological processes, anthropogenic water utilisation and storage routing that influence the streamflow in both regulated and unregulated river systems. It includes an irrigation model to compute water diversion for irrigation use and associated fluxes and stores and a storage-based floodplain inundation model to compute overbank flow from river to floodplain and associated floodplain fluxes and stores. An auto-calibration tool has been built within the modelling system to automatically calibrate the model in large river systems using Shuffled Complex Evolution optimiser and user-defined objective functions. The auto-calibration tool makes the model computationally efficient and practical for large basin applications. The model has been implemented in several large basins in Australia including the Murray-Darling Basin, covering more than 2 million km2. The results of calibration and validation of the model shows highly satisfactory performance. The model has been operalisationalised in BoM for producing various fluxes and stores for national water accounting.\nThis paper introduces this newly developed river system model describing the conceptual hydrological framework, methods used for representing different hydrological processes in the model and the results and evaluation of the model performance. The operational implementation of the model for water accounting is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater recharge is an essential hydrology component for sustainable water withdrawal from an aquifer. The Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) is the largest (~1.2 million km2) transboundary groundwater reservoir in South America, supplying freshwater to four countries: Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. However, recharge in the GAS outcrop zones is one of the least known hydrological variables, in part because studies from hydrological data are scarce or nonexistent. We assess recharge using the water-budget as the difference of precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET). Data is derived from remotely sensed estimates of P (TRMM 3B42 V7) and ET (MOD16) in the Onça Creek watershed over the 2004­–12 period. This is an upland-flat watershed (slope steepness < 1%) dominated by sand soils and representative of the GAS outcrop zones. We compared the remote sensing approach against Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method and another water-budget using ground-based measurements. Uncertainty propagation analysis were also performed. On monthly basis, TRMM P exhibited a great agreement with ground-based P data (R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 41 mm). Historical (2004–12) mean(±sd) satellite-based recharge (Rsat) was 537(±224) mm y-1, while ground-based recharge using water-budget (Rgr) and WTF (Rwtf) method was 469 mm y-1 and 311(±150) mm y-1, respectively. We found that ~440 mm y-1 is a reasonable historical mean (between Rsat, Rgr and Rwtf) recharge for the study area over 2004–2012 period. The latter mean recharge estimate is about 29% of the mean historical P (1,514 mm y-1). Our results provide the first insight about an intercomparison of water budget from remote sensing and measured data to estimate recharge in the GAS outcrop zone. These results should be useful for future studies on assessing recharge in the GAS outcrop zones. Since accurate and precise recharge estimation still is a gap, our recharge satellite-based is considered acceptable for the Onça Creek watershed.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic models of supercontinent assembly and dispersal should strive to emulate kinematic histories obtained from the geologic record; but the breakup of Pangea and initial assembly of Amasia, at 200-0 Ma, are the only phases of an alleged \"cycle\" that are known with good precision. Pre-Mesozoic reconstructions (i.e., 95% of Earth history) must rely on typically non-unique geological comparisons between extant continental fragments, guided by sparse paleomagnetic data from those blocks. Pangea assembly and evolution (500-200 Ma) are known in broad terms, but uncertainties of order 10-20° arc distance are common. The transition from Rodinia breakup to incipient Pangea assembly (Gondwana amalgamation; 700-500 Ma) is the least understood interval of global kinematics from the past two billion years, with uncertainties occasionally nearing 90°, and raising the geophysical specters of non-dipole geomagnetic field geometries and/or rapid true polar wander oscillations. Various Rodinia reconstructions (900-700 Ma) share many common features, but they are upheld by a rather lean dataset, by comparison to Pangea. The assembly stage of Rodinia (1300-900 Ma) derives its substantial uncertainty from questions concerning not only the supercontinent's end-configuration as noted above, but also the reconstruction of its predecessor Nuna (1600-1300 Ma), which has made much recent progress though likewise based on relatively limited data. Nuna's assembly phase (2000-1600 Ma) is a fruitful frontier for global reconstruction hypotheses at their earliest stages of development. Older intervals (2700-2000 Ma) will likely soon yield some insights into whether an earlier possible supercontinent, Kenorland, may have existed; but gaining even a broad outline of its reconstruction will be hard-fought, probably over decades, against dwindling Archean preservation. Today's geodynamic modelers of supercontinental episodicity should consider these noteworthy uncertainties as they assess whether their models are \"Earth-like.\" Explorations into neglected corners of parameter space may shed light not only onto possible dynamic evolutions of exoplanets, but perhaps also to our own planet in deep time.",

            "abstract": "Fire is the main ecological disturbance controlling forest development in the boreal forests of Siberia and contributing substantially to the global carbon cycle. The warmer and dryer climate observed recently in the boreal forests is considered to be responsible for extreme fire weather, resulting in higher fire frequency, larger areas burned, and an increase of fire severity. Because of the increase of fire activity, boreal forests in some regions may not be able to reach maturity before they re-burn, which means less carbon will be stored in the ecosystem and more will remain in the atmosphere. Moreover, if one fire occurs within a few years of another, some stands will not re-grow at all, and even more carbon will accumulate in the atmosphere. Zabaikalye region located in the south of Siberia is characterized by the highest fire activity in Russia. With a use of the satellite-based fire product we found that there are about 7.0 million hectares in the region burned repeatedly during the last decade. We have investigated a number of sites in-situ in light-coniferous (Scots pine and larch) forests and evaluated the impacts of repeated fires on fuel loads, carbon emissions, and tree regeneration. Substantial decrease of carbon stocks, change of the vegetation structure and composition, and soil erosion were observed in many areas disturbed by repeated fires. At drier sites located in the southern regions repeated fires prohibited successful regeneration and resulted in forest conversion to grassland. Detection and monitoring of changes in the areas of Siberia where repeated fires have caused a major shift in ecosystem structure and function is required for the development of sustainable forest management strategies to mitigate climate change.

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional inversion are the key process in gravity exploration. In the commonly used scheme of inversion, the subsurface of the earth is usually divided into many small prism blocks (or grids) with variable density values. A key task in gravity inversion is to calculate the composite fields (gravity and gravity gradient tensor) generated by all these grids, this is known as forward modeling. In general forward modeling is memory-demanding and time-consuming. One scheme to rapidly calculate the fields is to implement it in Fourier domain and use fast Fourier transform algorithm. The advantage of the Fourier domain method is, obviously, much faster. However, the intrinsic edge effect of the Fourier domain method degrades the precision of the calculated fields.\nWe have developed an innovative scheme to directly calculate the fields in spatial domain. There are two key points in this scheme. One key point is spatial discretization. Spatial convolution formula is discretized using an approach similar to normal difference method. A key idea during discretization is to use the analytical formula of a cubic prism, and this makes the resultant discrete formula have clear physical meaning: it embodies the superposition principle of the fields and is the exact formula to calculate the fields generated by all grids. The discretization only requires the grids have the same dimension in horizontal directions, and grids in different layers may have different dimension in vertical direction, and this offers more flexibility for inversion. Another key point is discrete convolution calculation. We invoke a high efficient two-dimensional discrete convolution algorithm, and it guarantees both time-saving and memory-saving. Its memory cost has the same order as the number of grids. Numerical test result shows that for a model with a dimension of 1000x1000x201 grids, it takes about 300s to calculate the fields on 1000x1000 field points in a personal computer with 3.4-GHz CPU (Code is carried out on Matlab), and the calculated fields is almost identical with the analytical solutions.\nThe above spatial scheme can also be used to calculate geomagnetic field and its gradient tensor. With limited extra-effort, it even can be used to conduct the forward modeling for the electromagnetic field.",

            "abstract": "Because of the properties of gravity data, it is made difficult to solve the problem of multiple solutions. There are two main types of 3D gravity inversion methods：One of two methods is based on the improvement of the instability of the sensitive matrix, solving the problem of multiple solutions and instability in 3D gravity inversion. Another is to join weight function into the 3D gravity inversion iteration. Through constant iteration, it can renewal density values and weight function to achieve the purpose to solve the multiple solutions and instability of the 3D gravity data inversion. Thanks to the sparse nature of the solutions of 3D gravity data inversions, we can transform it into a sparse equation. Then, through solving the sparse equations, we can get perfect 3D gravity inversion results. The main principle is based on zero norm of sparse matrix solution of the equation. Zero norm is mainly to solve the nonzero solution of the sparse matrix. However, the method of this article adopted is same as the principle of zero norm. But the method is the opposite of zero norm to obtain zero value solution. Through the form of a Gaussian fitting solution of the zero norm, we can find the solution by using regularization principle. Moreover, this method has been proved that it had a certain resistance to random noise in the mathematics, and it was more suitable than zero norm for the solution of the geophysical data.\n3D gravity which is adopted in this article can well identify abnormal body density distribution characteristics, and it can also recognize the space position of abnormal distribution very well. We can take advantage of the density of the upper and lower limit penalty function to make each rectangular residual density within a reasonable range. Finally, this 3D gravity inversion is applied to a variety of combination model test, such as a single straight three-dimensional model, the adjacent straight three-dimensional model and Y three-dimensional model. They are classical model. We find that the inversion results are basically consistent with the results of forward models. Finally we apply the 3D gravity inversion method to the actual gravity data in Texas of the USA state. And we get the 3D gravity inversion which is almost the same with previous results.",

            "abstract": "Around the solar maximum, the dominant structures emanating from the sun are sporadic coronal mass ejection (CMEs) and their interplanetary counterparts (ICMEs). In the descending and minimum phases of solar cycle, the geomagnetic activities are mostly influenced by corotating high speed streams. These high speed streams are embedded with highly fluctuated Alfven waves.When these fluctuation of Alfven waves in IMF (Bz) diminish, the storm starts its long recovery phase. The Earth's equatorial magnetic field monitored by the Dst (disturbed storm time) index found to be below than its quiet day value for days. This phenomena is called high-intensity, long duration, continuous AE activity or HILDCAA. In this work, we discuss the ground magnetometers signatures obtained from five longitudinal stations during three HILDCAA events of different interplanetary causes. The concepts of wavelet analysis (CWT, DWT and modulus correlation) have been used in order to get some common signatures on these stations. The CWT is an integral transform, it explores time frequency representation of the horizontal component of geomagnetic field. The objective of DWT is to highlight the disturbances associated during HILDCAA.The Daubechies orthogonal wavelet transform of order 2 with wavelet coefficient magnitudes at seven levels have been studied. In terms of wavelet coefficients the fluctuations present in the horizontal component of geomagnetic field have been analyzed. Both CWT and DWT have proved to be a useful tool in order to get some common features on these stations during the events . We also used wavelet modulus correlation to study the correlation between H-component from five longitudinal stations with IMF-Bz. These results show that the H-component for all stations are highly correlated with IMF-Bz during HILDCAAs.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal alteration processes involve mineralogical and chemical changes, which are reflected in a major modification of potential field patterns observed over hydrothermal areas. Basalt-hosted hydrothermal sites exhibit characteristic responses with magnetic lows and minima of the gravity field. Near bottom AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) based potential field surveys have become a very effective technique in deep sea exploration. Here we present results of recent ship-borne and near seafloor magnetic and gravity investigations at deep (Marsili and Palinuro seamounts) and shallow (Panarea, Basiluzzo and Secca del Capo) hydrothermal sites in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea including multibeam bathymetry, seafloor reflectivity and seismic profiles.\nAt Marsili seamount, a large Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxides-rich chimney field is located at the summit (500 m depth). This site is correlated with pronounced magnetic and gravity lows (0 A/m and 2.0 g/cm3). Deep tow magnetic survey (Cruise MAVA11) revealed strong association between the complicated magnetization pattern and the main volcano-tectonic features of the ridge.\nHydrothermal manifestations at Palinuro seamount occur mainly on the western sector within the rim of a caldera structure at depth of 600m. Recent AUV based magnetic surveys (Cruise POS442, 2012 using AUV “Abyss”) detailed a magnetization low interpreted to represent the local distribution of subseafloor hydrothermal alteration (potentially massive sulfide deposits), and also mapped previously undiscovered inactive chimney fields.\nHydrothermal sites observed at the arc-related volcanic islands (Panarea, Basiluzzo, Eolo and Secca del Capo) are confined to shallow depths (less then 300m) and associated with large ochreaceous mounds, vents and chimney fields such as those observed E of Basiluzzo Island. At this site a recent magnetic survey (Cruise PANA13_ASTREA) combined with Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) investigations revealed that the submarine geothermal field of Panarea island is actually extending in NE-SW direction along preferential tectonic trends which intercept the submerged portion of Basiluzzo. These new findings could help the volcanic hazard mitigation of Panarea archipelago in case of a new gas crisis similar that which occurred in 2002.",

            "abstract": "Seismoelectric effect belongs to a wide family of Electrokinetic phenomena that arises in heterogeneous systems due to electric charge separation at interfaces. Resulting structure is called an Electric Double Layer (EDL), which is characterized by electric potential drop – Zeta potential. This parameter serves as a major characteristic of liquid-solid interface in liquid dispersion and in porous materials, including geological ones. It varies roughly (in absolute value) from 0 to 100 mV and, therefore, play a major role in the seismoelectric effect, which is proportional to it. Siesmoelectric effect offers opportunity for measuring Zeta potential in geological cores. Phase of the seismoelectric current is pore size dependent, which can be used for characterizing this parameter as well. There are currently hundreds of instruments worldwide that are based on ultrasound for characterizing heterogeneous systems. There are even ISO standards providing guidelines for these characterization techniques, but mostly for concentrated dispersions and emulsions. We are attempting to extend application of these techniques for characterizing geological cores and other porous materials. This talk will present general features of the underlying theory, experimental setup and results for geological cores and several other porous materials. Studying seismoelectric effect in laboratory setting seems to be useful not for characterization purposes only but also for its better understanding on the large scale during seismological tests. This preliminary laboratory experiments reveal factors that affect seismoelectric signal and would allow more adequate interpretation of the seismoelectric signals.",

            "abstract": "Increased submarine melting at the margins of Greenland’s glaciers is indicated as a potential trigger for their observed acceleration and retreat that began in the late 1990s. Progress on this hypothesis, however, has been hindered by a limited knowledge of the variability of the fjord waters in proximity to the glaciers, and a limited understanding of how such variability may affect submarine melt rates. Here, we present a synthesis of 5 years of oceanic data collected in the vicinity of Helheim Glacier, East Greenland, including the fjord and the nearby continental shelf from moored instrumentation. A comparison of this variability to that of the nearby, larger scale subpolar gyre, obtained from Argo float data, reveal that much of the seasonal and interannual variability observed in the fjord can be attributed to changes in the large scale ocean. The observed fjord variability, in conjunction with the regional atmospheric forcing, is then used to reconstruct changes in submarine melt rates. These, in turn, are compared with observed changes in the characteristics of Helheim Glacier in order to investigate the extent to which submarine melting may be driving glacier variability.",

            "abstract": "We use two decades of drifter and satellite data to examine the monthly evolution of the surface circulation of the Arabian Sea, which reverses annually in response to the Indian monsoon winds. Most significantly, we find that in the transition from winter to summer circulations, northward flow appears along the length of the western boundary as early as March or April, one or two months before the onset of the southwest monsoon winds. This reversal is initiated by annual Rossby waves, which in turn are initiated by wind curl forcing during the previous southwest monsoon. These results lead us to speculate that there is an oceanic mechanism through which one monsoon may precondition the next. Previous studies of monsoon circulations with lower temporal resolution have highlighted basin-wide currents and connections that are not found to exist in the monthly fields. In particular, we find that the Northeast Monsoon Current does not reach the western boundary and there is no counter-rotating gyre system during boreal winter. South of the equator, the eastward-flowing South Equatorial Counter Current (SECC) is present year-round, even though equatorial winds are strongly influenced by the monsoons. Semi-annual variability of the SECC is governed by Ekman pumping over the south equatorial gyre (or Seychelles dome) and, surprisingly, it is weakest during the northeast monsoon. This region has important influence on the atmosphere and its link to the monsoons deserves further investigation. The East African Coastal Current feeds into the SECC from the boundary. During the southwest monsoon it overshoots the equator and splits, feeding both northward into the Somali Current and eastward into the SECC after looping back across the equator. This apparent retroflection of the EACC is what was previously known as the southern gyre and is obscured at the surface by strong, locally wind-driven, cross-equatorial Ekman transport. Finally, there is broad, strong eastward flow at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden throughout the southwest monsoon, which is influenced by the curvature and bifurcation of the atmospheric monsoon jet.",

            "abstract": "The public and governments have a serious concern on increasing drought threats, particularly whether those are caused by climate change. Literature shows inconsistent assessments of drought conditions in the past century. The most recent assessment of the IPCC (Fifth Assessment Report, AR5) concludes that there is not enough evidence available in favor of or against any global trend in drought with high confidence, and admits that the global increasing trend in drought suggested by the IPCC AR4 was probably overestimated. On the other hand, droughts are expected to intensify in the future at regional level. This study joins many such efforts to assess drought conditions in the US and India during the past century using Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from two latest datasets (Dai 2011 and 2013; Sheffield et al. 2012). Besides the trend analyses of PDSI based on mean global or regional PDSI time series, we conduct frequency analysis by calculating the return period of drought with a particular intensity and duration. The following results will be presented: 1) the trend and abrupt changes of regional drought represented by historical PDSI, and 2) the change of the frequency, intensity and duration of drought events during the past century, in the continental states of the US and northern India. Preliminary results show that drought variables are highly correlated, and thus Copulas joint distribution is used to enable the calculation of multivariate return periods. Implications for drought risk management in places in US and India will be discussed.\nDai, A., 2011a: Characteristics and trends in various forms of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during 1900-2008.

            "abstract": "In the late Pleistocene (~50-10,000 years ago), ninety-seven genera of large animals (>44kg) (megafauna) went extinct, concentrated in the Americas and Australia. The loss of megafauna had major effects on ecosystem structure, seed dispersal and land surface albedo. However, the impact of this dramatic extinction on ecosystem nutrient biogeochemistry, through the lateral transport of dung and bodies, has never been explored. Here we explore these nutrient impacts using a novel mathematical framework that analyses this lateral transport as a diffusion-like process and demonstrates that large animals play a disproportionately large role in the horizontal transfer of nutrients across landscapes. For example, we estimate that the extinction of the Amazonian megafauna led to a >98% reduction in the lateral transfer flux of the limiting nutrient phosphorus (P) with similar, though less extreme, decreases in all continents outside of Africa. This resulted in strong decreases in phosphorus availability in Eastern Amazonia away from fertile floodplains, a decline which may still be ongoing, and current P limitation in the Amazon basin may be partially a relic of an ecosystem without the functional connectedness it once had. More broadly, the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions resulted in major and ongoing disruptions to terrestrial biogeochemical cycling at continental scales and increased nutrient heterogeneity globally.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge evolves in geoscience, and the evolution is reflected in datasets. In a context with distributed data sources, the evolution of knowledge may cause considerable challenges to data management and re-use. For example, a short news published in 2009 (Mascarelli, 2009) revealed the geoscience community’s concern that the International Commission on Stratigraphy’s change to the definition of Quaternary may bring heavy reworking of geologic maps. Now we are in the era of the World Wide Web, and geoscience knowledge is increasingly modeled and encoded in the form of ontologies and vocabularies by using semantic technologies. Accordingly, knowledge evolution leads to a consequence called ontology dynamics. Flouris et al. (2008) summarized 10 topics of general ontology changes/dynamics such as: ontology mapping, morphism, evolution, debugging and versioning, etc. Ontology dynamics makes impacts at several stages of a data life cycle and causes challenges, such as: the request for reworking of the extant data in a data center, semantic mismatch among data sources, differentiated understanding of a same piece of dataset between data providers and data users, as well as error propagation in cross-discipline data discovery and re-use (Ma et al., 2014). This presentation will analyze the best practices in the geoscience community so far and summarize a few recommendations to reduce the negative impacts of ontology dynamics in a data life cycle, including: communities of practice and collaboration on ontology and vocabulary building, link data records to standardized terms, and methods for (semi-)automatic reworking of datasets using semantic technologies.\n",

            "abstract": "The convective instability (CI) is excited in the troposphere in the presence of negative temperature gradient. The rising bubbles generated by the instability act like pressure disturbances at the top of the troposphere and subsequently excite the acoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) in the atmosphere. These AGWs propagate radially outward towards overlying MLT region while their amplitude increases exponentially with increasing altitude. In the MLT region, these waves encounter thermal and density ducts, leading to the dissipation of these waves and subsequent generation of secondary AGWs.\nIn this work, we present the simulation study of coupled convective instability - AGWs dynamics in the atmosphere covering troposphere to MLT region. We derive the governing hydrodynamics equations for the CI and AGWs that include the non-adiabatic dynamics of CI in the troposphere and compressible and ducting dynamics of AGWs above troposphere. These equations are solved using Finite-Time-Centered-Space difference method complemented by the Crank-Nicolson implicit scheme for the integration and Gradient-Conjugate method to solve the matrix equation. The simulation domain consists of altitude-longitude-latitude covering the tropical Brazilian region. The novel features of the present study are as follows: (1) Owing to the non-adiabatic dynamics, the CI in the troposphere grows for the adiabatically stable temperature profile (2) The growth remains linear and excite the bubbles reaching up to the base of the tropopause (~10 km altitude), (3) Thereafter, AGWs are excited attaining large amplitude in the MLT region, (4) In the MLT region, these large amplitude waves become ducted and as a result, the AGWs with short period equals to the Brunt-Vaisala period of MLT region, are amplified, (5) These ducting dynamics excite the atmospheric disturbances consist of ripples and bands, respectively associated with the short and long period AGWs.",

            "abstract": "The time series of forces exerted on the earth by a large and rapid landslide derived remotely from the inversion of seismic records can be used to tie post-slide evidence to what actually occurred during the event and can be used to tune numerical models and test theoretical methods. This strategy is applied to the 48.5 Mm3 August 2010 Mount Meager rockslide-debris flow in British Columbia, Canada. By inverting data from just five broadband seismic stations less than 300 km from the source, we reconstruct the time series of forces that the landslide exerted on the Earth as it occurred. The result illuminates a complex retrogressive initiation sequence and features attributable to flow over a complicated path including several curves and runup against a valley wall. The seismically derived force history also allows for the estimation of the horizontal acceleration (0.39 m/s^2) and average apparent coefficient of basal friction (0.38) of the rockslide, and the speed of the center of mass of the debris flow (peak of 92 m/s). To extend beyond these simple calculations and to test the interpretation, we also use the seismically derived force history to guide numerical modeling of the event – seeking to simulate the landslide in a way that best fits both the seismic and field constraints. This allows for a finer reconstruction of the volume, timing, and sequence of events, estimates of friction, and spatiotemporal variations in speed and flow thickness. The modeling allowed us to analyze the sensitivity of the force to the different parameters involved in the landslide modeling to better understand what can and cannot be constrained from seismic source inversions of landslide signals.",

Initial measurements from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) suggested that the heliosphere could be moving more slowly with respect to the interstellar medium than indicated by earlier observations from the Ulysses spacecraft. In this study we refine the range of possible IBEX flow parameters based on the latest measurements and show that both spacecraft’s data could be consistent with a single flow velocity for a much larger interstellar neutral temperature (7000-9000K) than previously found. Combining the IBEX and Ulysses observations suggests that the heliosphere is currently in a substantially warmer region of the interstellar medium than previously thought. This study examines this possible resolution of the prior apparent disconnect between these observations. We further examine the incredible improvement in interstellar observations – and our understanding of the local interstellar medium – that the envisioned Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) will provide.",

            "abstract": "Studies of the Famatina margin of northwest Argentina highlight the challenges in understanding the links between Cordilleran arc processes, terrane accretion, and lower crustal deformation, metamorphism, and magmatism. The evolution of the Famatina arc suggests that regional convergence and lower crustal shortening drove voluminous arc magmatism during terrane accretion, pervasive melting of the middle and lower crust did not result in regional extension, and the cessation in arc magmatism and late syn-convergent extension coincided with the end of terrane accretion and a change in the plate margin. The Famatina arc extends more than 1800 km along strike and records the transition from a Cambrian convergent margin to an Ordovician collisional orogen with the accretion of the allochthonous Precordillera terrane. The Famatina arc was established on mid-Proterozoic basement following the onset of regional convergence and east-dipping subduction by ~515-495 Ma. The peak in arc magmatism in the central portion of the Famatina arc occurred from ~485-465 Ma and was coeval with the initial collision of the Precordillera terrane, major crustal shortening accommodated along a series of oblique lower-crustal shear zones, and back arc shortening. Steeply dipping reverse-sense ductile fabrics within the arc have hornblende cooling ages of >445 Ma and suggest that voluminous arc magmatism was concurrent with intra-arc shortening. Intrusion of mafic and intermediate magmas during the peak in arc magmatism lead to widespread granulite facies metamorphism of the middle and lower arc crust from ~470-465 Ma. Pelitic rocks melted in this event remained above the solidus for ~20-30 Ma, throughout the episode of peak convergence. Pressure-temperature paths from middle and lower crustal migmatites suggest that cooling from peak conditions was near isobaric. Decreased convergence associated with the end of Precordillera terrane accretion at ~436 Ma facilitated the onset of syn-convergent extension, cooling and exhumation from granulite facies conditions, and the termination of Famatina arc magmatism.",

Heat conduction transports energy from the warmer, higher layers of the thermosphere to lower layers where CO2 and NO ultimately radiate the energy. These radiative processes play a large role in governing the neutral temperature of the ionosphere E and F regions. The SABER instrument on the NASA TIMED satellite has been observing radiative cooling by NO and CO2 for 13 years. Substantial variability in the radiative cooling is observed on timescales ranging from one day to the 11-year solar cycle. Harmonics of the annual cycle are evident in the CO2 cooling rates, implying strong coupling to the lower atmosphere. Harmonics of the solar rotation period are evident in the NO cooling, but only during solar minimum conditions. To date the NO cooling data have been helpful in understanding space weather forecasts and the interaction of co-rotating interaction regions with the ionosphere. The cooling rate data will be reviewed in light of their observed variability over the past 13 years, including the implications for variations in the thermal structure of the E and F regions. The potential for development of proxies and empirical models of the NO and CO2 emissions will also be presented. Such models could become part of an overall space weather forecasting tool.",

The GPM Core satellite, which was launched in March 2014, is intended to tie the constellation of disparate satellite instruments into a coherent whole. A first aspect of the constellation that needs to be made consistent is the calibration of the microwave radiometers. The GPM Intersatellite Calibration Working Group (aka X-CAL) is charged with deriving transformations that put the various constellation radiometers on a common basis with proper allowance for the differences in viewing parameters such as frequency, polarization and view angle. The low inclination (65°) prograde orbit of GPM Core allows frequent observations by the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) that are coincident in space and nearly so in time with the various constellation radiometers. The comparisons are done via a variety of methods. The similarity of the results allows estimates of the uncertainty and adds credibility.\nEarly simulations of the cross calibration role of GMI have been done with the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI), and as a temporary measure, X-CAL has provided transformations to map all the constellation radiometers to the calibration of TMI. As of July 2014, TRMM was nearly out of fuel and the orbit will decay over the next year or so.\nAs with any new sensor, there are several small problems with GMI that must be addressed before it can be used as a transfer standard. The largest appears to be an interaction with the Earth’s magnetic field that produces errors in the 1 to 2 K neighborhood.\nSome of the algorithms derive surface and atmospheric parameters from the observed radiances. These algorithms provide, as a by-product, a measure of the consistency of the radiances with models for the atmospheric absorption and ocean surface emissivity . Comparisons of GMI radiances with TMI, Windsat, MHS and other sensors will be presented.",

As such, hands-on labs are an important learning tool which have played a foundational role in science education since the time of Galileo. But labs also have features that make them difficult to implement in practice. They are often time consuming for the instructor to plan and setup, time consuming for students to perform, expensive to implement, and fraught with potential missteps that can send confused students into a spiral of misunderstanding. Our Direct Measurement Video team is working to create several series' of videos with an interface that allows students to interact with them in a way that (we hope) will start to feel lab-like, but with fewer of the impediments that tend to undermine lab-learning in the real world. We hope that lab-like videos will soon provide a needed complement to traditional hands-on labs in science classrooms across the nation.

The discovery of nirK genes in ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota (AOA) resulted in a slew of publications stating that AOA must also perform nitrifier denitrification and, due to their high abundance, must control the majority of nitrification-linked N2O emissions. Prior to a publication by Stieglmeier et al. (2014), which definitively showed a lack of nitrifier denitrification by two axenic AOA cultures, other researchers relied on enrichment cultures, negative data, and heavy inferencing without direct demonstration of either a functional pathway or involvement of specific genes or enzymes. AOA genomes lack recognizable nitric oxide reductases and thermophilic AOA also lack nirK genes. Physiological and microrespirometry experiments with axenic AOB and AOA cultures allowed us to demonstrate that: 1) AOB produce N2O via nitrifier denitrification even though some lack annotated nirK and/or norB genes; 2) nitrifier denitrification by AOB is reliant on nitric oxide but ammonia oxidation is not; 3) ammonia oxidation by AOA is reliant on production of nitric oxide; 4) AOA are incapable of generating N2O via nitrifier denitrification; 5) N2O production by AOA is from chemical interactions between NO and media components, most likely not by enzyme activity. Our results reveal operation of different N oxide transformation pathways in AOB and AOA governed by different environmental controls and involving different mechanisms of N2O production. Critical controls on these mechanisms are levels of oxygen and ammonium. Future calculations of relative contributions of AOB and AOA to N2O emissions must take into account physiological, enzymatic, and environmental differences between these two nitrifying microorganisms.",

            "abstract": "The Mantaro valley (MV) is located in the central Peruvian Andes. Occasionally, cold episodes are observed during the austral summer (January-March), which strongly damage crops. However, little is known about the causes and impacts of such cold episodes in the MV. The main goal of this study is thus to characterize cold episodes in the MV and assess their large-scale circulation and teleconnections over South America (SA) during austral summer.\nTo identify cold events in the MV daily minimum temperature for the period 1958-2009 from Huayao station, located within the MV was used. We defined a cold episode as the period when daily minimum temperature drops below the 10-percentile for at least one day. Several gridded reanalysis and satellite products were used to characterize the large-scale circulation, cloud cover and rainfall over SA associated with these events for same period.\nCold episodes in the MV are associated with positive OLR anomalies, which extend over much of the central Andes, indicating reduced convective cloud cover during these extremes, but also affirm the large-scale nature of these events. At the same time, northeastern Brazil (NEB) registers negative OLR anomalies, strong convective activity and enhanced cloud cover because displacement of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) toward the northeast of its climatologic position. Further, it is associated with a weakening of the Bolivian High - Nordeste Low (BH-NL) system at upper levels, but also influenced by a low-level migratory high-pressure center develops at 30°S, 50°W; propagating from mid- to low latitudes as part of an extratropical Rossby wave train.\nIn conclusion, cold episodes in the MV appear to be caused by radiative cooling associated with reduced cloudiness, rather than cold air advection. The reduced cloud cover in turn results from a robust large-scale pattern of westerly wind anomalies over central Peruvian Andes, inhibiting moisture influx, convective activity and hence cloud formation. At the same time NEB registers strong convective activity and enhanced cloud cover. This dipole is caused by a weakening of BH-NL system at upper levels, which is associated with a low-level migratory high-pressure center, propagating from mid- to low latitudes as part of an extratropical Rossby wave train.",

            "abstract": "The viability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) depends on safely sequestering large quantities of carbon dioxide over geologic time scales. One concern is the potential for induced seismicity. We report on seismic monitoring by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) at a CCS demonstration site in Decatur, IL. This is the first (and to date only) CCS project in the U.S. to inject large volumes of CO2 into an extensive undisturbed saline reservoir, and thus serves as an important test for future industrial-scale CCS projects. At Decatur, supercritical CO2 is injected at 2.1 km depth into the Mt. Simon Sandstone, which directly overlies granitic basement. The primary sealing cap is the Eau Claire Shale at a depth of about 1.5 km. The Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) manages the ongoing Illinois Basin - Decatur Project, a three-year project beginning in November 2011 during which CO2 is injected at an average rate of 1000 metric tons/day. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) manages the nearby Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage project, which, pending permit approval, plans to inject 3000 metric tons/day for five years. The USGS seismic network was installed starting in July 2013 and consists of 12 stations, three of which include borehole sensors at depths of 150 m. The aperture of this network is roughly 8 km, centered on the injection well. A one-dimensional velocity model was derived from a vertical seismic profile survey acquired by ADM and the ISGS to a depth of 2.2 km, tied into acoustic logs from a deep observation well and the USGS borehole stations. This model was used together with absolute and double-difference techniques to locate seismic events. These events group into two clusters: 0.4 to 1.0 km NE and 1.8 to 2.6 km WNW from the injection well, with moment magnitudes ranging from -0.8 to 1.1. Most of these events are in the granitic basement, well below the cap rock, and are unlikely to have compromised the integrity of the seal.",

            "abstract": "Individually identifiable tracer particles and instrumented clasts provide a wealth of information about coarse bedload transport during floods. The dispersive nature of sediment transport means that tracer methods may constrain effects of spatial variability in the underlying topography of the channel, and effects of temporal variability in discharge (e.g., hydrographs). We highlight results from recent field and flume work that employed both radio frequency identification (RFID) and accelerometer tracers. The overall goal is to demonstrate that a broad range of quantitative constraints on sediment transport can be pulled from these unique datasets. In the field, tracer transport was monitored along ~11 km of Reynolds Creek, Idaho, a snowmelt-dominated gravel-bedded stream with local reach slopes of roughly 0.5% to 7%. Three antennas were installed on the channel bed near a gauging station to measure the exact times that RFID tracers passed the antennas during high flows. The combination of transport data, discharge and flow modeling allows us to calculate a hiding function that quantifies size-dependent thresholds of motion in this particular reach. During transport, RFID and accelerometer tracers became distributed along ~11 and ~2 km of the channel, respectively. The timing of individual particle movements was measured in 10 minute intervals by the accelerometers. These data constrained transport probabilities and bedload hysteresis as a function of changing discharge. Additionally, cumulative travel distances of the accelerometers allow us to put bounds on particle velocities and average individual step lengths. We find that average tracer transport distances are well correlated with cumulative discharge. Using flood magnitude-frequency relations based on the >50 year discharge record of Reynolds creek, the seasonal flow with an ~10 year recurrence interval likely transports coarse gravel the farthest average distance. Finally, in flume experiments on gravel transport by flash flood bores, RFID tracers of different sizes were used to measure size-dependent sorting due to transport and burial in the bed. Accelerometer tracers were sampled at 10 hz to measure actual durations of particle transport and rest.",

            "abstract": "A key challenge facing educators and climate communicators is the wide array of misconceptions about climate science, often fostered by misinformation. A number of myths interfere with a sound understanding of the science, with key myths moderating public support for mitigation policies. An effective way to reduce the influence of misinformation is through agnotology-based learning. Agnotology is the study of ignorance while agnotology-based learning teaches students through the direct addressing of myths and misconceptions. This approach of “refutational teaching” is being applied in a MOOC (Massive Online Open Course) currently being developed by Skeptical Science and The University of Queensland, in collaboration with universities in Canada, USA and the UK. The MOOC will examine the science of climate change denial. Why is the issue so controversial given there is an overwhelming consensus on human-caused global warming? How do climate myths distort the science? What can scientists and laypeople do in response to misinformation? The MOOC will be released on the EdX platform in early 2015. I will summarise the research underpinning agnotology-based learning and present the approach taken in the MOOC to be released in early 2015",

            "abstract": "In May 2009 a mm-wave single-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for the first time demonstrated ice surface topography swath-mapping in Greenland. This was achieved with the airborne Glacier and Ice Surface Topography Interferometer (GLISTIN-A). Ka-band (35.6GHz) was chosen for high-precision topographic mapping from a compact sensor with minimal surface penetration. In recent years, the system was comprehensively upgraded for improved performance, stability and calibration.\nIn April 2013, after completing the upgrades, GLISTIN-A flew a brief campaign to Alaska. The primary purpose was to demonstrate the InSAR’s ability to generate high-precision, high resolution maps of ice surface topography with swaths in excess of 10km. Comparison of GLISTIN-A’s elevations over glacial ice with lidar verified the precision requirements and established elevation accuracies to within 2 m without tie points. Feature tracking of crevasses on Columbia Glacier using data acquired with a 3-day separation exhibit an impressive velocity mapping capability.\nFurthermore, GLISTIN-A flew over the Beaufort sea to determine if we could not only map sea ice, but also measure freeboard. Initial analysis has established we can measure sea-ice freeboard using height differences from the top of the sea-ice and the sea surface in open leads. In the future, a campaign with lidar is desired for a quantitative validation.\nAnother proof-of-concept collection mapped snow-basins for hydrology. Snow depth measurements using summer and winter collections in the Sierras were compared with lidar measurements. Unsurprisingly when present, trees complicate the interpretation, but additional filtering and processing is in work.\nFor each application, knowledge of the interferometric penetration is important for scientific interpretation. We present analytical predictions and experimental data to upper bound the elevation bias of the InSAR measurements over snow and snow-covered ice.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing the hydraulic properties of heterogeneous and complex aquifers often requires field scale investigations at multiple space and time scales to better constrain hydraulic property estimates. Here, we present and discuss results from the site of Ploemeur (Brittany, France) where complementary hydrological and geophysical approaches have been combined to characterize the hydrogeological functioning of this highly fractured crystalline rock aquifer. In particular, we show how cross-borehole flowmeter tests, pumping tests and frequency domain analysis of groundwater levels allow quantifying the hydraulic properties of the aquifer at different scales. In complement, we used groundwater temperature as an excellent tracer for characterizing groundwater flow. At the site scale, measurements of ground surface deformation through long-base tiltmeters provide robust estimates of aquifer storage and allow identifying the active structures where groundwater pressure changes occur, including those acting during recharge process. Finally, a numerical model of the site that combines hydraulic data and groundwater ages confirms the geometry of this complex aquifer and the consistency of the different datasets. The Ploemeur site, which has been used for water supply at a rate of about 106 m3 per year since 1991, belongs to the French network of hydrogeological sites H+ and is currently used for monitoring groundwater changes and testing innovative field methods.",

            "abstract": "The chemical signature of large rivers has a clear effect on the chemistry and biology of the nearshore ocean. At the same time, the flux of riverine constituents to coastal environments can be used to understand changes occurring over broad terrestrial landscapes. This is particularly relevant in the Arctic, where rivers have a disproportionate impact on nearshore ocean function. Additionally, change is playing out rapidly in Arctic regions, as permafrost thaw and changes in temperature and hydrology are exposing previously frozen soils, changing the nature of hydrological linkages between land and water, and affecting the seasonality of riverine chemistry and flux. Here, we examine a 40-year dataset of point-measurement alkalinity (largely dissolved inorganic carbon) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations near the mouth of the Mackenzie River, in addition to similar data from four of the Mackenzie’s major sub-catchments. These datasets are coupled with continuous discharge records, and capture flow from the fourth largest river discharging to the Arctic Ocean. Trends near the Mackenzie mouth show that annual fluxes of both alkalinity and DOC are increasing over time, with the proportional changes in DOC (approximately 16% per decade) being much greater than those for alkalinity (approximately 4% per decade). Seasonally, this increase in total flux occurs largely in the winter and late summer, for both constituents. Sub-catchment datasets indicate that these fluxes are increasing in northern, but not southern, sub-catchment regions. These results have clear implications for nearshore ocean function in the western Canadian Arctic. Increases in DOC may fuel increased bacterial metabolism, while differences in the magnitude of change in alkalinity and DOC flux may modify coastal aragonite saturation. Overall, the changing flux of dissolved carbon near the mouth of the Mackenzie River documents broad-scale changes in the carbon cycle of this region, both on land and in the nearshore ocean.",

            "abstract": "Aseismic fault slip was first reported over forty years ago along some major strike slip faults including the San Andreas (SAF) and North Anatolian faults (NAF). Yet both their origin and timing on active faults and underlying physical processes remain subjects of debate. The presence of weak minerals and/or trapped fluid overpressures within fault zones have been proposed as mechanics for aseismic fault creep. Our InSAR observations together with GPS measurements and geology along the NAF provide new evidence for the mechanism, characteristics, and initiation of fault surface creep. We have used the persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique to investigate both the creeping section of the NAF at Ismetpaşa that had ruptured during the 1944 and 1951 earthquakes, and the postseismic era of the 1999 İzmit Earthquake. The results reveal that the central segment of the 1999 Izmit Earthquake rupture has been creeping for over for the past 15 years since the event, becoming the longest lasting afterslip ever recorded. The slip pattern of ongoing surface creep on the İzmit rupture supports the idea that stable fault creep can be initiated as postseismic afterslip, a mechanism we proposed previously but could not have confirmed due to the lack of pre- and post-earthquake observations on creeping faults such as the Ismetpaşa segment of the NAF and the segments of the SAF in the San Francisco Bay area. Geological maps along the Ismetpaşa and Izmit creeping segments show that both fault zones run through ophiolitic and calcareous rocks with phyllosilicates that probably result in fault weakening. Earthquake rupture maps and PS-InSAR velocity fields for these regions also reveal that the creeping faults have simple geometry being fairly rectilinear and continuous along their strike. These common features suggest that following a large earthquake, a stable surface creep can be triggered on a section of a mature fault if it has evolved in to simple geometry and is located within weak rocks.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in technology have made videos much easier to produce, edit, store, transfer, and view. This has spawned an explosion in a production of a wide variety of different types of pedagogical videos. But with the exception of student-made videos (which are often of poor quality) almost all of the educational videos being produced are passive. No matter how compelling the content, students are expected to simply sit and watch them. Because we feel that being engaged and active are necessary components of student learning, we have been working to create a free online library of Direct Measurement Videos (DMV's). These videos are short high-quality videos of real events, shot in a way that allows students to make measurements directly from the video. Instead of handing students a word problem about a car skidding on ice, we actually show them the car skidding on ice. We then ask them to measure the important quantities, make calculations based on those measurements and solve for unknowns. DMV's are more interesting than their word problem equivalents and frequently inspire further questions about the physics of the situation or about the uncertainty of the measurement in ways that word problems almost never do. We feel that it is simply impossible to a video of a roller coaster or a rocket and then argue that word problems are better. In this talk I will highlight some new additions to our DMV collection.

            "abstract": "For much of the last century, it has been hypothesized that the downslope flux of regolith is dependent on hillslope gradient, but the functional form of this dependence remains uncertain. The development of new isotopic methods and the increasing availability of high resolution topographic data sets allows for testing of simple transport models in a variety of landscapes. At the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHO), we use a combination of high resolution, LiDAR-derived digital topography and the cosmogenic radionuclide meteoric 10Be to measure rates of regolith transport along six hillslopes (3 north-facing, 3 south-facing), test commonly invoked transport rules, and elucidate the mechanisms acting to transport regolith materials. Topographic observations reveal a systematic asymmetry at SSHO, where north-facing hillslopes exhibit steeper gradients than south-facing hillslopes. Despite this asymmetry, our meteoric 10Be results suggest that regolith flux is similar along all six hillslopes, and that the landscape is steadily lowering at ~ 20-30 m/My. Tests of frequently invoked transport rules suggest that downslope regolith transport is depth-dependent at SSHO, and that regolith transport efficiency is consistently higher on south-facing hillslopes than north-facing hillslopes by a factor of two. However, along ridgetops, where regolith thickness is uniformly thin, our results suggest that aspect-related differences in transport efficiency are minimal and ridgetop curvature reflects erosion rate and transport efficiency. Therefore, we contend that hillslopes at SSHO are approaching an equilibrium condition, where ridgetop curvature and hillslope gradient are adjusted to maintain a steady flux of materials out of the watershed.",

            "abstract": "Circum-arctic frozen soils contain twice as much carbon as is currently present as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Ongoing climate warming causes frozen soils to thaw, making the carbon available for microbial processing. This can generate greenhouse gases (fueling further global warming), both at the thaw site, but also during lateral transport in inland and coastal waters. Aquatic systems are increasingly recognized as reactive transport systems, but are generally not included in quantitative assessments of the magnitude of the permafrost carbon feedback. Combined carbon fluxes from lateral transport and aquatic gas emission can however be an important component of the total ecosystem carbon budget in Arctic regions. Here I aim to give an overview of our current knowledge on riverine and coastal organic carbon fluxes in permafrost regions, what factors determine the degradability (i.e. potential greenhouse gas production) of this organic carbon, and how we expect this to change in the future.",

            "abstract": "Many landforms display sharp corners, or edges, that are maintained as they migrate laterally. Our present landscape models, cast largely in terms of patterns of vertical erosion, fail to capture the essence of these landscapes, including flatirons, hogbacks, cliffs, and lumpy outcropped hillslopes; roche moutonée and glacial steps, and river knickpoints. Yet these are the very landscape signatures of rock type and structure. Block sizes, and the fracture distributions that bound the blocks, vary from one rock type or geological setting to another. Removal and transportation of discrete blocks of rock maintains a sharp edge, and results in their upvalley/upslope migration.\nOur challenge in developing numerical landscapes is to capture the essential variation, noisiness, and roughness of natural landscapes and their dependence on rock type and structure. The rate of lowering of the landscape is governed by the product of the spatial density of edges, their step height, and their rate of migration. I present cellular automata-like models in which I explicitly incorporate blocks, and utilize algorithms for the susceptibility of any block to motion, and the forces imposed on the surface by the environment. Susceptibility of a block to release is governed by its size, the geometry of the pocket in which it sits, the frictional properties of the bounding discontinuities, and the cohesion across these discontinuities. This is akin to coordination number and bond strengths of atoms in mineral dissolution studies; their atoms are our blocks. Removal of a block requires an event of sufficient magnitude to overcome its resistance. The relevant events include fluctuations in water pressure at the bed of glaciers, turbulence and sediment impacts in rivers, and root throw or earthquakes in hillslopes.\nPreliminary models capture the essence of migrating edges. The systems self-organize to produce suites of steps. In glacial beds, for example, migration of steps produces upvalley and downward migrating rocky edges with an angle of descent analogous to the angle of climb of migrating bedforms; this angle reflects the relative importance of abrasion and quarrying. Steps in glacial beds arise from strong gradients in fracture density because the susceptibility to quarrying is strongly governed by block size.",

            "abstract": "The faint young Sun paradox (early Earth had surface liquid water despite solar luminosity 70% of the modern value) implies that our planet’s albedo has increased through time and/or greenhouse warming has fallen. The obvious explanation is that negative feedback processes stabilized temperatures. However, the limited temperature data available does not exhibit the expected residual temperature rise and, at least for the Phanerozoic, estimates of climate sensitivity exceed the Planck sensitivity (the zero net-feedback value). The alternate explanation is that biological and geological evolution have tended to cool Earth through time hence countering solar-driven warming. The coincidence that Earth-evolution has roughly cancelled Solar-evolution can then be explained as an emergent property of a complex system (the Gaia hypothesis) or the result of the unavoidable observational bias that Earth’s climate history must be compatible with our existence (the anthropic principle).\nHere, I use a simple climate model to investigate the sensitivity of Earth’s climate to changes in the rate of Earth-evolution. Earth-evolution is represented by an effective emissivity which has an intrinsic variation through time (due to continental growth, the evolution of cyanobacteria, orbital fluctuations etc) plus a linear feedback term which enhances emissivity variations. An important feature of this model is a predicted maximum in the radiated-flux versus temperature function. If the increasing solar flux through time had exceeded this value then runaway warming would have occurred. For the best-guess temperature history and climate sensitivity, the Earth has always been within a few percent of this maximum. There is no obvious Gaian explanation for this flux-coincidence but the anthropic principle naturally explains it: If the rate of biological/geological evolution is naturally slow then Earth is a fortunate outlier which evolved just fast enough to avoid solar-induced over-heating.\nHowever, there are large uncertainties concerning the temperature history of our planet and concerning climate sensitivity in the Archean and Proterozoic. When these are included, the solar-flux through time might have been as little as 70-90 % of the maximum thus reducing the significance of the flux-coincidence.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol can affect cloud, radiation and precipitation via various mechanisms by altering surface radiative fluxes, thermodynamic state of the atmosphere and cloud micro- and macro-physics. Apparently, different mechanisms lead to different types of impact that may suppress or foster cloud processes and precipitation. Aerosol reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching ground, reducing sensible and latent heat fluxes. For absorbing aerosol, it warms up the atmosphere. Together, they inhibits convection and convective clouds and precipitation. By serving CCN, it reduces cloud droplet size and suppress drizzle but may enhance heavy precipitation due to the invigoration effect. While it is unclear if aerosol changes total rainfall amount, but it surely change the distribution of precipitation. It is an essential but a challenging task to sort out the various effects. To tackle the problem and unravel various complex relations, data from both long-term routine measurements and intensive field experiments have been analyzed, together with some modeling studies. In this talk, I will summarize major findings drawn from several analyses using long-term research and operational data, global satellite data from CloudSat, CALIPSO and MODIS and IOPs. They are concerned with aerosol direct and indirect effects, invigoration effect and thermodynamic effect and their impact on regional climate.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial planets are now understood to accrete from smaller bodies – both planetesimals and planetary embryos – that are, at least in many cases, already internally differentiated into a metallic core and a silicate mantle. The final terrestrial planet retains few or no unmodified vestiges of the first bodies from which it formed; each planet is the result of multiple heating, melting, and differentiation events as it grew and also on the bodies from which it grew. Planetesimals and embryos, however, are imperfect miniature physical analogs to today’s Earth. The small gravity fields produce different physical processes, as would the potentially higher temperatures, the dominance of internal radiogenic heating, and the possibility of far higher volatile fractions.\nThe meteorite collection contains samples of undifferentiated primitive material from planetesimals along with both silicates and iron-nickel metal from differentiated planetesimals. Conspicuously lacking is olivine-dominated material similar to the Earth’s mantle or resulting from magmatic fractionation. Perhaps our collection simply lacks these samples but they did originally exist. Perhaps, however, in the small gravity field of a planetesimal magmas cannot efficiently fractionate, and no olivine-dominated material can be produced; the mantles and crusts of planetesimals may have been significantly different than our Earth, Venus, and Mars examples.\nEven in the low-gravity environment, however, metal can segregate into a core, and this core can produce a magnetic dynamo. And because each planetary core is the result of combining many smaller, pre-differentiated cores from other bodies, each core (except the very first differentiation event) is a combination of many others that went through multiple melting, solidification, collision, and disruption events. Thus core materials and processes on planetesimals may have been higher-fidelity analogs to the cores of terrestrial planets than are their mantles and crusts.",

Yet despite this failure it is clear that life survived the Snowball Earth events and may have even thrived as a result of them, either indirectly (through associated rises in oxygen) or directly (through evolutionary pressure). In this talk I will focus on the physical conditions that may have allowed life to survive Snowball Earth episodes, and what this can tell us about habitability more generally.

Over the last few decades, land transformation related to exploitative land uses is among the main drivers of changing vegetation cover and productivity in western Himalayas. In a region where field based research is challenging due to heterogeneous relief and high altitude, quantifying changes in vegetation productivity using remote sensing can provide essential information regarding trends in vegetation cover and its linkages with Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics. We conducted seasonal trend analysis (STA) on MODIS NDVI time-series data (2000-2014) over Uttarakhand Himalayas and examined spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation trend and its association with altitudinal gradient and LULC dynamics. In STA the first step determines the annual mean and seasonal NDVI patterns and the second step analyzes the non-parametric trend in magnitude and timing of the annual mean and seasonal NDVI cycle. In total 3286.82 km2 (6.9% vegetated area of Uttarakhand) showed significant trend (p<0.01) in mean annual greenness. While areas <800 m elevation showed dominant negative trend in mean annual greenness, area between 800-1600m showed mostly positive trend and majority of areas >1600 m were characterized by negative trend in mean annual greenness. Considering LULC characteristics, majority of intensively cultivated irrigated croplands in the Himalayan foothills as well as areas around growing urban centers showed widespread negative trend in mean annual greenness, which was contrastingly different from rainfed cultivation areas that showed dominant positive trend. Negative trend in mean annual greenness was observed to be consistent with increasing altitude and particularly in closed needle leaf forests and alpine shrublands except areas where human impacts has led to mixed patterns. Trends in the annual seasonal timing of NDVI indicated an earlier green-up for most parts of the Uttarakhand Himalayas. These results are somewhat surprising and are partially in agreement with previous studies that suggest increasing brownness in Himalayan vegetation based on analyses of comparatively much coarser spatial resolution NDVI time-series.",

Here, we model bed evolution as a random walk with mean-reverting tendency (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) originating from the restoring effect of erosion and deposition. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model contains two parameters, a and b, related to particle feed rate and range of bed elevation fluctuations, respectively. Observations of bed evolution in idealized flume experiments of glass spheres moving in a two-dimensional channel under constant shear stress agree with model predictions; in particular, the model reproduces the observed asymptotic t-1 tail in the tracer waiting time exceedance probability distribution. This waiting time distribution is similar to that inferred for tracers in natural gravel streams and avalanching rice piles, indicating applicability of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting model to many disordered transport systems with tracer burial and excavation. We explore possible application of our model for understanding steady-state evolution of bed forms.",

            "abstract": "The studies of the interaction between vegetation and climate change in the Amazon Basin indicate that up to half of the region’s forests may be displaced by savanna vegetation by the end of the century. Additional analyses suggest that complex interactions among land use, fire-frequency, and episodic drought are driving an even more rapid process of the forest impoverishment and displacement referred here as “savannization”. But it is not clear whether surface/ecosystem models are suitable to analyze extreme events like a drought. Long-term simulations of throughfall exclusion experiments has provided unique insights into the energy dynamics of Amazonian rainforests during drought conditions. In this study, we evaluate how well six surface/ecosystem models quantify the energy dynamics from two Amazonian throughfall exclusion experiments. All models were run for the Tapajós and Caxiuanã sites with one control plot using normal precipitation (i.e. do not impose a drought) and then the drought manipulation was imposed for several drought treatments (10 to 90% rainfall exclusion). The sap flow, net radiation (Rn), sensible (H), latent (LE) and ground (G) heat flux are used to analyze if the models are able to capture the dynamics of water stress and what the implications for the energy dynamics are. With respect to the model validation, when we compare the sap flow observed and transpiration simulated, models are more accurate to simulate control plots than drought treatments (50% rainfall exclusion). The results show that the models overestimate the sap flow data during the drought conditions, but they were able to capture the changes in the main energy balance components for different drought treatments. The Rn and LE decreased and H increased with more intensity of drought. The models sensitivity analysis indicate that models are more sensitive to drought when rainfall is excluded for more than 60% and when this reduction occurs during the dry season.",

            "abstract": "Glacial Lake Calgary in southern Alberta, Canada, was a Late Pleistocene proglacial lake that formed along the southwest margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS), dammed by the retreating ice sheet margin. Attempts to constrain the age of the lake using radiocarbon methods have been hampered by the lack of datable organic material. In an effort to apply an alternative chronometer, this study uses two optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating approaches to date fine grained sand and silt that were deposited in the lake during its existence. OSL dating determines the depositional ages of sediments by measuring the energy from ionizing radiation that is stored in mineral grains such as quartz and feldspar. Dividing the stored energy, also referred to as the paleodose, by the rate at which the dose accumulated, allows an age to be ascertained. In one method applied in this study, the paleodose stored in the feldspar component of the sediment is determined using normalized infrared stimulated luminescence signals acquired using a portable OSL reader. In the second method, blue optically stimulated luminescence signals obtained from quartz separates from the sediment by employing a regular OSL reader and standard protocols are used to determine the paleodose. After correcting the feldspar data for anomalous fading, the age results from the two dating approaches are compared. The ages signify a time period by which the LIS had retreated from the study area and, hence, serve as constraints for the initiation of the retreat of the ice sheet from its western limit. Advantages and limitations of the dating methods are briefly discussed.\nConstraining the chronology of the retreat of the LIS from western Canada allows for a better understanding of the driving forces behind ice sheet retreat. Secondly, assigning a temporal scale to the postglacial evolution of the environment of the region permits a better insight into the dynamics of the physical and biological environments of the time. Thirdly, the region is at the heart of the ice-free corridor that was ostensibly used by early humans to migrate southwards to populate the Americas ca. 16 ka ago. Hence, an improved deglaciation chronology would allow a more comprehensive evaluation of this concept.",

Infrared spectra measured with apertures of 10-100 µm exhibit OH absorptions characteristic of hydrogen point defects, fine fluid inclusions and micas within quartz grain interiors, and hydrous phases at grain boundaries.\nMoine Thrust quartzites, deformed at greenschist conditions (T ~ 350°C) by Regime II, BLG/SGR dislocation creep, have pervasive broad OH absorptions due to fine fluid inclusions and sharp OH bands that appear locally due to finely dispersed micas. Mean OH contents vary from 2250 (+/-1500) ppm (106 OH/Si) in mylonitic quartzites 2.5 m below the thrust surface to 4080 (+/-1400) ppm in weakly deformed Cambrian quartzites 70 m below the thrust. Spatial variations in OH due to fine fluid inclusions are complex, with water contents that differ significantly between neighboring grains and correlate with grain strain and recrystallization. OH absorption bands mapped at a resolution of 10 µm vary from 280 to 9000 ppm, well above and below concentrations known to weaken quartz.\nHimalayan mylonites in the hanging wall of the Main Central Thrust of the Sutlej region were deformed at upper amphibolite conditions (T ~ 600°C) by Regime III, GBM dislocation creep. Given their extensive deformation and dislocation creep microstructures, quartz grains of these rocks are remarkably dry. Quartz grain spectra are dominated by sharp OH bands due to hydrogen interstitials with OH contents from 350 (+/-250) ppm (T = 600°C) to 119 (+/-62) ppm (T = 640 - 740°C).  These results offer challenges to the application of experimental flow laws for water-weakened quartz to the high-grade dislocation creep of Himalayan mylonites. Much lower water contents may be sufficient for water weakening at upper amphibolite conditions and natural strain rates than are needed at experimental strain rates. Alternatively, hydrogen defects that enhance dislocation motion at these conditions may be sourced from grain boundaries or micas, diffusing over longer distances than are possible at greenschist conditions or laboratory rates.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial surface processes and vegetation conditions are anticipated to play important roles in atmospheric phenomena over a range of temporal scales varying from the diurnal cycle up to intra-seasonal variability. In the North American Monsoon system, a strong vegetation response to summer precipitation in the form of regional ecosystem greening over mountainous terrain had long been recognized. Yet, until the North American Monsoon Experiment (NAME) in 2004 and its subsequent investigations, few details on terrain-vegetation-atmosphere interactions had been studied. This talk discusses advances in understanding the coupling of vegetation and hydrologic processes in mountainous landscapes and its implications for atmospheric feedbacks during the North American Monsoon. First, regional vegetation dynamics are quantified using long-term remote sensing observations, then linked to inter-annual precipitation variability, and subsequently used to enhance the intra-seasonal predictability of evapotranspiration. Second, seasonal vegetation dynamics are used to drive a spatially-explicit land surface model applied at two eddy-covariance sites and a medium-sized watershed to identify their impact on soil moisture, total evapotranspiration and its partitioning into soil evaporation and plant-mediated losses to the atmosphere. Third, vegetation dynamics are shown to alter land surface temperature across mountainous landscapes, thus potentially influencing mountain-valley circulations and mesoscale convective systems. Based on the evidence presented, some possible avenues of future research are outlined to quantify the relative importance terrain-vegetation-atmosphere interactions on the North American Monsoon system.",

The nonlinear effect of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on carbon-water coupling has not been fully considered. To improve the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) at the sub-daily time scale, we propose a new underlying water use efficiency (uWUE = GPP·VPD0.5/ET) and a hysteresis model to minimize time lags among GPP, ET, and VPD. Half-hourly data were used to validate uWUE for 7 vegetation types from 42 AmeriFlux sites. Correlation analysis shows that the GPP·VPD0.5 and ET relationship (r = 0.844) is better than that between GPP·VPD and ET (r = 0.802). The hysteresis model supports the GPP·VPD0.5 and ET relationship. As uWUE is related to CO2 concentrations, its use can improve estimates of GPP and ET, and the effect of CO2 fertilization on carbon reservation and water loss.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the shear strain field ahead of a supershear rupture. The strain data was obtained during large-scale biaxial friction experiments conducted at NIED in March 2013. We conducted friction experiments using a pair of meter-scale gabbro rock specimens whose simulated fault area was 1.5m x 0.1m. We applied 2.6MPa normal stress and loading velocity of 0.1mm/s. At the long side of the fault edge, which is parallel to the slip direction, 32 2-component semi-conductor strain gauges were installed at an interval of 50mm and 10mm off the fault. The data are conditioned by high frequency strain amplifiers (<0.5MHz) and continuously recorded at an interval of 1MHz with 16-bit resolution. Many stick slip events were observed and a unilateral rupture event was chosen in this analysis that propagated with supershear rupture velocity. One of the reasons for this selection was that the strain field ahead of the supershear rupture was not contaminated by elastic waves. Focusing on the rupture front, stress concentration was observed and sharp stress drop occurred immediately inside the rupture. We found that the stress concentration becomes mild as the rupture propagates and length of the stress concentration area becomes longer. This observation is quite interesting because in this experiment the rupture propagated at a constant speed close to root two times the shear wave velocity and thus a longer stress concentration region suggests more energy dissipation. We could speculate that such longer stress concentration area suggests longer plastic region ahead of the rupture (or longer cohesive distance). I.e. the cohesive zone length becomes longer as the rupture propagates to maintain constant rupture velocity propagation. We empirically obtained the relation Lc = 1.8x10^-5 L for 0.1<L<1.4[m] where Lc is cohesive zone length and L is ruptured length.",

In Czechia, there are two mountain ranges (Krkonoše and Jeseníky Mountains), which suffer from regular avalanche activity every year. Mountain Rescue Service is responsible for issuing avalanche bulletins. However, its approaches are still lacking objective assessments and procedures for hazard level estimations. This lack is mainly caused by missing expert avalanche information system.\nThis paper presents preliminary results from a project funded by the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic. This project is focused on development of an information system for snow-avalanche hazard level forecasting. It is composed of three main modules, which should act as a Decision Support System (DSS) for the Mountain Rescue Service.\nFirstly, snow-avalanche susceptibility model is used for delimiting areas where avalanches can occur based on accurate statistical analyses. For that purpose a waste database is used, containing more than 1100 avalanche events from 1961/62 till present.\nSecondly, a physical modeling of the avalanches is being performed on avalanche paths using RAMMS modeling code. Regular paths, where avalanches occur every year, and irregular paths are being assessed. Their footprint is being updated using return period information for each path.\nThirdly, snow distribution and stability models (distributed HBV-ETH, Snowtran 3D, Snowpack and Alpine 3D) are used to assess the critical conditions for avalanche release. For calibration of the models data about meteo/snow cover data and snowpits is used.\nThose three parts are being coupled in a WebGIS platform used as the principal component of the DSS in snow-avalanche hazard level assessment.",

            "abstract": "The prediction of the mobility of geophysical flows to assess their hazards is one of the main research goals in the earth sciences. Our laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are carried out to understand the effects of grain size and flow volume on the mobility of the centre of mass of dry granular flows of angular rock fragments that have pyroclastic flows and rock avalanches as counterpart in nature. We focus on the centre of mass because it provides information about the intrinsic ability of a flow to dissipate more or less energy as a function of its own features. We show that the grain size and flow volume effects can be expressed by a linear relationship between scaling parameters where the finer the grain size or the smaller the flow volume, the more mobile the centre of mass of the granular flow. The grain size effect is the result of the decrease of particle agitation per unit of flow mass, and thus, the decrease of energy dissipation per unit of travel distance, as grain size decreases. In this sense, flows with different grain sizes are like cars with engines with different fuel efficiencies. The volume effect is the result of the fact that the deposit accretes backward during its formation on a slope change (either gradual or abrupt). We adopt for the numerical simulations a 3D discrete element modeling which confirms the grain size and flow volume effects shown by the laboratory experiments. This confirmation is obtained without prior fine tuning of the parameter values to get the desired output. The numerical simulations reveal also that the larger the initial compaction of the granular mass before release, the more mobile the flow. This behaviour must be taken into account to prevent misinterpretation of laboratory and field data. Discrete element modeling predicts the correct effects of grain size and flow volume because it takes into consideration particle interactions that are responsible for the energy dissipated by the flows.",

            "abstract": "Neoproterozoic large negative carbon isotope excursions remain an enigmatic feature of the long-term carbon isotopic record yet their temporal distribution predating the appearance and diversification of complex animals in the fossil record demands an improved understanding of their origin. There is considerable uncertainty on whether these extreme excursions reflect primary perturbations in marine DIC, or whether they are post-depositional features. A variety of diagenetic processes have been proposed to generate the observed record including mechanisms relating to sea level drawdown, burial diagenesis in the presence of hydrocarbons and precipitation of authigenic carbonates. We examine perplexing aspects of the largest negative excursion on record—the Ediacaran Shuram Excursion—including: (1) co-variation in δ13C and δ18O carbonate, (2) elevated trace metal signatures, and (3) its global distribution.\nWe combine bulk and micro-scale analysis of isotopic composition using carbonate clumped isotope thermometry and SIMS, and trace metal enrichments using ICP-OES, XANES and electron microprobe measurements. We find there is little evidence for large-scale isotopic re-ordering associated with open system diagenesis. Instead the bulk of the δ18Omin trend can be explained by a two-step change caused by 1) a temperature increase and fluid composition change from enriched evaporative fluids to open marine fluids and 2) a mineralogical shift from dolomite to calcite. The excursion is correlated with an increase in fine-grained, poorly-weathered detrital sediment that accounts for the majority of the increase in bulk trace metal enrichment. Additionally, SIMS analysis indicates there is no difference in the δ13C of authigenic phases versus primary carbonate phases suggesting the δ13C of the fluid was not modified during burial. These results suggest the combined influences of pH, temperature and carbonate mineralogy (calcite vs. aragonite) on the isotopic fractionation between DIC and precipitated carbonate minerals could be a key component of the carbon isotope excursion.",

IRIS provides imaging and spectral observations of the solar chromosphere and transition region, at high spatial (0.166 arcsec/pix) and temporal (down to ~1s) resolution at FUV and NUV wavelengths. We discuss how simultaneous IRIS and AIA observations, together with loop modeling (with the RADYN code) including chromosphere, transition region and corona, allow us to study impulsive heating events (nanoflares) and the energy transport mechanism between the corona and the lower atmospheric layers (thermal conduction vs. beams of non-thermal particles).

            "abstract": "Natural faults are surrounded by materials damaged through quasi-static and dynamic processes, forming fault zones whose thickness and degree of damage may vary along strike and depth, and as a function of fault maturity. Fault zones can affect earthquake ruptures in observable ways. In particular, we have found that waves trapped in tabular fault zones with reduced seismic wave velocities can generate pulse-like rupture and oscillatory rupture speed, facilitate supershear rupture transition and allow for steady rupture propagation at speeds that are unstable or inadmissible in homogeneous media. Fault zones also enhance near-field ground motions. These effects can appear in pre-existing fault zones but also in damaged zones generated dynamically during rupture, and crucially depend on the fault zone thickness and velocity reduction. Here we attempt to understand what controls fault zone thickness.\nA synthesis of field observations indicates a dependence of fault zone thickness on cumulated slip characterized by linear scaling at small slip and saturation at large slip. These observations combined with empirical slip-length relations suggest that the maximum fault zone thickness is controlled by (proportional to) the depth extent of the seismogenic zone. We will present fracture mechanics theoretical arguments and dynamic rupture simulations with off-fault plasticity and damage that predict this saturation of fault zone thickness. In essence, the stress intensity factor at the front of a rupture in 3D, which controls the distance reached by the large off-fault stresses that cause damage, scales with the shortest characteristic length of the slipping zone. This length is limited by the seismogenic depth.\nFurther implications and effects of seismogenic depth will be presented, including limits on the fault stepover offset that can be breached by a dynamic rupture.",

            "abstract": "Many methanotrophic bacterial groups fix nitrogen in laboratory conditions. Furthermore, nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient in many environments where methane concentrations are highest. Despite these facts, methane-induced N fixation has previously been overlooked, possibly due to methodological problems. To study the possible link between methanotrophy and diazotrophy in terrestrial and aquatic habitats, we measured the co-occurrence of these two processes in boreal forest, peatland and stream mosses using a stable isotope labeling approach (15 N2 and 13 CH4 double labeling) and sequencing of the nifH gene marker. N fixation associated with forest mosses was dependent on the annual N deposition, whereas methane stimulate N fixation neither in high (>3 kg N ha -1 yr -1) nor low deposition areas, which was in accordance with the nifH gene sequencing showing that forest mosses (Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens ) carried mainly cyanobacterial N fixers. On the other extreme, in stream mosses (Fontinalis sp.) methane was actively oxidized throughout the year, whereas N fixation showed seasonal fluctuation. The co-occurrence of the two processes in single cell level was proven by co-localizing both N and methane-carbon fixation with the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) approach. Methanotrophy and diazotrophy was also studied in peatlands of different primary successional stages in the land-uplift coast of Bothnian Bay, in the Siikajoki chronosequence, where N accumulation rates in peat profiles indicate significant N fixation. Based on experimental evidence it was counted that methane-induced N fixation explained over one-third of the new N input in the younger peatland successional stages, where the highest N fixation rates and highest methane oxidation activities co-occurred in the water-submerged Sphagnum moss vegetation. The linkage between methanotrophic carbon cycling and N fixation may therefore constitute an important mechanism in the rapid accumulation of N during the primary succession of peatlands. It is still an open issue whether methanotrophy induces N fixation directly or by enhancing phototrophic or heterotrophic N fixation.",

            "abstract": "The Snowball Earth model provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding the causes and demise of the extreme global glaciations that occurred during the Neoproterozoic, and can be refined through creative interactions between geological, geochemical and modeling studies. We present unequivocal evidence for oscillating glacier extent and varying hydrological conditions during the Marinoan, the second major Cryogenian glaciation (~650-635 Ma), from the Wilsonbreen Formation of NE Svalbard. Extensive exposures record (1) a possibly long arid periglacial phase; (2) multiple switches between subglacial, glaciolacustrine, carbonate lacustrine and non-glacial terrestrial deposition; and (3) rapid deglaciation. Oxygen and sulfur isotopes of sulfate in carbonate facies indicate persistently high pCO2 consistent with deposition of the Formation on a 105-year timescale.\nUsing an ice sheet model (GRISLI) coupled to a General Circulation Model (LMDz), the response of the continental ice-sheet to insolation changes (i.e. orbital forcing) and pCO2 is investigated. We show that land-ice cover waxes and wanes over the course of a precession cycle for pCO2 levels from 0.01 to 0.05 bar. Growth and retreat of ice reflect shifts in the balance between precipitation and evaporation (P-E), in response to migration of the tropical Hadley Cell. In cold conditions (<0.01bar), the weakness of the hydrological cycle makes the system insensitive to precession changes, explaining relatively stable ice-sheets during the earlier stages of the Snowball Earth. With 0.01<pCO2<0.05bar, variations of the P-E pattern caused by insolation changes (orbital forcing) produces advances/retreats of the ice sheet in <10 kyr. With pCO2>0.05bar, the albedo effect is overcome and air temperatures rise in ice free regions in low latitudes and deglaciation occurs. The results show that the Snowball Earth model can be reconciled with evidence for prolonged, pulsed glacial deposition. The main, longest phase of the glacial epoch appears to have been cold and arid with a limited hydrological cycle, but deglaciation was not a simple switch from icehouse to greenhouse. Instead, there was a climate transition during which glacial cycles could be forced by Milankovitch orbital variations.",

            "abstract": "The rise and collapse of orogens through geologic time has been a major forcing on terrestrial climate and water cycling. Orogens substantially affect the type, amount, and distribution of precipitation on continents through their influence on atmospheric dynamics and circulation, vapor transport, and precipitation processes. Stable isotope compositions (δ18O/δD) of authigenic minerals can preserve a record of ancient meteoric waters and, in this way, offer a glimpse into past water cycles and their response to topographic evolution. In practice, however, stable isotope records can be difficult to interpret, both due to the complex response of the water cycle to topographic change and due to coeval climate change.\nIsotope-enabled global climate models (GCMs) provide a tool for quantifying the response of water isotopes to topography and climate, and can be used in collaboration with proxy records to refine our understanding of long-term paleoclimate change. Our previous work using isotope-enabled GCMs has demonstrated that Cenozoic uplift of the Andes and the North American Cordillera had a large and complicated influence on the water cycle and stable isotope compositions. In this talk, we report on a series of experiments simulating surface uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas using an isotope-enabled GCM (ECHAM5-wiso), and compare stable isotope and water cycle responses to those resulting from uplift of the Andean and North American orogens. Our preliminary results indicate that as in the central Andes and western North America the response to surface uplift is regionally large, spatially heterogeneous, and nonlinear. In contrast to the Andes and North American Cordillera however, surface uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas has a more widespread influence on stable isotope compositions that extends across the Northern Hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "For improving the estimation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle, a new time series of the leaf area index (LAI) is generated for the global land surface at 8 km resolution from 1981 to 2012 by combining AVHRR and MODIS satellite data. This product differs from existing LAI products in the following two aspects: (1) the non-random spatial distribution of leaves with the canopy is considered, and (2) the seasonal variation of the vegetation background is included. The non-randomness of the leaf spatial distribution in the canopy is considered using the second vegetation structural parameter named clumping index (CI), which quantifies the deviation of the leaf spatial distribution from the random case. Using the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function product, a global map of CI is produced at 500 m resolution. In our LAI algorithm, CI is used to convert the effective LAI obtained from mono-angle remote sensing into the true LAI, otherwise LAI would be considerably underestimated. The vegetation background is soil in crop, grass and shrub but includes soil, grass, moss, and litter in forests. Through processing a large volume of MISR data from 2000 to 2010, monthly red and near-infrared reflectances of the vegetation background is mapped globally at 1 km resolution. This new LAI product has been validated extensively using ground-based LAI measurements distributed globally. In carbon cycle modeling, the use of CI in addition to LAI allows for accurate separation of sunlit and shaded leaves as an important step in terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration modeling. Carbon flux measurements over 100 sites over the globe are used to validate an ecosystem model named Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS). The validated model is run globally at 8 km resolution for the period from 1981 to 2012 using the LAI product and other spatial datasets. The modeled results suggest that changes in vegetation structure as quantified by LAI do not contribute significantly to the increasing trend in carbon sink over the last 32 years. The increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition are found to be the major causes for the increases in plant productivity and carbon sink over the last 32 years.",

It often occurs as particles made of nanoscale crystallites, which tend to increase its reactivity. At this meeting, we will present alteration experiments of nano-goethite particles after moderate heating in reducing or oxidizing atmospheres. Initial, intermediate, and final products of these experiments were characterized using low-temperature and room-temperature magnetometry, as well as non-magnetic techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. Our results show that alteration of poorly crystalline nanophase goethite can produce strongly magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. As a consequence, nano-goethite likely represents an important precursor of magnetic nanoparticles in the environment, which may impact a large number of paleoclimate, paleoenvironmental, and paleomagnetic studies. In particular, our experiments show that synthetic oriented aggregates of goethite nanoparticles can be easily converted to stoichiometric, highly crystalline, single-domain magnetite particles, including a substantial number of euhedral grains with morphologies similar to those of magnetosomes found in magnetotactic bacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate that such abiotic magnetite meets several of the biogenicity criteria commonly used for the identification of magnetofossils.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of aquatic environments to landscape carbon cycling is particularly apparent in carbon- and water-rich regions. Such areas arguably represent an end member in terms of the relative significance of aquatic carbon cycling, while dry, carbon-poor zones are the likely opposing end member. Not surprisingly, most limnological attention has focused on these former regions, leaving open questions as to how aquatic systems in other locales influence larger-scale carbon dynamics. This includes human-dominated landscapes where agricultural and urban land uses can fundamentally alter carbon dynamics. Surveys of streams, ponds, and lakes in a southern Wisconsin landscape highlight three findings relevant to understanding the role of these aquatic systems in larger-scale carbon dynamics. First, streams and ponds had unexpectedly high summertime concentrations in and fluxes of CO2 and CH4. These values were approximately an order of magnitude greater than for less disturbed, forest and wetland-dominated landscapes in northern Wisconsin. Second, while mean C gas concentrations in lakes were lower than in streams and ponds, detailed spatial measurements demonstrate variability in surface water CO2 (43-1090 ppm pCO2) and CH4 (6-839 ppm pCH4) within a lake on a single day is similar to that observed among 25 streams included in our survey (260-6000 ppm pCO2; 50-600 ppm pCH4). This small-scale heterogeneity highlights a basic challenge for upscaling site-specific data collected at one or a few points to the whole lake and across lakes. Third, while agricultural and urban ecosystems are not necessarily carbon-rich environments, area-specific carbon storage in streams and ponds is substantial (up to 3000-5000 g C per m2). Further, carbon storage was strongly related to CH4 concentrations in streams, as C-rich sediments provided both an environment and substrate to fuel methanogenesis. The picture that emerges of C processing in aquatic environments throughout this human-dominated landscape is one of large C pools and fluxes and high spatial variability, suggesting that these land uses may be accelerating rates of aquatic C cycling and amplifying the role of these ecosystems in anthropogenic landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Clouds are not only fascinating to watch for their myriad of shapes, but are also scientifically challenging because their formation requires both knowledge about the large-scale meteorological environment as well as knowledge about the details of cloud droplet and ice crystal formation on the micro-scale. The ice phase in cloud remains enigmatic because ice crystal number concentrations can exceed the number concentrations of those aerosol particles acting as centers for ice crystals (so-called ice nuclei) by orders of magnitude. To date, measurement devices for ice nuclei are rare and custom-made. In this work, I present the significant progress that has been made in the ice nucleation community in identifying which aerosol particles may act as ice nuclei and why. As pointed out in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions remains the largest uncertainty of the anthropogenic forcings. On the other hand, how clouds change in a warmer climate is the largest of uncertainties in terms of the expected warming at a point of doubling of carbon dioxide.",

            "abstract": "Classifying observed aerosols into types (e.g., urban-industrial, biomass burning, mineral dust, maritime) helps to understand aerosol sources, transformations, effects, and feedback mechanisms; to improve accuracy of satellite retrievals; and to quantify aerosol radiative impacts on climate. The number of aerosol parameters retrieved from spaceborne sensors has been growing, from the initial aerosol optical depth (AOD) at one or a few wavelengths to a list that now includes AOD, complex refractive index, single scattering albedo (SSA), and depolarization of backscatter, each at several wavelengths, plus several particle size and shape parameters. Making optimal use of these varied data products requires objective, multi-dimensional analysis methods. We describe such a method, which makes explicit use of uncertainties in input parameters. It treats an N-parameter retrieved data point and its N-dimensional uncertainty as an extended data point, E. It then uses a modified Mahalanobis distance, DEC, to assign an observation to the class (cluster) C that has minimum DEC from the point. We use parameters retrieved from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) to define seven prespecified clusters (pure dust, polluted dust, urban-industrial/developed economy, urban-industrial/developing economy, dark biomass smoke, light biomass smoke, pure marine), and we demonstrate application of the method to a 5-year record of retrievals from the spaceborne POLDER-3 (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances) polarimeter over the island of Crete, Greece. Results show changes of aerosol type at this location in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, which is influenced by a wide variety of aerosol sources.",

We previously found that across a broad range of climate regimes, the seasonal change in δ13C measured within tree rings reflects changes in seasonal precipitation amount, and demonstrated its utility for quantifying seasonal paleo-precipitation from non-permineralized, fossil wood. Here we produce an equation relating intra-ring changes in δ18O to seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation amount, but the equation yields for unknowns (summer and winter precipitation amounts, and cold and warm month mean temperatures). By combining high-resolution δ13C and δ18O records with independent estimates of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, we show how our general, global relationships could be used to quantify seasonal climate information from fossil sites. We validate our approach using high-resolution δ13C and δ18O data from trees growing at five modern sites (Hawaii, Alaska, Norway, Guyana, and Kenya). The reconstructed estimates of seasonal precipitation and temperature showed excellent agreement with the known climate data for each site (precipitation: R2 = 0.98; temperature: R2 = 0.91). These results confirm that across diverse sites and tree species, seasonal climate information can be accurately quantified using a combination of carbon and oxygen intra-ring isotope profiles.",

            "abstract": "To understand how Sr isotopes behave during chemical weathering and biogeochemical cycling, we analyzed the stable Sr isotope composition (δ88/86Sr) of rivers, rocks, sediments, plants, and soils from the Cleddau and Hollyford catchments in Fiordland, New Zealand. We leached rocks, sediments, and soils to isolate relatively soluble Sr sources. δ88/86Sr values were measured using an 87Sr-84Sr double-spike MC-TIMS method, which was optimized according to the Monte Carlo error model described in Lehn et al. (2013). The long-term, external reproducibility of the method is ±0.020‰ (2σSD) based on repeated measurements of NBS-987 [δ88/86Sr = 0.000 ± 0.004‰ (2σSEM), n=77] and IAPSO seawater [δ88/86Sr = 0.396 ± 0.005‰ (2σSEM), n=54]. Although the study site receives abundant rainfall (6700mm/yr), atmospheric inputs of Sr are negligible. We find that δ88/86Sr values can distinguish between silicate- versus carbonate- derived riverine Sr sources when traditional tracers, such as radiogenic Sr isotope (87Sr/86Sr) and molar Ca/Sr ratios, are equivocal. Moreover, rivers draining gabbro bedrock in the Cleddau and Upper Hollyford catchments have higher δ88/86Sr values (0.368‰) as compared to bulk silicate rock (0.162 – 0.284‰) and sediment (0.286‰). In the Lower Hollyford catchment, tributary rivers draining volcanic and sedimentary rocks also have higher δ88/86Sr values (0.328‰) as compared to bulk silicate rock (0.177‰) and sediment (0.260‰). We examine several hypotheses to explain the elevated riverine δ88/86Sr values, including end-member mixing, fractionation during chemical weathering, and plant uptake. We attribute the riverine δ88/86Sr values to mixing with the soil pore water pool, which is isotopically heavy due to preferential uptake of 86Sr by plants.",

How does that happen?\nThe machinery of climate anti-science starts from the top with funders working through a maze of money paths, think tanks and front groups, employing spokespeople who can be portrayed as experts. While much of the money flows are still dark, some have been exposed over the last few years, and the effects finally filter down to the state and local levels of education. Among others, the Heartland Institute has a long history of trying to inject anti-science into K-12 and college education, having sent books, DVDs or brochures to teachers or school boards, as well as monthly newsletters to state legislators. Such are aimed at the top of the state or local organizations that affect education.\nFor a vocal subset of the citizenry, a constant flow of misinformation from books, blogs, newsletters and some newspapers and magazines stirs action such as writing letters to editors, complaining to schools, calling on pseudo-experts and demanding equal time for pseudoscience. As the teacher said, it only takes one person to cause trouble at the local level.\nAfter a brief review of the overall machinery, this focuses on examples of anti-education tactics seen already, with some brief advice for climate scientists and educators who need to understand the machinery that supports such tactics.\nSome earlier history is included in http://www.desmogblog.com/2012/10/23/fakery-2-more-funny-finances-free-tax, but other attempts have surfaced in last few years, including state-wide efforts to reject Common Core Educational standard to avoid teaching climate science.

            "abstract": "As temperatures increase, the onset and severity of droughts are likely to become more intense. Improved tools for understanding, monitoring, and predicting droughts will be a key component of 21st century climate adaption. The best drought monitoring systems will bring together accurate precipitation estimates with skillful climate and weather forecasts. Such systems combine the predictive power inherent in the current land surface state with the predictive power inherent in low frequency ocean-atmosphere dynamics. To this end, researchers at the Climate Hazards Group (CHG), in collaboration with partners at the USGS and NASA, have developed i) a long (1981-present) quasi-global (50°S-50°N, 180°W-180°E) high resolution (0.05°) homogeneous precipitation data set designed specifically for drought monitoring, ii) tools for understanding and predicting East African boreal spring droughts, and iii) an integrated land surface model (LSM) system that combines rainfall observations and predictions to provide effective drought early warning. This talk briefly describes these three components.\nComponent 1: CHIRPS\nThe Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) blends in situ station data with geostationary satellite observations to provide global near real time daily, pentadal and monthly precipitation estimates. We describe the CHIRPS algorithm and compare CHIRPS and other estimates to validation data. The CHIRPS is shown to have high correlation, low systematic errors (bias) and low mean absolute errors.\nComponent 2: Hybrid statistical-dynamic forecast strategies\nEast African droughts have increased in frequency, but become more predictable as Indo-Pacific SST gradients and Walker circulation disruptions intensify. We describe hybrid statistical-dynamic forecast strategies that are far superior to the raw output of coupled forecast models. These forecasts can be translated into probabilities that can be used to generate bootstrapped ensembles describing future climate conditions.\nComponent 3: Assimilation using LSMs\nCHIRPS rainfall observations (component 1) and bootstrapped forecast ensembles (component 2) can be combined using LSMs to predict soil moisture deficits. We evaluate the skill of such a system in East Africa, and demonstrate results for 2013.",

            "abstract": "Single-cell sequencing and metagenomics have extended the genomics revolution to yet-uncultivated microorganisms and provided insights into the coding potential of this so-called \"microbial dark matter\", including microbes belonging candidate phyla with no cultivated representatives. As more datasets emerge, comparison of individual genomes from different lineages and habitats can provide insight into the phylogeny, conserved features, and potential metabolic diversity of candidate phyla. The candidate bacterial phylum OP9 was originally found in Obsidian Pool, Yellowstone National Park, and it has since been detected in geothermal springs, petroleum reservoirs, and engineered thermal environments worldwide. JS1, another uncultivated bacterial lineage affiliated with OP9, is often abundant in marine sediments associated with methane hydrates, hydrocarbon seeps, and on continental margins and shelves, and is found in other non-thermal marine and subsurface environments. The phylogenetic relationship between OP9, JS1, and other Bacteria has not been fully resolved, and to date no axenic cultures from these lineages have been reported. Recently, 31 single amplified genomes (SAGs) from six distinct OP9 and JS1 lineages have been obtained using flow cytometric and microfluidic techniques. These SAGs were used to inform metagenome binning techniques that identified OP9/JS1 sequences in several metagenomes, extending genomic coverage in three of the OP9 and JS1 lineages. Phylogenomic analyses of these SAG and metagenome bin datasets suggest that OP9 and JS1 constitute a single, deeply branching phylum, for which the name \"Atribacteria\" has recently been proposed. Overall, members of the \"Atribacteria\" are predicted to be heterotrophic anaerobes without the capacity for respiration, with some lineages potentially specializing in secondary fermentation of organic acids. A set of signature \"Atribacteria\" genes was tentatively identified, including components of a bacterial microcompartments gene cluster that may be involved in carbohydrate catabolism. The \"Atribacteria\" may play important roles in biomass processing in anaerobic geothermal and subsurface environments.",

The study area is the Río El Estado watershed that covers 5.2 km2 and lies on the southwestern flank of Pico de Orizaba volcano.\nThe watershed was studied by using aerial photographs, fieldwork, and adaptation of the Landslide Hazard Zonation Protocol of the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, USA. 107 gravitational slope failures of six types were recognized: shallow landslides, debris-avalanches, deep-seated landslides, debris flows, earthflows, and rock falls. This analysis divided the watershed into 12 mass-wasting landforms on which gravitational processes occur: inner gorges, headwalls, active scarps of deep-seated landslides, meanders, plains, rockfalls, non-rule-identified inner gorges, non-rule-identified headwalls, non-rule-identified converging hillslopes and three types of hillslopes classified by their gradient: low, moderate, and high. For each landform the landslide area rate and the landslide frequency rate were calculated as well as the overall hazard rating. The slope-stability hazard rating has a range that goes from low to very high. The overall hazard rating for this watershed was very high. The shallow slide type landslide was selected and area and volume of individual landslides were retrieved from the watershed landslide inventory geo-database, to establish an empirical relationship between area and volume that takes the form of a power law. The relationship was used to estimate the total volume of landslides in the study area. The findings are important to understand the long-term evolution of the southwestern flank stream system of Pico de Orizaba, and may prove useful in the assessment of landslide susceptibility and hazard in volcanic terrains.",

Different processes have been proposed for their origin. In this work we test the idea that the lunar swirls have a higher albedo relative to surrounding regions because they deflect incoming solar wind particles that can darken, or weather, the surface. Particle tracking is used to estimate the influence of four lunar magnetic anomalies on incoming solar wind. The regions investigated include Mare Ingenii, Gerasimovich, Renier Gamma and Northwest of Apollo. Both ions and electrons are tracked as they interact with the anomalous magnetic field and impact maps are calculated. The impact maps are then compared to optical observations and comparisons are made between the maxima and minima in surface fluxes and the high and low albedo regions. Results show deflection of typical solar wind particles on a larger scale than the fine scale optical features. Efficiencies for deflection of incoming particles do not scale directly with surface magnetic field strength but are also a function of the 3D nature of the magnetic field. All anomalous regions can also produce moderate deflection of fast solar wind particles but none can deflect SEP energy range particles.",

            "abstract": "The ion foreshock upstream of the quasi-parallel terrestrial bow shock is characterized by suprathermal plasma counter-streaming against the incident solar wind. Interactions between the foreshock and solar wind plasmas can enhance wave activity and produce large-scale transient phenomena, such as hot flow anomalies (HFAs) and foreshock bubbles (FBs). HFAs and FBs both result from discontinuities in the interplanetary magnetic field “sweeping up” and concentrating suprathermal foreshock ions via gyro-kinetic effects. These concentrations become the super-heated cores of HFAs and FBs and result in strong disruptions of the local solar wind plasma, including flow deflections and strong density and magnetic field variations. One of the consequences of these strong variations is a change in the total pressure incident on the bow shock. Here, we quantify these pressure variations from a series of cases of HFAs and FBs observed by NASA’s THEMIS spacecraft and discuss how these pressure variations can penetrate through the magnetosheath and impact the magnetosphere, resulting in significant magnetopause displacement. With evidence from multi-point observations, we also compare and contrast the nature of HFAs and FB impacts on the magnetopause, showing that HFAs tend to be more localized in nature while FBs impact the system more globally, similar to pressure pulses in the solar wind. Both phenomena also result in the formation of strong compressions and/or shocks, resulting in strong wave activity. We finish with a discussion of the potential for particle acceleration from HFAs and FBs, showing evidence that both are highly efficient at ion and electron acceleration.",

            "abstract": "It is notoriously difficult to create and maintain permeability in deep hot-dry rock (HDR) geothermal reservoirs with engineering strategies. However, we predict that long-lived, slowly deforming HDR reservoirs likely contain hydraulically conductive, over-pressured fracture systems, provided that (a) the underlying lower crust and/or mantle are not entirely depleted of fluids and (b) the fracture system has not been drained into highly permeable overlying rocks. Such fracture systems could be targeted for the extraction of geothermal energy.\nOur prediction hinges on the notion that polycrystalline creep through matter transfer by a liquid phase (dissolution-precipitation creep) is a widespread mechanism for extracting fluids from the lower crust and mantle. Such processes - where creep cavities form during the slow, high-temperature deformation of crystalline solids, e.g., ceramics, metals, and rocks – entail the formation of (intergranular) fluid-assisted creep fractures. They constitute micron-scale voids formed along grain boundaries due to incompatibilities arising from diffusion or dislocation creep. Field and laboratory evidence suggest that the process leading to creep fractures may generate a dynamic permeability in the ductile crust, thus extracting fluids from this domain.\nWe employed an elasto-visco-plastic material model that simulates creep fractures with continuum damage mechanics to model the slow contraction of high-heat-producing granites overlain by sedimentary rocks in 2D. The models suggest that deformation always leads to the initiation of a horizontal creep-damage front in the lower crust. This front propagates upwards towards the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) during protracted deformation where it collapses into highly damaged brittle-ductile shear zones. If the BDT is sufficiently shallow or finite strain sufficiently large, these shear zones trigger brittle faults emerging from their tips, which connect to the sub-horizontal damage layer just underneath the BDT. This layer may feed the brittle fault with over-pressured, hot fluids from ductile lithosphere. We discuss our models in relation to the Cooper-Basin granites of South Australia, which may constitute a natural example of this phenomenon.",

            "abstract": "Most of the major features of the Earth’s interior were discovered using the concepts of isotropic seismology; however, subtle features require more realistic concepts. Although the importance of anisotropy has been known for over 50 years, only in the last decade has the increasing quality and quantity of data forced the wide recognition that anisotropyis crucial for accurate descriptions of upper mantle structure.\nThe persistence of the “plume hypothesis”, in spite of abundant evidence to the contrary, is partly based on the neglect of anisotropy, sparse and biased ray coverage, and the misuse of Occam’s razor. Whereas isotropic inversion of teleseismic near-vertical travel-time datasets suggests the presence of deep vertical zones of low velocity (interpreted as mantle plumes), anisotropic inversion of data having a range of polarizations and directions of approach suggests instead shallow zones of relatively high anisotropy. This raises the possibility that current understanding of manyof the subtle features of Earth structure could be erroneous, caused by over-simplified analysis.\nThe simplest plausible anisotropic model is that of polar anisotropy (“VTI” [sic!]), with a radial symmetry axis. The essential idea which makes anisotropic seismology feasible is the recognition that, in the Earth, the anisotropy is almost invariably weak, and the anisotropic equations (linearized in appropriately chosen small parameters) are quite simple (see below).\nThese equations show that, to first order, the anisotropic variation of velocity is not governed by the individual Cab , but rather by the combinations of parameters given above. Hence, inversions should seek these combinations, rather than the individual moduli.\nThe Rayleigh velocity VR is a simple function of VS0 and the P- and SV- anisotropies. The Love velocity VL is a complicated function of VS0 and the SH anisotropy γ.\nThe simplest plausible model of azimuthal anisotropy is orthorhombic (not (“HTI” [sic!]), which may be analyzed as a simple generalization of the foregoing. Along the two principle azimuths, the velocities are exactly those of two (different) polar anisotropic media, which may be simplified as above. At other azimuths, a 9th (δ-like) parameter is required. The VR-VL discrepancy is best described in these terms.",

Our main approach is to couple simulation models: (1) the magnetically and electrically self-consistent Rice Convection Model – Equilibrium (RCM-E) of the inner magnetosphere, (2) the B3c transport model for electron-proton-hydrogen atom aurora in the ionosphere, and (3) the Thermosphere-Ionsphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) of the ionosphere and thermosphere. Realistic descriptions of electron pitch-angle diffusion by whistler chorus in the plasma sheet/magnetotail and hiss in the plasmasphere are included in the RCM-E. We use parameterized rates of electron pitch-angle scattering with whistler chorus of Orlova and Shprits [JGR, 2014] that depend on equatorial radial distance, magnetic activity (Kp), and magnetic local time. To study how the precipitating electron energy flux distributions affect ionospheric conductivity and ionospheric electric potential patterns, we have performed a one-way coupling of the RCM-E and ionospheric B3c model. The simulated precipitating electron flux distributions are used to specify the energy flux and particle heating due to precipitating auroral electrons for TIEGCM simulations of the neutral atmosphere.

HEIDI solves the time dependent, gyration and bounced averaged kinetic equation for the phase space density of different ring current species and computes full pitch angle distributions for all local times and radial distances. During geomagnetic times the dipole approximation becomes unsuitable even in the inner magnetosphere. Therefore the HEIDI model was generalized to accommodate an arbitrary magnetic field and through the coupling with SWMF it obtains a magnetic field description throughout the HEIDI domain along with a plasma distribution at the model outer boundary from the Block Adaptive Tree Solar Wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model within SWMF. Electric field self-consistency is assured by the passing of convection potentials from the Ridley Ionosphere Model (RIM) within SWMF.\nIn this study we test the various levels of coupling between the 3 physics based models, highlighting the role that the magnetic field, plasma sheet conditions and the cross polar cap potential play in the formation and evolution of the ring current. We show that the dynamically changing geospace environment itself plays a key role in determining the geoeffectiveness of the driver.\nThe results of the self-consistent coupling between HEIDI, BATS-R-US and RIM during disturbed conditions emphasize the importance of a kinetic self-consistent approach to the description of geospace.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater pollution is a major concern in peri-urban environments. Thus, water quality is being investigated at several domestic wells in Brandsen, 70 km south of Buenos Aires, Argentina. To present, about 20 water sources were sampled in orchards and small farms of the area. There is limited data about the wells construction, although collected information suggests that groundwater is derived from the superficial sandy loams of the Pampean Aquifer. Samples were analysed for major inorganic elements using ion chromatography and ICP-MS. Titration was used to estimate alkalinity. Physical characteristics (EC, pH, temperature) were measured on site. Results show that groundwater pH ranges from 6.5 to 7.8, with a specific conductance of 180 to 255 mS/m. A peak of 360 mS/m in one horticultural parcel is associated to local NO3- concentrations up to 140 mg/L. This value exceeds the maximum recommendations set by the WHO (50 mg/L). Considering that fertilizer inputs in that property are negligible, the high levels of NO3- might be attributed to effluents from a neighbour septic tank. An increase in NO3- (>150mg/L) was also detected in two conventional farms. This increase correlates to elevated SO42- concentrations (>300 mg/L) suggesting thus, fertilizers percolation into the saturated zone. The leaching of these fluids might be exacerbated by irrigation during new planting, and accumulations of fertilizer-solids in the root zones from previous seasons. Chloride concentrations average ~90 mg/L and would not pose a threat to health at the moment. Its main origin would be related to connate waters in the loam matrix, although some anthropogenic inputs might occur in the previously described farms. In general, the rest of the analysed elements fall within acceptable levels for drinking purposes as well. Nevertheless, further work is still necessary to better define the fate of the potential harmful elements and assess seasonal variations in water quality.",

Results of batch study showed that 75-90% of both As (III) and As (V) were removed at pH 7. Arsenic adsorption capacities were the highest at neutral pH condition and the adsorption equilibrium time reached in 7 days using AMDS mortar. Additionally, the adsorption kinetic process is expressed well by pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption capacities of AMDS mortar for As(III) and As(V) were found 19.04 and 30.75 mg g-1, respectively. The results of As (III) adsorption isotherms were fitted well to the Freundlich model. Moreover, As (V) adsorption isotherms were fitted well to the Langmuir model rather than Freundlich model. Based on experimental results in this study, we could conclude that AMDS mortar can be effectively used for arsenic removal agent from subsurface environment.",

NASA climate education datasets and tools were introduced to faculty of Minority Serving Institutions through a grant from the NASA Innovations in Climate Education program.\nThese lessons were developed to study various ocean processes involving phytoplankton's chlorophyll production over time for specific geographic areas using the Giovanni NASA software tool. The pre-service teachers had designed the climate change content that will assist K-4 learners to identify and predict phytoplankton sources attributed to sea surface temperatures, nutrient levels, sunlight, and atmospheric carbon dioxide associated with annual chlorophyll production.\nFrom the EDUC 203 course content, the preservice teachers applied the three phases of the technology integration planning (TIP) model in developing their lessons. The Zunal website (http://www.zunal.com) served as a hypermedia tool for online instructional delivery in presenting the climate change content, the NASA climate datasets, and the visualization tools used for the production of elementary learning units. A rubric was developed to assess students’ development of their webquests to meet the overall learning objectives and specific climate education objectives. Accompanying each webquest is a rubric with a defined table of criteria, for a teacher to assess students completing each of the required tasks for each lesson.\nTwo primary challenges of technology integration for elementary pre-service teachers were 1) motivating pre-service teachers to be interested in climate education and 2) aligning elementary learning objectives with the Next Generation science standards of climate education that are non-existent in the Common Core State Standards.",

            "abstract": "The ring current plays an important role in the processes of energy transport through the inner magnetosphere into the subauroral ionosphere, and as a source of particle precipitation into the atmospheric regions located equatorward of the auroral zone. A large fraction of the solar wind energy transferred into the magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms is consumed by the buildup of the storm-time ring current. As the ring current decays during the storm recovery phase, its energy is released into the atmosphere, ionosphere, and plasmasphere causing effects such as subauroral electron temperature enhancements, detached proton arcs, and energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes. Ring current pressure gradients drive the Region-2 field-aligned currents that further modify the overall convection pattern and can have significant feedback on ring current dynamics. In addition, the storm-time ring current development affects radiation belt dynamics in various ways: a) it depresses the background magnetic field on the nightside, which affects the subsequent transport of radiation belt electrons, b) its electron component represents a highly variable, asymmetric, low-energy seed population of the radiation belts, and c) the unstable ring current ion and electron populations generate electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC), magnetosonic, and chorus waves (with different intensities and spatial distributions) that scatter radiation belt particles. Results from recent ring current modeling studies using self-consistently calculated electric and magnetic fields that illustrate these coupling processes are presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Carbon (C) in thawing permafrost soils may have global impacts on climate change, yet controls on its processing and fate are poorly understood. The dominant fate of dissolved organic C (DOC) released from soils to inland waters is either complete oxidation to CO2 or partial oxidation and river export to oceans. Both processes are most often attributed to bacterial respiration, but we recently showed that photochemical oxidation exceeds rates of respiration and accounts for 70-95% of total DOC processed in the water column of arctic lakes and rivers. While the overall dominance of photochemical processing in streams and lakes remained, the fate of DOC varied consistently by water type. In small streams DOC was mainly mineralized by sunlight to CO2, while in lakes the main fate of DOC was partial photo-oxidation. Large rivers were intermediate between these end members, and photo-mineralization to CO2 was about equal to or less than partial photo-oxidation. We suggest this pattern is a result of light-exposure history, where DOC leached from soils into headwater streams has little prior light exposure and is labile to complete photo-oxidation, but as light exposure increases moving downstream and into lakes with longer residence times the DOC photo-lability declines. Thus as easily photo-mineralized moieties are removed, DOC fate shifts toward partial photo-oxidation and downstream export in rivers and lakes. At the basin scale, photochemical processing of DOC is about one third of the total CO2 released from surface waters, and is thus an important, newly measured component of the Arctic C budget. We also suggest that these photochemical transformations of DOC will occur in any shallow surface water, and could be important for better understanding inland water carbon cycling.",

            "abstract": "Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Müll. Arg.) plantaitons are rapidly expanding throughout mainland Southeast Asia, potentially changing the partitioning of water, energy, and carbon at multiple scales, compared with the traditional land covers they are replacing. We have conducted eddy flux measurements in two rubber plantation sites: Som Sanuk (SS), located northern Thailand; and Cambodian Rubber Research Institute (CRRI), central Cambodia. We used combination of actual evapotranspiration (ET) flux measurements and an inversed version of a simple 2-layer ET model for estimating the mean canopy stomatal conductances (gs), which is among the most effective measures for describing the exchange characteristics. It is demonstrated how each studied rubber plantation copes with each strong seasonal drought via tree water use strategies. Potential tree water use deficit (precipitation (P) - potential evaporation (ET_POT)) for each season (i.e., December-February: DJF, March-May: MAM, June-August: JJA, and September-November: SON) revealed in which season and how the water use should be controlled. We found that in the season when actual tree water use deficit (P - ET) was negative (DJF and MAM), the deficit was compensated with soil water from the previous season at a depth of 0-2 m at the Thailand site, and from a depth of 0-3 m at CRRI. Two ecophysiological parameters, the reference value of gs (gsref) and the sensitivity of gs to atmospheric demand (m), as well as their proportionality (m/gsref), were derived from the logarithmic response curve of gs to vapor pressure deficit (D) for each season and each site. In both sites, gsref and m appeared to be less in DJF and MAM than each in the other three month periods (seasons). On average in a whole year, m/gsref was less than 0.6 at SS and almost 0.6 at the CRRI site, suggesting that there was less sufficient stomatal regulation at SS, where there might be little risk of water stress-induced hydraulic failure because of much annual rainfall amount. In comparison, at CRRI where annual P - ET_POT was negative, there was stricter stomatal regulation, preventing excessive xylem cavitation. These tendencies imply that in the drier season, i.e., DJF and MAM, the rubber trees in SS and CRRI adopt the stomatal control strategy of changing gsref with reluctance and positive to change m, respectively.",

Here we demonstrate that a small cluster of tremors is extremely well correlated with tide levels observed at nearby stations in western Japan. The correlation is interpreted as representing a nonlinear relationship between stress and slip, which is similar to the rate-dependent friction law. An empirical relationship and observed tide records explain the temporal changes in tremor activity over 9 years. The combination of the nonlinear fault rheology and oscillating tidal stress may control temporal changes in plate motion and earthquake occurrence. Remarkably, the background seismicity is similar to the predicted tremor rate obtained from tidal observations over the past 50 years. This mechanism may also explain the seasonality and decadal-scale weak periodicity of large earthquakes and is likely to be helpful in probabilistic forecasting of future seismicity.",

            "abstract": "Droughts statistically exceed all other natural disasters in complexity, spatio-temporal extent and number of people affected. Triggered by crop failure, food insecurity is a major manifestation of agricultural drought and water scarcity. However, other socio-economic precursors, such as chronically low levels of disaster preparedness, hampered access to food security or a lack of social safety nets are equally important factors. We will present the first results of the SATIDA (Satellite Technologies for Improved Drought-Risk Assessment) project, which advances three complementary developments. First, an existing drought indicator is enhanced by replacing in-situ measurements on rainfall and surface air temperature with satellite-derived datasets. We identify the vegetation status via a new noise-corrected and gap-filled vegetation index. In addition, we introduce a soil moisture component to close the gap between rainfall deficiencies, extreme temperature and the first visible impacts of atmospheric anomalies on vegetation. Second, once calibrated, the index is forced with seasonal forecasts to quantify their uncertainty and added value in the regions of interest. Third, a mobile application is developed to disseminate relevant visualizations to decision-makers in affected areas, to collect additional information about socio-economic conditions and to validate the output of the drought index in real conditions. Involving Doctors without Borders (MSF) as a key user, SATIDA aims at decreasing uncertainties in decision-making via a more holistic risk framework, resulting in longer lead times for disaster logistics in the preparedness phase.",

            "abstract": "While conceptual runoff models with a low number of model parameters are useful tools to capture the hydrological catchment functioning, these models usually rely on model calibration, which makes their use in ungauged basins challenging. One approach might be to take at least a few measurements. Recent studies demonstrated that few streamflow measurements, representing data that could be measured with limited efforts in an ungauged basin, might be helpful to constrain runoff models for simulations in ungauged basins. While in these previous studies we assumed that few streamflow measurements were taken, obviously it would also be reasonable to measure stream levels. Several approaches could be used in practice for such stream level observations: water level loggers have become less expensive and easier to install; stream levels will in the near future be increasingly available from satellite remote sensing resulting in evenly space time series; community-based approaches (e.g., crowdhydrology.org), finally, can offer level observations at irregular time intervals. Here we present a study where a runoff model (the HBV model) was calibrated for 600+ gauged basins in the US assuming that only a subset of the data was available. We pretended that only stream level observations at different time intervals, representing the temporal resolution of the different observation approaches mentioned before, were available. The model, which was calibrated based on these data subsets, was then evaluated on the full observed streamflow record. Our results indicate that streamlevel data alone already can provide surprisingly good model simulation results in humid catchments, whereas in arid catchments some form of quantitative information (streamflow observation or regional average value) is needed to obtain good results. These results are encouraging for hydrological observations in data scarce regions as level observations are much easier to obtain than streamflow observations. Based on runoff modeling it might be possible to derive streamflow series from level observations using loggers, satellites or community-based approaches. The approach presented here also allows comparing the value of different types of observations and, thus, to guide the monitoring of (previously) ungauged basins.",

In flood risk analysis and channel design engineering, channel capacity is generally assumed to be constant, and changes in flood frequency are assumed to be driven primarily by changes in streamflow. However, trends in channel capacity will also modify flood hazard, even if the flow frequency distribution does not change.\nUsing daily discharge records and manual field measurements of channel cross-sectional geometry for USGS gauging stations that have defined flood stages (water levels), we present novel methods for measuring long-term trends in channel capacity of gauged rivers, and for quantifying how they affect flood frequency. We apply these methods to 401 U.S. rivers and detect measurable trends in flood hazard linked to changes in channel capacity or the frequency of high flows.\nWe found increases in flood frequency at a statistically significant majority of sites. Trends in channel capacity were smaller, but more numerous, than those in streamflow, with a slight tendency to compensate for streamflow changes. Recognizing and quantifying the joint influence of trends in channel capacity and streamflow on flood frequency is necessary to determine changes in flood hazard accurately.",

For many years, it was thought that, during geomagnetic quiet conditions, the equatorial and low-latitude F-layer was mainly perturbed by waves that were generated not far away from the observed location or electric fields generated by the Equatorial Electroject (EEJ). On the contrary, during geomagnetic storms when the energy sources are in high latitudes the waves (TIDs) travel a very long distance from high latitude to equatorial region and electric fields can be mapped via magnetic field lines. However, in the recent times an unexpected coupling between high latitude, mid- latitude, and equatorial/low latitudes was discovered during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events. All aspects involved in this process must be explored in order to improve our knowledge about the Earth´s atmosphere. The present study investigates the consequences of vertical coupling from lower to the upper atmosphere in the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere in Southern Hemisphere during a major SSW event, which took place during January-February 2009 in the Northern Hemisphere. Using seventeen ground-based dual-frequency GPS stations and two ionosonde stations spanning from latitude 2.8oN to 53.8oS and from longitude 36.7oW to 67.8oW over the South American sector, it has been observed that the ionosphere was significantly disturbed by the SSW event from Equator to the mid-latitudes. Using one GPS station located in mid-latitude (South America sector) it is reported for the first time that the mid-latitude in southern hemisphere (American Sector) was disturbed by the SSW event in the Northern hemisphere. The VTEC at all 17 GPS and two ionosonde stations show significant deviations lasting for several days after the SSW temperature peak.",

In this study we typify contrasting hydrological regimes at two different scales in contrasting climates in Asia: small scale high altitude glacierized catchments and large scale upstream basins. Subsequently we analyze the hydrological impact of climate change using the latest climate model output at both spatial scales. Conceptually different glacio-hydrological models are used at catchment and basin scale. The largest difference is the spatial resolution (90 m versus 1 km) and the fact that at the catchment scale we explicitly include glacier dynamics whereas at the large scale we parameterize future retreat. Despite the conceptual differences the conclusions are remarkably similar. The average annual runoff will increase or remain stable in the coming decades as a result of projected increases in precipitation in combination with sustained higher glacier melt, e.g. the glacier retreat is counterbalanced by an increase in melt rate per unit area for years to come. We conclude that the challenge for the future is coping with intra-annual shifts in the water balance and a possible increase of extreme events.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic systems are widespread in permafrost environments and play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles, especially in GHG emissions (CO2, CH4). Amount, rate and age of carbon released from permafrost thawing can be strongly influenced by local geomorphology, which affects the biogeochemical dynamics of ponds and lakes.\nBylot Island (Nunavut) is located in the heart of the Eastern Canadian Arctic and comprises numerous glacial and periglacial aquatic landscapes. Several glacial valleys of the island represent highly dynamic biogeosystems rich in permafrost ground ice, peat, and aquatic environments. We aimed at characterizing the influence of geomorphology and permafrost degradation processes on aquatic system biogeochemistry. We sampled gas, water, permafrost and lacustrine sediment in different types of aquatic systems: polygonal ponds, collapsed ice-wedge trough ponds, and larger lakes overlying unfrozen soil (‘talik’).\nPreliminary results and field observations indicate a relationship between pond/lake morphology, processes of permafrost degradation, and the age of carbon processed – ultimately released as GHG – in these aquatic systems. Small and shallow ponds produced modern or young (< 500 yr BP) CO2 and CH4, whereas larger and deeper lakes released older (< 2000 yr BP) gases. We also observed a substantial difference in gas fluxes between similar ponds of comparable size and depth. When pond margins were actively eroding (eroded and collapsed peat blocks), fluxes were several orders of magnitude higher than when their margins were stabilized.\nSuch findings underscore the strong impact of local geomorphology and permafrost degradation processes on aquatic system biogeochemistry. Upscaling of GHG emissions at the watershed scale requires a better understanding of the emissions from different types of ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The formerly glaciated granite cliffs of Yosemite Valley are now primarily modified by rockfalls, and vast accumulations of talus beneath the cliffs indicate the long-term importance of this process. Formation and weathering of exfoliation fractures provides a mechanism for relatively steady cliff erosion over thousand-year timescales, but how important are larger events? Yosemite Valley presents an ideal setting for investigating postglacial cliff erosion because (1) Last Glacial Maximum deglaciation left a wide, flat valley floor that has experienced only a few meters of subsequent aggradation, (2) deglaciation is known to have occurred ~15 ka, (3) lidar-based digital elevation models reveal postglacial talus accumulations in three dimensions, (4) talus deposits have been precisely dated by Be-10, and (5) historical rockfalls are well documented. Since deglaciation, ~180 million m3 of rock has been shed from 53 million m2 of cliffs, representing a postglacial cliff retreat rate of ~0.2 mm/yr – among the faster landscape erosion rates measured in the Sierra Nevada. The average annual talus accumulation rate over the past 15 kyr is about 12,000 m3/yr, but evidence suggests that accumulation rates were punctuated by infrequent, extremely large events. Ten extremely large rockfalls, dated by Be-10, occurred between 13.2 and 1.0 ka and were likely seismically triggered. Volumetrically, these events represent about one-fifth of the total postglacial talus volume. Historical talus accumulations are similarly punctuated. A database of historical rockfalls documents ~1.55 million m3 of rock that has fallen from the valley walls since 1857, yielding a historical cliff retreat rate of ~0.2 mm/yr and an average annual accumulation rate of about 10,000 m3/yr, similar to rates averaged over 15 kyr. However, here again talus accumulation is dominated by a few extremely large (≥200,000 m3) events; a single 600,000 m3 rockfall in 1987 accounts for nearly one-third of the total historical volume. Thus, both long- and short-term rockfall records in Yosemite Valley indicate that, although formation and degradation of exfoliation fractures may allow for relatively steady cliff erosion, volumetrically this process is equaled or even exceeded by infrequent, extremely large rockfalls.",

            "abstract": "Some recent subduction earthquakes (2011 Tohoku, Japan and 2014 Pisagua, Chile) presented large nucleation processes punctuated by foreshock swarms, including repeating earthquakes, that can be interpreted as asperities driven by aseismic slip or cascading via intervening aseismic transients. The mainshock slip expanded into these nucleation regions without particularly strong high frequency radiation. Other regions of the megathrust produce smaller magnitude seismicity and participate in large earthquakes with remarkably strong high-frequency radiation. Hence, asperities seem to be capable of sliding slow or fast, with high or low frequency slip.\nOne of the frameworks to interpret the variety of fault slip styles (seismic vs aseismic, low vs high frequency, etc) is the spatial heterogeneity of mechanical properties of the fault zone, including frictional, thermal and fluid transport parameters. Field observations on exhumed faults support the view that fault zones are often mixtures of materials with different strength and frictional stability. The overall stability of a mixture is controlled by structural parameters, such as the ratio of stable to unstable materials, but also by time-dependent variables, such as pore pressure and loading rate.\nThe goal of this presentation is to review our current theoretical understanding of the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous faults, and to compare some model predictions to seismological observations of the nucleation and rupture processes of recent megathrust earthquakes. In particular we focus on rate-and-state models with velocity-weakening asperities embedded in a matrix of velocity-strengthening materials or with a transition from weakening to strengthening at high speed. Earthquake cycle simulations on heterogeneous faults provide insight into the conditions that allow asperities to generate high-frequency radiation during large events.",

Seismic tomography has been an important tool for the determination of three-dimensional (3-D) velocity structure. However, attenuation inversion has generally fallen behind velocity studies mainly because of the data scattering, inversion complexity and interpretation difficulty. Here, I combine the recent results of attenuation tomography with the existing velocity models for the interpretation of structural heterogeneity in both northern and southern California. I focus the attenuation study on frequency-independent 3-D compressional wave attenuation model (indicated by the reciprocal of quality factor Qp) for the crust and uppermost mantle in the study areas. The classic simul2000 tomographic algorithm is applied to invert the frequency-independent attenuation operator t* values measured from amplitude spectra of P-wave arrivals through recently developed 3-D velocity models and earthquake relocation catalogs. In general, the resulting Qp values increase with depth and agree with the surface geology at shallow depth layers. I also apply a state-of-the-art technique to estimate in situ Vp/Vs ratios for similar event clusters by using P- and S-wave differential times from waveform cross-correlation. This approach provides highly precise results for near-source regions because cross-correlation can measure differential times to within a few milliseconds and can achieve a precision of 0.001 in the estimated Vp/Vs ratio, corresponding to about 0.0004 in Poisson’s ratio. The availability of 3-D attenuation models and in situ Vp/Vs ratios provides a complementary definition of the fault systems in California to the existing velocity models.",

We examined relationships among retrogressive thaw slump initiation and annual air temperature, precipitation and snow cover using time series of satellite imagery and weather station data in northwest Alaska. Synthetic aperture RADAR and optical imagery were used to examine retrogressive thaw slump initiation between 1997 and 2010. Over 80% of the slump features examined in this study first appear within a 13 month span from late June 2004 to July 2005. Remote weather station data show that 2004 and 2005 are among several years exhibiting above average thawing indices and average summer temperatures between 1992 and 2011. However, 2004 is distinct from the rest of the record, with unusually warm temperatures primarily occurring early in the thaw season between April and early June, and including two intense precipitation events in May. Regional weather reported by the NOAA National Weather Service also reflects these local findings. Snowmelt timing in 2004 corresponded with warmer air temperatures and precipitation between April and May, exposing the ground surface more than two weeks earlier than average for 2001-2012 within the Noatak Basin. Future rates of thaw slump initiation may be linked with changing trends in the timing of weather, in addition to general climate warming.",

            "abstract": "Continental elevation can be partitioned into contributions from intrinsic isostatic buoyancy forces arising from thermal, compositional and thickness variations within the crust or lithosphere and external geodynamic forces. External forces include horizontal in-plane stress and vertical forces arising from convection within the deep mantle giving rise to dynamic uplift of Earth’s surface. In essence both of these are ultimately expressions of the energy driving and/or contained within the convecting lithosphere-mantle system, and so are not really separate, but their expression in the topography at the surface is often quite different. The term dynamic uplift refers to topography that is supported by the vertical stresses arising from the upward viscous flow of mantle impinging on the base of the lithosphere, and it is typically regional in extent. In recent years the importance of dynamic uplift as a major control on continental topography has been emphasised by the advances in seismology and progress in understanding the structure of the shallow as well as deep mantle. However, the difficulty of quantifying surface uplift within non-orogenic regions has hampered progress in understanding how continental topography reacts to the competing interaction between mantle process creating the topography and surface processes that destroy it. Any geomorphic response, and the resulting erosion or sedimentary signal related to these uplift events, is strongly filtered through the response times of surface processes that are responding to relatively small changes in surface gradient. But with care, the erosional history, measured over large areas, can monitor the evolution of continental scale topography and this can be very effectively measured at appropriate temporal and spatial scales using low temperature thermochronometry. This approach, combined with analysis of the offshore sedimentary record around southern Africa, has proved to be very effective at documenting the topographic evolution of the sub-continent and has identified the expression of ‘conventional’ plate tectonic processes of rifting and rift flank uplift as well as discrete responses to significant plate kinematic changes and the more regional expression of dynamic uplift likely arising from flow within the deep mantle.",

Further, shallow cumulus clouds are also found to become less reflective (i.e., to have weaker shortwave cloud radiative effect, SWCRE) in response to the composite climate perturbation, though the magnitude of SWCRE changes are smaller than for stratocumulus. While the shallow cumulus simulations reflect changes in both cloud thickness and fraction, the stratocumulus simulations are fully overcast, so that only changes in cloud optical depth (and not in cloud fraction) may be simulated. In the stratocumulus simulations, the cloud-topped boundary layer as a whole also thins in response to both climate perturbations.\nThis study is part of the second phase of CGILS, the CFMIP/GCSS Intercomparison of Large-Eddy and Single-Column Models. Steady, idealized forcings based on the ECMWF July climatology are applied at three locations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, where the simulated equilibrium cloud states change from shallow, well-mixed stratocumulus to cumulus under stratocumulus and to shallow cumulus convection as the locations move away from the coast. The aforementioned composite climate perturbation includes doubled CO2, increases in sea surface temperature (2.2-2.5 K) and inversion strength, and decreases in mean subsidence (5%), free tropospheric relative humidity (1.5%) and surface wind speed (1.5%). Six LES modeling groups participated in the study. Their LESs exhibited good agreement in the cloud responses, except for the response of shallow cumulus clouds to quadrupled CO2, even though the models differ in their numerical discretizations and treatments of subgrid turbulence and microphysics.\nResults from a single LES model for two CGILS locations suggest that cloud response to climate perturbations is similar between simulations with steady forcing and those with realistically varying forcing with the same time-mean, as long as the forcings for both simulations are identically perturbed.",

Here, we present the results of shock-tube experiments with volcanic particles which exhibit remarkable similarities to the ejection dynamics of transient eruptions. Upon rapid decompression (from 2-11 MPa argon pressure to atmospheric pressure Pa = 0.1 MPa), loose particles are vertically accelerated and ejected into a large tank filled with air at atmospheric conditions. Our experimental results show that: 1) time-scales of the mechanical coupling between pyroclasts and the gas phase control the mixture dynamics and different regimes can be defined in terms of the Stokes number according to the particles grain-size; 2) As suggested by previous studies, we found that the pseudo-gas approximation is a reasonable approximation in transient eruptions only under certain conditions (constrained here experimentally); 3) the non-linear decay of the particles velocities with time is related with the conduit depth and the initial volume of the expanding material. Our results broaden the impact of previous experimental studies and provide fundamental information for numerical models of eruptive dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Astrophysical plasmas contain ubiquitous non-thermal velocity distribution functions (VDF’s) down to the mean energies of the plasma. These non-thermal particles represent a non-negligible part of the solar wind density, gas pressure, and heat flow. The usual fluid treatments ignore the information in non-Gaussian VDF’s, while kinetic treatments suggest they play an essential role for the observed wind expansion. The existence of the such kurtotic VDF’s contradict the very Spitzer-Braginskii (SB) approximations made to motivate low order closures approximations of the quasi-neutral fluid equations for the plasma (1). Their routine observation implies the usual continuum description of the plasma must change from the SB framework. The origin of such kurtotic distributions has been traced (1) to the consequences of gravity’s violating the assumptions of the SB framework, giving any astrophysical plasma fluid description a non-local character. The quasi-steady character of the observed solar wind implies that this non-local character is resolved by spatial variation of the kurtotic distribution functions moving along the tubes of magnetic force as they enforce the higher goals of quasi-neutrality and zero current. This insight suggests an unusual equation of state for the plasma.\nA minimal fluid model will be introduced for the coronal expansion that (i) suggests the origin and strength of kurtotic VDF’s, (ii) explains their ubiquity; (iii) provides a continuum description, (iv) allows variations of kurtosis and velocity filtration-like variations of T; and (v) retains coulomb collisions. The non-thermal electrons of the solar wind VDF’s will be shown to closely resemble the conduction band in a metal, being the global regulators of quasi-neutrality, electric and heat currents and behaving as a second electron fluid which, together with the protons forms the minimal 3 fluid description.\n(1) Scudder, J.D. and H.

            "abstract": "The US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program provides long-term (~20 years) ground-based cloud remote sensing observations. However, there are large uncertainties in the retrieval products of cloud microphysical properties based on the active and/or passive remote-sensing measurements. To address this uncertainty issue, a DOE Atmospheric System Research scientific focus study, Quantification of Uncertainties in Cloud Retrievals (QUICR), has been formed. In addition to an overview of recent progress of QUICR, we will demonstrate the capacity of an observation-based general uncertainty quantification (UQ) methodology via the ARM Climate Research Facility baseline cloud microphysical properties (MICROBASE) product. This UQ method utilizes the Karhunen-Loéve expansion (KLE) and Central Limit Theorems (CLT) to quantify the retrieval uncertainties from observations and algorithm parameters. The input perturbations are imposed on major modes to take into account the cross correlations between input data, which greatly reduces the dimension of random variables (up to a factor of 50) and quantifies vertically resolved full probability distribution functions of retrieved quantities. Moreover, this KLE/CLT approach has the capability of attributing the uncertainties in the retrieval output to individual uncertainty source and thus sheds light on improving the retrieval algorithm and observations. We will present the results of a case study for the ice water content at the Southern Great Plains during an intensive observing period on March 9, 2000.\nThis work is performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

Such interactions provide a channel of energy redistribution between different plasma populations, and lead to connections between physical processes developing on different spatial and temporal scales. The lower hybrid waves (LHWs) are particularly interesting for plasma dynamics, because they couple well with both electrons and ions. The excitation of LHWs is a widely discussed mechanism of interaction between plasma species in space and is one of the unresolved questions of magnetospheric multi-ion plasmas. It is demonstrated that large-amplitude Alfven and/or EMIC waves, in particular those associated with lower frequency (LF) turbulence, may generate LHWs in the auroral zone and ring current region and in some cases this serves as the Alfven and/or EMIC waves saturation mechanism. We believe that this described scenario, as well as some other cross-frequency coupling of plasma waves processes that will be discussed in this presentation, can play a vital role in various parts of the magnetospheric plasma, especially in the places under investigation by the NASA THEMIS and Van Allen Probes (formerly known as the Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP)) missions.",

            "abstract": "Understanding depositional remanent magnetizations (DRMs) bears implications on interpreting paleomagnetic and paleointensity records extracted from sedimentary rocks. Laboratory deposition experiments have yielded DRMs with shallow remanent inclinations and revealed a field dependence of the magnetization (M), which is orders of magnitude lower than the saturation remanence. To investigate these observations further, experiments involving differently shaped particles were performed. Spherical particles confirmed the field dependence of both the inclination error and M and the fact that the DRM acquired experimentally is lower than saturation. A sediment concentration dependence of the inclination error was observed, indicating a dependance of the inclination error on the sediment load/burial depth or the sedimentation rate. Other outcome was the certainty that spherical particles alone can lead to substantial inclination shallowing. Numerical simulations of settling spherical particles indicated that DRM should be ~10 times lower than the saturation remanence and predicted that rolling of the grains on the sediment surface and particle interactions during settling can produce a substantial shallowing of the inclination and lowering of the remanence, bringing the simulations in close agreement to the experimental results. Experiments involving platy particles, instead allowed interesting comparisons and gave insight into the behavior of differently shaped particles, for instance yielding smaller amounts of shallowing than spheres, in contrast to general belief. Viewing DRM as an anisotropic process allows fitting the experimental results with tensors (kDRM). The ratios of kvertical over khorizontal are in good agreement to the ratios of M obtained in vertical over horizontal experimental fields, which should be equivalent to the widely used inclination shallowing factor f. Experimental results were highly repeatabile, however not always as repeatable for both M and inclination (direction) for both particle shapes, heighlighting that while a sediment might carry a stable remanent direction, it may not always be a particularily good paleointensity recorder.",

            "abstract": "The geography of water and nutrients in the savannas of West Africa has shaped the development of a system of migratory cattle movements (“transhumance”) in which herds travel north during the rainy season to graze the nutritious grasslands of the Sahel and return south in the dry season to graze in fallow lands and on agricultural residue. Cattle in this system gain most of their body mass while grazing in the Sahel and frequently lose mass on their dry season range. The Sahel is, therefore, at the heart of extensive livestock production systems in West Africa. However, there is increasing concern regarding how climate change will impact the region, while human population growth and economic development require increased agricultural and livestock production. The future for pastoral production systems in West Africa is, therefore, uncertain.\nThis presentation combines remote sensing of vegetation structure and phenology with a watershed-scale tree-grass ecohydrology model, to explore how key resources for Sahelian pastoralist communities (forage and surface water for livestock, woody biomass for fuel) respond to climate variability and extreme events, conditioned by human management of grazing, fire and fuel-wood harvest. Mortality of woody species and loss of herbaceous cover during the Sahelian droughts of the 1970’s and 1980’s significantly perturbed vegetation dynamics and ecohydrological interactions, perturbations from which the region is still recovering. The re-greening and reforestation of the Sahel reported by many authors is, in part, an expression of this recovery. Future trajectories of change in pastoral resources in the Sahel, in particular forage availability and drinking water, are explored using climate change ensembles.",

These rainfall deficits have triggered widespread food insecurity, and even contributed to the outbreak of famine conditions in Somalia in 2011. At both seasonal and decadal time scales, new science supported by the USAID Famine Early Warning Systems Network seeks to understand the mechanisms producing these droughts. We present research suggesting that the ultimate and proximate causes of these increases in aridity are i) stronger equatorial Pacific SST gradients and ii) associated increases in the strength of the Indo-Pacific Walker circulation.\nUsing observations and new modeling ensembles, we explore the relative contributions of Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) and global warming under warm and cold east Pacific Ocean states. This question is addressed in two ways: by using atmospheric GCMs forced with full and ENSO-only SSTs, and ii) by decomposing coupled ocean-atmosphere climate simulations into PDV and non-PDV components. These analyses allow us to explore the Walker circulation’s sensitivity to climate change under various PDV states, and inform a tentative bracketing of 2030 climate conditions.\nWe conclude by discussing links to East African development. Regions of high rainfall sensitivity are delineated and intersected with recent changes in population and land cover/land use. The interaction of elevation and climate is shown to create climatically secure regions that are likely to remain viable even under drier and warmer conditions; such regions may be logical targets for agricultural intensification. Conversely, arid low elevation regions are likely to experience substantial temperature impacts. Continued expansion into these areas may effectively create more ‘drought’ even if rainfall increases.",

            "abstract": "We address fundamental questions about how contemporary tectonic deformation of the crust in the southern Great Basin occurs in the region around Las Vegas (LV) Nevada, western Arizona and eastern California. This area lies in the intersection of the eastern Walker Lane Belt, southern Great Basin and western Colorado Plateau (CP), sharing features of transtensional and extensional deformation associated with Pacific/North America relative motion. We use GPS data collected from 48 stations of the MAGNET semi-continuous network and 77 stations from continuous networks including BARGEN and EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory. MAGNET stations have been observed for a minimum of 7 years, while most continuous stations have longer records. From these data we estimate the velocity of crustal motion for all stations with respect to the stable North America reference frame NA12. To correct for transients from recent large earthquakes including the 1999 Hector Mine and 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah events we use models of co- and post-seismic deformation, subtracting the predicted motions from the time series before estimating interseismic stain rates.\nWe find approximately 2 mm/yr of relative motion distributed over 200 km centered on Las Vegas, with a mean strain accumulation rate of 10 × 10-9 yr-1, with lower rates of predominantly extensional strain to the east and higher rates of predominantly shear deformation to the west. The mean strain rate is lower than that of the western Walker Lane but about twice that of eastern Nevada where e.g., the Wells, NV MW 6.0 earthquake occurred in 2008. From this new velocity field we generated a horizontal tensor strain rate map and a crustal block motion model to portray the transition of active strain from the CP into the Walker Lane. For faults in the Las Vegas Valley, including the Eglington Fault and Frenchman Mountain Fault, the observed velocity gradients and model results are consistent with normal slip rates of 0.2 mm/yr, which are typical for the region. The Stateline Fault system experiences dextral slip of at least 0.4 mm/yr while normal faults south of LV collectively accommodate 0.9 mm/yr of east-west extension across a zone ~150 km wide. We see no evidence for concentrations of deformation or isolated rigid microplates within this zone.",

Of the myriad of mechanisms that are important in determining the ionospheric outflow solution at high latitudes, we focus on the role of superthermal electron populations. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies that even small concentrations of superthermal electrons can have a dramatic effect on the outflow solution. In this presentation, we present simulation results using our Polar Wind Outflow Model (PWOM) and our SuperThermal Electron Transport (STET) code. We describe recent results on superthermal electrons role in defining the quiet time solar wind solution with comparisons to observations.

It is generally held the mPWP Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) must have been stronger, to explain a weak Atlantic meridional δ13C gradient and large northern high latitude warming. However, climate models do not simulate such stronger AMOC when forced with mid-Pliocene boundary conditions. Proxy reconstructions allow for an alternative scenario that the weak δ13C gradient can be explained by increased ventilation and reduced stratification in the Southern Ocean. Here this alternative scenario is supported by simulations with the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM-L), which simulate an intensified and slightly poleward shifted wind field off Antarctica giving enhanced ventilation and reduced stratification in the Southern Ocean. Our findings challenge the prevailing theory, and show how increased Southern Ocean ventilation can reconcile existing model-data discrepancies about AMOC while explaining fundamental ocean features.",

            "abstract": "The O/N2 ratio is a sensitive indicator of dynamical changes in the composition of the lower Thermosphere. In the auroral zone the deposition of auroral energy (either through particle precipitation or Joule heating) can produce changes in vertical winds causing a decrease in the O/N2 ratio. Horizontal winds may transport O-depleted air away from the auroral zone causing composition changes in the latitude regions equatorward of the auroral zone. Large waves and tides may also affect composition. To measure such composition changes a number of complimentary remote sensing techniques exist. In the auroral zone ground-based photometers have been sued to monitor, at night, variations of the column O/N2 at a single location as a function of time. Satellite observations (most notably the GUVI instrument on TIMED) provide column O/N2 variations during the daytime as a function of latitude at a nearly fixed local time. Rockets have recently been shown to be able to measure vertical variations in an auroral arc providing altitude-based measurements. Here we review some of the most recent results with an emphasis on comparison with the model predictions of MSIS.",

            "abstract": "Helium has been a missing constituent in current thermosphere general circulation models. Although typically a minor gas relative to the more abundant major gasses, its unique properties of being chemically inert and light make it an excellent tracer of thermosphere dynamics. Studying helium can help simplify understanding of transport effects. This understanding can then be projected to other gasses whose overall structure and behavior are complex but, by contrasting with helium, can be evaluated for its transport dependencies. The dynamical influences on composition impact estimates of thermosphere mass density, where helium during solar minima can have a direct contribution, as well as ionosphere electron density. Furthermore, helium estimates in the upper thermosphere during solar minima have not been observed since the 1976 minimum. Indirect estimates of helium in the upper thermosphere during the recent extreme solar minimum indicates winter-time helium concentrations exceeded NRL-MSISE00 estimates by 30%-70% during periods of quiet geomagnetic activity. For times of active geomagnetic conditions, helium concentrations near ~450 km altitude are estimated to decrease while oxygen concentrations increase. An investigation of the altitude structure in thermosphere mass density storm-time perturbations reveal the important effects of composition change with maximum perturbation occurring near the He/O transition region and a much weaker maximum occurring near the O/N2 transition region. However, evaluating helium behavior and its role as a dynamical tracer is not straightforward and model development is necessary to adequately establish the connection to specific dynamical processes. Fortunately recent efforts have led to the implementation of helium modules in the NCAR TIEGCM and TIME-GCM. In this invited talk, the simulated helium behavior and structure will be shown to reproduce observations (such as the wintertime helium bulge and storm-time response) and its utility as a dynamical tracer of thermosphere dynamics will be elucidated.",

Limitations of this approach are related to the quality and resolution of remote sensing data and the representation of subsurface flow in the land surface model, amongst others. This presentation focuses on ways to improve predictions with land surface models using sequential data assimilation. One approach is multivariate data assimilation, where different data types are jointly assimilated. We will show two examples; one is the joint assimilation of land surface temperature and brightness temperature, the second example is the joint assimilation of neutron counts and land surface temperature. A second approach to improve predictions is estimation of land surface parameters in a consistent stochastic framework. This will be illustrated with a synthetic example. A third approach is by using a more sophisticated land surface model. A sequential data assimilation framework implemented together with the land surface model ParFlow-CLM in a high performance computing environment will be presented, and its performance illustrated for a real-world example.",

            "abstract": "Arctic rivers carry black carbon (BC) from Arctic soils to the ocean, linking two of the largest carbon stores on Earth. Wildfires have charred biomass since land plants emerged. BC, a refractory component of char, has accumulated in soils. In the oceans, dissolved BC (DBC) has also accumulated. Here we use samples and data collected as part of the long-term, high temporal resolution Arctic Great Rivers Observatory to model export of DBC from the six largest Arctic Rivers. Scaling to the pan-Arctic catchment, we report that ~3 million tons of DBC are delivered to the Arctic Ocean each year, which is ~8% of dissolved organic carbon loads to the Arctic Ocean. We suggest the transfer of Arctic river DBC to areas of deep water formation is a major source of DBC to the deep ocean carbon store. As the Arctic warms, greater wildfire occurrence is expected to produce more BC and changing hydrology and permafrost thaw to promote DBC export. Thus, the transfer of BC from Arctic soils to the ocean is predicted to increase.",

Common practices used in modern web applications can improve the quality of scientific data as well as increase availability to a wider audience while reducing costs of maintenance. Motivated to improve discovery and access of scientific metadata hosted at NSIDC and the need to aggregate many areas of arctic research, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS) contributed to a shared codebase used by the NSIDC Search and Arctic Data Explorer (ADE) portals. We implemented the NSIDC Search and ADE to improve search and discovery of scientific metadata in many areas of cryospheric research. All parts of the applications are available free and open for reuse in other applications and portals. We have applied common techniques that are widely used by search applications around the web and with the goal of providing quick and easy access to scientific metadata. We adopted keyword search auto-suggest which provides a dynamic list of terms and phrases that closely match characters as the user types. Facet queries are another technique we have implemented to filter results based on aspects of the data like the instrument used or temporal duration of the data set. Service APIs provide a layer between the interface and the database and are shared between the NSIDC Search and ACADIS ADE interfaces. We also implemented a shared data store between both portals using Apache Solr (an Open Source search engine platform that stores and indexes XML documents) and leverage many powerful features including geospatial search and faceting. This presentation will discuss the application architecture as well as tools and techniques used to enhance search and discovery of scientific metadata.",

Although no large changes were apparent in the total freshwater inventory, a decline in the inventory of meteoric water (-600 km3 yr-1) between 2000 and 2012 was somewhat offset by a concomitant increase in the net sea-ice meltwater (300 km3 yr-1) contribution to the total freshwater volume of the North Pole region. In more recent years (2013-2014), both meteoric water and sea-ice melt contributions have reverted back toward values reminiscent of the late 1990s/early 2000s.\nThe loss of meteoric water from the Central Arctic generally agreed with hypotheses that suggest the recent freshwater increase observed in Canada Basin was due, in part, to a diversion of Siberian river runoff from the Central to Western Arctic. In contrast, the average annual increase in net sea-ice melt was approximately equal to the long-term decline in the sea ice volume anomaly. Although no trend was apparent in the Pacific water influence, two separate events resulted in relatively brief (1-3 years) returns of Pacific water to the Central Arctic.",

            "abstract": "Magma degassing is one of the fundamental processes in volcanology. Volatile exsolution, leading to pressure build-up, is a major driving force for explosive volcanic eruptions, whereas gas escape has the ability to diffuse volcanic crises. Understanding the dynamics of magma ascent, volatile exsolution and gas escape is thus a crucial objective of volcanology.\nThe behaviour of volatile elements in ascending magma is controlled by solubilities, partition coefficients and diffusivities. Once exsolved, gas moves through magma in bubbles and fractures. During this transport (i.e. open system degassing, gas fluxing or streaming), elements are continuously redistributed between melt and gas. However, this redistribution is time-dependent. Hence, magma can be spatially heterogeneous with respect to volatile elements. The extent of this heterogeneity is determined by the volatilities and the diffusivities of the elements, the type of pathway used, and time. Studying the spatial distribution of different volatile elements in volcanic glass can thus provide information on the dynamics of magma degassing.\nHere, we show that tuffisite veins, formed when magma fragments during deformation and degassing within the conduit, are associated with both enrichments and depletions of certain volatile elements (H2O, Cl, Li, As, Pb, Mo, Zn and others). From the spatial distribution of the chemical variations we are able to estimate total gas flux through the veins showing that tuffisite veins form highly efficient gas pathways, which can channel pre-exsolved volatiles to the surface. We also infer significant vertical transport of clasts within interconnected tuffisite vein networks, indicating that degassing pathways may extend to hundreds of meters below the surface.",

            "abstract": "The two large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) that dominate lower-mantle structure may hold key information on Earth's thermal and chemical evolution. It is generally accepted that these provinces are hotter than background mantle and are likely the main source of mantle plumes. Increasingly, it is also proposed that they hold a dense (primitive and/or recycled) compositional component. The principle evidence that LLSVPs may represent thermo-chemical `piles' comes from seismic constraints, including: (i) their long-wavelength nature; (ii) sharp gradients in shear-wave velocity at their margins; (iii) non-Gaussian distributions of deep mantle shear-wave velocity anomalies; (iv) anti-correlated shear-wave and bulk-sound velocity anomalies (and elevated ratios between shear- and compressional-wave velocity anomalies); (v) anti-correlated shear-wave and density anomalies; and (vi) 1-D/radial profiles of seismic velocity that deviate from those expected for an isochemical, well-mixed mantle. In addition, it has been proposed that hotspots and the reconstructed eruption sites of large igneous provinces correlate in location with LLSVP margins. Here, we review recent results, which indicate that the majority of these constraints do not require thermo-chemical piles: they are equally well (or poorly) explained by thermal heterogeneity alone. Our analyses and conclusions are largely based on comparisons between imaged seismic structure and synthetic seismic structures from a set of thermal and thermo-chemical mantle convection models, which are constrained by 300 Myr of plate motion histories. Modelled physical structure (temperature, pressure and composition) is converted into seismic velocities via a thermodynamic approach that accounts for elastic, anelastic and phase contributions and, subsequently, a tomographic resolution filter is applied to account for the damping and geographic bias inherent to seismic imaging. Our results indicate that, in terms of large-scale seismic structure and dynamics, these two provinces are predominantly thermal features and, accordingly, that chemical heterogeneity is largely a passive component of lowermost mantle dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes on plate boundary megathrust faults exhibit substantial variations in rupture characteristics determined from seismic wave observations. There is significant scatter in stress drop, moment-scaled energy release, earthquake source spectrum, and rupture duration. We analyze 113 earthquakes with Mw ≥ 7.0 identified as being on megathrust faults on the basis of their locations and focal mechanisms, analyzing far-field P and S wave observations supplemented by very long-period seismic wave inversions (W-phase, global centroid moment tensor), examining the source scaling behavior, spatial patterns, and depth-dependence of the source parameters. Depth-dependent characteristics have previously been recognized in the occurrence of shallow tsunami earthquakes with depleted short-period source spectra and unusually long source durations, and in enhanced coherent short-period energy release from the deeper portions of megathrusts that fail in huge ruptures. Analysis of the large number of intermediate size events demonstrates that there is little depth-dependence of stress drop or total radiated energy release for megathrust events that are not tsunami earthquakes, but there is systematic increase in relative short-period energy content in the source spectra for deeper events. This is manifested in reduced high-frequency fall-off slope of the source spectra as depth increases. In some cases this is possibly related to compound nature of the ruptures with varying scale-lengths of heterogeneity, but in some cases it is very smooth behavior. Isolating this as a source effect is challenging, as systematic reduction of average attenuation factor with increasing depth can account for some of the systematic pattern. There are some correlations with estimated average megathrust temperature, with higher spectral decay rate correlating with higher slab surface temperature at 30 km depth. We consider the implications of the new source parameter data set for mechanisms operating in the megathrust environment.",

            "abstract": "Constraining physical controls on seismic rupture of plate boundary megathrust faults is challenging due to observational limitations, but seismic, geodetic, tsunami, electromagnetic, geologic and hydrologic studies are steadily accumulating data that hold potential of advancing our understanding of subduction fault zones. Very shallow (< 15 km deep) megathrust earthquakes are rare, but intermittently occur as large tsunami earthquakes such as the 2010 Mentawai Mw 7.8 event. This rupture occurred up-dip of prior large interplate ruptures in the Sumatra subduction zone in 2007, and rupture extended all the way to the trench, but with patchy large-slip regions that can only be confidently resolved using tsunami observations. The seismic wave radiation from tsunami earthquakes is now established to be distinct from that of ruptures deeper on the megathrust, but the controlling factors are not well-resolved. Smaller events at shallow depths tend to have diverse rupture processes, but some are also anomalously depleted in short-period radiation, suggesting that the shallow environment has variable scale-lengths of frictional heterogeneity. At the other end of the megathrust, large events deeper than about 35 km tend to have modest enhancement of short-period seismic wave radiation, with somewhat lower slope to their short-period source spectra than typical of shallower events. The controlling process are also not well-resolved for this behavior. These depth-variations of megathrust earthquake source spectra are one class of observations that may relate to pressure- and temperature-dependent evolution of the megathrust from the trench to decoupling depths near 45-50 km. Other attributes of seismic sources, such as static stress drop and moment-scaled radiated energy have large variability, but do not show systematic variations with depth on the megathrust, so some attributes of earthquake processes are not strongly influenced by evolving conditions of the plate boundary. We explore these issues based on a recent seismological study of all large interplate earthquakes from 1990-2014 combined with detailed investigations of several recent large and great earthquakes for which we have unprecedented geophysical data sets.",

            "abstract": "Roots play a key role in the soil water balance. They extract and transport water for transpiration, which usually represents the most important soil water loss in vegetated areas, and can redistribute soil water, thereby increasing transpiration rates and enhancing root nutrient uptake.\nWe present here a two-dimensional model capable of describing two key aspects of root water uptake: root water compensation and hydraulic redistribution. Root water compensation is the ability of root systems to respond to the reduction of water uptake from areas of the soil with low soil water potential by increasing the water uptake from the roots in soil parts with higher water potential. Hydraulic redistribution is a passive transfer of water through the root system from areas of the soil with greater water potential to areas with lower water potential. Both mechanisms are driven by gradients of water potential in the soil and the roots.\nThe inclusion of root water compensation and hydraulic redistribution in models can be achieved by describing root water uptake as a function of the difference in water potential between soil and root xylem. We use a model comprising the Richards equation for the water flow in variably saturated soils and the Darcy’s equation for the water flow in the xylem. The two equations are coupled via a sink term, which is assumed to be proportional to the difference between soil and xylem water potentials.\nThe model is applied in two case studies to describe vertical and horizontal hydraulic redistribution and the interaction between vegetation with different root depths. In the case of horizontal redistribution, the model is used to reproduce the fluxes of water across the root system of a tree subjected to uneven irrigation. This example can be extended to situations when only part of the root system has access to water, such as vegetation near creeks, trees at the edge of forests, and street trees in urban areas. The second case is inspired by recent agro-ecosystems experiments that combined different vegetation species to increase crop yield. The presence of deep rooted plants (nursing species) near shallow rooted crops (nursed species) enhanced crop growth thanks to vertical and horizontal hydraulic redistribution. The model is able to reproduce the patterns of water redistribution observed in this scenario.",

However, such work is limited by a lack of suitable dating material preserved in the Gobi Desert, but cosmogenic 10Be has great potential to date the Gobi deserts. In the present study, 10Be in quartz gravel from the Gobi deserts of the Ejina Basin in Inner Mongolia of China has been measured to assess exposure ages. Results show that the Gobi Desert in the northern margin of the basin developed 420 ka ago, whereas the Gobi Desert that developed from alluvial plains in the Heihe River drainage basin came about during the last 190 ka. The latter developed gradually northward and eastward to modern terminal lakes of the river. These temporal and spatial variations in the Gobi deserts are a consequence of alluvial processes influenced by Tibetan Plateau uplift and tectonic activities within the Ejina Basin. Possible episodes of Gobi Desert development within the last 420 ka indicate that the advance/retreat of alpine glaciers during glacial/interglacial cycles might have been the dominant factor to influencing the alluvial intensity and water volume in the basin. Intense floods and large water volumes would mainly occur during the short deglacial periods.",

Sedimentary studies have shown that these were formed by highly dynamic ice sheets; however, in the absence of reliable depositional age constraints on the timing on glacial erosion and sedimentation, these have been unable to resolve if they represent high rates of sedimentation at the end of long-lived (many Myr) glacial episodes with complete sea-ice covered oceans, or if they are the product of essentially continuous sedimentation (with possible multiple advance-retreat cycles) during less extreme glaciations of much shorter duration due to open water conditions and attendant lower albedo.\nHere we present a precise CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb zircon age of 639.3 Ma from one of three thin (0.5-15.0 cm) laminated air-fall ash beds interlayered with proximal glaciomarine deposits (2.5 m dropstone-bearing interval between thick massive subglacial diamictite) of the Ghaub Formation in northern Namibia. Combined with a revised age of 635.5 Ma from an ash bed within basinal strata of the Ghaub Formation it constrains the duration of end-Cryogenian (Marinoan) glacial deposition along the Otavi paleoplatform margin to at least four Myr. We also document stratigraphic evidence for deep (several hundred m) subglacial erosion along the shelf-slope break and relate this to erosive wet-based ice sheet activity at a glacial maximum many million years prior to glacial termination. In addition, we interpret the set of three thin, ash beds as distal air-fall deposits and regard their presence within ice-rafted debris as indicating transient open water conditions near the shelf-slope break at the time of deposition. The implications of the ages are of some significance for models attempting to better understand the circumstances and conditions of Cryogenian glaciations.",

            "abstract": "How rapidly slabs sink, which trajectories they follow, and how they deform in the process, presents an inferential challenge to geophysics. Mantle rheologies remain highly uncertain, and seismic tomography can merely offer present-day snapshots of a process defined by temporal evolution. Thus observational constraints on slab sinking have tended to remain non-unique.\nSubduction zones are complex litho-consumers whose time-variant activity can be reconstructed from geological observations on paleo-arcs, but the association of arcs to their subducted, tomographically imaged lithosphere is iffy. Except for young slabs that can be reliably linked with coeval paleo-arc activity a priori, deeper geological time information cannot be exploited with certainty. As long as slab geometries remain “undated”, few constraints on slab sinking behavior and hence mantle rheology can be extracted.\n Sigloch & Mihalynuk (2013) demonstrated a quantitative method to tighten constraints on slab sinking in the lower mantle by investigating the least ambiguous slab geometries observed. Extremely massive and almost vertical slab walls should have been deposited by vertical sinking beneath (intra-oceanic) trenches that remained stationary for a long time (~100 m.y.). We showed how this hypothesis of vertical sinking can be tested quantitatively and successfully, making only minimal assumptions on mantle rheology, and with proper error propagation for all observations (tomography, plate reconstructions, geology).\nHere the discussion of sinking trajectories and rates is extended to more challenging geometries. Dipping slabs in the lower mantle, and laterally extensive “stagnant slabs” in the transition zone can also be rendered dateable and trackable by (re-)investigation of their paleo-trenches. We discuss examples and link to recent geodynamic modeling of viscous sheet sinking.\n",

            "abstract": "In the modern Atlantic Ocean, intermediate water circulation is largely governed by the southward flowing upper North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and the northward return flow Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). During the last deglaciation, it is commonly accepted that the southward flow Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water, the glacial analogue of NADW, contributed significantly to past variations in intermediate water circulation. However, to date, there is no common consensus of the role AAIW played during the last deglaciation, especially across abrupt climate events such as the Heinrich 1 and the Younger Dryas.\nThis study aims to reconstruct intermediate northern- and southern-sourced water circulation in the tropical North Atlantic during the past 22 kyr and attempts to confine the boundary between AAIW and northern-sourced intermediate waters in the past. High-resolution Nd isotopic compositions (εNd thereafter) of fish debris and bulk sediment acid-reductive leachate from the Southern Caribbean (VM12-107; 1079 m) are inconsistent, again casting concerns, as already raised by recent studies, on the reliability of the leachate method in extracting seawater εNd signature. This urges the need to carefully verify the seawater εNd integrity in sediment acid-reductive leachate in various oceanic settings. Fish debris Nd isotope record in our study displays a two-step decreasing trend from the early deglaciation to early Holocene. We interpret this as recording a two-step deglacial recovery of the upper NADW, given the assumption on a more radiogenic glacial northern-sourced water is valid. Comparing with authigenic εNd records in the Florida Straits [1] and the Demarara Rise [2], our new fish debris εNd results suggest that, in the tropical western North Atlantic, glacial and deglacial AAIW never penetrated beyond the lower depth limit of modern AAIW.\n[1] Xie et al., GCA (140) 2014; [2] Huang et al., EPSL (389) 2014",

            "abstract": "The finite element method (FEM) is an efficient tool for modeling electromagnetic (EM) fields in complex 3D media. One of the advantages it offers is the adaptive local mesh refinement also known as h-refinement. In geo-electromagnetic applications one usually wants to obtain an accurate solution at the locations of survey stations. This suggests that a mesh needs to be locally refined only where it affects accuracy at the stations. Recently, automatic schemes were derived to carry out such h-refinement for geo-electromagnetic modeling and we present them in this work. Furthermore, the EM field inside every finite element is described by a polynomial. Therefore, in addition to the h-refinement discussed above one can perform p-refinement, i.e. every element can be constructed using an invidual polynomial degree. As a result, h-refinement can be performed in regions where an EM field exhibits strong variations in order to describe small-scale features properly, whereas in parts of the domain where the field is smooth and diffusive, it sufficies to perform p-refinement without refinning the mesh itself. It has been shown that if done properly, exponential convergence rates are attained with this approach. However, in most geo-electromagnetic codes, which use FEM, the lowest-order finite elements (also known as edge-based) are exploited. In this contribution, we investigate the application of high-order finite elements to EM modelling in 3D. To make this task feasible, we have extendeded the robust and scalable auxiliary space preconditioner for high-order elements on non-conforming hexahedral meshes and studied its efficiency.",

            "abstract": "The Greenland Ice sheet has gained massive attention in recent years due to a sudden increase in mass loss at the onset of this century. A significant part of this mass loss has been attributed to increased ice discharge at the margin through iceberg calving from marine-terminating outlet glaciers. However, due to the lack of instrumental data beyond the past 20-30 years it is difficult to evaluate if this was an outstanding event or if it was part of a recurring phenomenon acting on inter-annual, inter-decadal or centennial timescales. In order to improve understanding of the timescales involved in glacier changes and on the influence of ocean and atmosphere variability we investigate sediment archives from fjords with marine terminating glaciers. Near the glacier margin the sedimentation rates are relatively high due to glacial flour input and rafting of iceberg debris. Our studies of several sediment cores obtained from Sermilik Fjord by Helheim Glacier in Southeast Greenland has allowed us to reconstruct glacier calving, shelf temperature and fjord water renewal rate for the past 100 years. These studies show that dominant modes of climate variability, i.e. the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, affect ocean properties near the glacier and that the recorded variability concurs with reconstructed outlet glacier changes. This presentation provides an overview these studies.",

            "abstract": "Iceberg calving is a key mass loss mechanism for tidewater glaciers, and has been the major contributor to increased contribution to sea-level rise from several regions of Greenland, including the south-east. In summer 2013 we installed a network of 19 GNSS sensors at the margin of Helheim Glacier in south-east Greenland together with 5 oblique cameras to study iceberg calving mechanisms. The network collected data at rates up to every 7 seconds and was designed to be robust to the loss of sensor nodes as the glacier calved. Data collection covered 55 days during July through to early September 2013, and many sensors survived in locations right at the glacier front to the time of iceberg calving. The observation period included a number of significant calving events, and in consequence the glacier retreated ~1.5 km. Throughout the summer the glacier was seen to calve by a process of buoyancy-force-induced bottom-crevassing in which the ice downglacier of flexion zones rotates upwards because it is out of buoyant equilibrium. Calving then occurs back to the flexion zone. This calving process provides a compelling and complete explanation for the data collected. Tracking of the oblique camera images allows identification and characterisation of the flexion zones and their propagation downglacier. Interpretation of the GNSS data and camera data in combination allows us to place constraints on the geometry of the basal cavity that forms beneath the rotating ice downglacier of the flexion zone before calving. Theoretical considerations suggest that the process of bottom crevasse propagation is strongly enhanced when the glacier base is deeper than buoyant equilibrium. We therefore suggest that this calving mechanism will be prevalent whenever this occurs. Interactions between the fjord water and the glacier are likely to enhance calving rates and the process also has implications for mixing in the proglacial fjord.",

This study assesses the impact of real-time assimilation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals from the MODIS instrument on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites within the Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) through comparisons of aerosol predictions with observations for two parallel forecasts that were conducted during FRAPPE/DISCOVER-AQ, one with and one without MODIS AOD assimilation. Results of these real-time assimilation experiments demonstrate that assimilation of MODIS AOD improves the prediction of large-scale smoke events such as those that occurred during July and August, 2014.

            "abstract": "Temporally inconsistent and potentially unreliable global historical data hinder detection of trends in tropical cyclone metrics. This limits the confident evaluation of proposed linkages between observed trends in tropical cyclones and in the environment. Here we mitigate this difficulty by focusing on a metric that is comparatively insensitive to past data uncertainty, and we uncover a pronounced poleward migration in the average latitude where tropical cyclones have reached their peak intensities over the past 30 years. The poleward trends are evident in the global historical data in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres with rates of 53 and 62 km per decade, respectively, and are statistically significant. When considered together, the trends in each hemisphere depict a global-average expansion of tropical cyclone activity away from the tropics at a rate of about 1° latitude per decade, which lies within the range of estimates of the independently-observed expansion of the tropics over this same period. The global migration remains evident and statistically significant under a formal data homogenization procedure and is unlikely to be a data artifact. The migration away from the tropics is apparently linked to marked changes in the mean meridional structure of environmental vertical wind shear and potential intensity and can be plausibly linked to tropical expansion (as related to Hadley circulation expansion), which is generally thought to be driven largely by anthropogenic factors.",

            "abstract": "The maximum entropy production (MEP) principle holds that non equilibrium systems with sufficient degrees of freedom will likely be found in a state that maximizes entropy production or, analogously, maximizes potential energy destruction rate. The theory does not distinguish between abiotic or biotic systems; however, we will show that systems that can coordinate function over time and/or space can potentially dissipate more free energy than purely Markovian processes (such as fire or a rock rolling down a hill) that only maximize instantaneous entropy production. Biological systems have the ability to store useful information acquired via evolution and curated by natural selection in genomic sequences that allow them to execute temporal strategies and coordinate function over space. For example, circadian rhythms allow phototrophs to “predict” that sun light will return and can orchestrate metabolic machinery appropriately before sunrise, which not only gives them a competitive advantage, but also increases the total entropy production rate compared to systems that lack such anticipatory control. Similarly, coordination over space, such a quorum sensing in microbial biofilms, can increase acquisition of spatially distributed resources and free energy and thereby enhance entropy production. In this talk we will develop a modeling framework to describe microbial biogeochemistry based on the MEP conjecture constrained by information and resource availability. Results from model simulations will be compared to laboratory experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of the MEP approach.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and associated permafrost thaw has the potential to increase methane emissions from high latitude wetlands, thus amplifying human-caused climate change. Methane monitoring at high latitude wetlands have been carried out since the 1970s, and at this time there are published data from a large number of sites and some individual sites have data that span more than a decade. By synthesizing data both across and within sites it is possible to improve our understanding of environmental and physical controls on methane emissions. It is clear from comparing mean growing season methane emissions across sites that site wetness, soil temperature and vegetation composition have strong and interacting effects. At individual sites it is also evident that soil temperatures and wetness co-vary at inter-annual scales as a result of physical processes, with compounding influences on methane emissions. Further the presence of certain sedge species, often found in fens at high latitudes strongly influence sensitivities to soil temperature and wetness. Shifts in functional relationships as related to ecosystem structure is central for methane emissions at high latitude wetlands, given the hydrological and ecological changes that occur with permafrost thaw and thermokarst landform development. Hence, in order to more accurately project future methane emissions from high latitudes at a pan-arctic scale, it is necessary to include a spatial representation of thermokarst development as well as ecosystem-appropriate functional relationships between emissions and environmental variables.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal vents are hotspots of microbial primary productivity often described as “windows into the subsurface biosphere.” High temperature vents have received the majority of research attention, but cooler diffuse flows are as, if not more, important a source of heat and chemicals to the overlying ocean. We studied patterns of in situ gene expression and co-registered geochemistry in order to 1) describe the diversity and physiological poise of active microbial communities that span thermal and geochemical gradients from active diffuse flow to background vent field seawater, and 2) determine to what extent seawater or subsurface microbes were active throughout this environment. Analyses of multiple metatranscriptomes from 5 geochemically distinct sites (some from samples preserved in situ) show that proximate diffuse flows showed strikingly different transcription profiles. Specifically, caldera background and some diffuse flows were similar, both dominated by seawater-derived Gammaproteobacteria despite having distinct geochemistries. Intra-field community shows evidence of increased primary productivity throughout the entire vent field and not just at individual diffuse flows. In contrast, a more spatially limited, Epsilonproteobacteria-dominated transcription profile from the most hydrothermally-influenced diffuse flow appeared to be driven by the activity of vent-endemic microbes, likely reflecting subsurface microbial activity. We suggest that the microbial activity within many diffuse flow vents is primarily attributable to seawater derived Gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizers, while in certain other flows vent-endemic Epsilonproteobactiera are most active. These data reveal a diversity in microbial activity at diffuse flows that has not previously been recognized, and reshapes our thinking about the relative influence that different microbial communities may have on local processes (such as primary production) and potentially global biogeochemical cycles.",

For example, the deglacial evolution of the contribution of northern and southern source waters to the middle and intermediate depths of the Atlantic is still vigorously debated. Here, we evaluate the evolution of subsurface Atlantic ventilation, emphasizing middle and intermediate depths, by comparing new and published records of water mass variability to output from transient model simulations designed to provide insight into the climatic and oceanographic effects of a dramatic reduction in the AMOC, such as apparently occurred during Heinrich Stadial 1 (Liu et al., 2009; Schmittner and Lund, 2014).\nGebbie, G.

Too often, the experimental and modeling activities in the hydrologic community are carried out in isolation of each other. This talk will describe our long-term efforts in building two natural watershed laboratories in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts for the purpose of studying the hydrologic effects of woody plant encroachment. Through the common use of environmental sensor networks, unmanned areal vehicles and spatial sampling methods, the two small watersheds provide unprecedented detail on the hydrologic responses to the bimodal precipitation regime in the southwestern United States in the presence of varying woody plant cover. By designing each natural laboratory using hydrologic modeling criteria, sensor and remote sensing data products and their analyses have been immediately useful for testing and developing meaningful applications of a distributed hydrologic model, the Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS). After building confidence in the model applications, the virtual laboratories at each site are used to test hypotheses on the spatial controls on hydrologic patterns and to infer underlying hydrologic mechanisms. Furthermore, the model-data comparisons allow for detailed investigation of the model improvements that are required related processes, parameters or forcings. Examples are provided to illustrate the information content of the natural and virtual laboratories, the identification of model deficiencies and their resolution, and the process understanding gained from combining the distributed observations and modeling approaches.",

The analysis presented here focuses on the spatial and temporal response of the Greenland ice sheet. We demonstrate that the ice thickness evolution displays a characteristic signature or “fingerprint” patterns, which propagate at different rate and to specific regions, depending on the type of sensitivity experiment. For example, warmer atmospheric conditions results in interior growth and a thinning of the ice margins, but the converse occurs with the enhanced basal sliding experiments. In addition, when two distinct forcing are used to drive the ice sheet simultaneously, the resulting complex new fingerprint is comparable to the linear combination of the two independent simpler fingerprints. We apply this technique of fingerprint analysis to develop a set of contemporary climate forcings that can be used as inputs for ice sheet models in order to reproduce recently observed ice thickness and ice margin fluctuations.",

Studies of source-to-sink systems make the Eocene stratigraphy of the Pyrenees and adjoining areas one of the best natural laboratories worldwide for understanding a complete sedimentary system. The hydrocarbon industry requires good predictive models for the distribution of reservoir and non-reservoir deposits. Using a wide range of proxy physical and geochemical data, we show with a high degree of confidence that Milankovitch forcing at a range of astronomical scales controlled deposition of the thin-bedded, fine-grained sandy turbidites and hemipelagites throughout the basin (~ 70% of the stratigraphy). The driver on sandy channelised submarine-fan deposition (the principal sandbodies) cannot be simply related to Milankovitch frequencies and is likely to be due to a combination of climatic, tectonic and/or autocyclic processes.",

            "abstract": "18O/16O ratios are widely used in paleoclimate studies as proxies for temperature, precipitation amount and hydrologic change, but interpretations of these records are often challenged by the multiple factors that can influence them. Variation in 17O/16O ratios of Earth materials have long been assumed to covary with 18O/16O ratios in predictable and uniform ways such that they were not considered useful in studies of Phanerozoic climate. However, recent advances in the ability to measure small differences in 17O-excess, the deviation from an expected relationship between 18O/16O and 17O/16O ratios, in both waters and low-temperature minerals and rocks (e.g., carbonates, bioapatites, silicates, oxides) present the opportunity to use triple oxygen isotope measurements in hydrological and paleoclimate studies. In particular, the sensitivity of 17O-excess to kinetic fractionation means that it can be used to constrain the influence of kinetic effects on variations in δ18O.\nHere we review recently generated datasets on the triple oxygen isotope composition of the hydrosphere and show that there is considerably more variation in 17O-excess of continental waters than initially proposed. A compilation of 17O-excess data from precipitation, which includes snow from polar regions, tropical storms and weekly precipitation collections from mid-latitudes, shows that the 17O-excess of precipitation can range from -0.06 to +0.07‰. A continent-wide survey of tap waters from the U.S. mirrors the variation observed in precipitation. Among leaf waters, 17O-excess values range from -0.28 to +0.04‰ and can vary by as much as 0.16‰ in a plant within a single day. The mass-dependent effects associated with kinetic fractionation are likely responsible for the majority of the observed variation in waters, either during re-evaporation of rainfall at warmer temperatures, snow formation at very cold temperatures, or evapotranspiration within leaf waters.\nIn summary, the combination of the observed variation of 17O-excess in continental waters and the emerging techniques for measuring 17O-excess in a wide range of geologic materials means that it is possible to use 17O-excess to monitor the effects of kinetic fractionation on meteoric waters and provide additional constraints on variation of δ18O in sedimentary archives.",

            "abstract": "River basins are a natural laboratory for the study of the integration of hydrological, ecological and geomorphological processes. Moving from morphological and functional analyses of dendritic geometries observed in Nature over a wide range of scales, this Lecture addresses essential ecological processes that take place along dendritic structures, hydrology-driven and controlled, like e.g.: population migrations and human settlements, that historically proceeded along river networks to follow water supply routes; riparian ecosystems composition that owing to their positioning along streams play crucial roles in their watersheds and in the loss of biodiversity proceeding at unprecedented rates; waterborne disease spreading, like epidemic cholera that exhibits epidemic patterns that mirror those of watercourses and of human mobility and resurgences upon heavy rainfall. Moreover, the regional incidence of Schistosomiasis, a parasitic waterborne disease, and water resources developments prove tightly related, and proliferative kidney disease in fish thrives differently in pristine and engineered watercourses: can we establish quantitatively the critical linkages with hydrologic drivers and controls? How does connectivity within a river network affect community composition or the spreading mechanisms? Does the river basin act as a template for biodiversity or for species' persistence? Are there hydrologic controls on epidemics of water-borne disease?\nHere, I shall focus on the noteworthy scientific perspectives provided by spatially explicit eco-hydrological studies centered on river networks viewed as ecological corridors for species, populations and pathogens of waterborne disease. A notable methodological coherence is granted by the mathematical description of river networks as the support for reactive transport. The Lecture overviews a number of topics idiosyncratically related to my own research work but ideally aimed at a coherent body of materials and methods. A theory is thus argued to emerge on the role of dendritic geometries as environmental support for ecological dynamics and processes – a fun and possibly even instructive novel research field, possibly a hotspot of eco-hydrologic research in the years to come.",

            "abstract": "Predicting soil erosion is common practice in natural resource management for assessing the effects of management practices and control techniques of soil productivity, sediment delivery and off site water quality. The Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) was designed for this purpose. RHEM is an event-based model that estimates runoff, erosion, and sediment delivery rates and volumes at the spatial scale of the hillslope and the temporal scale of as single rainfall event. It represents erosion processes under normal and fire-impacted rangeland conditions. Moreover, it adopts a new splash erosion and thin sheet –flow transport equation developed from rangeland data, and it links the model hydrologic and erosion parameters with rangeland plant community by providing a new system of parameter estimation equations based on 204 plots at 49 rangeland sites distributed across 15 western U.S. states. Testing was done using long-term runoff and erosion data from small semi-aridland catchments. One of our goals with this project is to develop a framework for incorporating key ecohydrologic information/relationships in Ecological Site Descriptions and thereby enhanced utility of Ecological Site Descriptions s for guiding management. These key ecohydrologic relationships govern the ecologic resilience of the various states and community phases on many rangeland ecological sites and are strongly affected by management practices, land use, and disturbances. However, ecohydrologic data and relationships are often missing in Ecological Site Descriptions and resilience-based state-and-transition models. In this study we applied the RHEM model to data from multiple points in several ecological sites in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah to assess the utility of the model for informing these Ecological Site Descriptions.",

            "abstract": "Detailed investigations of 15 sites associated with seafloor faults and/or slope failures have been conducted with MBARI’s Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The motivation for these surveys is to better constrain neotectonic deformation of the seafloor and thus to evaluate potential seafloor geohazards. The coupled use of AUVs and ROVs has enabled marine neotectonic investigations to be achieved at similar observational detail to that previously only possible on land. The AUV surveys provide 1-m resolution bathymetric grids with vertical resolutions of ~10 cm along with chirp sub-bottom profiles that allow subtle deformation on and near the seafloor to be detected. ROV surveys enable precisely located push core and vibracore samples. Sampling strategies include taking transects of closely spaced cores across faults (comparable to trenching on land), and taking transects of horizontal push cores along the faces of scarps where reflectors in chirp profiles crop out or occur in the shallow subsurface. The timing of fault movement can then be established via radiocarbon dating of appropriate material within the sediment samples. The marine environment offers some inherent advantages for neotectonic investigations over the terrestrial environment, as the seafloor geomorphology is relatively unaffected by the deleterious effects of human development (agriculture and urbanization), has no vegetative cover, and is likely to experience continuous deposition of 14C datable materials. Examples will be shown of how AUV and ROV technologies help to constrain the extent, style, and timing of deformation associated with: the San Gregorio fault, offshore central California; the Palos Verdes and San Diego trough faults off southern California; transform faults within the Gulf of California; and young slump scars off Monterey, California. The increased resolution provided by these tools frequently leads to interpretations that differ from what could be inferred from surface-ship collected bathymetric surveys and ship-based coring.",

To assess the limitations of global water resources, numerous indicators have been developed, but they rarely consider nonrenewable water use. In addition, surface water over-abstraction is rarely assessed in the context of human and environmental water needs. Here, we perform a transient assessment of global groundwater and surface water use over the historical period 1960-2010 as well as the future projections of 2011-2099, using a newly developed indicator: the Blue Water Sustainability Index (BlWSI). The BlWSI incorporates both nonrenewable groundwater use and nonsustainable water use that compromises environmental flow requirements. Our results reveal an increasing trend of water consumed from nonsustainable surface water and groundwater resources over the historical period (~30%), and this increase is projected to continue further towards the end of this century (~40%). The global amount of nonsustainable water consumption has been increasing especially since the late 1990s, despite a wetter climate and increasing water availability during this period. The BlWSI is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the renewability and degradation of surface water and groundwater resources as a result of human water over-abstraction.",

The methodology is divided in graphical analysis and application of trend tests, where initially an exploratory analysis of data is performed, followed by confirmation through statistical tests. In this studied were analyzed the streamflow and rainfall of the “Alto Teles Pires Watershed”, northern Brazil, in the period from 1977 to 2009. The Mann Kendall and Pettitt test were used to trends analysis and abrupt changes in the mean, respectively. The results showed in the ten rainfall stations studied significant negative trend mainly between May and July, but abrupt change was not observed. The streamflow also showed the significant negative trend in the three stations studied, with statistically significant changes, mainly in dry season. In addition to decreasing rainfall, the rapid population growth plus the increase of grain crops, has led to an appreciable increase in water consumption in the watershed for urban supply and irrigation, what is probably this fact that can be felt in the drier months in the streamflow. This watershed still do not suffer from the water problem, but if to keep increasing consumption plus the possible impacts of climatic changes, without prior and appropriate planning, which can be obtained, the watershed could suffer future problems regarding of water.",

            "abstract": "Freeze-thaw is an abiotic stress applied to soils and is a natural process at medium to high latitudes. Freezing and thawing processes influence not only the physical properties of soil, but also the metabolic activity of soil microorganisms. Fungi and bacteria play a crucial role in soil organic matter degradation and the production of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2, CH4 and N2O. Production and consumption of these atmospheric trace gases are the result of biological processes such as photosynthesis, aerobic respiration (CO2), methanogenesis, methanotrophy (CH4), nitrification and denitrification (N2O). To enhance our understanding of the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil biogeochemical transformations and fluxes, a highly instrumented soil column experiment was designed to realistically simulate freeze-thaw dynamics under controlled conditions. Pore waters collected periodically from different depths of the column and solid-phase analyses on core material obtained at the initial and end of the experiment highlighted striking geochemical cycling. CO2, CH4 and N2O production at different depths within the column were quantified from dissolved gas concentrations in pore water. Subsequent emissions from the soil surface were determined by direct measurement in the head space. Pulsed CO2 emission to the headspace was observed at the onset of thawing, however, the magnitude of the pulse decreased with each subsequent freeze-thaw cycle indicating depletion of a “freeze-thaw accessible” carbon pool. Pulsed CO2 emission was due to a combination of physical release of gases dissolved in porewater and entrapped below the frozen zone and changing microbial respiration in response to electron acceptor variability (O2, NO3-, SO42-). In this presentation, we focus on soil-specific physical, chemical, microbial factors (e.g. redox conditions, respiration, fermentation) and the mechanisms that drive GHG emission and nutrient cycling in soils under freeze-thaw cycles.",

As hot neutrals stream into the interstellar medium, they experience charge exchange with the background cooler interstellar protons, creating a population of energetic (~1 keV) pickup ions. Similarly, fast neutrals created in the supersonic solar wind stream into the local interstellar medium and create a pickup ion population in the VLISM. The importance of these pickup ions is thought to manifest itself in the creation of the IBEX ribbon. Like the outer regions of the supersonic solar wind and the inner heliosheath, the VLISM is a pickup ion mediated plasma. Here we derive a model of a pickup ion mediated plasma using an approach analogous to a Chapman-Enskog expansion. We derive the anomalous heat flux and obtain a three-fluid model comprising electrons, thermal protons, and pickup ions. We investigate waves and turbulence in a pickup ion mediated VLISM plasma, comparing the basic properties to those of the better known two-fluid model.",

Mobile CO2 sensors, such as those attached to taxis and other existing mobile platforms, may be a promising way to observe and map CO2 mixing ratios across heterogenous urban environments with a limited number of sensors. Emerging modular open source technologies, and inexpensive compact sensor components not only enable rapid prototyping and replication, but also are allowing for the miniaturization and mobilization of traditionally fixed sensor networks. We aim to optimize the methods and technologies for monitoring CO2 in cities using a network of CO2 sensors deployable on vehicles and bikes. Our sensor technology is contained in a compact weather-proof case (35.8cm x 27.8cm x 11.8cm), powered independently by battery or by car, and includes the Li-Cor Li-820 infrared gas analyzer (Licor Inc, lincoln, NB, USA), Arduino Mega microcontroller (Arduino CC, Italy) and Adafruit GPS (Adafruit Technologies, NY, USA), and digital air temperature thermometer which measure CO2 mixing ratios (ppm), geolocation and speed, pressure and temperature, respectively at 1-second intervals. With the deployment of our sensor technology, we will determine if such a semi-autonomous mobile approach to monitoring CO2 in cities can determine excess urban CO2 mixing ratios (i.e. the ’urban CO2 dome’) when compared to values measured at a fixed, remote background site. We present results from a pilot study in Vancouver, BC, where the a network of our new sensors was deployed both in fixed network and in a mobile campaign and examine the spatial biases of the two methods.",

            "abstract": "Our improved capability to adapt to future changes in discharge is unavoidably linked to our capability to predict the magnitude or at least the direction of these changes. The importance of improving discharge projections is particularly relevant in an agricultural state like Iowa. Iowa has been affected by a sequence of extreme events over the most recent years, with the flood events of 1993, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2014 interrupted by the droughts of 2012 and summer 2013. It is clear that too much or too little water will have severe economic and societal impacts for this state, and the agricultural U.S. Midwest more generally. Therefore, being able to increase our confidence in the direction and magnitude of the projected changes in discharge (from low to high flow) will be of key importance for improving our mitigation and management strategies during both flooding and droughts.\nHere we focus on the Raccoon River at Van Meter, Iowa, and use a statistical approach to examine projected changes in discharge. We build on statistical models using rainfall and harvested corn and soybean acreage to explain the observed stream flow variability. We then use projections of these two predictors to examine the projected discharge response. Results are based on seven state-of-the-art global climate models (GCMs) produced under the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). We find that there is not a strong signal of change in the discharge projections under the RCP 4.5. On the other hand, the results for the RCP 8.5 point to a stronger changing signal, in particular increasing trends in the upper part of the discharge distribution. Examination of two hypothetical agricultural scenarios indicates that these increasing trends could be potentially offset by decreasing the extent of the agricultural production. Finally, we discuss how to move forward with the concept of return period for engineering design and management in a non-stationary world.",

Problems of this type include ice sheet grounded margins, ice shelf calving fronts, subglacial hydrology, and supraglacial runoff, among other applications. Finding the boundary in a way that respects the physics is part of the problem, but additionally exact discrete mass (or energy) conservation is a goal, especially when the cyrospheric layer appears as a component in a climate or earth system model. I'll review the small existing free-boundary mass conservation literature for the continuum and discrete cases. Then I'll describe an abstracted view of the mass conservation equation with free boundary. This view suggests what degree of mass conservation is possible in such models, and what is needed for a time-stepping model to conserve mass as well as it can. I'll give examples.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties persist regarding calcium carbonate preservation and its controls within Eastern Equatorial Pacific (EEP) paleoceanographic analyses. Studies have used two indirect proxies from foraminifera tests to constrain and quantify fluctuations in CaCO3: 1) coarse fraction (> 150 μm, %CF) and 2) fragmentation (% fragmented tests in sample). Whereas dilution by terrigenous matter and volcanic debris, changes in productivity, and dissolution all influence %CF measurements, fragmentation measurements are based on the percentage of broken foraminiferal tests, which directly correlates with dissolution. The EEP currently lacks longer timescale Pleistocene fragmentation records. We are developing a longer-timescale record of fragmentation and %CF measurements so that we may interpret potential changes in dominant CaCO3 controls within the EEP. We are extending the work of Martin et al. (2002, EPSL) by analyzing Eastern Equatorial Pacific core CDH-36 (1.53° N, 86.79° W, 3225 m water depth), cored from the Carnegie Platform northwest of the Grijalva Ridge. This core was taken from the same site as core TR163-31B/P, and is close to the location of core V19-29. Core CDH-36 is 42.63 meters in length, with an approximate sedimentation rate of 7 cm/kyr. Therefore, we estimate the timescale of this core to extend from the present day to ~600 kyr, extending into the Pleistocene through Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 14. We are generating a benthic Cibicidoides Wuellerstorfi d18O record, measured at 10 cm (~1.4 kyr resolution), throughout core CDH-36. We will combine this d18O record with fragmentation and %CF measurements which are also being measured every 10 cm throughout the core, with the goal of developing the longest existing fragmentation record within the EEP. Preliminary results for CDH-36 support studies which suggest that dissolution dominates early Pleistocene CaCO3 fluctuations. By extending existing shorter EEP fragmentation records, we hope to better constrain CaCO3 fluctuations over longer timescales. Additionally, the length of this record will allow us to extend fragmentation records to anomalous intervals such as MIS 11, and thus to explore the coupling between Pacific dissolution and carbon cycle changes during these intervals.",

            "abstract": "According to the IPCC AR5, the Antarctic sea ice cover expanded during 1979-2012 at a statistically significant rate with a magnitude 1/3 as large as the rapid sea ice retreat in the Arctic. This was a substantial change from the IPCC AR4, which reported the 1979-2005 trend to be considerably smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Both estimates were based on satellite retrievals that use NASA's \"Bootstrap algorithm\" to estimate the sea ice concentration from passive microwave radiometer measurements. The increase in trend between the two IPCC reports has generally been attributed to an acceleration in the ice advance. Here, we show instead that most of the increase occurred due to a change in the way the satellite observations were processed. The Bootstrap algorithm underwent an update in 2007 to make the dataset more consistent with a 2002-2006 record from another satellite, and the entire dataset was reprocessed with the updated algorithm. We find that this reprocessing of the Bootstrap dataset caused a previously undocumented change in the inter-calibration across a 1991 sensor transition, which caused a four-fold increase in the 1979-2006 trend. The question remains whether this undocumented change corrected an error or introduced one. Our analysis is not able to definitively answer this, but the results show that either the older dataset or the newer dataset contains a substantial and previously undocumented inter-calibration error. This suggests that numerous studies that have relied on these observations should be reexamined to determine the sensitivity to this change in inter-calibration. Implications for the uncertainty in satellite sea ice observations will also be discussed. Furthermore, a number of recent studies have investigated physical mechanisms for the observed expansion of the Antarctic sea ice cover. The results of this analysis raise the possibility that much of this apparent expansion may be a spurious artifact of an error in the processing of the satellite observations.",

Previous observational studies on ballooning instability have been focused on the subsequent particle and field oscillations. However, the initiation of the instability has never been validated, and its connection to the auroral beading is also to be evaluated observationally. We take advantage of the THEMIS multi-spacecraft and ground All-Sky-Imager and Multi-Spectrum-Imager observation conjunctions to examine whether the plasma and field conditions in the transition region prior to the substorm/pseudo-breakup onset is unstable against ballooning mode within MHD regime. The instability criterion is calculated using observations from radially aligned THEMIS probes in the near-Earth plasma sheet. We found that the ballooning instability criterion is violated locally in the transition region about one Alfvenic transit time prior to the auroral beading initiation. The instability is associated with enhanced field-aligned currents (FAC) on top of the background currents, which provides energy source for the auroral brightening. These observations support the idea that the ballooning instability in the near-Earth plasma sheet is a plausible trigger for the auroral beading. We also found evidence in some cases that earthward moving flow channels from middle tail to the near-Earth region precedes the instability, indicating that the earthward penetrating plasma may lead to the violation of the instability criterion. The observed magnetic field profile prior to the instability initiation provides an initial condition for the numerical simulations, which may assist further understanding of the plasma sheet conditions leading to instability for every event.",

            "abstract": "When Voyagers 1 and 2 left Earth in 1977, we had little clue as to the rich variety of activity we’d find on the outer Solar System moons. The moons of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune would likely exhibit little geologic evolution¾much less even than our Moon. We expected battered, cratered, dead worlds. Like the Moon, Mars had showed volcanic activity in the geologic past, but ancient, heavily crater highlands dominated both surfaces. It seemed unlikely that we’d find even extinct volcanism in the cold, dead reaches of the outer Solar System. Voyager 1 shocked us by revealing Io’s prolific ongoing volcanism. (Not all were surprised: just days earlier, Peale, Cassen, and Reynolds published a prediction that Io could be volcanically active). Europa, too, was a Voyager surprise; only a small handful of impact craters pocked its surface. It too had to be a geologically young body—likely still actively evolving. We have even found very recent geological activity on tiny cometary nuclei, where young flows have oozed forth across their surfaces. At Neptune, incredibly, Voyager 2 found eruptions on Triton’s 37K polar cap—plumes driven by solar-heated nitrogen gas blasting dark dust and bright ice in 8-km-high columns. On Mars, “dark spiders” near the pole signaled similar active eruptions, in this case driven by pressurized carbon dioxide. Cassini witnessed a myriad of jets near tiny Enceladus’ south pole, arising from an internal ocean evidently driven by active chemical processes and modulated by Saturn’s proximity. Cassini revealed Titan to be Earth’s alien twin, with a host of processes borrowed from textbooks on terrestrial geomorphology and meteorology. Akin to Earth’s global hydrological cycle, Titan’s runs on methane—methane rivers, seas, and rain abound.\nWhat lessons can we take from these active places into the next phase of exploration? When the Voyagers were launched, our naiveté allowed that only planet Earth was dynamically active. But exploring our cosmic backyard has awed us with unforeseen complexity, scientific beauty, and rich activity. We are now far better armed in our nascent exploration of the worlds beyond that backyard.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography is an important tool for detecting the distibution of magma and other crustal fluids. In this presentation, we show the results of seismic tomography, in an area that includes the Naruko volcano and the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake, using data from a dense temporary seismic network, and discuss the crustal fluid distribution related to the volcanic and seismic activity.\nThe seismic velocity structure is complex within the crust and we found distinct seismic low-velocity zones (LVZs). In the shallow crust, the LVZ is located beneath each volcano (Naruko, Onikobe, and Kurikoma) in the focal area of the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku Earthquake.In the middle to deep crust (10–20 km), a distinct LVZ beneath the volcanic front can be observed. This LVZ seems to be continuously distributed in the NNE-SSW direction, from the Yakeishi to the Naruko volcano. The lateral extent of the LVZ in the NNE-SSW direction is almost the same as the lateral extent of the aftershock area of the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake.\nSome low-V areas in the upper crust have high Vp/Vs areas. The aseismic low-V and high-Vp/Vs areas just beneath the volcanoes could correspond to an area with molten magma. We also found some low-V and high Vp/Vs areas with seismicity in the upper crust. Possible reason for this low-V and relatively high-Vp/Vs area could be the presence of overpressurized fluid. For a misoriented compressional inversion fault, reduction of fault strength by overpressurized fluid along the fault is a possible cause for reactivation (Sibson 1990; Sibson 2009). The fault plane of the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake is thought to be as compressional inversion fault (Sibson, 2009). Compressional inversion fault is the reverse fault along the pre-existing “normal” fault. The complex distribution of the aftershock alignment (i.e. fault) has been spatially correlated with the distribution of the LVZ. This suggests that the fluid path distribution could have controlled the occurrence of the complex faulting during the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake.",

Despite seismological observations providing density-sound velocity data of Earth’s core, there are few experimental reports about the sound velocity of hcp-Fe at ultrahigh pressure and temperature. The sound velocity of pure hcp-Fe at high temperature provides an important constraint on the composition of the Earth's core: any model of the impurity composition of the core must satisfy both the density deficit from seismology and give an appropriate change in velocity. Here, we report the compressional sound velocity ( VP ) of hcp-Fe up to 163 GPa and 3000 K based on a combination of the laser-heated diamond anvil cell and inelastic X-ray scattering measurements. The pressure and temperature dependence suggest both the density and VP of hcp-Fe are higher than PREM. In other words, Earth’s inner core shows a velocity deficit in addition to the density deficit. Thus, we conclude that light elements or a combination of light elements and nickel in the inner core decreases not only density but also VP of hcp-Fe simultaneously under the inner core conditions. We will discuss the Earth’s core composition based on our results.",

RAD also acquired data for most of the cruise to Mars, from Dec. 2011 through July 2012. In both cruise and on the surface, RAD is under considerable shielding, averaging 22 g cm-2 of CO2 during the surface mission, and ~ 16 g cm-2 during cruise. The Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) aboard the LRO spacecraft in lunar orbit has been making measurements since mid-2009. CRaTER contains three sets of detectors, of which one is unshielded, one is under 6 g cm-2 of tissue-equivalent plastic (TEP) shielding, and one is under 9 g cm-2 of TEP. Taken together, the two experiments provide a wealth of data concerning the effects of shielding on Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs). Comparison of data from the two instruments is complicated by their different locations in the heliosphere, which at most times causes them to be magnetically connected to different regions on the Sun. Variability of the atmospheric shielding above RAD, which is both diurnal and seasonal, also influences the comparison. During solar quiet time, when the energetic particle flux is due to GCRs, many similarities – and some small but significant differences – are seen in detailed time series data. In contrast, during SEP events, both the shielding and location disparities cause large differences in the measured particle fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography reveals two large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the lowermost mantle, one beneath the central Pacific Ocean and the other beneath Africa and southern Atlantic Ocean. LLSVPs have been hypothesized to be caused by long-lived compositional reservoirs. Seismic studies have also detected much smaller scale ultra-low velocity zones (ULVZs) on the core mantle boundary. However, it is unclear whether ULVZs are caused by partial melting within hottest regions of LLSVPs or compositional heterogeneities that are different from LLSVPs. Furthermore, it is unknown whether ULVZs caused by compositional heterogeneity should form a continuous ribbon along the margins of LLSVPs or whether they should form discrete regional accumulations.\nHere, we performed high-resolution 3D thermochemical calculations to study the morphology and distribution of ULVZs and the interaction between ULVZs and LLSVPs. In some cases, a thin layer of ULVZ material is initially introduced at the lowermost 5-10 km of the mantle, and the ULVZ material is later advected by mantle flows. We found that, if ULVZs have a different composition from LLSVPs (no matter they are partially melted or not), they will preferentially accumulate into discontinuous patches with variable size and shape, along the edges of LLSVPs; however, if ULVZs are simply caused by partial melting in hottest regions of LLSVPs, they would be located within LLSVPs, inboard from their margins, where temperature is highest. Although the detailed dynamics of ULVZs are governed by parameters such as density and viscosity of ULVZ materials, Rayleigh number and temperature dependent viscosity, the general characteristics regarding the morphology and distribution of ULVZs remain unchanged. Thus, our results suggest that ULVZs along the edges of LLSVPs are caused by compositional heterogeneity with different composition as LLSVPs, while ULVZs in other regions of LLSVPs may be better explained by partial melting.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency waves (or wavy structures) often emerge in a localized region of the near-Earth plasma sheet and midnight auroral arcs in the course of substorm onset. One of pre-existing auroral arcs becomes active with some spatial structuring into fine-scale forms (also called auroral beads/rays/waves) in several/a few minutes prior to auroral breakup and the evolving individual structures propagate either westward or eastward along the arc. Whereas such a pre-breakup arc signature is believed to reflect the development of near-Earth plasma sheet instability that may trigger the subsequent abrupt expansion of aurora, it still remains to be understood regarding the physical processes operating behind the connection. Here we report on recent progress of our understanding of the pre-breakup auroral arcs, with a particular emphasis on highlighting their key aspects obtained by the ground-based auroral observations. Some of the examples will include comparison with in situ field and particle measurements from spacecraft (such as THEMIS, Van Allen Probes) in the near-Earth tail that were favorable for magnetic conjunction with pre-breakup auroral arc. We will also discuss the implications of these observations on magnetospheric processes involved in the deformation of pre-breakup auroral arcs into smaller structures.",

            "abstract": "Damaging earthquakes on faults typically recur at intervals of centuries to millennia but the seismographs that record them have only been around for about hundred years. Complete records of earthquakes of Ms5 or above for Anhui Province of China and its adjacent areas began in 1336 and most previous records were lost. To reduce the hazard from earthquakes we need a longer record of them than can be provided from such instruments. Archaeoseismological evidence has the potential to determine earthquake activity over millennial time spans, especially when integrated with historical documents and geological evidence. In recent years, taking advantage of large-scale civil excavations, our research team including earthquake and archaeological scientists have cataloged, identified, and analyzed deformation relics of the late-Quaternary period, especially the Neolithic Age. Prehistoric earthquake traces were found in the cultural layers of the Western Zhou Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn Period in Southwest Anhui, the late Dawenkou cultural period in North Anhui, and the Eastern Zhou in South Henan. Along the segment of the Tanlu Fault Zone on the border of Jiangsu-Anhui Provinces, several rapid deformation events mainly in the form of oblique translational thrust had occurred since Late Pleistocene, which was confirmed by microscopic studies. The research findings have partly filled the gap of earthquake records in the area and enriched research methodologies in archaeology, prehistoric earthquakes and earthquake prediction.\nThe project was sponsored by China Earthquake Science Special Research Funding Program (#201308012)",

The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble showed a teleconnection pattern of stationary waves from East Asia to the North Pacific and a weakening of horizontal divergence over the Maritime Continent in the upper troposphere. To investigate dynamical relationships among these changes, we performed LBM experiments using the zonal mean basic state and zonally asymmetric thermal forcing. The pattern of differences between the future and present experiments was similar to the changes that had been projected by the CMIP5 models, although positions and amplitudes differed slightly. In addition, two of the LBM experiments showed that the change in the basic state explained most of the changes in the stationary wave pattern, whereas the change in thermal forcing accounted for the eastward shift of the stationary wave. The results of storm track experiments conducted with the LBM to investigate the role of transient eddy feedback on stationary wave changes suggested that eddy feedback shifts the thermally forced stationary waves northward. This shift may explain the difference between the LBM experimental results and the CMIP5 future projection.",

            "abstract": "Coastal managers require reliable spatial data on the extent and timing of potential coastal inundation, particularly as extreme high sea levels and associated erosion are forecasted to increase in magnitude. Most sea level rise (SLR) vulnerability assessments are undertaken using the easily implemented bathtub approach, where areas adjacent to the sea and below a given elevation are mapped using a deterministic line dividing potentially inundated from dry areas. This method only requires elevation data usually in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM). However, inherent errors in the DEM and spatial analysis propagate into the inundation mapping. Error propagation within spatial modelling can be appropriately analysed using, for example, a probabilistic framework based on geostatistical simulations. Geostatistical modelling takes the spatial correlation in elevation errors into account, which has a significant impact on analyses that include spatial interactions, such as inundation modelling. The aim of this study was to elaborate probability maps incorporating the impacts of spatially variable and spatially correlated elevation errors in high-resolution DEMs combined with sea level rise uncertainties. The spatial variability of elevation errors was partially explained by land cover and terrain variables. Elevation errors were simulated using sequential Gaussian simulation, a Monte Carlo probabilistic approach. Sea level rise uncertainty was non-parametrically modelled using 1000 Monte Carlo estimations which were processed to provide the probability density function numerically. The sea level rise uncertainties were modelled using a Weibull distribution with 0.95 scale and 2.2 shape parameters\n. These uncertainties were combined through addition (i.e., assuming they are independent), and when using probability density distributions, requires a convolution. This probabilistic approach can be used in a risk-aversive decision making process by planning for scenarios with different probabilities of occurrence. For example, results showed that when considering a 1% probability exceedance, the inundated area was ~11% larger than mapped using the deterministic bathtub approach.",

This phenomenon is known as polar amplification. Understanding this equator-to-pole temperature gradient is fundamental to climate and general circulation, yet there is no established theory from a perspective of the general circulation. Here, a general-circulation-based theory for polar amplification is presented. Recognizing the fact that most of the available potential energy (APE) in the atmosphere is untapped, this theory invokes that La-Niña-like tropical heating can help tap APE and warm the Arctic by exciting poleward and upward propagating Rossby waves.",

            "abstract": "Environmental change affects forests directly by changing physiological process rates, but the consequent changes in resource acquisition may lead to structural and functional acclimations that obscure the long-term relationship between environmental drivers and forest function. Based on an adaptive balance between structure and function, evolutionary optimisation may provide a feasible tool for analysing such indirect effects of environmental change on forests. This study applies OptiPipe, a model of optimal co-allocation of forest carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), to prediction of potential productivity and C balance of Finnish forests under climate change. OptiPipe is embedded in a transparent modular system including: PreLes, a canopy C exchange model; Yasso, a soil C model; and expert assumptions about the impacts of weather on N availability at different growth sites. National Forest Inventory data and gridded weather data (10 x 10 km2) are utilised. The uncertainties of the projections are analysed relative to inputs and parameters. The results quantify the changes in growth and carbon stocks, which are either smaller or larger than those in photosynthetic capacity, depending on the C:N balance of the site. The results emphasize the need to obtain more reliable information and data about nitrogen processes, but also demonstrate the potential for the optimality approach for regional applications.",

            "abstract": "The minimum in Indian Summer monsoon rainfall is located around Sri Lanka and the ocean below is characterized by a cold pool – having cooler water in comparison to the surrounding region. The meridional gridient in SST between this cold pool and the northern Bay of Bengal has been suggested to be critical for triggering deep atmospheric convection furhter north. As a part of the CTCZ (Continental Tropical Convergence Zone) project under the Indian Climate Research Programme, the first field experiment within the cold pool was conducted during the summer monsoon of 2009 to understand the oceanography of this region. Hydrographic (CTD), ADCP and surface meteorological observations at two time-series locations (TSL) within the core of the Summer Monsoon Current (SMC) during 27 July – 8 August constituted the major data set of this experiment. These observations captured interesting features in both salinity and temperature fields. CTD time series revealed the existence of a salt pump by which the saltier Arabian Sea water located at subsurface layers is pumped up to the surface of the Bay of Bengal. The pumping occurred intermittently during the summer monsoon, in several bursts, along the meandering path of the SMC and is hypothesized to be the mechanism for importing saltier water into the bay in order to maintain the salt balance of the bay. Simulation using an Indian Ocean model reproduces pupming events albeit with certain difference in its characteristics. The temperature data captured two cooling events during the observation period. The first cooling event was during 24 -27 July in which the SST decreased by 0.3°C and the second was during 30 July – 2 August in which the SST dropped by about 0.5°C. These observations were made within the region where cold water is advected eastward by the SMC that carries cooler upwelled water from the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. Estimates of horizontal advection using in situ data sets and simulations using an Indian Ocean model suggest that cooling events taking place within the summer monsoon are controlled by ocean dynamics dominated by the powerful presence of the SMC.",

This study subjects the Variable Parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) method recently proposed by Perumal and Price (2013) to uncertainty analysis. The VPMM method has been developed based on the assumption that there exists no lateral flow in the river stretch where it is employed for routing. But in this study this method is applied for the study of flood wave movement in a 24.2 km stretch between Rottweil and Oberndorf of Neckar River in Germany in the presence of lateral inflow. The study also proposes a general procedure for simulating flood events with the consideration of lateral flow in the reach. The cross sectioned information of the considered river stretch is estimated by the Robust Parameter Estimation (ROPE) algorithm. ROPE algorithm is used to get the best performing parameters set of bed width (Trapezoidal section) and side slope. As the evaluation of VPMM is done with the help of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion, this study uses it as an objective function to check the performance of the method with different data sets obtained using the ROPE algorithm. The uncertainty associated with parameter K and due to the presence of lateral flow is checked by the Jackknife method.\nAll the 26 flood events observed from the Neckar catchment from 1999 to 2004 have been used for the analysis of the VPMM method. When inflow and outflow hydrographs for lateral flow estimation are used, performance of the VPMM method as per N-S efficiency criterion can be up to 97.061 %. By the analysis of all 27 available flood events, a relationship between total rainfall and total loss is obtained, and the value of loss obtained from the developed relationship can be used to simulate outflow hydrograph with the maximum N-S efficiency of 93.812 %.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion methods have several advantages as relative geochronometers in volcano-related magmatic processes: diffusion stops on eruption, locking in short timescale information; methods are relatively easy to implement; and suitable material is generally abundant. Such methods also pose significant, accompanying challenges: the need for accurate melt palaeothermometry, uncertainties in diffusion parameters, and sometimes even a cryptic connection between mineral zonation and timescale. As all timescales are relative to an event, timing is not absolute, and care must be taken in interpretation. Yet for all the difficulties, diffusion tools are seeing more widespread usage. This has come about because of the potential of diffusion methods to interrogate certain pre-eruptive processes operating over timescales of relevance to human timescales and responses, having direct bearing on hazard mitigation procedures.\nIn studying subduction zone systems we have a wide range of minerals to choose from but will, in subduction-related, andesitic-to-rhyolitic systems, usually be operating away from the relatively well-constrained system of olivine, and instead be dealing with mineral phases that offer different challenges, such as plagioclase, quartz, sanidine, amphibole, orthopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides and mica. Timescales here span a wide range across different mineral-element combinations, from minutes for Li in plagioclase and quartz to days by Fe-Ti oxides, years by orthopyroxene Fe-Mg and decades to millennia with plagioclase, sanidine and quartz.\nThis contribution will focus on the interpretation of diffusion signals in minerals found in subduction-related volcanic systems. To understand what any modelled timescale means, the process which formed the relevant zonation pattern is absolutely key, yet often elusive. Variations in P, T, X conditions really drive the crystallisation process yet certain zonation patterns are non-unique. This ambiguity necessitates painstaking petrological and geochemical detective work to understand where the zoning came from to begin with, and which parameter or parameters were truly driving the zonation. The rewards are insights into short-lived processes occurring in the build up to, or process of, eruption, which are not accessible via other mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Simple mechanistic models of vegetation processes are essential both to our understanding of plant behaviour and to our ability to predict future changes in vegetation. One concept that can take us closer to such models is that of plant optimality, the hypothesis that plants aim to achieve an optimal state. Conceptually, plant optimality can be either structural or functional optimality. A structural constraint would mean that plants aim to achieve a certain structural characteristic such as an allometric relationship or nutrient content that allows optimal function. A functional condition refers to plants achieving optimal functionality, in most cases by maximising carbon gain. Functional optimality conditions are applied on shorter time scales and lead to higher plasticity, making plants more adaptable to changes in their environment. In contrast, structural constraints are optimal given the specific environmental conditions that plants are adapted to and offer less flexibility. We exemplify these concepts using a simple model of crop growth. The model represents annual cycles of growth from sowing date to harvest, including both vegetative and reproductive growth and phenology. Structural constraints to growth are represented as an optimal C:N ratio in all plant organs, which drives allocation throughout the vegetative growing stage. Reproductive phenology - i.e. the onset of flowering and grain filling - is determined by a functional optimality condition in the form of maximising final seed mass, so that vegetative growth stops when the plant reaches maximum nitrogen or carbon uptake. We investigate the plants' response to variations in environmental conditions within these two optimality constraints and show that final yield is most affected by changes during vegetative growth which affect the structural constraint.",

            "abstract": "Rheology of mantle rocks at lithospheric temperatures remains poorly constrained, since most experimental studies on creep mechanisms of olivine single crystals ((MgFe)2SiO4, Pbnm) and polycrystalline olivine aggregates were performed at high-temperatures (T >> 1200oC). In this study, we report results from deformation experiments on oriented single crystals of San Carlos olivine and polycrystalline olivine aggregate at temperatures relevant of the uppermost mantle (ranging from 800o to 1090oC) in tri-axial compression. The experiments were carried out at a confining pressure of 300 MPa in a high-resolution gas-medium mechanical testing apparatus at various constant strain rates (from 7 x 10-6 s-1 to 1 x 10-4 s-1). Mechanical tests show that mantle lithosphere is actually weaker than previously inferred from the extrapolation of high-temperature experiments. In this study, we present characterization of dislocation microstructures based on transmission electron microscopy and electron tomography. It is shown that below 1000°C, dislocation activity is restricted to [001] glide with a strong predominance of {110} as glide planes. We observe recovery mechanisms which suggest that the mechanical properties observed in laboratory experiments represent an upper bound for the actual behavior of olivine under lithospheric mantle conditions. Moreover, the drastic reduction in slip system activity observed questions the ability of deforming olivine aggregates in the ductile regime at such temperatures. We show that ductility is preserved thanks to the activation of alternative deformation mechanisms in grain boundaries involving disclinations.",

The research of this study focuses on determining the extent and spectral signatures of isolated wetlands within Ob-Tom Interfluve area using Landsat and Quickbird space images.\nHigh-resolution space images were carefully examined and wetlands were manually delineated. Wetlands have clear visible signs at the high resolution space images. 567 wetlands were recognized as isolated wetlands with the area about 10 000 ha (of 2.5% of the study area). Isolated wetlands with area less 2 ha are the most frequent. Half of the total amount of wetlands has area less than 6.4 ha. The largest isolated wetland occupies 797 ha, and only 5% have area more than 50 ha.\nThe Landsat 7 ETM+ data were used for analysis of vegetation structure and spectral characteristics of wetlands. The masked isolated wetlands image was classified into 12 land cover classes using ISODATA unsupervised classification. The attribution of unsupervised classification results allowed us to clearly recognize 7 types of wetlands: tall, low and sparse ryams (Pine-Shrub-Sphagnum community), open wetlands with shrub, moss or sedge cover, and open water objects. Analysis of spectral profiles for all classes has shown that Landsat spectral bands 4 and 5 have higher variability. These bands allow to separate wetland classed definitely. Accuracy assessment of isolated wetland map shows a good agreement with expert field data.\nThe work was supported by grants ISTC № 4079.",

            "abstract": "The origin of v-shaped sediment bodies, so-called “chevrons”, is currently controversially discussed. The term “chevron” is presently only defined in terms of the morphology of the sediment body, but not in terms of its genesis. Both an aeolian and an impact-tsunami origin are discussed.\nWe investigated internal structures in trenches and by ground penetrating radar. Ages were obtained by radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating. Grain size and the general sediment composition were analyzed. If the chevrons were deposited by a tsunami, all chevrons along one coastline should possess the same depositional ages, the grain-size distribution should be polymodal indicating various sediment sources and internal structures should be restricted mainly to normal grading. In case of an aeolian origin, the ages of the individual chevrons may vary and internal ages will reflect the migration of the sediment body. Furthermore, cross bedding should be present throughout the sediment body and soil horizons may represent inactive phases.\nResults indicate the presence of internal cross bedding and an unimodal grain-size distribution. Ages decrease in landward transport direction and to the top within vertical successions. At some locations soil layers intercalate between well sorted sands. The mean grain size of the chevron sands is 0.11-0.25 mm. A comparison of the components with the mineral content of possible sediment sources (e.g., rivers, beaches, cliffs) shows that the chevrons are composed of the fine grain size fraction of the respective sources. Sediments of this grain size can easily be transported by aeolian forces under the local prevailing wind conditions. Terrestrial gastropods found within the chevrons also give evidence of a long term development of these sediment bodies. Therefore, results of this study point rather to an aeolian than a tsunamigenic origin of chevrons.",

            "abstract": "The remineralization of terrestrially-derived organic carbon (OC), along with direct CO2 inputs from autochthonous plant respiration in floodplains, results in an evasive CO2 gas flux from inland waters that is an order of magnitude greater than the flux of OC to the ocean. This phenomenon is enhanced in tropical systems as a result of elevated temperatures and productivity relative to temperate and high-latitude counterparts. Likewise, this balance is suspected to be influenced by increasing global temperatures and alterations to hydrologic and land use regimes.\nHere, we assess the reactivity of terrestrial and aquatic plant-derived OM near the mouth of the Amazon River. The stable isotopic signature of CO2 (δ13CO2) was monitored in real-time during incubation experiments performed in a closed system gas phase equilibration chamber connected to a Picarro Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer. Incubations were performed under natural conditions and with the injection of isotopically labeled terrestrial macromolecules (e.g. lignin) and algal fatty acids. Under natural conditions, δ13CO2 became more depleted, shifting from roughly -23‰ to -27‰ on average, suggesting that C3 terrestrial vegetation was the primary fuel for CO2 production. Upon separate injections of 13C-labeled lignin and algal fatty acids, δ13CO2 increased near instantaneously and peaked in under 12 hours. Roughly 75% of the labeled lignin was converted to CO2 at the peak in δ13CO2, whereas less than 20% of the algal fatty acids were converted to CO2 (preliminary data subject to change). The rate of labeled-OC remineralization was enhanced by the addition of a highly labile substrate (e.g. ethyl acetate). Likewise, constant measurements of O2/pCO2 along the lower river revealed anomalously high CO2 and low O2 levels near the confluence of the mainstem and large tributaries with high algal productivity. These collective results suggest that the remineralization of complex terrestrial macromolecules is a significant source of CO2 to tropical rivers, whereas algal-derived OC is primarily incorporated into the microbial loop/higher trophic levels and enhances the breakdown of more complex terrestrially-derived molecules (e.g. the “priming effect”).",

            "abstract": "It is important to understand how new subduction zones form. Some subduction zones begin spontaneously, with sinking of dense oceanic lithosphere adjacent to a lithospheric weakness. The Eocene evolution of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana convergent margin is the type example of this process, with an increasingly well-documented evolution including results from IODP 352 drilling. A lack of any active examples of spontaneous SI hinders our understanding, but our studies of the evolution of the southernmost Mariana convergent margin provides important insights. Here the Mariana Trough backarc basin terminates against the Challenger Deep trench segment, where it has opened ~250 km in the past ~4 Ma. This corresponds to GPS opening rate of ~4.5cm/y at the latitude of Guam (Kato et al., 2003). This newly formed and rapidy widening margin faces the NW-converging Pacific plate and causes it to contort and tear. Pacific plate continues to move NW but the upper plate response is illustrative of a newly formed subduction zone. Slab-related earthquakes can be identified to ~200 km deep beneath this margin; with convergence rate of 3cm/yr, this may reflect no more than 7 Ma of subduction. The usual well-defined magmatic arc is missing; its position ~100 km above the subducted slab is occupied by the magma-rich (inflated) Malaguana-Gadao Ridge (MGR), and hydrous MORB-like basalts with ~2 wt. % H2O have erupted unusually close to the trench where they overly mantle peridotites ~6 km water depth. HMR-1 sonar backscatter mapping reveals a chaotic fabric that is at a high angle to the trend of the MGR to the east but is concordant to the west. This unusual spreading fabric may have formed by chaotic upper plate extension in response to rapid rollback of the short, narrow Pacific slab in a manner similar to that thought to occur during SI. Further interdisciplinary studies are needed to understand this rapidly-evolving tectono-magmatic province and what it can teach us about SI.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how subduction zones initiate and continental crust forms in intraoceanic arcs requires knowledge of the inception and evolution of a representative intraoceanic arc, such as the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) Arc system. This can be obtained by exploring regions adjacent to an arc, where unequivocal pre-arc crust overlain by undisturbed arc-derived materials exists. IODP Exp. 351 (June-July 2014) specifically targeted evidence for the earliest evolution of the IBM system following inception. Site U1438 (4711 m water depth) is located in the Amami Sankaku Basin (ASB), west of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR), a paleo-IBM arc. Primary objectives of Exp. 351 were: 1) determine the nature of the crust and mantle pre-existing the IBM arc; 2) identify and model the process of subduction initiation and initial arc crust formation; 3) determine the compositional evolution of the IBM arc during the Paleogene; 4) establish geophysical properties of the ASB. Seismic reflection profiles indicate a ~1.3 km thick sediment layer overlying ~5.5 km thick igneous crust, presumed to be oceanic. This igneous crust seemed likely to be the basement of the IBM arc. Four holes were cored at Site U1438 spanning the entire sediment section and into basement. The cored interval comprises 5 units: uppermost Unit I is hemipelagic sediment with intercalated ash layers, presumably recording explosive volcanism mainly from the Ryukyu and Kyushu arcs; Units II and III host a series of volcaniclastic gravity-flow deposits, likely recording the magmatic history of the IBM Arc from arc initiation until 25 Ma; Siliceous pelagic sediment (Unit IV) underlies these deposits with minimal coarse-grained sediment input and may pre-date arc initiation. Sediment-basement contact occurs at 1461 mbsf. A basaltic lava flow section dominantly composed of plagioclase and clinopyroxene with rare chilled margins continues to the bottom of the Site (1611 mbsf). The expedition successfully recovered pre-IBM Arc basement, a volcanic and geologic record spanning pre-Arc, Arc initiation to remnant Arc stages, which permits testing for subduction initiation and subsequent Arc evolution.",

            "abstract": "The hydrodynamic regime of a tsunami inundation is characterised by variations of flow depth, velocity and turbulence in a short period of time. Thus, deposits left inland may have different characteristics, depending on the deposition setting (microtopography) and deposition stage preserved (bore front, breaking wave, oscillatory currents, waning phase, backwash). This heterogeneity give birth to a great variety of primary sedimentary structures of both the lower and upper flow regime. These bedforms are not always well preserved or easily identificable, but many information are now available thanks to post-tsunami reports. Tsunamis bedforms as described on the field are reviewed, and perspectives on their importance for interpreting tsunami deposits are presented. Micromorphology of bedforms analysed through X-ray radiography and tomography is a promising approach and might lead to a re-interpretation of some sedimentary structures.",

            "abstract": "Non-Gaussian distributions are ubiquitous in systems having long-range interactions, from real-world networks to astrophysical plasmas. The corona and solar wind are no exception. In this review, we concentrate on the corona and solar wind electrons, whose suprathermal tail governs heat transport and plays a crucial role in the temperature structure and wind production, as first suggested thirty years ago by Olbert and confirmed by a large number of subsequent studies. These non-thermal electrons have been measured in both the corona and solar wind, and are a direct consequence of the fast increase with speed of the Coulomb free-path, compared to the pressure scale-height. This situation has four important consequences: (1) the fluid description, on which the vast majority of solar wind models are based is inadequate; (2) the heat flux is NOT given by the classical Spitzer-Härm expression in the corona and solar wind; (3) for most non-thermal distributions (except the convenient and fashionable Kappa distribution), the fraction of supra-thermal electrons increases with altitude in the corona because of velocity filtration; for example, with a sum of Maxwellians, the hotter the population, the larger the increase with altitude of its fractional contribution; (4) ad-hoc heat addition – assumed in most models, is not necessarily required to produce the observed variation in temperature and the wind acceleration. We will shortly review the observed electron velocity distributions together with the theoretical expectations, the major role of the electric field and the consequences on the heat flux, the temperature structure and the wind acceleration.",

            "abstract": "It is increasingly clear that the exceptionally high land-surface subsidence rates in coastal Louisiana (as inferred, among others, from tide-gauge records) are primarily due to processes that operate in the uppermost tens of meters of the subsurface. Considerable efforts are needed to better quantify these processes in terms of their rates and spatial patterns. Only then the predictive models can be developed that so far have remained elusive. Here we present shallow stratigraphic data, demonstrating that compaction within the Holocene column can explain a large portion of the subsidence that is observed at the land surface. Loading of water-rich deltaic strata with clastic sediment is an effective mechanism to drive subsidence rates up to at least 5 mm/yr that can persist for centuries if not longer. While stratigraphic studies offer detailed insights in the dominant processes, they have less potential to determine present-day subsidence rates and to predict future subsidence rates and their spatial patterns.\nThe Coastwide ",

            "abstract": "The polymorphs of (Fe,Mg)2SiO4 (olivine, wadsleyite and ringwoodite) form the major component of the Earth’s mantle down to depths of 660 km. Olivine is the stable polymorph to depths of around 410 km, wadsleyite between 410 and 510 km and ringwoodite between 510 and 660 km. The rheology of these three phases plays a significant role in controlling the dynamics of the Earth’s mantle and has implications for the origins of deep focus Earthquakes. Each of the three polymorphs has a different crystal structure, along with which comes different physical properties, including rheology.\nThe importance of olivine rheology is reflected in the large body of work investigating it over multiple decades. The rheology of wasleyite and ringwoodite, while equally important, has not been so comprehensively studied because of the historic difficulty of performing controlled strain-rate deformation experiments under the stability conditions of the higher pressure phases. Recent studies investigating the rheology of wadsleyite and ringwoodite [e.g. 1,2] do not directly compare their strengths to that of olivine. To date there is only one study directly comparing the strengths of the (Fe,Mg)2SiO4 polymorphs [3], which demonstrated that at low temperatures (≤800°C) olivine is significantly weaker its higher pressures polymorphs. However, these experiments were stress-relaxation experiments.\nI will present results of constant strain-rate deformation experiments performed under in-situ conditions, using the newly developed Deformation T-Cup [4]. Because the (Fe,Mg)2SiO4 polymorphs are not stable concurrently, I measure their strength relative to a pyrope garnet standard which is stable within the stability fields of all the polymorphs. The sample of interest and the standard are deformed simultaneously in a single experiment and the ratio of their strains gives the relative strength.\n",

            "abstract": "The sedimentary archive from Laguna Potrok Aike is the only continuous record reaching back to the last Glacial period in continental southeastern Patagonia. Here we use high-resolution u-channel, as well as discrete rock-magnetic and physical grain size data from the 106 m long core (~51,200 cal BP) of site 2 of the ICDP Potrok Aike maar lake Sediment Archive Drilling project (PASADO) in order to develop magnetic proxies of dust and wind intensity, as well as precipitation and extreme runoff events. Rock-magnetic analyses indicate the magnetic mineral assemblage is dominated by detrital magnetite and that low field magnetic susceptibility (kLF) can be interpreted as a dust indicator in the dust source of southern Patagonia at the millennial time scale. On shorter time scales however, kLF variability is correlated to ferrimagnetic grain size and coercivity. Comparison to physical grain-size data indicates that the median destructive field of the isothermal remanent magnetisation (MDFIRM) mostly reflects medium to coarse magnetite bearing silts typically transported by winds for short-term suspension and that MDFIRM can be interpreted as a wind-intensity proxy, with stronger winds capable of transporting coarser silts to the lake.\nIn addition, about half of the sedimentary sequence is composed of mass movement deposits (MMDs). Within these MMDs, two distinct sedimentary facies can easily be identified. The first rock-magnetic signature is detected in MMDs composed of reworked sand and tephra material. The signature consists of a gyroremanent magnetisation (GRM) acquired during demagnetisation of the natural remanent magnetisation (NRM) and other rock-magnetic properties typical of iron sulfides such as greigite. We interpret these intervals as authigenic formation of iron sulfides in suboxic conditions within the MMD. The second rock-magnetic signature consists of 10 short intervals located on the top of MMDs characterized by GRM acquisition during demagnetisation of the isothermal remanent magnetisation (IRM). These layers are interpreted as reflecting pedogenic hematite and/or goethite brought to the lake by runoff events related to precipitation and permafrost melt, and are coeval to warm periods of the last Glacial period.",

            "abstract": "The challenge posed by human-induced climate change to society and the natural environment has been established by thousands of peer-reviewed studies, many of which have appeared in AGU journals and have been presented at AGU meetings such as this one. This literature has in turn been carefully and methodically summarized by decades’ worth of exhaustive reports by Royal Societies, National Academies, federal agencies, and the IPCC, many of which clearly document the solid science, the emerging consequences, and the future risks of climate change at the global, national, and even regional scale.\nIn the U.S., the most recent Third National Climate Assessment vividly illustrates how warming temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and increasing risk of weather extremes are already affecting agriculture, infrastructure, human health, natural resources, and water supplies. In many sectors, the risk of severe and even potentially dangerous impacts increases with higher levels of carbon emissions and global warming.\nAs the scientific evidence builds, however, public and political opinion in the U.S.—as well as in other developed nations including Australia, the U.K., and Canada—remains sharply divided. Social science has established that this divergence in opinions on global warming tends to run along ideological, socio-economic, religious, and even racial lines. Polling has also shown how public polarization on climate change has increased, rather than decreased, over time.\nUnderstanding the reasons that have created and fed this polarization is crucial to the success of outreach efforts that attempt to bridge this divide. The main reason for this divergence is not a deficit of information or knowledge among the public. Instead, there are a plethora of causes that can be variously categorized as psychological, societal, political, and economic. The diversity of these barriers helps explain why no single message or campaign has been able to successfully turn the tide of public opinion. By identifying each of these barriers, however, I will share from my experience how it is possible to bypass much of the “he said-she said” stalemate that occurs in media and outreach activities, transitioning instead towards positive discussion based on a foundation of shared values and concern.",

            "abstract": "Human-induced climate change is altering the risk of many types of weather extremes, including the frequency and/or severity of heavy precipitation events. The basic science connecting global warming to more frequent heavy precipitation is relative straightforward. It is far more challenging, however, to predict how climate change will affect the magnitude and frequency of these events at the relatively fine spatial scales at which the impacts of extreme rainfall, snow storms, and flooding are typically characterized.\nUsing a case study based on a set of geographically distributed long-term weather stations located at Dept. of Defense installations across the U.S., we explore the individual and combined contributions of high-resolution regional climate modeling (WRF), station-based statistical downscaling (ARRM), extreme value distributions (GEV), and the use of global mean temperature-based thresholds rather than time slices (an approach that is illustrated Figure 1) to resolve observed trends and narrow the envelope of projected future change. All projections and analyses are based on the CESM1-MOAR simulation driven by the higher RCP 8.5 scenario, a consistency specifically introduced into the experiment in order to better resolve the strengths and limitations of each method in understanding extreme precipitation trends.\nEach of these approaches provides clear added value when compared to direct output from the global climate model. We also find that the ability to refine global model output using high-resolution physical modeling, statistics, and observations can all prove useful at different geographic locations and for different parts of the distribution. However, the primary conclusion of this analysis is the utility of combining multiple physical and statistical modeling and analysis approaches when addressing issues such as extreme precipitation that occur at the tails of the distribution.",

            "abstract": "Large disparities among published studies have led to considerable confusion over the question of how drought is changing and how it is expected to change with global warming. As a result the IPCC AR5 assessment has watered down statements, and failed to carry out an adequate assessment of the sources of the discrepancies. Quite aside from the different definitions of drought related to meteorological (absence of precipitation), hydrological (lack of water in lakes and rivers), and agricultural (lack of soil moisture) drought, there are many indices that measure drought. Good homogeneous datasets are essential to assess changes over time, but are often not available. Simpler indices may miss effects of certain physical processes, such as evapotranspiration (ET). The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) has been much maligned but has considerable merit because it can accommodate different ET formulations (e.g., Thornthwaite vs Penman-Monteith), it can be self calibrating to accommodate different regions, and it carries out a crude moisture balance. This is in contrast to simpler indices, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index, which provides only a measure of moisture supply, or the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, which also includes potential (but not actual) ET. The largest source of drought variations is ENSO: during La Niña more rain falls on land while during El Niño most precipitation is over the Pacific Ocean, exposing more land to drought conditions. It is essential to account for interannual and inter-decadal variability in assessing changes in drought with climate change. Yet drought is one time on land when effects accumulate, with huge consequences for wild fire risk. It is important to ask the right questions in dealing with drought.",

Such remote impacts are examined here in the context of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations, leading to the identification of one potential mechanism: the phase-locking and amplification of a planetary wave through the imposition of a spatial pattern of soil moisture at the land surface. This mechanism, shown here to be relevant in the AGCM, apparently also operates in nature, as suggested by supporting evidence found in reanalysis data.",

Due to the use of the Sympletic algorithm, the method can produce a reliable seismic wavefront with an accurate ray trajectory (Fig.1).\nMeanwhile, the numerical modeling shows that the use of SAM can not only keep the stability of the Hamilton System with a fast computation but also improve the accuracy of the seismic ray tracing (Fig.2).",

To quantify the relative effects of these forcings on ice-sheet dynamics, a series of a transient simulations was conducted with a coupled ice-sheet-earth system modeling framework. The numerical experiments are based on the earth system model LOVECLIM which can be coupled to two different ice-sheet models:\nA.) The ice-sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies (IcIES) is used to evaluate the large-scale ice-sheet response to the time-varying climate fields and potential ice-sheet/climate feedbacks\nB.) The Penn State University ice-sheet model in addition, captures ice shelf dynamics and grounding line movements.\nResults from our transient simulations for the past 30 ka reveal that the observed CO2 changes are an essential element in destabilizing the glacial ice-sheets. Without the deglacial CO2 increase, our planet would still be in a glacial state. We further demonstrate that neither orbital nor CO2 forcing alone were sufficient to complete the deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "The western U.S. receives precipitation predominantly during the cold season when storms approach from the Pacific Ocean. The snowpack that accumulates during winter storms provides about 70-90% of water supply for the region. Two elements of significant importance in predicting precipitation variability in the western U.S. are atmospheric rivers and aerosols. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow bands of enhanced water vapor associated with the warm sector of extratropical cyclones over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. While ARs are responsible for a large fraction of heavy precipitation in the western U.S. during winter, much of the rest of the orographic precipitation occurs in post-frontal clouds, which are typically quite shallow, with tops just high enough to pass the mountain barrier. Such clouds are inherently quite susceptible to aerosol effects on both warm rain and ice precipitation-forming processes.\nIn January – March 2015, the ARM Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (ACAPEX) field campaign will take place in northern California. Joined with CalWater 2, the field campaign aims to improve understanding and modeling of large-scale dynamics and cloud and precipitation processes associated with ARs and aerosol-cloud interactions that influence precipitation variability and extremes in the western U.S. We will implement an observational strategy consisting of the use of land and offshore assets to monitor (1) the evolution and structure of ARs from near their regions of development, (2) long range transport of aerosols in eastern North Pacific and potential interactions with ARs, and (3) how aerosols from long-range transport and local sources influence cloud and precipitation in the U.S. West Coast where ARs make landfall and post-frontal clouds are frequent. This presentation will provide an overview of the science questions and hypotheses to be addressed by CalWater 2/ACAPEX, review key results from prior studies, and discuss recent findings from modeling experiments to investigate long range transport of aerosols to the western U.S. and the influence of cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei on precipitation.",

            "abstract": "We provide a view of lithologic makeup, deformation, and fluid-rock interaction along the deep forearc to subarc plate interface, based on insights gained from study of HP/UHP metamorphic rocks. Exposures of plate-boundary shear zones on which we base our perspective represent 30-80 km depths and are on Catalina Island and at Monviso, Syros, and New Caledonia. Each contains highly deformed zones with schistose matrix, commonly with a large ultramafic component, containing bodies of less deformed mafic, sedimentary, and ultramafic rocks. These “blocks” have varying geometries, are up to km-scale, and can preserve disparate P-T histories reflecting dynamics of incorporation and entrainment.\nSheared matrices contain high-variance, hydrous mineral assemblages in some cases resembling metasomatic zones (“rinds”) at block-matrix contacts, and rinds and matrices have homogenized isotopic compositions reflecting extensive fluid-rock interaction. Shearing and related physical juxtaposition of disparate metasomatic rocks can result in mixed or ‘hybrid’ chemical compositions. The chlorite-, talc-, and amphibole-rich schists developed by these processes can stabilize H2O to great depth and influence its cycling.\nFluids (hydrous fluids, silicate melts) released within slabs necessarily interact with highly deformed, lithologically hybridized zones at the plate interface as they ascend to potentially enter mantle wedges. Fluids bearing chemical/isotopic signatures of hybrid rocks appear capable of producing arc magma compositions interpreted as reflecting multiple, chemically distinct fluids sources. Geophysical signatures of these rheologically weak zones are equivocal but many recognize the presence of zones of low seismic velocity at/near the top of slabs and attribute them to hydrated rocks. Whether rocks from this interface buoyantly ascend into mantle wedges, indicated in some theoretical models, remains largely untested by field and geophysical observations.",

Here we use lidar and balloon-borne observations to provide evidence that total radiative forcing resulting from recent eruptions is underestimated even when currently available satellite estimates are taken into account, owing to significant amounts of volcanic aerosol between the tropopause and 15 km at mid to high latitudes. We also demonstrate the ability of the AERONET sun-photometer network to detect stratospheric AOD (SAOD) volcanic enhancements and account for the full stratospheric perturbation above the tropopause that tracks other methods of observation at multiple latitudes. Using the AERONET data, we develop an uncertainty range for post-2000 SAOD and, using a simple climate model, determine the global volcanic aerosol forcing and related cooling since 2000. We find that recent volcanic events are very likely to have caused significantly more post-2000 cooling than implied by available satellite databases that cover stratospheric aerosols only above 15 km.",

            "abstract": "Deviatoric stress profoundly influences the distribution of melt in viscously deforming, partially molten rocks. Under hydrostatic stress melt forms an interconnected network, primarily along grain edges (triple junctions) to reach a state of minimum interfacial energy. Melt also wets a fraction of the grain boundaries due to anisotropy in solid-melt interfacial energy. Under a non-hydrostatic state of stress melt quickly redistributes at the grain scale, introducing a pronounced melt preferred orientation. Melt pockets align at the grain scale with their long axes 15 to 30o to the maximum principal stress in triaxial compression experiments and at 15-40o to the shear plane, antithetic to the shear direction, in shear experiments. This stress-induced, grain-scale alignment of melt gives rise to anisotropic viscosity of the solid/melt aggregate. In response, melt redistributes over distances larger than the grain scale. Two types of redistribution occur. First, in torsion experiments, a diffuse (base-state) migration of melt occurs from the outer radius toward the axis of the cylindrical sample. Second, in simple shear and torsion experiments, melt spontaneously segregates into melt-rich bands spaced at distances smaller than the compaction length. The occurrence of both base-state melt migration and melt-rich band formation are observed in laboratory experiments and modelled using two-phase flow theory. In intensely deforming regions of Earth’s upper mantle, melt-rich bands may provide high-permeability pathways that host rapid extraction of melt and zones of weakness that localize deformation. Moreover, they may be detected as regions of reduced seismic velocity and increased seismic anisotropy.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen fugacity (fO2) of a mantle mineral assemblage, controlled primarily by Fe redox chemistry, sets the depth of the diamond to carbonated melt reaction (DCO3). Near-surface fO2 recorded by primitive MORB glasses and abyssal peridotites anchor the fO2 profile of the mantle at depth. If the fO2-depth relationship of the mantle is known, then the depth of the DCO3 can be predicted. Alternatively, if the DCO3 can be detected geophysically, then its depth can be used to infer physical and chemical characteristics of upwelling mantle.\nWe present an expanded version of a model of the fO2-depth profile of adiabatically upwelling mantle first presented by Stagno et al. (2013), kindly provided by D. Frost. The model uses a chemical mass balance and empirical fits to experimental data to calculate compositions and modes of mantle minerals at specified P, T, and bulk Fe3+/ƩFe. We added P and T dependences to the partitioning of Al and Ca to better simulate the mineralogical changes in peridotite at depth and included majorite component in garnet to increase the depth range of the model. We calculate fO2 from the mineral assemblages using the grt-ol-opx oxybarometer (Stagno et al., 2013). The onset of carbonated melting occurs at the intersection of a Fe3+/ƩFe isopleth with the DCO3. Upwelling mantle is tied to the DCO3 until all native C is oxidized to form carbonated melts by reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. The depth of intersection of a parcel of mantle with the DCO3 is a function of bulk Fe3+/ƩFe, potential temperature, and bulk composition. We predict that fertile mantle (PUM) along a 1400 °C adiabat, with 50 ppm bulk C, and Fe3+/ƩFe = 0.05 after C oxidation begins redox melting at a depth of 250 km.\nThe model contextualizes observations of MORB redox chemistry. Because fertile peridotite is richer in Al2O3, the Fe2O3-bearing components of garnet are diluted leading to lower fO2 at a given depth compared to refractory mantle under the same conditions. This may indicate that the negative\ncorrelation observed between enrichment and fO2 at ridges (Cottrell and Kelley, 2013) is a consequence of the increased fertility of remixing recycled crust into the mantle. Addition of reduced C to the mantle during subduction can also explain this observation. Geophysical detection of the depth of the DCO3 may resolve these hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "Trace element chemistry of ocean island basalts (OIBs) suggests that they are sourced from multiple compositional reservoirs, including a less-degassed primordial reservoir, recycled ocean crust, and depleted mantle. Geodynamic models have shown that dense primordial material could be swept into thermochemical piles, with mantle plumes forming from their tops. In addition, oceanic crust has been shown to subduct from the surface to the lowermost mantle. However, an important question centers on how these compositional components interact with each other and how mantle plume successively sample each of them. Furthermore, it is unclear why the recycled crustal component in OIBs shows large variable ages ranging from Archean to relatively recent.\nHere, we performed high resolution thermochemical calculations to explore the interaction between mantle plumes, subducted oceanic crust, and primordial reservoirs. We model the entire mantle system which include three compositional components: subducted oceanic crust, primordial material, and depleted mantle. We found that in the lowermost mantle, some subducted oceanic crust is entrained directly into mantle plumes, but a signiﬁcant fraction of oceanic crust enters primordial reservoirs, some of which is later entrained into plumes with the primordial material. As a result, mantle plumes arising from the tops of primordial reservoirs contain a variable combination of primordial material, depleted mantle material, and subducted oceanic crust of varying age. Cycling of oceanic crust through mantle reservoirs can therefore explain the multiple compositional components of OIBs and reconcile the different recycled oceanic crustal ages observed in OIBs. In addition, oceanic crust that episodically enters the primordial reservoir also causes multi-scale compositional heterogeneity within the LLSVPs, which may explain seismic discontinuity and/or heterogeneity within LLSVPs.",

First is the observation of wave-particle interactions associated with substorm injections in the midnight to dawn region of the magnetosphere. Second is the electron content of the inner radiation zone and slot regions prior to and during storm times using background corrected MagEIS data. The wave-particle observations take advantage of the MagEIS high rate data mode in conjuction with the HOPE and EMFISIS burst mode data to show the tight relationship between the <70 keV electron fluxes and chorus waves. Both electron flux enhancements and flux depletions are observed during temporally localized chorus wave events.\nThe ability to remove the penetrating backgrounds caused by energetic protons in the inner zone and electron generated bremsstrahlung in the slot and outer zone allows one to put limits on the electron fluxes in these regions, especially for energies greater than a few hundred keV. We find that deep in the inner zone the electrons fluxes at >800 keV are very low or non-existent while there are significant fluxes of electrons at lower energies, down to MagEIS limit of ~30 keV. The more dynamic slot region fluxes have been similarly dominated by such lower energy electron fluxes thus far during the Van Allen Probes mission. We will also show evidence that during storm times the seed population electrons, <200 keV, can penetrate deep into the slot region and, at times, even into the inner zone.",

            "abstract": "The proportions of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in magmas reflect the redox conditions of their origin and influence the chemical and physical properties of natural silicate liquids, but the relationship between Fe3+/FeT and oxygen fugacity depends on pressure owing to different molar volumes and compressibilities of Fe3+ and Fe2+ in silicates. An important case where the effect of pressure effect may be important is in magma oceans, where well mixed (and therefore potentially uniform Fe3+/FeT) experiencses a wide range of pressures, and therefore can impart different ƒO2 at different depths, influencing magma ocean degassing and early atmospheres, as well as chemical gradients within magma oceans.\nTo investigate the effect of pressure on magmatic Fe3+/FeT we conducted high pressure expeirments on ƒO2-buffered andestic liquids. Quenched glasses were analyzed by Mössbauer spectroscopy. To verify the accuracy of Mössbauer determinations of Fe3+/FeT in glasses, we also conducted low temperature Mössbauer studies to determine differences in the recoilless fraction (ƒ) of Fe2+ and Fe3. These indicate that room temperature Mössbauer determinations of on Fe3+/FeT glasses are systematically high by 4% compared to recoilless-fraction corrected ratios.\nUp to 7 GPa, pressure decreases Fe3+/FeT, at fixed ƒO2 relative to metal-oxide buffers, meaning that an isochemical magma will become more reduced with decreasing pressure. Consequently, for small planetary bodies such as the Moon or Mercury, atmospheres overlying their MO will be highly reducing, consisting chiefly of H2 and CO. The same may also be true for Mars. The trend may reverse at higher pressure, as is the case for solid peridotite, and so for Earth, Venus, and possibly Mars, more oxidized atmospheres above MO are possible. Diamond anvil experiments are underway to examine this hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "Conventional stepwise thermal demagnetization of samples spanning a basalt flow erupted during a polarity transition at Steens Mountain, Oregon yielded scattered directions of high-temperature remanence, whereas the results of continuous thermal demagnetization cluster convincingly among the characteristic directions of the next several flows below. The continuous demagnetization was performed using the Triaxe1, a 3-axis vibrating sample magnetometer in which the directions of ~1 cm3 sub-samples were measured repeatedly as temperature increased during heated from 20 to 500-550°C in only 12-13 minutes. The demagnetization trajectories suggest that normal-polarity secondary magnetization, acquired both at room temperature in today’s polarity chron and during modest reheating in a normal field during cooling of the overlying flow, was responsible for the failure of conventional thermal demagnetization. Our favored explanation is that alteration during ordinary thermal demagnetization raised the blocking temperature while preserving the direction of the overprint, thereby masking the primary component. The rapid heating (~40°C/min) during continuous demagnetization appears to have been fast enough to demagnetize the normal overprint before this masking could happen. Thermomagnetic cycles exhibit significant irreversibility starting around 300°C, both in air and in argon. Changes in room-temperature hysteresis parameters after heating in air to temperature T also start to change around T=300°C. Titanomagnetite of composition TM65-70, partially oxidized to titanomaghemite, plus a minor low-Ti, oxyexsolved phase are observed in thin section and inferred from thermomagnetic curves. Thus, inversion of secondary titanomaghemite that carries a normal overprint could be the masking mechanism. The failure of AF demagnetization, on the other hand, we attribute to overlapping coercivity spectra of primary and secondary magnetization.\n1Le Goff and Gallet, 2004, Earth Planet. Sci.

Further, we must explain the implications of those uncertainties, which in many cases imply the possibility of greater, not lesser, risk.

Climate Central works to tackle the misperception that climate change is a distant thing – affecting other people and other places - by demonstrating the local and personal impacts of global warming. This talk will focus on describing three important Climate Central initiatives.\nFirst, our Climate Matters program delivers localized climate information at the regional and local level to weathercasters around the U.S., providing ready-to-use, broadcast quality graphics and analyses that put climate change in a local context. After three years, the program has grown from a pilot with just one TV meteorologist in Columbia, South Carolina to a network of more than 150 weathercasters across the country. Climate Central was also closely involved in the development and production of Years of Living Dangerously - a 9-part global warming documentary that premiered in April 2014. Finally, the World Weather Attribution project is a new initiative that aims to identify the human fingerprint in certain types of extreme weather events, including sea level rise and its contribution to storm surges, extreme heat events, heavy rainfall events/flooding, and drought. Our goal is to objectively and transparently assess certain extreme events and equip journalists and scientists with the tools to provide the larger global warming context in real-time while there is still media interest.",

All of these instruments except the lidar operate continuously outdoors. During August 2012, the continuously deployed instruments recorded the transition from relatively clean air to thick wildfire smoke. This presentation will summarize the temporal evolution of the aerosols and the resulting skylight polarization change as the smoke plume expanded and dissipated. During this event, the 500-nm zenith aerosol optical depth determined along the path to the Sun increased from 0.05 to 0.8 and the ground-level aerosol extinction coefficient at 530 nm wavelength increased from near 10 Mm-1 to 490 Mm-1. During the same time period, the maximum skylight polarization at 450 nm wavelength decreased from 0.7 to near 0.2. The skylight degree of linear polarization in an arc 90-degrees from the Sun was observed to transition from a nearly constant value across the arc to a highly spatially variable pattern because of the spatially nonuniform smoke plume.",

Temperature estimates, derived from foraminiferal Mg/Ca, Uk’37 and TEX86, differ in detail from each other, but overall indicate that, within error, WPWP temperatures were similar to today while the zonal gradient was reduced relative to today. WPWP TEX86 data (Zhang et al., 2014; O’Brien et al., 2014) indicate a long-term cooling from early Pliocene average values similar to today, to approximately 2C cooler during the Late Pleistocene (although calibration errors of ±2.5C exceed the amplitude of the trend). Notably, Late Pleistocene orbital-scale data indicate a strong coupling between WPWP temperature and CO2, which was as much as ~30% lower than pre-industrial values; however, during the early Pliocene, WPWP temperatures were not warmer even though CO2 was as much as ~30% higher that pre-industrial values. Hence, WPWP temperature sensitivity to CO2 forcing was non-linear over myr-long time scales. Orbital scale sensitivity cannot be evaluated in the early Pliocene until more CO2 and temperature records are generated. By compiling data from the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) it is possible to resolve changes in the spatial pattern of temperature, with the largest anomalies in the heart of the cold tongue. In all, the cold tongue was warmer than today resulting in a reduced (but existent) zonal gradient of about 1-2C, referred to as a ‘permanent El Niño-like’ or ‘El Padre’ mean state. Although many temperature proxy records agree with each other, some do not. These apparent disagreements can be explained by considering the depth ecology of organisms that produce the fossil shells and molecules that are analyzed, whole-ocean changes in chemistry, and post-depositional processes.",

            "abstract": "The role of the decoupling in the low-velocity zone is crucial for understanding the mechanisms governing plate tectonics and mantle convection. Mantle convection models fail to integrate plate kinematics and thermodynamics of the mantle. We computed the volume of the plates lost along subduction zones, which is about 306 km3/yr (±15). Mass balance predicts that slabs are compensated by broad passive upwellings beneath oceans, mainly at oceanic ridges and backarc basins. These may correspond to the broad low wavespeed regions found in the upper mantle by tomography. However, W-directed slabs enter the mantle more than 3 times faster (232 km3/yr ±15) than the opposite E- or NE-directed subduction zones (74 km3/yr ±15). This is consistent with the westward drift of the outer shell relative to the underlying mantle, which accounts for the steep dip of W-directed slabs, and the asymmetry between the flanks of oceanic ridges, and the directions of ridge migration. The larger recycling volumes along W-directed subduction zones implies i) asymmetry of the cooling of the underlying mantle and ii) it constrains the “easterly” directed component of the upwelling replacement mantle. In this model, mantle convection is tuned by polarized decoupling of the advecting and shearing upper boundary layer. Return mantle flow can be envisaged as a result of passive volume balance rather than as a thermal buoyancy driven upwelling.",

            "abstract": "The way that water is stored within and transmitted through structured porous media can be challenging to infer from available observation techniques, in particular at field scales. Fractured porous media are an example of such structured media, comprising a fracture domain and a matrix domain. Flow processes depend on how water is both stored and transmitted within each domain, and how water exchanges between the domains. In unsaturated conditions the problem is confounded as hydraulic properties (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) in each domain become dynamic, as a function of saturation. One domain may not contribute significantly to the flow, or may not provide significant amounts of storage, depending of the properties of both domains. The two domains may or may not respond in equilibrium with one another, depending on both the properties and on driving boundary conditions (i.e. infiltration intensity). Physically based models can in theory be used to falsify hypotheses about the role of the fractures versus the matrix in transmitting flow, within an inverse modelling framework. However, there are two problems: firstly, even the most detailed and complex physically based model will still be a simplification of reality, unable to resolve heterogeneities that exist; and secondly the observations available may not contain sufficient information to constrain the model. In this study we explore how models and observations have been applied to understand the flow processes in the unsaturated Chalk in field sites in south east England. We look at what can and cannot be inferred from various observations, including the water table response, soil moisture and matric potential, and the power of these observations to constrain models. We look at how models provide a framework through which to interpret the observations, and provide insights into the dominant controls on behavior. In the case of the unsaturated Chalk, we have demonstrated that groundwater recharge is transmitted through both the fractures and the matrix. Matrix saturated hydraulic conductivity is found to be the dominant parametric control on partitioning of flow. The characteristics of individual rainfall events, combined with near surface soil moisture content, are shown to be good predictors of rapid, preferential recharge.",

These data enable us to separate for the first time the distinct roles of cloud forcing and precipitation in land-atmosphere coupling and memory. This talk will map these climate relations from the diurnal to the 50-year timescale using these observational data, as a benchmark for the coupling of processes in regional and global models. We will also show how changes in cropping in the past 30 years have altered the diurnal climate in the growing season. On the annual timescale, the rapid transitions with snow completely transform the surface boundary layer coupling and the winter climate.",

These factors can fundamentally alter the vertical distribution of mass in the volcanic plume, and the rates and styles of particle aggregation. However, it is not clear when near-source complexities factor significantly into the long-distance dispersal of volcanic ash. In studies of the regional to global-scale impacts of explosive volcanism, when are these processes crucial, and when can they simply be ignored? Here, we use field observations of particle aggregation with coupled 3D numerical modeling of near-source and distal ash cloud evolution (using ATHAM and Ash3d, respectively) to examine a range of recent and prehistoric eruptions. In particular, the eruptions of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska (2009), Mount St. Helens, USA (1980), Oruanui, New Zealand (25.4 ka), and Ilopango, El Salvador (~536 AD) will provide field constraints to test the sensitivity of distal dispersal to proximal column dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous, Gram-negative bacterium that utilizes several different modes of motility to colonize surfaces, including swarming, which is the coordinated movement of cells over surfaces in groups. Swarming facilitates surface colonization and biofilm development for P. aeruginosa, and it is known that swarming behavior is influenced by changes in nutrient composition and surface moisture. To understand the fate and cycling of heavy metals in the environment, it is important to understand the interaction and toxicity of these metals upon bacteria. While previous studies have shown surface-attached bacterial biofilms to be highly resistant to heavy metal toxicity, little is known about the influence of heavy metals upon surface motile bacteria and developing biofilms. Using a combination of laboratory assays we examined differences in bacterial behavior in response to two metals, Cd and Ni. We find that surface swarming bacteria are able to grow on 4x and 2.5x more Cd and Ni, respectively, than planktonic cells (i.e., test tube cultures). P. aeruginosa was able to swarm in the presence ≤0.051mM Ni and ≤0.045mM Cd. To investigate the bioavailability of metals to bacteria growing under our examined conditions, we separated cell and supernatant fractions of P. aeruginosa cultures, and used ICP-MS techniques to measure Cd and Ni sorption. A greater percentage of Cd than Ni was sorbed by both cells and supernatant (which contains rhamnolipid, a surfactant known to sorb some metals and improve swarming). While we show that cell products such as rhamnolipid bind heavy metals (as expected) and should limit metal bioavailability, our results suggest at least one additional mechanism (as yet undetermined) that promotes cell survival during swarming in the presence of these heavy metals.",

            "abstract": "Over little more than a decade, tsunami research has gone from a few scientists using a range of over-used black and white and colour photographs to try and convince a largely disinterested audience of the perils of tsunamis, to a highly regarded branch of the natural hazard stable populated by a plethora of researchers and disciplines. What happened? Tsunamis happened, big ones, in 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2011. In many ways we now have more data than we know what to do with. We should therefore be forgiven for appearing just a little rushed off our feet. The past decade has seen a phenomenal increase in the number of publications and, as a result, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the geological and environmental impacts of tsunamis.\nIn the quest to better understand tsunami geology, many of us are eternally searching for the Holy Grail - the one proxy that will tell us that a deposit was laid down by a tsunami and not by a storm. Well, the one thing that recent advances have told us is that it is not that simple – the devil is in the detail, and we have plenty of that. There has been a significantly improvement in our understanding of tsunami sediments, particularly at either end of the size spectrum, greater use of microfossil data, major advances in geochemistry and the introduction of new studies such as magnetic fabric. What has been particularly satisfying for me to see has been the improved incorporation and study of proxies that are often viewed as tangential to geological data such as geomorphology, archaeology, anthropology and contextual environmental changes.\nThe take home message is that this is a truly multi-disciplinary topic and we do ourselves a disservice if we do not embrace all the innovations available to us. Yes, in many cases we can tell the difference between a storm and a tsunami, it is just that the difference is different every time. The devil is in the detail.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are believed to be important for influencing the dynamics of energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere - both ring current ions and radiation belt electrons - causing particle precipitation into the atmosphere. EMIC waves are generated from unstable ion distributions as a result of ion temperature anisotropy, with the ion dynamics being modified self-consistently by the growth of the EMIC instability. EMIC waves are also thought to influence higher energy electrons in the Van Allen belts through a Doppler shifted cyclotron resonance, including changes in electron pitch-angle distributions and electron scattering loss into the atmosphere. We will present some of the latest results addressing EMIC wave distribution, solar wind and magnetospheric conditions favorable for their generation and their role in energetic particle loss in the inner magnetosphere. We will focus on results from recent satellite missions including THEMIS and Cluster, as well as some of the latest results from the Van Allen Probes. We will also highlight the value of data from networks of modern ground-based magnetometers in providing continuous monitoring over global scales, especially in conjunction with in-situ measurements from satellites. Such coordinated ground-satellite conjunction studies represent a powerful tool for understanding the self-consistent and cross-energy coupling in the inner magnetosphere between ring current ions and radiation belt electrons via the intermediary of EMIC waves.",

            "abstract": "The Cassini Spacecraft flew past Titan on June 13, 2007 and found Titan was outside Saturn's magnetopause. During this pass (T32), observations showed dramatic changes of magnetic field orientation as well as plasma flow parameters during inbound and outbound segments. We have studied Titan’s ionospheric responses to such a sudden change in the upstream plasma conditions, using a sophisticated multi-species global MHD model. Simulation results of three different cases (steady state; simple current sheet crossing and magnetopause crossing) are presented and compared against Cassini Magnetometer (MAG), Langmuir Probe (LP) and Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) observations. The simulation results provide clear evidence of the existence of fossil field. The MAG data can be well reproduced with a simple current sheet crossing. The Cassini plasma observations can only be reproduced by the magnetopause crossing case using plasma conditions constrained by CAPS observations. Real-time simulation also reveals how the fossil field formed during the interaction and shows the coexistence of two pile-up regions with opposite magnetic orientation, the formation of a pair of new Alfven wings and tail disconnection during magnetopause crossing process.\nDuring two recent Titan flybys T85 and T96, Titan was found to be in the magnetosheath region of Saturn and in the solar wind, respectively. We present simulation results for those two flybys and compare features of Titan’s plasma interaction in different plasma environments.",

            "abstract": "Long-term time series of satellite evapotranspiration (ET) were trialled for their additional value in aquifer characterisation on the catchment scale in New Zealand. In a simple chain-of-events approach yearly natural groundwater recharge was calculated with a 1x1km resolution. The chain consisted of (1) rainfall; (2) runoff due to slope; (3) actual ET; (4) soil permeability and water holding capacity; and (5) hydraulic conductivity of the deeper geology. As ET is a large part of the water balance (in New Zealand on average appr. 50% of rainfall), high resolution and high quality ET data is important for estimating groundwater recharge.\nMost global satellite data already embed a pseudo-model with coarse, global, input data. An example is ET data from the MODIS MOD16 product: although the spatial footprint of the satellite data is 1x1 km, input data to calculate ET contains global meteorology data. These data do not capture the extreme diversity in the New Zealand climate, where yearly rainfall and ET can change considerably over small distances. However, enough national ground-observed data are available to improve the MOD16 data. We improved monthly MOD16 ET by using the satellite data pattern as an interpolator between approximately 80 ground stations. Simple least squares fitting gave the best result. The added value of satellite data is obvious: the corrected MOD16 ET data have much higher spatial resolution and vegetation cover and growth is taken into account better.\nWe then used national data to estimate 1x1km natural groundwater recharge: the corrected MOD16 PET and AET, in-situ based precipitation models; soil maps; geology maps; and (satellite-based) elevation. Validation with lysimeters and existing sub-catchment model output data looks promising, and further improvement with satellite soil moisture to estimate monthly recharge is underway.\nThis work was done in the SMART Aquifer Characterisation (SAC) programme, a six-year research project funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation en Employment.\nFigure: Mean annual 1x1km PET (2000-2012) from MODIS MOD16 data, corrected for ground stations.",

            "abstract": "The construction of O‘ahu began with the recently recognized, ~3.5-4.9 Ma Ka‘ena Volcano, as an isolated edifice in the Kaua‘i Channel. Ka‘ena remained submarine until, near the end of its lifetime as magma supply waned and the volcano transitioned to a late-shield stage of activity, it emerged to reach a maximum elevation of ~1000 m above sea level. We estimate that Ka‘ena was emergent only for the last 15-25% of its lifespan, and that subaerial lavas make up < 5% of the total volume (20-27 x 103 km3). O‘ahu’s other volcanoes, Wai‘anae (~3.9-2.85 Ma) and Ko‘olau (~3.0-1.9 Ma), were built at least partly on the flanks of earlier edifices and both were active subaerial volcanoes for at least 1 Ma. The constructional history of Ka‘ena contrasts with that of Wai‘anae, Ko‘olau, and many other Hawaiian volcanoes, which likely emerge within a few hundred kyr after inception, and with subaerial lavas comprising up to 35 volume % of the volcano. These relations suggest that volcano growth history and morphology are critically dependent on whether volcanic initiation and growth occur in the deep ocean floor (isolated), or on the flanks of pre-existing edifices. Two other volcanoes that likely formed in isolation are West Moloka‘i and Kohala, both of which have long submarine rift zones, and neither attained great heights above sea level despite having substantial volume. The partitioning of volcanism between submarine and subaerial volcanism depends on the distance between volcanic centers, whether new volcanoes initiate on the flanks of earlier ones, and the time over which neighboring volcanoes are concurrently active. Ka‘ena might represent an end-member in this spectrum, having initiated far from its next oldest neighbor and completed much of its evolution in isolation.",

On a global scale, the mass loss from glaciers contributes to sea-level rise. On regional and local scales, glacier meltwater is an important contributor to and modulator of river flow. Until recently, the lack of basic inventory data was a major impediment in global mass balance assessments and projections. The recently completed Randolph Glacier Inventory, the first globally complete glacier inventory, is a major forward step towards reducing uncertainties in global-scale studies. In this talk I will review some of the recent attempts to model glacier mass changes on regional and global scales, and discuss the main challenges these models face.

            "abstract": "In the United States, fewer than one-third of Republicans believe that climate change is driven significantly by burning fossil fuels. This despite unprecedented worldwide scientific consensus that it is. Over 13,000 peer reviewed scientific papers affirm it. Twenty-four deny it. Yet the Republican “disbelief” persists in part because of ideological bubbles that, according to analysis by the Marquette Law School, are deeper and more geographically based than ever before. More and more Americans are living in politically one-sided counties, with 51% of voters in the 2012 presidential race living in a county that was “partisan” – or 10 points redder or bluer than the U.S. as a whole. One in five lived in a county that was “extreme” – or 20 points redder or bluer than the country.\nWith mainstream media contracting, opinion media exploding and the Internet increasingly giving us only what we want to hear, ideological bubbles are becoming more isolated and insulated than ever. Dan Kahan at Yale has discovered that these bubbles – the values and groups that hold them – have a greater impact on our perception of certain issues than scientific understanding. In fact, the more individuals become scientifically literate, the more they tend to use that information to confirm the view of their group. So the more conservative and more knowledgeable you are about climate change, the less convinced you will be that it is a problem.\nCountless scientific studies confirm people rely on those they trust. And conversely, they reject information coming from those they do not. To bridge the partisan divide, and break the ideological barriers to climate science, trusted leaders within conservative circles must engage and speak out. The conservative leaders I work with have transcended their ideological boundaries, understand the science largely because they have learned from people they trust, recognize the risk and have identified solutions that protect their conservative values.",

            "abstract": "In this study authors analyzed the possible influences of springtime Arctic Oscillation (AO) on climatic change over South China Sea (SCS), by employing monthly data of precipitation (GPCP), sea surface temperature (ERSSTv3b) and atmospheric circulation from NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data for the period of 1979-2013. Prior to analysis the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals have been linearly fit to the time series of interests and been subtracted. The first mode of the multi-variable (including SST, precipitation, and horizontal and vertical winds at 850hPa) empirical orthogonal function (MV-EOF) explains 27.8% variance over the domain of 5ºS-25ºN and 105ºE-125ºE. The temporal variations of the first mode co-change tightly with spring AO. Their correlation coefficient is -0.4, being significant at the 0.05 level and their out-of-phase relationship is even more dominant on the interannual time scales. During positive (negative) AO years, an anticyclonic(cyclonic) anomalous circulation is observed over tropical Western Pacific in mid- and lower troposphere. Meanwhile, anomalous southern (northern) winds appear in the SCS area. Corresponding to the circulation anomalies, there are more (less) precipitation in the northern SCS and the neighboring southern China, and the precipitation get drier (wetter) in the central SCS. There are two possible mechanisms linking AO and SCS climate. The first possible way is the wave train along the Asian westerly jet stream. There are two upstream centers, one is located in the Bay of Bengal and Indochina Peninsula, the other located in Arabian Sea. An active wave train enhances the southern winds in SCS. The second possible way seems related to the dipole-structure circulation anomalies over the North Pacific. During positive AO years, an anticyclone and a cyclone circulation appear to the north and south of the stormtracks, respectively. The cyclonic circulation in the western Pacific also modulate SCS climate.",

We report unusual silicate exsolution lamellae (coesite, clinopyroxene and MgSiO3 phase) in chromite (Yamamoto et al., 2009), and unusual ancient crustal zircons from chromitites (Yamamoto et al., 2013). To deduce long history of mantle convection, including both upward mantle-upwelling and horizontal movement, micro-inclusions preserved in refractory minerals can provide potential mineralogical and geochemical evidence. Coesite as an exsolution in chromite is diagnostic UHP evidence and clinopyroxene exsolution in chromite is possible evidence of former CF-type high-pressure polymorph of chromite (>380 km deep). More importantly, we found that silicate exsolutions in chromites are restricted in the nodular- and massive-type chromites, and that disseminated-type chromites have no exsolutions. Petrographically, nodular-type chromites with abundant silicate-exsolutions are gradually modified into disseminated-type chromites in their morphology and exsolution abundance. The characteristic of the disseminated-type chromite, such as their interstitial distribution, euhedral to subhedral morphology and absence of silicate-exsolutions, suggest their formation under the low-pressure magmatic conditions. Therefore, we propose that the podiform chromitites at the Luobusa retain evidence of their multi-stage development from ultrahigh-pressure environment to low-pressure magmatic processes, and tiny inclusions shielded by refractory minerals, such as chromite, diamond and zircon, record their prolonged history in the mantle.",

We perform systematic numerical experiments at fine spatial scales using large-eddy simulations explicitly coupled to a plant-physiology model. To break down the complexity of the vegetation-atmospheric system at the diurnal scales, we design the following experiments with increasing complexity: (a) clouds that are transparent to radiation, (b) clouds that shade the surface from the incoming shortwave radiation and (c) plant stomata whose apertures react with an adjustment in time to cloud perturbations.\nThe shading by SCu leads to a strong spatial variability in photosynthesis and the surface energy balance. As a result, experiment (b) simulates SCu that are characterized by less extreme and less skewed values of the liquid water path and cloud-base height. These findings are corroborated by the calculation of characteristics lengths scales of the thermals and clouds using autocorrelation and spectral analysis methods. We find that experiments (a) and (b) are characterized by similar cloud cover evolution, but different cloud population characteristics. Experiment (b), including cloud shading, is characterized by smaller clouds, but closer to each other. By performing a sensitivity analysis on the exchange of water vapor and carbon dioxide at the canopy level, we show that the larger water-use efficiency of C4 grass leads to two opposing effects that directly influence boundary-layer clouds: the thermals below the clouds are more vigorous and deeper driven by a larger buoyancy surface flux (positive effect), but are characterized by less moisture content (negative effect). We conclude that under the investigated mid-latitude atmospheric and well-watered soil conditions, SCu over C4 grass fields is characterized by larger cloud cover and an enhanced liquid water path compared to C3 grass fields.",

In particular, we are interested in problems where the multiscale approximation is of almost sufficient accuracy, but may be unacceptable due to lack of uniform scale separation in the domain. In this setting, it is of interest to find efficient approaches that do not require a completely new analysis of the problem, or a resolved fine-scale approximation.\nWe thus consider multiscale methods in the framework of domain decomposition and multigrid techniques. Our objective is to formulate linear and non-linear solvers, possessing the following properties: 1) The initial iteration is identical to a multiscale approximation. 2) Further iterations reduce the approximation error with comparable efficiency to dedicated fine-scale solvers. 3) The error can be controlled by explicitly computable error bounds.\nWe give examples from a range of applications, including large-scale simulation of CO2 storage, mechanical deformation of heterogeneous poroelastic materials, and flow and heat transfer in highly fractured porous media associated with geothermal energy recovery. The latter application is illustrated in the figures, where we compare the A) Multiscale approximation, B) Approximation with intermediate accuracy, and C) Fine-scale solution for the problem.",

In general, gravity gradient data are sensitive to shallower structures than the gravity field itself and provide information about the variations in both the horizontal and vertical plane.\nValidation of satellite data in different orbit heights show that the gradients in different heights have a significantly different sensitivity, which can be exploited to construct the most reasonable lithospheric setting.\nTo explore the benefit by using gravity gradients in addition to conventional gravity data, a case example from the well-explored and understood North-East Atlantic Margin will be shown. Here, a 3D model of the lithosphere preexisted that incorporates a wealth of geophysical data sets, e.g. seismics, magnetics and borehole information. The model is initially optimized for near-surface gravity data. However, in the NE Atlantic the gravity field is affected by a regional trend, which is reflected as well in the geoid, and associated to sub-lithospheric density domains.\nUsing this model for sensitivity analysis shows that the satellite gravity gradients are little affected by the sub-lithospheric field, but are especially sensitive to the density contrasts from the lower crust to 100 km depth.\nAnother important observation is that modeling of the gravity gradients requires depth-dependent crustal densities and temperature dependent upper mantle densities. A too simplified use of average densities leads to clear misfit to the observed data.\nSatellite gravity gradients are as well sensitive to compositional changes in the upper mantle, but for to decipher the thermal structure and composition integration with information from seismic tomography is needed. In summary, the sensitivity analysis in the NE Atlantic region shows, that satellite gravity gradients are a valuable addition to image the lithosphere in 3D and consequently to distinguish the lithospheric and sub-lithospheric components in the gravity field.",

            "abstract": "The heights and expansion rate of eruption cloud and the dispersal pattern of tephra particles are key observable data for understanding the dynamics of volcanic plume. In general, when the volcanic plume rises in a stationary environment, the plume height and expansion rate of the umbrella cloud increases as the eruption intensity (i.e., the magma discharge rate) increases. On the other hand, when the plume is distorted by the atmospheric wind, it is difficult to quantify the relationship between the eruption conditions and the observable data. Therefore, we aim to develop a three-dimensional numerical model of volcanic plume and directly reproduce the plume dynamics and the tephra dispersal.\nWe performed a numerical simulation of the 2014 eruption at Mount Kelud, Java, Indonesia, which formed a large volcanic plume and umbrella cloud in the wind field. We employ a 3D numerical model which is designed to simulate the injection of tephra particles and volcanic gas from a circular vent into the stratified atmosphere, using a combination of a pseudo-gas model for fluid motion and a Lagrangian model for particle motion (Suzuki and Koyaguchi, 2013 EPS). Using the estimated total mass (3.9—6.4×1011 kg) and the eruption duration (2.5 – 3 hours), the average mass discharge rate is estimated to be 3.6—7.1×107 kg/s. In this study, the magma discharge rate is set to be 5×107 kg/s. The weather data based on the radiosonde observation in Surabaya is applied to the atmospheric condition.\nThe simulation results indicate that the top of plume reaches to nearly 30 km and the umbrella cloud radially spreads at the height of 17—20 km high. These simulated heights are consistent with the observations (e.g., NASA Earth Observatory). The particles are transported by the gravity current of the umbrella cloud. Between the umbrella cloud and the ground, the particles separated from the cloud are drifted by the easterly wind. Therefore, the dispersal axis of the main fall deposits simulated by the present model agrees well with the observation. However, the present simulation cannot reproduce the fall deposits on the north and northeast area of the volcano. This inconsistency implies that in reality, unlike the conditions assumed in our model, the eruption intensity and atmospheric condition fluctuated largely with time.",

            "abstract": "The ESA Earth Observation Swarm satellite mission, a constellation of three satellites to measure the Earth’s magnetic and electric fields as well as the neutral environment, was launched on November 22, 2013. The mission delivers observations that provide new insight into the Earth system by improving our understanding of the Earth’s interior as well as the near Earth electro-magnetic environment. The unprecedented high-accuracy and high spatial resolution measurements of the strength, direction and time variations of the magnetic field, complemented by precise navigation, accelerometer and electric field measurements, provide the required observations to model the various sources of the geomagnetic field.\nThe three satellites fly in a constellation. Swarm Alpha and Charlie are orbiting almost next to each other at a distance of about 150 km at the equator and Charlie is approximately 10 seconds delayed relative to Alpha. At the start of the science phase they were injected at an altitude of 462 km and an inclination of 87.35°, in naturally decaying orbits. Swarm Bravo started in a higher orbit at 510 km with an inclination of 87.75°. This causes a relative drift between Alpha/Charlie and Bravo resulting in a local time difference of about 6 hours in the third year of the mission. Different objectives of the mission may benefit more during different phases of the constellation. This presentation will include the mission status a year after launch and focus on the products, studies and results related to the external fields.",

Alternatively, linear chains may be present in which a crystallographic easy axis (<111> for magnetite) is not oriented along the long particle axis and chain axis, as is the case in magnetotactic bacteria strains that do not produce particles of regular morphology and for which FMR data have not been recorded yet.

            "abstract": "Due to the high heterogeneity of fractured media and the ubiquitous lack of a complete site characterization, deterministic simulations of radionuclide transport in fractured rocks are notoriously highly uncertain. This epistemic uncertainty is typically addressed using stochastic methods; e.g. the connectivity structure of the medium is described using one or multiple realizations of Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN), which are then combined to Time Domain Random Walk (TDRW) simulations (e.g. Painter and Cvetkovic, 2005). In these formulations, many complex geochemical retention processes are usually lumped into a single parameter: the distribution coefficient (Kd). Although this approach is mathematically robust and numerically efficient, it relies on an important assumption: the Kd value of each radionuclide is constant in time. This assumption could be critical under long-term geochemical changes as it is demonstrated that the distribution coefficient depends on the pH, redox conditions and major chemistry of the system. In this work, we present a novel methodology that combines the robustness of stochastic methods with a sound and explicit description of water-solute-rock interaction processes. The reconciliation of all these is achieved by using an “intelligent Kd” approach. The hydrogeochemical evolution of the site of study is first computed using long-term and large-scale mechanistic reactive transport simulations. The simulated hydrochemical conditions are then used to generate a complete database of Kd values, which represent the hydrochemical conditions in every position and time of the model domain. Then, TDRW simulations, based on one or multiple DFN realizations, are fed with these data and the results (e.g. radionuclide breakthrough curves) implicitly bring the signature of the underlying changes in the background geochemistry.",

            "abstract": "The theory of plate tectonics has been one of the major breakthroughs in solid-Earth science and is capable of explaining many of the tectonic processes on present-day Earth. Moreover, it allows us to reconstruct Earth’s tectonic history back until times of the supercontinent Pangaea and thus improves our understanding how Earth developed to its present state. However, plate tectonics remains a kinematic theory that does not sufficiently incorporate the balance of forces in the Earth’s mantle and can thus not explain the motion of Earth’s tectonic plates in a dynamically consistent manner.\nHere, we use fully dynamic models of mantle convection in global spherical geometry to overcome this issue. These models include tectonic plates self-consistently evolving from mantle flow (using a viscoplastic rheology) as well as continental drift. We analyze the evolution of plate velocities over time periods considerably longer than those covered by modern plate reconstructions. We observe significant changes in plate velocity magnitude and direction over timescales relevant for the Earth. While some of these plate reorganizations appear to be rather local affecting only very few plates, others seem to have more global consequences.\nWe characterize the variety of different reorganizations based on features of modeled spreading centers and subduction zones, for instance the flux of slab material into the lower mantle. Initial results suggest that global changes in plate configuration correlate with phases of major slab penetration into the lower mantle, while changes on individual plate-scale do not necessarily do so.",

            "abstract": "Early in the Solar System history, planets grew through energetic collisions between planetesimals. Partial destruction of planetary embryos could have produce heterogeneous bodies, because of widespread internal chemical differentiation through core-segregation, partial melting of silicated mantles and fractional crystallization of magma oceans. On larger proto-planets, including the early Earth, meteoritic impacts have potentially induced erosion of part of the surface, which could have affected significantly the final chemical composition of terrestrial planets. Here we report that collisional erosion of 15-18% of the early Earth’s surface reconciles the major apparent compositional differences between the known enstatite chondrites (EC) and the bulk Earth. We base our arguments on experimental measurements of the melting properties of an EC body at pressures between 1 bar and 25 GPa. At low degree of partial melting, the silicate melts are found highly enriched in SiO2, Al2O3 and Na2O and strongly depleted in MgO. Loss through collisional erosion of the surface of such differentiated planetesimal should ultimately raise its Mg/Si ratio and decrease its concentration in incompatible elements. We elaborate auto-coherent models of the Earth formation. Vaporization into space of the protocrusts could be a source of the Na-rich SiO gas that interacted with chondrules and explain the enrichments of enstatite chondrites in SiO2 and volatile lithophile elements.",

            "abstract": "The European Space Agency’s Rosetta spacecraft is now close in a bound orbit around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G). On board is the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument suite. ROSINA consists of two mass spectrometers, the Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) and the Reflectron-type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF), as well as the COmet Pressure Sensor (COPS). ROSINA is designed to detect and monitor the neutral gas and thermal plasma environment in the comet’s coma by in situ investigation. The two mass spectrometers have high dynamic ranges and complement each other with high mass resolution (DFMS) and high time resolution and large mass range (RTOF). Especially the unprecedented sensitivity and mass resolution of DFMS together with the large mass range of RTOF will allow determining precisely light species (e.g. isotopologues) as well as detecting heavy organics. The pressure sensor COPS is capable to derive total gas densities, velocities, and temperatures. To date only limited data for the composition of cometary comae at heliocentric distances of more than 2.5 AU are available. The set is dominated by CO and daughter species of water from bright comets originating in the Oort cloud. While some molecules can be detected from far by remote sensing (e.g. CO) other molecules are much more difficult to observe from ground (e.g. CO2). The Rosetta mission presents a unique opportunity to directly probe the parent species in the thin cometary atmosphere of a Kuiper-belt object at more than 2.5 AU from the Sun and relate it to ground-based observations. Distances that far from the Sun are of particular interest as the comet’s activity transitions from being super volatiles dominated to being water dominated. We will report on the first measurements of the volatile inventory obtained from ROSINA observations as Rosetta is following comet 67P/C-G in close vicinity.",

Although there are differences between the overall secondary assemblage in the nakhlites and that identified in the Yellowknife Bay mudstones by CheMin (Vaniman et al. 2014 10.1126/science1243480), the trioctahedral iron-rich saponite is probably the closest analogue known to the smectite found in Gale Crater.\nMSL analysed mudstones at the Yellowknife Bay, deposited in a fluvio-lacustrine setting followed by diagenesis ~50 oC (Grotzinger et al. 2014 10.1126/science.1242777). The mineralogical information provides allows us to constrain mineral reactions, W/R, pH, and redox associated using thermochemical modelling, and comparisons to the nakhlites. We use a 2 stage fluid model, with an initial Deccan-type brine composition (Minissale et al. 2000 10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00200-4) which reacts with the known rock compositions - using ChemCam and APXS data to produce a pore fluid. CHIM-XPT was used for the modelling.\nInitial reaction of the early brine with olivine in the mudstone produces relatively Mg-rich phyllosilicate. This early diagenesis may correspond to the formation of Mg-Fe rich ridges (Leveille et al. 10.1002/2014JE004620). Subsequent reaction of the resultant fluid separated at a W/R of 100, produced a fluid that we then reacted with a range of different mineral and amorphous mixtures, T, W/R conditions. A mixture of 70% amorphous, 20% olivine, 10% host rock produced a clay-Fe oxide dominated assemblage, similar to that in Sheepbed.

            "abstract": "Relative sea-level variations during the late Pleistocene can only be reconstructed with the knowledge of ice-sheet history. On the other hand, the knowledge of regional and global relative sea-level variations is necessary to learn about the changes in ice volume. Overcoming this problem of circularity demands a fully coupled system where ice sheets and sea level vary consistently in space and time and dynamically affect each other. Here we present results for the last glacial cycle from the coupling of a set of 3-D ice-sheet-shelf models to a global sea-level model based on the solution of the gravitationally self-consistent sea-level equation. The sea-level model incorporates all the glacial isostatic adjustment feedbacks for a Maxwell viscoelastic and rotating Earth model with variable coastlines. Ice volume is computed with four 3-D ice-sheet-shelf models for North America, Eurasia, Greenland and Antarctica. With an inverse approach, ice volume and temperature are derived from a benthic δ18O stacked record. The derived surface-air temperature anomaly is applied on the present-day climatology to simulate glacial-interglacial changes in temperature and hence ice volume. The ice-sheet thickness variations are forwarded to the sea-level model to compute the bedrock deformation, the change in sea-surface height and thus the relative sea-level change. The latter is coupled back to the ice-sheet models. Due to rotational effects, local isostatic depression and growth or collapse of the forebulge, RSL differences can reach up to 100 m between different locations over the globe. Additionally, ice-sheet model parameters have been varied such that we come up with a suite of different modelling results of ice volume and accompanying global RSL over the last glacial cycle. Subsequently, we will present a first-order comparison of our results with RSL reconstructions derived from geological and archaeological paleo sea-level indicators over the globe.",

            "abstract": "The forcing mechanism and instability of the Atlantic Meridional Overtuning Circulation (AMOC) over the last 21,000 years is studied using transient simulations under realistic forcings in the NCAR-CCSM3. First, in addition to the strong millennial AMOC variability forced by melting water fluxes, the background AMOC is determined by two opposing effects: the intensification by the rising atmospheric CO2 and the reduction by the retreating ice sheet, both through the sea ice feedbacks in the North Atlantic. As a result, the AMOC strength does not change significantly after the deglaciation. Second, the model AMOC exhibits a monostable behavior. This monostable AMOC, which has been observed in almost all state-of-art coupled general climate models (CGCMs), is likely to be caused by a systematic model bias that is associated with the tropical bias, the resulted freshwater flux and AMOC freshwater export. This AMOC over-stabilization bias needs to be improved in these CGCMs to allow for a credible projection of AMOC evolution in the future.",

            "abstract": "Seismic anisotropy represents one of the few sources of information about flow in the mantle that takes place at timescales that are barely accessible at human timescales. Seismic waves travelling through rocks at the speed of sound can reveal flow lines frozen in rocks over hundreds of million years.\nThe interpretation of seismic anisotropy also needs to bridge length-scales since crystal defects are responsible for the plastic anisotropy that align crystals in a deforming rock thus revealing elastic anisotropy at the macroscopic scale. Knowing the easiest slip systems for a given crystal structure is thus the fundamental information needed. To obtain it we propose the following approach based on multiscale numerical modeling.\nAs a first approach, we calculate generalized stacking faults which inform us about the easiest shear paths imposed by the crystal chemistry. This leads to a short list of potential slip systems for which lattice friction will be calculated. A further selection will be done by modeling the core structures of screw dislocations. The tendency for core spreading of screw dislocations impose a selection on potential glide planes which is further validated by modeling corresponding edge dislocations and their respective mobilities.\nFinally, we model the mobility of these dislocations under the conjugate influence of stress and temperature using the kink-pair model which is based on the activation enthalpy of the critical configuration which allows a dislocation to glide from one stable position to the next. The output of this model is the so-called critical resolved shear stress which is the onset of plastic glide at a given temperature and strain rate. Comparison between slip systems provides constraints on the plastic anisotropy.\nExamples are presented among the major phases of the Earth’s mantle.",

            "abstract": "After fifty years of plate-tectonic theory, the reasons why earth sometime freezed as a snowball or sometime became lethally hot resulting in mass extinction remain enigmatic. This article proposes a new hypothesis on Earth evolution. The unbalance of heat between the input and output is considered as the driving force for the Earth evolution, the lithospheric expansion and associated uplift are the triggers, the self-organized progressive failure leading to collapse of the Earth are the amplifier, and the global scale response in terms of volcanism and magmatism is the globalizer. This shallow process of lithosphere may reach a critical state with a positive feedback loop, and result in the formation of no-plume original Large Igneous Provinces (NPOLIP) in a top-down pattern. Endothermic phase changes during de-compressive melting remove heat from and cool their surroundings, including the upper parts of the lithosphere. The huge loss of Earth’s heat during eruption of LIPs, together with the endothermic cooling, may put the thermal cycle to an end and a new start of the cycle initiates. In summary, Earth drives itself to evolve in terms of thermal cycles. Global cooling and warming are the two stages of the many cycles during the Earth evolution. Glaciations are the extreme result of global cooling, whereas the LIPs, sometime accompanied with remarkable sea level dropping, are the extreme result of global warming, with a long recovering age, the interglacialstage, between them. They come and go as thermal cycle evolves, with climate warming, being caused by Earth itself rather than by external forces or human activities, as the most attractive prediction.",

            "abstract": "Chemical weathering has an important influence on continental crust evolution, as weathering of basalt preferentially removes soluble elements, such as Mg and Ca, and can shift the crust towards more andesitic compositions, thus helping to solve the crustal composition paradox. The isotopic compositions of soluble elements (e.g., Li and Mg) provide a monitor of chemical weathering of the continents through time.\nHere we evaluate the factors influencing the abundance, [Li], and isotopic composition of riverine Li delivered to the oceans through analyses and modeling of [Li] and d7Li in streams and groundwaters draining a single continental lithology, the Columbia River Basalts (CRBs). The streams were sampled in different climate zones that lie on the dry and wet sides of the Cascades Mountains, and during two different seasons (summer and late winter) in order to evaluate climatic and seasonal influences on Li isotopes in rivers. Dissolved Li (δ7Li = +9.3 to +30.4) is systematically heavier than that of fresh or weathered CRBs, suspended loads (-5.9 to -0.3), and shallow groundwaters (+6.7 to +9.4). Continued isotopic fractionation between stream water and suspended and/or bed loads has a major influence on riverine δ7Li as indicated by the heavier Li in streams, compared to the shallow groundwaters that feed them. Seasonal δ7Li variation is observed only for streams west of the Cascades, where the difference in precipitation rate between the seasons is greatest. Reactive transport model simulations reveal that riverine δ7Li is strongly controlled by subsurface residence times and Li isotope fractionation occurring within rivers. The varying residence times for groundwaters feeding the western streams in summer (long residence times, higher δ7Li, greater weathering) and winter (short residence times, lower δ7Li, less weathering) explains the observed seasonal variations. A global, negative correlation between δ7Li and Li/Na for streams and rivers draining basaltic catchments reflects the overall transport time, hence the amount of silicate weathering. Based on our results, the increase of δ7Li in seawater during the Cenozoic is unlikely related to changing climate, but may reflect mountain building giving rise to increased silicate weathering.",

In this approach, cables are plowed into the ground at several depths and use to make continuous measurements of soil temperature. Unlike Active DTS, external heating is not applied to the cables. The soil temperature profile variations in response to the diurnal net radiation cycle are observed instead. Recent results will be presented from an improved inversion approach, in which the vertical profile of thermal diffusivity is inferred from the cable temperatures and limited ancillary information. Results will also be presented from a promising new data assimilation approach, in which temperature observations are assimilated into a model to obtain simultaneous soil moisture and temperature profiles. This approach is particularly well suited to handling the vertical and horizontal spatial variability in moisture content and soil texture. It is less sensitive to errors in cable depth than the inversion method and circumvents the problem of inferring one of two possible soil moisture values from a thermal diffusivity estimate. We will conclude with some perspectives on how this approach can be extended to facilitate the combined use of active and passive DTS for soil moisture estimation.",

In this talk, I compare the empirical results with results for synthetic catalogs in order to clarify whether or not these results are consistent with the description of the seismicity by a superposition of background activity and epidemic-type aftershock sequences (ETAS models). This question is important, because it is still controversially discussed whether the nucleation process of large earthquakes is driven by seismically cascading (ETAS-type) or by aseismic accelerating processes. To explore the foreshock characteristics, I firstly applied the same clustering algorithms to real and synthetic catalogs and analyzed the temporal, spatial and magnitude distributions of the selected foreshocks, to find significant differences particularly in the temporal acceleration and magnitude dependence. Finally, I calculated forecast scores based on a single-link cluster algorithm which could be appropriate for real-time applications. I find that the JMA catalog yields higher scores than all synthetic catalogs and that the ETAS models having the same magnitude sequence as the original catalog performs significantly better (more close to the reality) than ETAS-models with randomly picked magnitudes.",

These changes have regional and global implications via the climate and socioeconomic systems. The presentation will present results of an integrated analysis aimed at synthesis of changes that have occurred in drylands of Central Asia in the context of socioeconomic transformations and climate variability and change since the 1950s. The analysis uses historical LCLU records, multiple US Earth-observing satellite products, climatological and socioeconomic data, crop production data, and results of climate and wind erosion modeling. The aim is to characterize and understand how drylands have been changed by human activities and by climate, with an emphasis on managed ecosystems related to agricultural activities and food production.

We examine 27 well-located earthquakes that occurred from October 2005 to October 2006 with magnitudes (Mw) between 3.5 and 4.8. We estimated S-wave site effects by calculating horizontal to vertical spectral ratios and determined attenuation functions with a nonparametric model by inverting the observed spectral amplitudes of 21 frequencies between 0.13 and 12.59 Hz for the SCOOBA (OBS) stations and 19 frequencies between 0.16 and 7.94 Hz for NARS-Baja and RESBAN stations. We calculated the geometrical spreading and the attenuation (1/Q) factors for two distance intervals (10-120 km and 120-220 km, respectively) for each frequency considered. The estimates of Q obtained with the SCOOBA (OBS) records for the interval 10-120 km indicate that the P waves attenuate more than S waves (QP=34 f 0.82, QS=59 f 0.90) for frequencies between 0.6 and 12.6 Hz; while for the 120-220 km interval, where ray-paths travel deeper, S waves attenuate more than P waves (QP=117 f 0.44, QS=51 f 1.12). The estimates of Q obtained using NARS-Baja and RESBAN records, within 10-120 km, indicate that P waves attenuate more than S waves (QP=69 f 0.87, QS=176 f 0.61) at frequencies between 0.3 and 6.3 Hz; while at the 120-220 km distance interval S waves attenuate slightly more than P waves (QP=39 f 0.64, QS=48 f 0.37) at high frequencies (f > 3 Hz).

For recent events (younger than 1990's) the seismic sources parameters has been reevaluated with 2 methods: one involving an inversion of the surface waves in the long period domain, and the second one involving an inversion of the W-PHASE in the ultra long period domain. For older ones, the published sources parameters were used for the tsunami simulations.\nThe tsunami modeling is performed via parallel computing on nested grids for some selected sites of French Polynesia, and the results will be compared to the observations and/or measurements given by sea-level instruments. The case of some problematic (complex, slow) events will be then detailed.",

            "abstract": "Model reduction has been shown to be a very effective method for reducing the computational burden of large-scale simulations. Model reduction techniques preserve much of the physical knowledge of the system and primarily seek to remove components from the model that do not provide significant information of interest. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is a model reduction technique by which a system of ordinary equations is projected onto a much smaller subspace in such a way that the span of the subspace is equal to the span of the original full model space. Basically, the POD technique selects a small number of orthonormal basis functions (principal components) that span the spatial variability of the solutions. In this way the state variable (head) is approximated by a linear combination of these basis functions and, using a Galerkin projection, the dimension of the problem is significantly reduced. It has been shown that for a highly discritized model, the reduced model can be two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the original model and runs 1,000 faster. More importantly, the reduced model captures the dominating characteristics of the full model and produces sufficiently accurate solutions. One of the major tasks in the development of the reduced model is the selection of snapshots which are used to determine the dominant eigenvectors. This paper discusses ways to optimize the snapshot selection. Additionally, the paper also discusses applications of the reduced model to parameter estimation, Monte Carlo simulation and experimental design in groundwater modeling.",

Most recent hypotheses invoke Southern Hemisphere processes such as shifts in mid-latitude westerly winds. Here we compare simulations from a global, coupled climate-biogeochemistry model including carbon isotopes (δ\u000e13C) with a synthesis of high-resolution deep sea δ\u000e13C\u000e reconstructions as well as ice core data. The reconstructions from Heinrich Stadial Event 1 (19–15 ka BP) are constistent with model simulations of a large multi-millennial reduction of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our results suggest that the rise in atmospheric CO2 and decrease in its \u000eδ\u000e13C composition (δ13CCO2) observed during the early deglacial may have been caused by an AMOC induced decline of the ocean’s biologically sequestered carbon storage without the need to invoke changes in Southern Hemisphere winds.",

            "abstract": "The increasing global use of road salt deicers has led to an influx of salts, particularly NaCl and CaCl2, into urban surface waters. This influx has led to documented salinization of drinking water supplies, as well as damage to ecosystems. There is an increasing recognition that the influx of road salt deciers may also influence the physical mixing of lakes, with dramatic consequences for lake biogeochemistry. In this study, the water column chemistry of two kettle lakes in urban Kalamazoo, MI, USA was monitored for over a year. Woods Lake, an ~9.7 ha, 14 m max depth lake, receives most water from storm water sewers, whereas nearby Asylum Lake, an ~19.8 ha, 15.8 m max depth lake, is primarily groundwater fed. The water columns of both lakes are strongly redox stratified, but exhibit some significant differences in water chemistry. The input of road salt has caused Woods Lake to transition to meromixis, with permanently anoxic bottom waters and significant accumulations of dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), NH3, PO4-3 and sometimes HS- in the hypolimnion. In contrast, Asylum Lake appears to be monomictic, with turnover occurring in fall, but not spring. During most seasons, the hypolimnion of Asylum Lake has significant levels of dissolved Mn(II), NH3, PO4-3, and sometimes HS-, but dissolved Fe(II) remains below detection limits. A comparison of δ18O and δD with the local meteoric water line demonstrates that both lakes undergo significant evaporation. Woods Lake is considerably more influenced by evaporation than Asylum Lake, presumably due to the longer residence time of water in Woods Lake. The longer residence time, together with the smaller volume of water in Woods Lake, likely explains the more rapid transition to meromixis compared to Asylum Lake. This study demonstrates that road salt deicers can significantly influence the biogeochemistry and physical function of urban lakes, and in some cases can result in dimictic lakes transitioning to cultural meromixis.",

            "abstract": "The Alpine Fault is a major plate-boundary fault zone that poses a significant seismic hazard in southern New Zealand, with the next major earthquake expected to be imminent. Core samples from the Alpine Fault were recovered from two Deep Fault Drilling Project pilot boreholes that penetrated the principal slip zone (PSZ). We show here that at room temperature and low effective stress (30 MPa), materials from within and very near the PSZ are weaker than the surrounding cataclasites (µ = 0.45), exhibit velocity-strengthening friction, and also tend to restrengthen (heal) rapidly. Under conditions appropriate for several kilometers depth on the Alpine Fault (100 MPa, 160 °C, fluid-saturated), a cataclasite/gouge sample located very near to the PSZ exhibits µ = 0.67, which is high compared to measurements performed at lower pressures and temperatures for the Alpine Fault and other major fault zones sampled by scientific drilling. Every major lithological unit tested under elevated P-T conditions exhibits both positive and negative values of friction velocity-dependence suggesting that they are all capable of earthquake nucleation. Using representative values of the friction velocity-dependent parameter a-b, the critical slip distance Dc, and previously documented elastic properties of the wall rock, estimated critical nucleation patch lengths may be as low as ~3 m. This small value is consistent with a seismic moment Mo = ~4x1010 or a Mw = ~1, which suggests that events of this size or larger are expected to occur as normal earthquakes and that slow or transient slip events are unlikely in the approximate depth range of 3-7 km. In conjunction with previous geodetic and seismologic observations, our results indicate that the Alpine Fault has a high potential for frictional instability throughout the brittle crust, in contrast with other major fault zones on which the uppermost portion is relatively stable.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake, tsunami and geodetic data show that co-seismic slips of a large megathrust earthquakes do not uniformly propagate along a plate boundary. For example, a clear segmentation of slip zones of magnitude-8 class megathrust earthquakes are well recognized in the Nankai Trough. Moreover, a lateral variation of the slips are revealed even in one segment. In the Japan Trench, the most characteristic slip behavior of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake is an extremely large slip reaching to the trench axis, but geodetic, tsunami or teleseismic show the slip was heterogeneous near the trench. In order to examine whether those complex slip distributions are attributed by any distinct structural factor, we have been carried out active-source seismic surveys in the subduction seismogenic. In the Nankai Trough, large-scale subducted seamounts, ridges and doming structure intruded in an overriding accretion wedge are imaged. Comparing co-seismic slip distribution of the 1944 Tonankai and the 1946 Nankai earthquakes with the seismic images, we concluded that those structures are key factors to control the slip distributions. In the central part of the Japan Trench area, we fund a rough basement geometry is overprinted on the horst-and-graben structure. Those complex geometry of basement cause a strong lateral variation of the thickness of subducting pelagic/hemi-pelagic sediment. Many geological studies suggest that properties of the plate-boundary sediment attribute the large slip near the trench. We therefore plan to acquire additional high-resolution seismic data in the entire Japan Trench in order to examine a role of incoming sediment on the large slip to the trench axis. In this presentation we present an overview of the structural factors controlling slips in megathrust earthquakes, including new data acquired in the Nankai Trough and Japan Trench.",

How can we understand our place in the “sensing ecosystem,” and sort between the transformative opportunities of sensing technology and technological land mines that will expend your budget and be unreliable? Here I review the impact of three technological frameworks on biogeochemical observation: distributed fiber optic sensing; low-power radio and GSM communication; and 3-D printing. From the fiber optic sensing applications in air, soil, rivers, oceans and wells, we see that this truly does qualify as a revolutionary observational platform. Specifically, it densely spans the critical 0.1 m to 10,000 m spatial scales and 1 to 1,000,000 s temporal scales, providing opportunity to address long-standing fundamental open questions. This is placed in contrast to the unfulfilled promises touted by the self-organizing mesh network radio technology. We argue that this outcome reflects a lack of candor of technology insiders in the selling of this technology with respect to the potential given the 1/r^3 energy of radio communication combined with the challenges of environmental settings for wave propagation (e.g., intense rain, snow laden branches, and long periods of low solar radiation). This is contrasted with the excellent outcomes of GSM-based monitoring approaches that leveraged the massive infrastructure of cellular telephones. Finally, I will venture to explain why open-source 3-D printing technology will provide the next transformative opportunity for Biogeosicences by re-inventing point-sensing instrumentation.",

The results revealed large annual variations in the seasonal distribution of precipitation, which along with soil freezing and thawing gave rise to significant variations in soil moisture. Radiation components had general seasonal cycles with less annual variability. Shortwave radiation fluctuated obviously with weather conditions, while longwave radiation was less affected. Surface albedo had significant seasonal and interannual variations: the maximum midday mean value (0.83) occurred after snow, then it dropped to less than 0.2 during crop growing season, after crop harvest, it fluctuated with precipitation. There was a negatively linear relationship between the albedo and the soil moisture. Large interannual differences in seasonal variations of sensible and latent heat fluxes were observed due to the interannual variations in precipitation and agricultural activities. The main consumer of available energy varied among months and years, with the monthly mean diurnal cycle of latent (sensible) heat flux peaking in summer (spring) at 251.9 (192.5) W m-2. On an annual scale, the largest consumer of midday net radiation was sensible (latent) heat flux in 2010-2011 (2011-2012), which accounted for about 35% (40%) of the net radiation. The annual surface energy budget closures were 77.6% and 73.3%, respectively. The closure was the lowest in winter and the highest in spring, which was affected by atmospheric stability and the heat storage by vegetation canopy and near surface air layer.",

The hum contains periods longer than 30 s, and the primary and secondary peaks are usually centered around 15 and 5 s, respectively. Motions in all three bands are recorded everywhere on our planet and can provide information on both the solid Earth structure and the ocean wave climate over the past century. Here we describe recent efforts to extend the range of validity of ocean wave models to cover periods from 1 to 300 s (Ardhuin et al., Ocean Modelling 2014), and the resulting public database of ocean wave spectra (http://tinyurl.com/iowagaftp/HINDCAST/ ).\nWe particularly discuss the sources of uncertainty for building a numerical model of acoustic and seismic noise on this knowledge of ocean wave spectra. For acoustic periods shorter than 3 seconds, the main uncertainties are the directional distributions of wave energy (Ardhuin et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Amer. 2013). For intermediate periods (3 to 25 s), the propagation properties of seismic waves are probably the main source of error when producing synthetic spectra of Rayleigh waves (Ardhuin et al. JGR 2011, Stutzmann et al. GJI 2012). For the longer periods (25 to 300 s), the poor knowledge of the bottom topography details may be the limiting factor for estimating hum spectra or inverting hum measurements in properties of the infragravity wave field. All in all, the space and time variability of recorded seismic and acoustic spectra is generally well reproduced in the band 3 to 300 s, and work on shorter periods is under way. This direct model can be used to search for missing noise sources, such as wave scattering in the marginal ice zone, find events relevant for solid earth studies (e.g. Obrebski et al. JGR 2013) or invert wave climate properties from microseismic records.\nThe figure shows measured spectra of the vertical ground acceleration, and modeled result for the primary and secondary mechanisms using our numerical wave model.

In 2009, under Secretarial Order 3289, Interior created eight regional Climate Science Centers managed by the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and in partnership with universities. Secretarial Order 3289 provides a framework to coordinate climate change science and adaptation efforts across Interior and to integrate science and resource management expertise from Federal, State, Tribal, private, non-profit, and academic partners.\nIn addition to broad research expertise, these Federal/university partnerships provide opportunities to develop a next generation of climate science professionals. These include opportunities to increase the climate science knowledge base of students and practicing professionals; build students’ skills in working across the boundary between research and implementation; facilitate networking among researchers, students, and professionals for the application of research to on-the-ground issues; and support the science pipeline in climate-related fields through structured, intensive professional development.\nIn 2013, Climate Science Centers supported approximately 10 undergraduates, 60 graduate students, and 26 postdoctoral researchers. Additional students trained by Climate Science Center-affiliated faculty also contribute valuable time and expertise, and are effectively part of the Climate Science Center network. The Climate Science Centers’ education and training efforts have also reached a number of high school students interested in STEM careers, and professionals in natural and cultural resource management.\nThe Climate Science Centers are coordinating to build on each other’s successful education and training efforts. Early successes include several intensive education experiences, such as the Alaska Climate Science Center’s Girls on Ice, the Northeast’s Consortium Retreat, the Northwest’s Climate Science Boot Camp; the whole-network Early Career Climate Forum; the South Central Climate Science Center’s Minority Internship; and a growing curriculum through Interior’s National Conservation Training Center.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) shows limited skill in capturing the Tropical Intraseasonal Oscillations (TISO). As the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFS) is adopted for operational monsoon forecast of India, improving its bias will directly benefit the operational forecast and finally the society. Keeping this in background, we felt, improving the cloud and convection parameterization of CFS (version2) is the need of the hour. A first attempt is made to improve the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall from diurnal through daily to seasonal scale. Experiments with Simplified Arakawa Schubert (SAS) and a revised SAS (RSAS) schemes are carried out to make 15 years climate run (free run). It is clearly seen that the use of RSAS is able to improve some of the biases of CFSv2 with SAS. Improvement is seen in the annual seasonal cycle, onset and withdrawal but most importantly the rainfall probability distribution function (PDF). The PDF of diurnal rainfall has significantly improved with respect to even a high resolution CFSv2 T382. The improvement of diurnal cycle of total rainfall is found to be contributed by the improvement of convective rainfall. However, the cold tropospheric temperature bias, low cloud fractions need further improvement. As the RSAS could only improve the convective rainfall but not the resolved scale process, the existing Zhao and Carr microphysics scheme is replaced by WSM6 scheme with six class of hydrometeors. The incorporation of WSM6 along with RSAS appears to make a significant improvement in the systematic biases of CFSv2 in the intraseasonal scale. It is able to capture the cloud processes much realistically and show a significant improvement in simulating the tropical waves and TISO. As a part of improving the cloud processes in CFSv2, we have attempted Superparameterization technique and have developed a SP-CFS (superparameterized (SP)). The CFSv2 used for SP is at T62 resolution. SP-CFS simulates an improved precipitation distribution over the globe; better temperature structures, variance for the synoptic and low-frequency TISO and reduction of the dry precipitation bias. These developments give a clear message that improvement in representation of cloud and convection processes improve the systematic biases of CFSv2 and improve model fidelity.",

            "abstract": "Physical and biological processes occurring within fluvial networks can have strong influence on catchment scale retention of water and nutrients. Quantifying the physical (i.e., hydrologic exchange) and biological (i.e., nutrient uptake) contributions to total retention and deciphering how they relate to catchment morphology remains a central challenge in the hydrologic and biogeo-sciences. Here we present examples from our research that highlight the interactions between biology, physical hydrology, and geomorphology and how they combine to influence nutrient retention and streamwater compositions. Biological nutrient uptake in streams can have substantial influence on downstream fluxes and induce nutrient transformation along stream networks. Additionally, hydrologic loss of water and associated nutrients from streams to surrounding groundwater systems can greatly elongate water and nutrient retention times. While in-stream nutrient uptake is often associated with hyporheic exchanges that occur at sub-meter scales, these are nested within a larger framework of fluvial exchanges (100s – 1000s of meters). Larger scale exchanges can lead to strong shifts in streamwater composition over relatively short spatial scales (~1km) and are often very pronounced along geomorphic transitions (e.g., mountain to valley) and/or catchment retention zones (e.g., alluvial aquifers, wetlands, lakes). In fact, 50 – 80% of the water in the channel can be exchanged and replaced by different water (i.e., groundwater) along geomorphic transitions/catchment retention zones that are ~1 km in scale. These features can enhance geochemical processing through extended interactions between water, sediment, and nutrients. Accordingly, we suggest that although catchment retention features may be limited in spatial extent (~1km) and frequency they have the capacity to play a disproportionately large role in controlling catchment retention dynamics and setting fluvial network streamwater compositions.",

            "abstract": "Fluids released from subducting slabs affect earthquakes, geochemical recycling, melt generation, and mantle wedge flow. The distribution of this fluid release is controlled by the composition/hydration of the slab entering a subduction zone and the pressure-temperature path that the slab follows. We examine the potential for along-strike changes in the thermal state of the south central Chile subduction zone (36 to 45 °S) to affect the distribution of fluid release from the subducting Nazca Plate. Because the age of the plate entering the subduction zone decreases from ~30 Ma at 36 °S to ~1 Ma at 45 °S, a southward warming of the subduction zone has been hypothesized. We model temperatures in the system, then use results of the thermal models and the thermodynamic calculation code Perple_X to estimate the distribution of dehydration-derived fluid release from the subducting slab. Surface heat flux observations in the region are most consistent with fluid circulation in the high permeability upper oceanic crust redistributing heat. This hydrothermal circulation preferentially cools parts of the system with the youngest subducting lithosphere. For example, relative to simulations with no fluid flow, hydrothermal circulation decreases temperatures in the 45 °S transect by up to 150 °C. Although hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust likely ceases by ~50 km landward of the trench, the legacy of its heat redistribution affects slab temperatures and dehydration >100 km farther landward. In the 45 °S transect, using temperatures from a model that includes hydrothermal circulation yields peak slab dehydration centered under the volcanic arc. In contrast, without hydrothermal circulation, peak slab dehydration is predicted at ~70 km seaward of the volcanic arc. For systems with young (<20 Ma) subducting lithosphere, hydrothermal circulation in oceanic crust should be considered in estimating subduction zone temperatures and fluid source distributions.",

Metagenomic sequencing of sediment samples reveals dominant presence of Methylobacter, contrary to prior understanding based on cultivation of methanotrophs. Stable isotope probing of microcosms incubated with methane at varying concentrations of oxygen and nitrate uncover a dominant response by Methylobacter species and a correlation between the populations of Methylobacter and Methylotenera, both responding positively to nitrate. We also uncover a propensity of Methylobacter to act in microoxic conditions, in this case transferring carbon down a food chain represented by a variety of bacteria. Functional gene profiling detects upwards shifts in the abundances of nitrogen metabolism genes in response to nitrate, with Methylococcaceae and Methylophilaceae genes being most abundant. We test a hypothesis of cooperative behavior between Methylobacter, Methylotenera and other species using two alternative approaches: a top-down approach in which we incubate native lake sediments under different conditions and observe trajectories of community simplification, and a bottom-up approach in which we construct synthetic communities from pure cultures of bacteria and observe their behavior. We also cultivate Methylobacter as well as multiple species of Methylophilaceae and analyze their genomes. Among the Methylophilaceae, we uncover a remarkable flexibility in terms of both central carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways. We hypothesize that this diversity may be driven by microniche conditions along the methane and oxygen countergradients, as well as by the availability of nitrogen sources. Our future plans include deciphering the mechanistic details of cooperative behavior in methane oxidation, using Lake Washington communities as a model.",

This form of ground has important implications in a permafrost system because as the wedge ice, the inherent structural support given to the sediment is lost and subsidence and flooding occurs. The volume of ice found in wedges is poorly known because the wedge geometry is difficult to measure with direct methods; most estimates of wedge depth come from exposures at thermo-erosional features. Here we demonstrate the a novel interpretation of a well-known non-invasive ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurement that may be useful for measuring ice wedge depth. Using synthetic data and a field data examples, we detail the signal anomaly observed in the GPR record associated with ice wedges and demonstrate that a genetic algorithm (GA) inversion can be used to recover the wedge depth by optimizing the fit between measured and simulated radar cross section (RCS). Our results indicate that this optimization approach can recover wedge geometry even under noisy conditions.",

However, the equations establishing the links between the continental flux of Li to the ocean, its Li isotope composition and the ocean Li isotope composition are under-constrained, and their resolution are related to significant uncertainties. In order to partially reduce this uncertainty, we propose a new approach that couples the C and Li cycles, such that our proposed reconstruction of the Cenozoic Li cycle is compatible with the required stability of the exospheric carbon cycle on geological timescales. The results of this exercise show, contrary to expectations, that the Li isotope composition of rivers exerts only a minor influence on the d7Li of the ocean. In contrast, variations in the continental flux of Li to the ocean are demonstrated to play a major role in setting the ocean d7Li. We also provide evidence that Li storage in soils is an important element of the global Li cycle that cannot be neglected during the Cenozoic. Our modeling of the published foraminifera record highlight a close link between soil formation rate and indexes recording the climate evolution during the Cenozoic, such as foraminifera d18O and pCO2 reconstructions. This leads us to propose that climate exerted a dominant control on soil production and therefore on continental weathering during the last 70 Ma.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial fill terraces provide a record of changes in sediment production and/or transport in response to external forcing. The N-S striking Humahuaca intermontane basin (Eastern Cordillera, NW Argentina) parallels the eastern margin of the Puna Plateau and is known for frequent landslides/debris flows during the wet season and protracted past wet periods. Fill terraces along tributaries (with 20-1100 km2 catchments) to the trunk stream are dated with OSL to between ~30 and 120 ka. Aggradation phases on the west side of the basin correlate with past wet periods, and those on the east side with dry periods. The difference may arise because the river-network geometry of eastern catchments promotes sediment storage, resulting in delayed sediment delivery to the trunk stream and/or a higher threshold to erosion and sediment transport. Cosmogenic nuclide (10Be) concentrations of sand (<0.7 cm) and pebbles (1-3 cm) reveal that in modern stream sediments, (1) denudation rates from sand (<0.1 mm/yr) overlap with bedrock erosion rates, (2) denudation rates from pebbles are 1.2 to 4x higher, which could reflect the importance of mass movements, and (3) eastern catchments yield lower rates. From wet-phase (west side) terraces, denudation rates are higher than those from modern streams, while highly scattered pebble denudation rates of 0.1-10 mm/yr may reflect an increased frequency of mass movements in past wetter periods. In contrast, dry-phase (east side) terrace pebble and sand denudation rates overlap with modern rates, 26Al/10Be ratios are low, and a sample from the sediment storage zone has a relatively high pebble denudation rate of 0.3 mm/yr. We interpret the patterns to imply that mass movements are triggered throughout the valley during wet climate phases and induce aggradation, but slow re-excavation of stored sediments from eastern catchments leads to increased 10Be concentrations and delayed sediment delivery to the main valley. Such behavior at an orogen scale could attenuate or mask landscape responses to climate forcing.",

            "abstract": "Many subduction zones retreat while hotspots remain sufficiently stable in the mantle to provide an approximate reference frame. As a consequence, the mantle can be thought of as an unusual convecting system which self-organises to promote frequent collisions of downgoing material with upwellings.\nWe present three 3D numerical models of subduction where buoyant material from a plume head and an associated ocean-island chain or plateau produce flat slab subduction and deformation of the over-riding plate. We observe transient instabilities of the convergent margin including: contorted trench geometry; trench migration parallel with the plate margin; folding of the subducting slab and orocline development at the convergent margin; and transfer of the plateau to the overriding plate.\nThe presence of plume material beneath the oceanic plateau causes flat subduction above the plume, resulting in a “bowed” shaped subducting slab. In the absence of a plateau at the surface, the slab can remain uncoupled from the over-riding plate during very shallow subduction and hence there is very little shortening at the surface or advance of the plate boundary.\nIn plateau-only models, plateau accretion at the edge of the overriding plate results in trench migration around the edge of the plateau before subduction re-establishes directly behind the trailing edge of the plateau. The plateau shortens during accretion and some plateau material subducts.\nIn a plateau-plus-plume model, accretion is associated with rapid trench advance as the flat slab drives the plateau into the margin. This indentation stops once a new convergent boundary forms close to the original trench location. A slab window formed beneath the accreted plateau allows plume material to flow from beneath the subducting plate to the underside of the overriding plate.\nIn all of these models the subduction zone maintains a relatively stable configuration away from the buoyancy anomalies within the downgoing plate. The models provide a dynamic context for plateau and plume accretion in accretionary orogenic systems.",

The energetic O+ population makes a significant contribution to the plasma pressure in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere during magnetic storms, although under quiet conditions H+ dominates the plasma pressure. The pressure enhancements, which we term energization, are caused by adiabatic heating through earthward transport of source population in the plasma sheet, local acceleration in the inner magnetosphere and near-Earth plasma sheet, and enhanced ion supply from the topside ionosphere.\nThe key issues regarding stronger O+ energization than H+ are non-adiabatic local acceleration, responsible for increase in O+ temperature, and more significant O+ supply than H+, responsible for increase in O+ density. Although several acceleration mechanisms and O+ supply processes have been proposed, it remains an open question what mechanism(s)/process(es) play the dominant role in stronger O+ energization.\nIn this paper we summarize important spacecraft observations including those from Van Allen Probes, introduces the proposed mechanisms/processes that generate O+-rich energetic plasma population, and outlines possible scenarios of O+ pressure abundance in the Earth’s inner magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "The mantle plumes rising from different depths relate to the seismic slow anomaly in the Earth’s interior and is significant to understand the geodynamic process. Deep mantle plumes often result as volcano chains or oceanic island chains. The previous EM-2 Oki-Daito mantle plume acted on the Philippine Sea Plate at ~50-35 Ma [\nIshizuka et al., 2013\n]. In order to detect the residual of the Oki-Daito plume in the lower mantle beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, P wave arrival-time delays of seven earthquakes occurred at the subduction zones surrounding the plate and recorded by the Chinese Digital Seismic Network and High Sensitivity Seismograph Network of Japan, are used to map the deep fine structure by using the ray-tracing method [\nRawlinson and Sambridge, 2004\n]. A slow anomaly is found at depths between ~837 and 1007 km beneath the central west Philippine Sea Plate, with the P-wave velocity decrease of 0.35%-0.45% and the related temperature increase of ~117-150K. The slow anomaly should be the residual of Oki-Daito plume. In addition, local fast anomaly of ~200km thickness is also found in the mantle transition zone beneath the northern west Philippine Sea Plate, with the P-wave velocity increase of 1.8-2.0%, which should be the stagnant slab of the Pacific Plate [\nFukao et al., 2009\n]. We also analyze the possible earlier interaction between the Oki-Daito plume and stagnant slab, or the cause of the slow anomaly in the lower mantle. Compared to seismic tomography results [\nHuang and Zhao, 2006\n;\nFukao and Obayashi, 2013\n], the slow anomaly obtained by the cross constraint of dense seismic ray-paths shows similar velocity perturbation, but much smaller scales and higher resolution. The phenomenon means that the lower mantle is more homogeneous than that shown in seismic tomography.",

            "abstract": "Humans continue to have an enormous impact on global C and N cycles. While a clear stimulation of methane emissions through human activities is evident, the role of also increasingly released nitrogenous compounds as electron acceptors for microbial methane oxidation is not well constrained. We have developed diverse methods for environmental detection of nitrate(NO3-)- and – predominantly - nitrite(NO2-)-dependent methanotrophs, which have been applied to several freshwater environments.\nIn contrast to most metabolically flexible heterotrophic denitrifiers, the microorganisms responsible for methane-dependent nitrate/nitrite reduction seem to be specialized to use methane only, grow slowly and employ pathways different from each other and from model organisms, which necessitate new approaches for the assessment of their environmental relevance. Nitrite-dependent methane oxidation is carried out by bacteria of the NC10 phylum, whereas nitrate-dependent methane oxidizers are close relatives of methanogenic archaea and sulfate-dependent anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME-2).\nLaboratory enrichment cultures of the nitrite-reducing methanotroph Methylomirabilis oxyfera (NC10 phylum) have formed the basis for its genetic and physiological characterization and the development of several independent methods for its sensitive detection. M. oxyfera differs from all known microorganisms by encoding an incomplete denitrification pathway, in which the last 2 steps, the reduction of NO via N2O to N2, apparently is replaced by the dismutation of NO to N2 and O2. The intracellularly produced O2 is used for methane oxidation via a methane monooxygenase, analogously to the phylogenetically unrelated proteobacterial methanotrophs. But unlike in proteobacteria, C is not assimilated from methane, but rather CO2, with important consequences for the interpretation of environmental isotope labelling studies. In addition, M. oxyfera is characterized by a distinct PLFA profile, including methylated lipids so far not found in any other organism. Case studies using specific primers together with lipid profiles and 13C-labelling in peatlands and other freshwater environments illustrate that the newly developed approaches and biomarkers enable the demonstration of M. oxyfera’s role as a methane sink.",

Typically, the measured distributions feature energetic components with quasi scale-free power-law velocity dependence in the high velocity range. It is customary to model such a feature by means of the kappa distribution, but recently the kappa distribution is understood as implying that the space plasma is in non-extensive thermo-statistical state. Alternatively, the kappa distribution may imply that the space plasma is in turbulent quasi-equilibrium state. The non-extensive state and the turbulent-equilibrium may turn out to be nothing but two different ways of describing the same physical state, although the proof is not so straightforward. The solar wind near 1 A.U. also pervasively shows the presence of electrostatic fluctuations called the quasi-thermal noise. The present talk overviews the theory of solar wind electron kappa distribution, the associated quasi-thermal noise fluctuation, and the newly-discovered spontaneously-generated electromagnetic radiation, which can all be discussed within a single, unified framework of electromagnetic weak turbulence theory.",

            "abstract": "Firstly, we present new results related to the lithospheric structure and tectonics of the Central Europe and the Western Carpathians. For geophysical study of the lithosphere in Central Europe we calculated four original 2D lithosphere-scales transects crossing this area from the West European Platform in the North to the Aegean Sea in the South and from the Adriatic Sea in the West to the East European Platform in the East. Modelling is based on the joint interpretation of gravity, geoid, topography and surface heat flow data with temperature-dependent density. Wherever possible, crustal structure is constrained by seismic data. The thickness of the lithosphere decreases from the older and colder platforms to the younger and hotter Pannonian Basin with a maximum thickness under the Eastern and Southern Carpathians. The thickness of the Carpathian arc lithosphere varies between 150 km in the North (the Western Carpathians) and about 300 km in the Vrancea zone (the Eastern and Southern Carpathian junction). In the Platform areas it is between 120 and 150 km and in the Pannonian Basin it is about 70 km. The models show that the Moesian Platform is overthrust from the North by the Southern Carpathians and from the South by the Balkanides and characterized by bending of this platform. In all transects, the thickest crust is found underneath the Carpathian Mountains or, as in the case of the Vrancea area, under their immediate foreland. The thickest crust outside the orogens is modelled for the Moesian Platform with Moho depths of up to 45 km. The thinnest crust is located under the Pannonian Basin with about 26-27 km.\nSecondly, our presentation deals with construction of the stripped gravity map in the Turiec Basin, which represents typical intramontane Neogene depression of the Western Carpathians. Based on this new and original gravity map corrected by regional gravity effect we were able to interpret the geological structure and tectonics of this sedimentary basin.\nThis work was supported by the Slovak Grant Agency VEGA (grants No. 1/0095/12, 2/0067/12) and Slovak Research and Development Agency (grants No. APVV-0827-12, APVV-0194-10).",

Our model features a sharp lateral velocity contrast extending to >200 km depth, coincident with the abrupt transition from low to high Helium ratios in arc volcanics near 123°E (see figure). The joint analysis of the tomographic model and isotope data (for He, Pb, Nd, Sr) suggests that the North Australian craton subducted beneath the Banda Sea to around 100 km depth.\nThe continuous increase of computing power combined with advances in numerical seismology allow us to develop full waveform inversion techniques that translate complete seismograms into 3D Earth models. The natural incorporation of any type of body and surface waves in full waveform inversion improves tomographic resolution in terms of both resolution length and amplitude recovery.\nWe applied full waveform inversion to Australasia, including the Sunda and Banda arcs. The correlation of the tomographic model with isotope signatures of arc volcanics supports the shallow-angle subduction of North Australian lithosphere. The integrated data suggest that the late Jurassic ocean lithosphere north of the North Australian craton was capable of entraining large volumes of continental lithosphere.\nA plausible explanation involves delamination within the continental crust, separating upper from lower crustal units. This interpretation is consistent with the existence of a massive accretionary complex on Timor island, with evidence from Pb isotope analysis for lower-crust involvement in arc volcanism; and with the approximate gravitational stability of the subducted lithosphere as inferred from the tomographic images. The Banda arc example demonstrates that continental lithosphere in arc-continent collisions may not generally be preserved, thus increasing the complexity of tectonic reconstructions and models of recycling continental crust.",

            "abstract": "Sediment recycling is expected in many tectonic settings, such as foreland basins, where the path followed by grains initially derived from erosion of a basement source region typically involves significant intermediate stages of crustal evolution before the detritus is finally incorporated into tectonically stable basin strata. The shallow-crustal thermal histories experienced by eroded sediment may go undetected by traditional provenance methods but are potentially recoverable by thermochronologic methods. The Patagonian Magallanes retroarc foreland basin affords an excellent case study of sediment burial and recycling within a thrust belt setting. Combined detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and (U-Th)/He thermochronology data and thermal modeling results confirm delivery of both rapidly cooled, first-cycle volcanogenic sediments from the Patagonian magmatic arc and recycled sediment from deeply buried and exhumed Cretaceous foredeep strata to the Cenozoic Magallanes basin depocenter. Numerical models of temperature-time histories indicate that ca. 54-45 Ma burial of the Maastrichtian Dorotea Formation produced 164-180°C conditions and heating to within the zircon He partial retention zone. Such deep burial is unusual for Andean foreland basins and may have resulted from combined effects of high basal heat flow and high sediment accumulation within a rapidly subsiding foredeep that was floored by basement weakened by previous Late Jurassic rifting. In this interpretation, Cenozoic thrust-related deformation deeply eroded the Dorotea Formation and underlying strata from ~5 km burial depths and may be associated with the development of a regionally extensive Paleogene unconformity. Results from the Cenozoic Río Turbio and Santa Cruz formations confirm that they contain both Cenozoic first-cycle zircon from the Patagonian magmatic arc and highly outgassed recycled zircon. This work suggests that Middle Miocene sediments were most likely derived from recycling of deeply buried Upper Cretaceous strata in the Patagonian thrust belt. These findings contribute new understanding to Patagonian foreland basin evolution and provide insight into the broader interactions between tectonics and sedimentation and signals of sediment recycling in convergent basins.",

            "abstract": "Detailed constraints on erosional flux are critical for understanding how exhumational processes control and respond to tectonic events in orogenic belts. This work compares the thermochronologic record and erosional behavior of retroarc thrust belts at two latitudes in the Andes with contrasting Cenozoic climate and deformational records: the glaciated southern Patagonian Andes and the semiarid Argentine Precordillera of the Central Andes. Both regions have undergone crustal shortening during Andean growth and have been affected by thermotectonic processes associated with subduction of oceanic ridges; the Chile Ridge spreading center and Juan Fernández Ridge, respectively. In Patagonia, deep erosion occurred during Miocene retroarc deformation. Zircon He thermochronology documents regional cooling and unroofing of the thrust belt ~22-17 Ma. This behavior likely reflects an upper plate manifestation of incipient subduction of the Chile Ridge spreading center and enhanced unroofing during thermally driven regional uplift. Late Cenozoic expansion of the Patagonian icesheet led to further excavation of the thrust belt, indicating a strong climatic overprinting on thrust belt erosional behavior. In contrast, less overall Cenozoic exhumation is observed in the Argentine Precordillera, despite high strain and crustal thickening. Pre-Jurassic zircon He dates from the Paleozoic strata within thrust sheets suggest Cenozoic Andean deformation was insufficient to exhume rocks from beneath the zircon He closure depth. The apatite He record shows a close correlation between thrust faulting and locus of erosion, and document eastward in-sequence rock cooling from 16 to 2 Ma across the Precordillera tracking with the progressive faulting of the Blanca, San Roque, and Niquivil thrust faults during this time. Pliocene apatite He dates located along the external margins of the Precordillera suggest that the most recent cooling and unroofing is associated with both out-of-sequence faulting and deformation in the Eastern Precordillera basement triangle zone during flat slab subduction. Considered together, both sectors of the Andean retroarc domain have undergone complex unroofing histories and exhibit important differences in geologic inheritance, thermotectonic evolution, and climatic regimes.",

Detailed paleomagnetic and rock magnetic measurements have been made on two cores from Lake Malawi (9m meters in depth, last ~10,000 years), two cores from Lake Victoria (8 m, last ~8,000 years), 11 cores from Lake Turkana (2-9 m, last ~10,000 years), and one core from Lake Tanganyika (5 m, last ~5,000 years). Our rock magnetic studies identify significant intervals of magnetic mineral dissolution in Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika making parts of these cores unsuitable for relative paleointensity studies. On the other hand, rock magnetic variability in the Lake Malawi and Lake Turkana cores are stable and correlatable among cores. We have recovered directional secular variation records from Lakes Malawi, Victoria, and Turkana. Millennial-scale inclination and declination features can be correlated among cores at each lake and between lakes. We have also recovered relative paleointensity records from Lakes Malawi and Turkana. More than 20 radiocarbon dates and detailed seismic stratigraphy (Turkana) provide critical added information for correlating and dating the paleomagnetic records.",

Additional analysis of abyssal topography flanking mid-ocean ridges is presented indicating the presence of excess energy near periods corresponding to precession, obliquity, and 100 ky variations. Wavelength is transformed into period using independently estimated spreading rates. This topographic structure is consistent with the expected response of mid-ocean ridge productivity and evolved crustal thickness to changes in pressure associated with variations in sea level. If ridge CO2 emissions track these indications of ridge productivity, decreased emissions as a result of deglaciation are implied, constituting a negative feedback. CO2 emissions would be delayed, however, because of transit times from the base of the melt zone, and a simple delayed oscillator is presented for how delayed negative feedbacks could be important for setting the 100 ky glacial cycle period.",

When the large reservoir size of oceanic crust is considered, carbon transformations in this environment have the potential to significantly impact the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, igneous oceanic crust is the most massive potential habitat for life on Earth, so understanding the carbon sources for this potential biosphere are important for understanding life on Earth. Geochemical evidence suggests that warm and anoxic upper basement is net heterotrophic, but the balance of these processes in cooler and potentially oxic oceanic crust are poorly known. Here, we present data from stable carbon isotope tracer incubations to examine carbon fixation in basalts collected from the Loihi Seamount, the Juan de Fuca Ridge, and the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, to provide a first order constraint on the rates of carbon fixation on basalts. These data will be compared to recently available assessments of carbon cycling rates in fluids from upper basement to synthesize our current state of understanding of the potential for carbon fixation and respiration in oceanic crust. Moreover, we will present new genomic data of carbon fixation genes observed in the basalt enrichments as well as from the subsurface of the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank, enabling identification of the microbes and metabolic pathways involved in carbon fixation in these systems.",

            "abstract": "Accretionary wedges in the subduction zone are typically highly porous due to continuous influx of unconsolidated sediments on the seafloor. A well-known deformation mode for porous materials is compaction. When porous materials are compacted in the undrained condition (as in the rapid loading of earthquake rupture) the pore pressure increases significantly when pore space closes while pore fluids are largely incompressible, resulting in a much larger pore pressure increase than that by the elastic compression alone. In this work, we incorporate compaction in our poroplastic model of shallow subduction zone earthquakes (Ma, 2012; Ma and Hirakawa, 2013) by using an end-cap yield criterion (e.g., Wong, 1997). We show that for a wedge on the verge of compactant failure initially (due to large porosity) up-dip rupture causes significant wedge compaction, which induces large pore pressure increase, reduces effective stress, and causes more easily shear failure. The wedge needs not be on the verge of Coulomb failure initially. Dilatancy accompanying shear failure near the end of deformation process can reduce volume loss due to initial compaction, resulting in a small net volumetric plastic strain. Compaction significantly enhances failure in the wedge, which makes our wedge-failure mechanism more plausible in explaining well-documented anomalous observations for shallow subduction zone earthquakes, such as slow rupture velocity, efficient tsunami generation, deficiency in high-frequency radiation, and low moment-scaled radiated energy. The dynamically elevated pore pressure may also explain numerous observations on the hydrologic activities in the wedge (e.g., mud volcanoes).",

            "abstract": "A number of physical mechanisms have been identified as potentially important for causing Van Allen radiation belt electron loss. Over 40 years ago it was suggested that loss caused by electron interaction with an electromagnetic plasma wave called plasmaspheric hiss dominates electron loss in the outer portion of the radiation belt that overlaps with a high density region called the plasmasphere. Motivated by the difficulty of observing this loss process with particle detectors on satellites, the Balloon Array for Radiation Belt Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) campaign was designed to observe bremsstrahlung x-rays generated by electrons colliding with atmospheric neutrals after removal from the radiation belts. By comparison of x-ray counts to magnetically conjugate plasmaspheric hiss observed on the Van Allen Probes we provide the first direct experimental verification that hiss removes electrons from the radiation belts. X-ray counts and hiss amplitude show similar variation on timescales ranging from minutes to hours. A surprising result is that 1–20 min period fluctuations of x-rays and hiss are coherent on scales comparable to the size of the plasmasphere, far exceeding the few km scale on which wave-particle interactions operate, and establishing that the loss process has global effects on the radiation belts.",

            "abstract": "The composition of anatectic melt extracted from the deep crust evolves during transport due to processes associated with melt–residuum separation and fractional crystallization. In the Cretaceous Fosdick migmatite–granite complex, P–T phase equilibria modeling of migmatitic paragneisses and orthogneisses, and the occurrence of leucosome-bearing normal-sense shear zones are consistent with suprasolidus conditions in the complex extending into the early stages of doming and exhumation. Sub-horizontal sheeted granites at shallower structural levels and variably oriented granites in networks at deeper structural levels within the complex commonly have coarse blocky plagioclase and/or K-feldspar grains within interstitial quartz, consistent with early crystallization of feldspar. The granites yield U–Pb zircon crystallization ages from 115 to 100 Ma, with a dominant grouping at 107–100 Ma, which corresponds to the timing of dome formation during regional oblique extension that facilitated exhumation of the complex. Whole rock Sr and Nd and zircon Hf and O isotope compositions are consistent with derivation from regionally-associated source materials. Although the major and trace element chemistry of these granites is highly variable, they typically have large positive Eu anomalies and correlated Rb/Sr/Ba covariation, features consistent with the early accumulation of feldspar and quartz and subsequent drainage of fractionated melt. The granites in networks are interpreted to represent clogging of magma transport channels through the middle crust by crystal accumulation as drainage of fractionating magma slowed during doming and exhumation. By contrast, the sheeted granites record collapse of sub-horizontal partially-crystallized layers of magma by filter pressing and drainage of melt during vertical shortening associated with doming. Processes that separate cumulates from evolved melt are likely to have been important in the evolution of granites in other migmatitic gneiss domes. Furthermore, since the evolved melt is expected to have higher concentrations of heat-producing elements, this study has significant implications for the tectonic history of large hot orogens, the cooling of UHT metamorphic terrains and the long-term stability of the continental crust.",

            "abstract": "Inland waters exchange sensible and latent heat with the overlying atmosphere in ways that are very different from the surrounding terrestrial landscape. Depending on the regional climate and lake characteristics, open-water evaporation from lakes can vary out of phase with terrestrial evapotranspiration within the watershed, and key atmospheric drivers are often different as well. Lake evaporation is a complex process that interacts with many aspects of a lake ecosystem, including water temperature, vertical mixing, lake chemistry, stratification, ice cover, and water levels. Although driven primarily by vapor pressure gradient and wind speed, evaporation is also an energy-consuming process. This leads not only to significant roles from net radiation, sensible heat flux, and other components of the surface energy budget, but it also results in important feedbacks on lake temperature, ice cover, and other evaporation-mediating processes. As such, defining the climatic variables that “drive” lake evaporation is far from straightforward and often depends on timescale, lake depth, and characteristics of the regional climate. In this study, we provide some insight into the problem by examining the energy budget of a variety of lakes across a range of climatic gradients and lake types. This includes shallow Arctic lakes, deep temperate lakes, and a hypersaline lake in a semi-arid climate. Our results reveal a wide range of evaporative response to climatic forcing, including some lakes that show counterintuitive effects or even opposite responses to those of other lakes. Although process-based, mechanistic models should be able to account for such complexities, these findings highlight the need for caution when interpreting climatic drivers of lake evaporation. It is not likely, for example, that models of a solely empirical or statistical nature would be sufficient to fully capture the physics and dynamics of evaporation, particularly in an ever-changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The conversion of rock to soil through weathering tends to reduce grain size [1] and prepares Earth’s surface for erosion processes to take hold. Warm, wet climatic conditions that lead to the formation of clays and weathering of bedrock clasts to sand might increase the transportability of the particles. For this reason, and potentially others, high weathering rates and high rates of erosion often go hand in hand. Here, we identify a potential process that mechanistically links highly weathered soil profiles with fine-grained particles at the surface – often formed during pre-Quaternary climate regimes – to decreased rates of fluvial incision. When bedrock type allows it, increased weathering in the hinterlands reduces the number and sizes of clasts to efficiently abrade the bed. What impact, then, does this previous climatic state have on the fluvial response times to uplift?\nWe test our ‘Tool-size Effect’ hypothesis in similar-sized tributaries in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory. Here, a series of well-defined knickpoints separate a relict, weathered landscape from a rejuvenated landscape downstream of the knickpoints. Knickpoint initiation results from Early Pliocene tilting of the platform that changed the base level ca. 600 m in <106y. Above the knickpoint, the soils are depleted of easily-weatherable minerals and the sand-bedded streams are graded to the former sea level. We tested the ability of the tool effect to account for different knickpoint propagation rates by ascribing different values of retreat efficiency to each knickpoint based on sediment grain size at each knickpoint lip and cosmogenic nuclide-derived mass fluxes in different grain fractions. We find that grain-size does impact the retreat velocity; the retreat rate with the smallest grain-size at the lip travels ca. half the speed of the stream with the coarsest particles. Knickpoint propagation has been slowing down with time at a rate faster than that predicted by the decrease in upstream drainage area. This mechanism explains the persistence of other high-elevation tropical landscapes with highly weathered soils. It also bears on the response of rivers to climate change and geomorphic hysteresis resulting from time-dependence of weathering processes. [1] Ruxton, B.P.; Berry, L. 1957.

            "abstract": "Ecological disturbances alter biogeochemical processes central to forest carbon (C) storage. Disturbances to forests occur along a continuum of severity, from low intensity disturbance causing the mortality of only a subset of trees to severe stand-replacing disturbance that kills all trees; yet, considerable uncertainty exists in how and why the forest C cycle changes across gradients of disturbance intensity, and whether ecosystem models robustly simulate these responses.\nAt the University of Michigan Biological Station, we are using multiple ecosystem-scale experiments to examine how disturbance intensity affects C cycling and to identify the underlying mechanisms that support recovery of the C cycle. The Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment (FASET), in which a third of all canopy trees were stem girdled within a 39 ha area, employs C cycling measurements within paired treatment and control meteorological flux tower footprints. A separate study examines forest C cycling following stand-replacing clear-cut harvest and fire.\nWe found that net ecosystem production (NEP) was highly resilient following moderate disturbance, but experienced long-term reductions following stand-replacing disturbance. Using a gradient of disturbance severity within the FASET treatment, we found that forest production declined non-linearly with rising disturbance intensity, remaining stable until a threshold of ~60 % tree mortality was exceeded. NEP was sustained following moderate disturbance because of improved canopy light-use efficiency, which compensated for a temporary reduction in leaf area index. Contrastingly, NEP was reduced for several decades at the highest levels of disturbance severity. A model assessment revealed that neither big-leaf nor gap models captured the observed high resilience in NEP following low intensity disturbance, suggesting inadequate representation of the mechanisms supporting C cycling resilience.",

However, current evidence is mainly derived from high-latitude ecosystems, with little known about high-altitude ecosystems. In this study, we examined permafrost carbon-climate feedback in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau from the following three aspects. First, we evaluated soil carbon stock in the top 3 meter by conducting a large-scale soil survey across the study area during the summer of 2013-2014. We found that Tibetan grassland soils store 10.4 Pg C in the upper 3 meter, ~40% larger than previous estimation in the top 1 meter. Second, we examined large-scale patterns of temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition in alpine ecosystems by conducting laboratory incubation experiments, and found that greater temperature sensitivity occurred in those soils with more recalcitrant components. Third, we explored the responses of carbon cycling processes in alpine grasslands to climate warming by conducting OTC experiments. We found that experimental warming stimulated ecosystem respiration, but also increased gross primary production, and thus led to the net carbon accumulation. Overall, these three lines of evidence demonstrate that carbon cycle in high-altitude ecosystems is very sensitive to climate warming.",

There are two sources of uncertainty. One is from the physically based watershed sediment yield model due to spatial variation in the watershed terrain slopes. The other is from the use of long-range episodic rainfall time series data. The work finds the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method as more mathematically robust compared with the traditional optimization based Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method for prediction of sediment yield fraction estimate uncertainty. Thereby, the work attempts to close the existing gap in research in this area of uncertainty comparison. The link between Markov Chain rainfall time series and the Bayesian MCMC simulation model is established using an erosion process parameter that promotes uncertainty in the statistical soil yield fraction estimates. The research hypothesis was tested using physical and statistical computational models in soil erosion and geostatistics with the use of rain gauge data and soil biogeochemical properties.\n ",

            "abstract": "Subduction forearcs are critically organized systems whose metastable state is governed by the configuration of boundary stresses and the internal distribution of fluid-pressure in pore/fracture space. In particular, seismogenic megathrusts lying within subduction interface shear zones (SISZ) appear overpressured to near-lithostatic values (i.e. λv = Pf/σv → 1.0) with substantial fluid repositories (<4% porosity) likely in tabular zones of non-volcanic tremor (NVT) defining the base of some megathrusts. Containment of overpressure is precarious because activation of brittle fault-fracture systems allows escape of overpressured fluids. This leads to a critical interdependence of differential stress and fluid-overpressure with overpressures more easily sustained in compressional as opposed to extensional stress regimes. Overpressures within SISZ are thus susceptible to abrupt stress changes and subsidiary fracturing that may occur locally around rupture heterogeneities or, on a broader scale, when total shear stress relief and stress field switching occurs along a megathrust, as occurred during the 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Massive fluid loss from a SISZ following megathrust rupture has been inferred from observed changes in the velocity structure of a fore-arc hangingwall. Paleodischarge sites in subduction fore-arcs exists in the form of diapiric roots to mud volcanoes and hydrothermal vein swarms. In some exhumed forearcs, extensive belts of Au-Quartz mineralization (orogenic gold) are plausibly related to episodic fluid redistribution from the subduction interface. Fluid loss from SISZ locally raises frictional strength along the megathrust, forming strength asperities. Subsequent failure of such ‘drainage asperities’ is then governed by the reaccumulation of fluid overpressure as well as shear stress within the SISZ. Populations of drainage asperities at various stages of overpressure restoration are likely along subduction interfaces.",

The resulting metamorphic/plutonic basement complex is disrupted by conjugate, mutually cross-cutting sets of brittle, late-orogenic strike-slip faults. Dextral strike-slip faults (separations < 25 km) strike NE-NNE, while conjugate sinistral faults strike SE-SSE, defining a wrench regime (σv = σ2) with horizontal maximum compression, σ1, trending c. 100°. The strike-slip faults are recessive except in dilational sites where upwelling hydrothermal fluids have silicified the cataclastic shear zones (CSZ) which protrude as blade-like ridges extending for kilometres across the semi-arid terrain. The mineralized fault segments include sinuous releasing bends where the fault trace is deflected <10° as well as more abrupt dilational stepovers with distributed extension fracturing linking en echelon fault segments. Other components of structural permeability include: (1) innumerable fault-parallel quartz-veins (cm to m thickness) within the CSZ; (2) irregular stringer veins; and (3) a regional set of predominantly extensional, subvertical planar quartz veins oriented 080-120° at moderate angles to the main faults. Broad contemporaneity is indicated by mutual cross-cutting relationships between all structural components. Measured strike separations along shear fractures are consistent with seismic slip increments which refreshed fracture permeability and promoted hydrothermal flow. Textures suggest the faults were exhumed from epithermal boiling environments (<1-2 km depth). Restoration of fault cohesive strength by hydrothermal cementation was critical in allowing continued vein formation by hydraulic extension fracturing. The distribution of hydrothermal quartz within the fault system provides a guide to structural localization of upflow zones in geothermal fields developed along strike-slip faults.",

            "abstract": "The identification of dust provenance and its characteristics is a key issue to understand climate, atmospheric and environmental changes, and provides key constraints to dust transport processes. Many traditional geochemical methods for dust source tracking are not relevant in Antarctic ice cores because of their extremely low dust content, spanning from a few ppb during warm interglacial periods to a few hundreds of ppb, in the case of relatively dustier glacial periods. For the same reason, the Sr-Nd-Pb radiogenic isotope composition of mineral dust in ice cores, that is the most widely-used technique for dust source fingerprint has intrinsic limitations related to dust abundance that drastically limit the temporal information one can achieve. Rock-magnetic properties of aerosol dust, instead, can be measured directly in small ice samples despite its very low concentration. Intensity of isothermal remanent magnetization and coercivity of magnetic minerals are directly related to that of insoluble dust and these magnetic properties are informative of the dust provenance areas. We investigated rock-magnetic properties of aerosol dust in Antartic ice older than M.I.S. 6 in EPiCA Dome-C and Vostok ice core to gather information on dust provenance prior to the last interglacial times. New and previously published results from rock-magnetism suggests that aerosol dust provenance has changed in time during subsequent glacial-interglacial climatic stages. Moreover parallel changes in Dome-C and Vostok sites suggest that such changes result from long-distance dust transportation implying that transportation paths and/or dust sources did not remained the same during the last few glacial-interglacial cycles.",

            "abstract": "Mountain glaciers show a high sensitivity to changes in climate forcing. In a global perspective, their anticipated retreat will pose far-reaching challenges to the management of fresh water resources and will raise sea levels significantly within only a few decades. Different model frameworks have been applied to simulate melt water contributions of glaciers outside the two ice sheets for the recent IPCC report. However, these models depend on strongly simplified, and often empirical descriptions of the driving processes hampering the reliability of the results. Thus, a transition from the physically-based mass balance-ice flow models developed for single glaciers to the application at the global scale is urgently needed. The challenges are manifold but can be tackled with the new data sets, methods and process-understanding that have emerged during the last years.\nHere, we present a novel glacier model for calculating the response of surface mass balance and 3D glacier geometry for each individual glacier around the globe. Our approach accounts for feedbacks due to glacier retreat and includes models for mass loss due to frontal ablation and refreezing of water in the snow/firn. This allows the calculation of the components of proglacial runoff for each individual glacier in a process-based way. The current surface geometry and thickness distribution for each of the world’s roughly 200’000 glaciers is extracted from the Randolph Glacier Inventory v3.3 and terrain models. Our simulations are driven with 14 Global Circulation Models from the CMIP5 project using the RCP4.5, RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios.\nWe focus on the timing of peak water from glacierized catchments in all climatic regions of the earth and the corresponding importance of these regime changes on hydrological stress. Peak water represents a crucial tipping point for sustained water supply even for regions with only a minor glacier coverage, and is relevant to the dynamics of sea level rise. The maximum rate of water release from glacial storage is subject to a high spatio-temporal variability depending on the glacier-specific geometry and its transient response to climatic change.",

The alkaline complex is composed of shoshonitic to ultrapotassic gabbro, pyroxene syenite, amphibole syenite, quartz syenite, and granite. Field researches suggest that the mafic rocks are earlier than the felsic ones in sequence. LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb dating on them gives Late Triassic ages of 214 ± 2 to 200 ± 3 Ma from mafic to felsic rocks. These ages are a bit younger than Late Triassic ages for partial melting of the Sulu UHP terrane during exhumation, indicating syn-exhumation magmatism during continental collision. The alkaline rocks have wide ranges of SiO2 (49.7 – 76.7 wt.%), MgO (8.25 – 0.03 wt.%),total Fe2O3 (9.23 – 0.47 wt.%), CaO (8.39 – 0.39 wt.%), Ni (126.0 – 0.07 ppm), and Cr (182.0 – 0.45 ppm) contents. Other major oxides are regularly changed with SiO2. The alkaline rocks have characteristics of arc-like patterns in the trace element distribution, e.g., enrichment of LREE and LILE (Rb, Ba, Th and U), depletion of HFSE (Nb, Ta, P and Ti), and positive Pb anomalies. From the mafic to felsic rocks, (La/Yb)N ratios and contents of the total REE, Sr and Ba are decreased but Rb contents are increased. The alkaline rocks also display features of A2-type granitoids, suggesting a post-collisional magmatism. They have high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70575 and 0.70927) and negative εNd(t) values (-18.6 to -15.0) for whole-rock. The homogeneous initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios and εNd(t) values of the alkaline rocks are almost unchanged with SiO2 and MgO contents, suggesting a fractional crystallization (FC) process from a same parental magma. Our studies suggest a series of crust-mantle interaction processes along the continental subduction interface as follows: (1) melts from partial melting of the subducted continental crust during its exhumation metasomatized the overlying mantle wedge; (2) partial melting of the enriched lithospheric mantle generated the Late Triassic alkaline complex; and (3) the alkaline magma was successively experienced crystal fractionation mainly dominated by olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and alkali feldspar.",

            "abstract": "The stream power law commonly used to parameterize bedrock incision by mountain channels predicts that rainfall directly controls the rate of erosion and thus landform evolution. We have shown that cyclic variations in rainfall may induce a measurable response from erosional systems that is delayed by a time lag that depends on the forcing period. Here we will generalize this result using a simple landscape evolution model over a wide range of forcing periods to infer the potential erosional response of active tectonic systems to rainfall variability. In particular, we will show that each orogenic system is characterized by a response time scale that can be defined from its height and mean rock uplift rate. When the climate forcing period is much shorter than the response time of the orogenic system, the erosional response is amplified by a factor m, the area exponent in the stream power law, and in phase with the forcing signal (the time lag is nil). To the contrary, when the climate forcing period is longer than the response time of the orogen, the erosional signal is nil. This is what we show in the accompanying diagram where the time lag, θ, (normalized by the forcing period, P) and the gain, G, (relative amplitude of the erosional response normalized by the relative amplitude of the climate forcing) are plotted as a function of the climate forcing period normalized by the response time scale (τ). The time lags are the results of erosional waves propagating upstream at a rate that is independent of channel length, insuring that all rivers in a mountain belt respond in phase with each other and therefore constructively contribute to the overall sedimentary flux. Our work demonstrates that before interrogating the geological record to find evidence for climate control on erosional systems and, a fortiori, on tectonic systems, one needs to carefully consider the period (or the rate) at which the climate has changed. One must also consider that, when that response is measurable, there might exist an important time lag between the climate signal and the erosional response. We will also show how climate variability affects the sediment transport capacity of rivers and the effect this has on the relationship between climate and erosion in active mountain belts.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the changes in Himalayan glaciers is of importance for assessment of the future water availability and detection of anthropogenic greenhouse effect related trends. Terrain of eastern Himalayan glaciers is harder in comparison to western and central Himalayas. For this reason long term field based measurements are not available for the glaciers of this region. Hence a glacier from Sikkim has been studied using off-field methods. Volume, area, mass balance, glacial melt and runoff for the East Rathong glacier have been estimated for the time period 1963-2011. It has been observed that the glacier is summer-accumulation type. Time series analysis has been done for the annual mass balance. Annual mass balance of the glacier is showing statistically significant negative trend and shift. Cumulative net mass balance suggests that the glacier has lost ~11 m. w. e. during last 48 years. Runoff from the glacier has increased by ~30% in the present decade in comparison to the runoff observed in 1960s. The glacier has lost ~20% of its volume from 1962 to 2013. MERRA (Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications) temperature satellite data, MODIS Terra Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data and water balance data from Hydrological information system for Sikkim region were analyzed. The temperature of Sikkim at an altitude of 5 kms has increased by 0.7 K during 1979-2011, AOD has shown a % change over mean of +14.42% during 2001–2012, and water yield of the region has shown a % change over mean of -46.77% during 1971-2005. The results suggest that it is important to understand aerosols-cloud interaction and their impact on precipitation and glacier-melt patterns over Himalayan region, regions dependent for their water needs on eastern Himalayan glaciers will soon have to adapt to use of scarce water resources, river flow reduction would come sooner as glacier area and volume are reduced more rapidly due to increasing air pollution, better predictive tools for factors affecting glacier melt rates are urgently needed for planning for climate change adaptation.\nThe presentation will link the changing regional climate of Sikkim to the changing area and volume of the glaciers and the hydrology of the region. The results of our work can be used by hydrological modelers to predict the future water availability of the region.",

            "abstract": "The societal needs for understanding ecosystems response to environmental perturbation have never been greater. Most research on the mechanisms that regulate long-term changes in water quality is based either on individual well-studied catchments, or regional monitoring datasets. While the advantage of research catchments often is the large amount of ancillary information that can provide mechanistic explanations, the results are often difficult to extrapolate because of limited statistical and geographic representation. Conversely, environmental monitoring sites often lack the process-based designed data collection, which instead makes it difficult to infer causal relationships. Here I will discuss the value of field research infrastructures sites that combine the best of long-term monitoring time-series with the exclusivity of process-based research infrastructures across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The basis for this presentation will be on the Krycklan Catchment Study (\nwww.slu.se/Krycklan\n) located in northern Sweden that provides a unique field experimental platform for hillslope to landscape-scale research on long-term ecosystem dynamics in the boreal landscape. The site is designed for processes-based research needed to assess the role of external drivers such as forest management, climate change, and long-range transport of pollutants on forests, mires, soils, streams, lakes and groundwater. In my presentation I will discuss some examples of how Krycklan has succeeded to construct a state-of-the-art field infrastructure for experimental and hypothesis driven research, maintain the long-term climatic, biogeochemical, hydrological and environmental data collection of highest quality, and how this has supported the development of new models and guidelines for research, policy and management.",

            "abstract": "A family of physics-based models designed to explain emergent, bandlimited, “tremor-like” seismograms shed light onto subglacial and englacial conditions. We consider two such models. In the first, a water-filled fracture hosts resonant modes; the seismically observable quality factor and characteristic frequency of these modes constrain the fracture length and aperture. In the second model, seismicity is generated by repeating stick-slip events on a fault patch (portion of the glacier bed) with sliding described by rate- and state-dependent friction laws. Wave propagation phenomena may additionally generate bandlimited seismic signals.\nThese models make distinct predictions that may be used to address questions of glaciological concern. Laboratory friction experiments show that small, repeating earthquakes most likely occur at the ice-till interface and at conditions below the pressure melting point. These laboratory friction values, when combined with observed ice surface velocities, may also be used to constrain basal pore pressure. In contrast, seismic signals indicative of water-filled basal fractures suggest that, at least locally, temperatures are above the pressure melting point.\n\nWe present a simple diagnostic test between these two processes that concerns the relationship between the multiple seismic spectral peaks generated by each process. Whereas repeating earthquakes generate evenly spaced spectral peaks through the Dirac comb effect, hydraulic fracture resonance, as a result of dispersive propagation of waves along the crack, generates spectral peaks that are not evenly spaced.",

            "abstract": "The Late Paleocene epoch marked a substantial change in the tectonic regime of the North Atlantic and the Arctic: after a rapid continental break-up new oceanic crust formed in several basins along the Eurasian, Greenland and North American margins. In the Northeast Atlantic small oceanic basins developed between large land masses, microcontinents and transform faults (like the Norwegian and Greenland basins which were isolated from the Eurasia basin to the north and the Irminger and Iceland basins to the south) that hindered the formation of deep oceanic currents. The most significant change in the tectonic configuration of this region that profoundly modified the oceanic paleocurrent patterns and subsequently the global climate was the (middle) Miocene opening of the Fram Strait.\nHere we present a series of paleobathymetric reconstructions of the North Atlantic and the Arctic using a detailed and updated kinematic model and published sediment thickness information. The kinematic model was constructed based on available geophysical data (mainly magnetic and gravity anomalies) and was combined with thermal subsidence models for calculating the paleodepth of various basins and ridges through time. Our models suggest that the Fram Strait evolved from a narrow strait in early Mid Miocene (ca. 50 km wide and more than 2000 m deep) to a wider and deeper gateway after 10 Ma (about 100 km wide and more than 3500 m deep). The proximity of continental margins and the presence of shallow continental blocks and volcanic plateaus complicated the architecture of this oceanic gateway. The implications of these changes for the formation of deep-water circulation between the North Atlantic and the Arctic regions are discussed and possible paleooceanographic scenarios are proposed.",

            "abstract": "Passive margins are first order strength contrasts between ocean and continents, and they may therefore play a critical role in steering the propagation direction of STEPs. Subduction history potentially is also relevant because it is a decisive factor for the forces that drive continued subduction. In this study we explore these factors with mechanical models.\nResults show that a STEP will follow a passive margin as long as variations in strike remain within 20 degrees. A change in strike of the passive margin ahead of the STEP of less than 15 degrees results in propagation along the passive margin. If the change in strike of the margin is greater than 15 degrees, the STEP will propagate into the direction that it had before reaching the change in margin strike. Surprisingly, subduction history and strength contrast are less relevant.\nThe results shed light on the evolution of the Calabrian arc (central Mediterranean) after the Miocene: slab rollback towards the ESE was facilitated by a roughly W-E oriented STEP that followed the Africa-Ionian passive margin along the north coast of Sicily. The geology of NE Sicily suggests that this passive margin changed orientation here and was parallel to the present-day Sisifo fault. Given that this corresponds to a moderate orientation change, the active STEP continued to follow the margin. The next orientation change of the passive margin, to the one that is bounded by the Malta Escarpment, was approximately 50 degrees. Based on our model results, we therefore predict that the STEP propagated into the Ionian basin in a direction that was approximately parallel to the Sisifo fault. Interestingly, the predicted location of the present-day STEP fault in the basement at the SW termination of the Calabrian trench appears to correspond with a significant discontinuity within the accretionary wedge.",

            "abstract": "Establishment of a constitutive law from friction to high-temperature plastic flow has long been a task for solving problems such as modeling earthquakes and plate interactions. Here we propose an empirical constitutive law that describes this transitional behavior using only friction and flow parameters, with good agreements with experimental data on halite shear zones. The law predicts a complete spectrum of steady-state and transient behaviors, including the dependence of the shear resistance of a fault on slip rate, effective normal stress and temperature. The law predicts a change in velocity-weakening to velocity-strengthening with increasing temperature, very similar to the change recognized for granite under hydrothermal conditions. It is surprising that a slight deviation from the steady-state friction law due to the involvement of plastic deformation can cause a large change in the velocity dependence. We solved seismic cycles of a fault across the lithosphere with the friction to flow law using a 2D spectral boundary integral equation method, revealing dynamic rupture extending into the aseismic zone and very rich evolution of interseismic creep including slow slip prior to earthquakes. Seismic slip followed by creep is consistent with natural pseudotachylytes overprinted with mylonitic deformation. Our friction-to-flow law merges “Christmas-tree” strength profiles of the lithosphere and rate-dependency fault models used for earthquake modeling on a unified basis. Conventionally strength profiles were drawn assuming a strain rate for the flow regime, but we emphasize that stress distribution evolves reflecting the fault behavior. A fault-zone model was updated based on the earthquake modeling.",

Thus GRACE is well suited for identifying hydrological droughts, when total water storage is low. The potential for GRACE to contribute to global drought monitoring is clear, but first it is necessary to overcome GRACE’s low spatial and temporal resolutions (relative to other hydrological observations) and data latency. To do so we synthesize GRACE data with other ground and space based meteorological observations within a sophisticated numerical model of land surface water and energy processes. The resulting high resolution, near real-time fields of soil moisture and groundwater storage variations are then used to generate drought indicator maps. Since 2011, such maps have been produced on a weekly basis for the continental U.S., disseminated through the University of Nebraska’s National Drought Mitigation Center website, and incorporated into the U.S. and North American Drought Monitors. Expansion of these GRACE-based drought indicators to the global scale is ongoing and is expect to be completed over the next 12-18 months.",

The initial orbits will be 12 RE geocentric radius by 1200 km altitude at 28˚ inclination, maneuvered into a resizable tetrahedral formation that will pass through the persistent sites of magnetic reconnection nearest to Earth. The Observatories, each with suite of instruments, underwent thermal vacuum testing serially beginning in late Nov 2013, with the final testing completed in July 2014. Pre-Shipment Review was held in late October 2014 prior to shipment of stacked pairs of Observatories to the launch processing site at KSC (Astrotech). They are now being processed in stacked pairs, pending full stacking as a constellation and installation on the Atlas V - Series 421 launch vehicle that will carry them into orbit. Final propulsion functional testing and launch rehearsal operations will be conducted this month. The Science and Engineering Team is preparing for commissioning and early operations immediately after launch by executing Mission Readiness Tests (MRTs) to exercise all systems including the “Scientist In The Loop” or SITL system that will provide human oversight of the prioritization of high resolution data segments for downloading to the ground. The Theory and Modeling team and three Interdisciplinary Science teams continue to develop virtual spacecraft data sets and displays as an aid to identification of features of interest during operations. Phase 1 operations will probe the dayside low latitude reconnection features, beginning in August 2015, as the constellation moves into the afternoon local time sector.

In this experiment,the East China Sea common algae- Karenia mikimotoi as research object,different pH effects on the physiological state have been studied. The results showed that pH significantly affect the growth of algae Karenia mikimotoi, nutrient absorption, chlorophyll, photosynthetic rate and affinity for inorganic carbon. When pH = 6.2, the cell growth was inhibited.Growth rate, nutrient absorption, maximum photosynthetic rate and affinity for inorganic carbon are the lowest; When pH = 8.2, the growth of cells ,absorption of nutrients and highest maximum photosynthetic rate are the fastest; pH = 7.2 and 9.2, the algal cells can still maintain higher growth and higher affinity for inorganic carbon is larger than those in pH = 8.2. In short, high or low pH stress can cause adverse changes in the physiological state of the algae Karenia mikimotoi, especially when the pH is too low.",

            "abstract": "The morphology of aerosol particles impacts their formation, reactivity, and interactions with light and clouds. We have investigated phase separation in aerosol particles composed organic compounds and ammonium sulfate using optical microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Phase separation can occur as water is evaporated from particles due to salting out of the organic component by ammonium sulfate. In previous studies, we have observed that certain submicron particles have a size-dependent morphology in which large particles are phase separated and small particles (less than approximately 200 nm) are homogeneous. In this talk, we will probe the origins of the size dependent behavior and the phase separation process. In particular, we have investigated model phase separating systems to explore the origins of the size dependence. To determine the mechanism of phase separation of organic compounds with ammonium sulfate, we have investigated the phase separation behavior of numerous compounds of different molecular architectures with the same O:C ratio. We will comment on the impact of our results on understanding salting out of organic compounds and the size dependence of particle morphology.",

            "abstract": "Changes in high-latitude sea-ice cover play an important role in many hypotheses regarding the cause of millennial-scale climate variability, mechanisms to impact global climate, and to explain the rapid return from stadial to interstadial conditions. However, clear proxy evidence for a response of high-latitude sea-ice cover to millennial-scale climate variability is, with a few exceptions, lacking. Here I present a novel record of millennial-scale climate variability and sea-ice cover in the Labrador Sea for the last 65 ka. Using the abundance of the sea-ice biomarker IP25, I show that during the early glacial (65-60 ka) sea-ice was absent from the core location, in-line with the present-day situation. As climate cooled, sea ice occasionally influenced the study site. During the LGM sea-ice cover expanded and the sea-ice margin was located close to the core site as shown by the high concentration of IP25. However, the record fails to demonstrate a direct response of sea-ice cover to Heinrich Events, which were clearly identified in the record by a high concentration of ice-rafted debris from the Hudson area. For example, sea-ice cover appears to have retreated during H2 and expanded directly afterwards, opposite to what is expected. These results demonstrate that at least in the Labrador Sea, sea-ice appears insensitive to millennial-scale climate variability, questioning our fundamental understanding of an important component of the climate system and its role in explaining the mechanisms that cause millennial-scale climate variability.",

            "abstract": "Fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) provides thermal data through space and time along linear cables. When installed along a streambed, FO-DTS can capture the influence of upwelling groundwater (GW) as thermal anomalies. The planning of labor-intensive physical measurements can make use of FO-DTS data to target areas of focused GW discharge that can disproportionately affect surface-water (SW) quality and temperature. Typical longitudinal FO-DTS spatial resolution ranges 0.25 to1.0 m, and cannot resolve small-scale water-column mixing or sub-surface diurnal fluctuations. However, configurations where the cable is wrapped around rods can improve the effective vertical resolution to sub-centimeter scales, and the pipes can be actively heated to induce a thermal tracer. Longitudinal streambed and high-resolution vertical arrays were deployed at the upper Delaware River (PA, USA) and the Quashnet River (MA, USA) for aquatic habitat studies. The resultant datasets exemplify the varied uses of FO-DTS. Cold anomalies found along the Delaware River steambed coincide with zones of known mussel populations, and high-resolution vertical array data showed relatively stable in-channel thermal refugia. Cold anomalies at the Quashnet River identified in 2013 were found to persist in 2014, and seepage measurements and water samples at these locations showed high GW flux with distinctive chemistry. Cable location is paramount to seepage identification, particularly in faster flowing deep streams such as the Quashnet and Delaware Rivers where steambed FO-DTS identified many seepage zones with no surface expression. The temporal characterization of seepage dynamics are unique to FO-DTS. However, data from Tidmarsh Farms, a cranberry bog restoration site in MA, USA indicate that in slower flowing shallow steams GW inflow affects surface temperature; therefore infrared imaging can provide seepage location information similar to FO-DTS with substantially less effort.",

            "abstract": "During a long duration solar flare, a hot plasma sheet is commonly formed above the flare loops. Often produced within this sheet are down-flowing voids referred to as supra-arcade downflows, thought to be the products of a patchy reconnection process. Models differ on the question of whether the downflows should be hotter than the surrounding plasma or not. We use imaging data from Hinode/XRT and SDO/AIA to determine the thermal structure of the plasma sheet and downflows. We find that the temperatures of the plasma within the downflows are either roughly the same as or lower than the surrounding fan plasma. This result implies that a mechanism for forming the voids that involves a sunward directed hydrodynamic shock pattern combined with perpendicular magnetic shock is unlikely. Additionally, we use the high cadence AIA data to trace the velocity fields in these regions through the use of a local correlation tracking algorithm. Through these measurements, we can determine areas of diverging velocity fields, as well as velocity shear fields and correlate them with temperature changes in order to understand the heating mechanisms in the plasma sheet.\nThis work is supported by under contract SP02H1701R from Lockheed-Martin to SAO, contract NNM07AB07C from NASA to SAO and NASA grant numbers NNX13AG54G and NNX14AD43G",

            "abstract": "Supercooled mixed-phase cloud decks are common in the Arctic, often persisting for days. Individual ice crystals in such clouds have relatively short lifetimes, typically an hour or less. Thus new ice crystals must be generated continuously in such long-lived cloud layers. Field campaigns investigating the microphysics of the simplest such clouds—unseeded single-layer cases in coupled or decoupled boundary layers—have aimed to measure the background ice nuclei (IN) required to initiate ice formation processes, specifically by measuring the concentration of IN above cloud top that are active at water saturation at cloud-top temperature. In previous detailed simulations of observed case studies, we demonstrated that if all ambient IN are assumed to be activated rapidly, and if there is no surface source of IN over pack ice or efficient multiplication process in the absence of riming, as commonly assumed, then overlying IN concentrations must exceed those of in-cloud ice crystals by a factor of order 10–100 or more, generally much higher than measured. However, under such conditions, entrainment and rapid activation quickly achieve a long-lived quasi-steady cloud microphysical state in simulations that seems consistent with that commonly observed. These previous studies made the assumption that all relevant IN have a lifetime of roughly one second at water saturation under cloud-top conditions, using a singular ice nucleation scheme. Here we investigate the behavior of the same cloud systems in the presence of IN with longer activation time scales, including those only available in the contact mode and those with a wider range of lifetimes under in-cloud conditions. We make a range of assumptions about IN properties to constrain ice nucleation schemes to the degree possible using field data. When ice crystals are primarily sustained by slowly activated IN, we find that the relative depletion rate of the boundary-layer reservoir of IN impacts the degree of quasi-steady behavior.",

            "abstract": "On April 1st, 2014, Northern Chile, was struck by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake near the city of Iquique following a protracted series of foreshocks. The earthquake occurred within a seismic gap left behind by two great earthquakes devastating the northern Chilean and southern Peruvian coast about 140 years ago in 1868 and 1877. This segment, about 500 km long, was the only one along the Chilean subduction zone that has not ruptured within the last century. The Integrated Plate boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) monitored the entire sequence of events, providing unprecedented resolution of the build-up to the main event and its rupture evolution.\nWe analyzed the entire seismicity in this section of the subduction zone since 2007. The offshore rupture region of the Iquique event has been more or less continuously seismically active within our observation period. This is in contrast to the segments to the north and south, which are still unruptured and seismically quiet. Starting in July 2013, three foreshock clusters with increasingly larger magnitudes occurred within the future rupture area. The largest Mw 6.7 foreshock, two weeks before the mainshock, had a source mechanism distinctively different from the mainshock and with a centroid depth of only 9 km probably occurred in the upper plate. The Iquique mainshock initiated then at the northern end of the foreshock zone, inside a region of intermediate interseismic locking. Comparing the foreshock distribution to the long term deformation history of the margin, we find that the area exhibits a high gradient of locking from weakly locked updip to fully locked downdip.\nMapping the b-value of the foreshocks indicates significantly lower b-values in the source area compared to all other regions where the b-value can be resolved. Importantly, a gradual drop of the b-value from about 0.75 to below 0.6 is observed in the source region within the three years before the Iquique earthquake. This has only been reversed within the last days of the foreshock sequence. We conclude that gradual weakening of the central part of the seismic gap accentuated by the foreshock activity in a zone of intermediate seismic coupling was instrumental in causing final failure.",

In contrast to the all-sky FPI design used in the polar region by Conde and colleagues, these FPIs are narrow-field instruments that utilize a SkyScanner to observe in a series of directions over a region 500-800 km in diameter. The sensitivity of these instruments has increased dramatically over older FPIs, allowing new and interesting phenomena to be investigated. When two or more FPIs are utilized, different observing strategies may then offer advantages regarding the ability to study the thermospheric-ionosphere system response over small and large scale sizes that can not be achieved by a single FPI observatory. Examples of results obtained by the North American Thermospheric and Ionospheric Observing Network (NATION), the five FPIs operating in South America, and the three FPIs observing in Alaska will illustrate the system science advantages provided by such networks.",

On the other hand, land use is also strongly influenced by climate changes due to the primarily rain-fed agriculture in this region and the relatively low capacity to adapt. It is therefore important that projections for future climate changes or land use changes account for the impact of the feedback between land use and climate. Land use influences regional climate through several different pathways, including changes in surface biogeophysical properties (e.g., surface albedo, Bowen ratio, surface roughness) that have been widely studied, and changes in the dynamic properties of the land surface influencing dust emission. The relative importance of these two pathways is likely to be model dependent and region dependent. In this study the effects of these two pathways will be evaluated and compared, based on results from a modeling framework that includes a regional climate-vegetation model, a crop growth model, an agricultural economics model, and a land use allocation model. This will be conducted in the context of future land use and climate change projections, with the ultimate objective to assess how agricultural land use in West Africa may change driven by climate and socioeconomic changes, and how the resulting land use change may further modify regional climate in the future.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation feedback plays an important role in regional and global climate variability at various time scales, ranging from seasonal to multi-decadal. Its impact is especially pronounced in regions of strong land-atmosphere coupling. Climate predictions in these regions should therefore account for the role of interactive vegetation. This can be accomplished through including a predictive phenology scheme for seasonal predictions and including a dynamic vegetation model for decadal or longer time scale predictions. At the seasonal time scale, plant phenology responds to hydro-meteorological anomalies, and the resulting anomalies in vegetation density then modify the severity and persistence of regional climate anomalies. At the decadal and longer time scales, changes in regional climate lead to changes of vegetation distribution and structure, which feed back to further change the regional climate. The direction and magnitude of the impact attributable to vegetation feedback are likely region dependent and model dependent. Using a regional climate model (RegCM4.3.4) coupled with the NCAR community land model (CLM4/4.5) including a carbon-nitrogen model (CN) and a dynamic vegetation model (DV), this study demonstrates how vegetation feedback may influence climate predictions at different time scales. North America and West Africa are chosen as the geographic focus due to strong land-atmosphere coupling in these regions.",

            "abstract": "A strikingly fast decrease of Arctic sea-ice cover has been recorded for the instrumental period and attributed to anthropogenic climate change, but little is known about natural sea-ice variability. Hence, there is a need for longer sea-ice time series to establish a baseline for natural Arctic sea-ice variability.\nWe compiled 119 proxy-based sea-ice reconstructions from the Arctic Ocean and subarctic marginal seas to evaluate the stability/variability of sea-ice cover during the Holocene. The reconstructions are primarily based on published data combined with some yet-unpublished records of biological (diatoms, dinocysts, foraminifera, ostracods), sedimentological (IRD), and biogeochemical (IP25, PIP25) sea-ice indicators. Each indicator and record has been interpreted independently. We present all data as long-term annual means (months of sea ice per year). Sea-ice reconstructions are grouped into these classes: perennial (11-12 month/yr), dense (6-10 m/yr), common (1-6 m/yr), occasional (0.1-1 m/yr), rare (almost never) and absent (never). Further, reconstructions are made for the time slices 0-2 cal. ka (BP), 2-4 ka, 4-6 ka, 6±0.5 ka, 6-8 ka and 8-10 ka.\nOur study shows that winter sea ice was present during the entire Holocene, but summer sea ice may have been somewhat reduced in some areas during the Holocene Climate Optimum (10-6 ka), with variations between basins. In the Nordic Seas and N Atlantic minimum sea-ice conditions are seen 10-6 ka, whereas in the eastern Labrador Sea minimum sea-ice occurred 6-4 ka. Since ~4 ka sea-ice cover has increased, especially in the most recent millennia. Changes are subtle, however, but nonetheless consistent. The Pacific sector of the Arctic (Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, Laptev, Okhotsk seas) show less variability during the Holocene, though it is noted that these records have poorer age control and resolution than those from the Atlantic sector.\nOur proxy data interpretations have been used to constrain model output using data assimilation in the LOVECLIM model, focusing on the period 6±0.5 ka. This period of warmer than present summer conditions can help to understand the dynamics of the system in a warmer world. As expected, data assimilation leads to an overall better agreement with the reconstructions, mainly because of changes in the simulated wind patterns.",

            "abstract": "Computational thermodynamics (CT) represents a collection of numerical techniques that are used to calculate quantitative results from thermodynamic theory. In the Earth sciences, CT is most often applied to estimate the equilibrium properties of solutions, to calculate phase equilibria from models of the thermodynamic properties of materials, and to approximate irreversible reaction pathways by modeling these as a series of local equilibrium steps. The thermodynamic models that underlie CT calculations relate the energy of a phase to temperature, pressure and composition. These relationships are not intuitive and they are seldom well constrained by experimental data; often, intuition must be applied to generate a robust model that satisfies the expectations of use. As a consequence of this situation, the models and databases the support CT applications in geochemistry and petrology are tedious to maintain as new data and observations arise. What is required to make the process more streamlined and responsive is a computational framework that permits the rapid generation of observable outcomes from the underlying data/model collections, and importantly, the ability to update and re-parameterize the constitutive models through direct manipulation of those outcomes. CT procedures that take models/data to the experiential reference frame of phase equilibria involve function minimization, gradient evaluation, the calculation of implicit lines, curves and surfaces, contour extraction, and other related geometrical measures. All these procedures are the mainstay of image processing analysis. Since the commercial escalation of video game technology, open source image processing libraries have emerged (e.g., VTK) that permit real time manipulation and analysis of images. These tools find immediate application to CT calculations of phase equilibria by permitting rapid calculation and real time feedback between model outcome and the underlying model parameters.",

CT is the basis for the construction of phase diagrams, the application of geothermometers and geobarometers, the equilibrium speciation of solutions, the construction of pseudosections, calculations of mass transfer between minerals, melts and fluids, and, it provides a means of estimating materials properties for the evaluation of constitutive relations in fluid dynamical simulations. The practical application of CT to Earth science problems requires data. Data on the thermochemical properties and the equation of state of relevant materials, and data on the relative stability and partitioning of chemical elements between phases as a function of temperature and pressure. These data must be evaluated and synthesized into a self consistent collection of theoretical models and model parameters that is colloquially known as a thermodynamic database. Quantitative outcomes derived from CT reply on the existence, maintenance and integrity of thermodynamic databases. Unfortunately, the community is reliant on too few such databases, developed by a small number of research groups, and mostly under circumstances where refinement and updates to the database lag behind or are unresponsive to need. Given the increasing level of reliance on CT calculations, what is required is a paradigm shift in the way thermodynamic databases are developed, maintained and disseminated. They must become community resources, with flexible and assessable software interfaces that permit easy modification, while at the same time maintaining theoretical integrity and fidelity to the underlying experimental observations. Advances in computational and data science give us the tools and resources to address this problem, allowing CT results to be obtained at the speed of thought, and permitting geochemical and petrological intuition to play a key role in model development and calibration.",

            "abstract": "Massive hydraulic fracturing is required for commercial gas production from unconventional reservoirs. These reservoirs are often highly fractured and heterogeneous, which may cause significant fracture complexity and also arrest propagation of hydraulic fractures, leading to production decrease. One of the goals of our study was to investigate the influence of rock fabric features on near-wellbore fracture geometry and complexity. We performed a series of laboratory tests on Niobrara outcrop shale blocks with dimensions of 30 x 30 x 36 inches in a true-triaxial loading frame. Acoustic Emission (AE) technique was applied to monitor hydraulic fracture initiation and dynamics of fracture propagation. After the tests, the shape of the created hydraulic fracture was mapped by goniometry technique. To estimate fracture aperture, particles of different sizes were injected with fracturing fluid.\nIn all tests, AE analysis indicated hydraulic fracture initiation prior to breakdown or the maximum of wellbore pressure. In most tests, AE analysis revealed asymmetrical hydraulic fracture shapes. Post-test analysis demonstrated good correspondence of AE results with the actual 3D shape of the fracture surface map. AE analysis confirmed that in some of these tests, the hydraulic fracture approached one face of the block before the maximum wellbore pressure had been reached. We have found that in such cases the propagation of hydraulic fracture in the opposite direction was arrested by the presence of mineralized interfaces. Mapping the distribution of injected particles confirmed the creation of a narrow-width aperture in the vicinity of pre-existing interfaces, restricting fracture conductivity. Based on the results of our study, we concluded that the presence of planes of weakness, such as mineralized natural fractures, can result in the arrest of hydraulic fracture propagation, or in poor fracture geometries with limited aperture, that in turn could lead to high net pressure and low fracture conductivity, restricted proppant delivery, and decreased production.",

            "abstract": "Attempts to link observations across multiple scales, and in particular the problem of scaling up fine-scale observations to landscape and regional process, faces numerous theoretical, computational, and statistical challenges. This talk aims to link theoretical advances in the scaling of biotic heterogeneity, abiotic heterogeneity, and contagious disturbance with statistical advances for linking observations that integrate over different scales. Critical to this goal is the need to partition sources of uncertainty and variability. In particular, the variance you can calculate most readily is rarely the most important or relevant one to quantify. In community ecology, hierarchical Bayes (HB) latent-variable models that separate true variability in ecosystem processes from observation errors have challenged long-standing theory surrounding the maintenance of biodiversity, yet application of such approaches to regional-scale biogeochemical processes is just beginning. A special case of such models, focused on the change of support problem, deal specifically with linking observations that integrate over different spatial and temporal scales.\nOccurring in parallel with these statistical advances have been the development of new theories for the spatially-implicit scaling of biotic and abiotic heterogeneity, as well as contagious disturbances such as fire and pathogens, and the incorporation of such approaches into process-based ecosystem models. Such approaches upscale by integrating the probability distributions of system heterogeneity over the functional response of the ecosystem to such heterogeneity. We demonstrate that this approach can also be downscaled by conditioning on incomplete partial observation at a local scale, and can have lower uncertainty than brute-force spatially-explicit approaches. We also extend such approaches from integrating over observed heterogeneities to integrating the latent, high-dimensional variability in HB models. Finally, there is a pressing need to quantify the important sources and scales of variability and uncertainty in ecosystem processes that affect our ability to forecast ecosystem processes.",

            "abstract": "Earth system models vary in their predictions of carbon (C) uptake and release by the terrestrial biosphere, partly due to great uncertainties in the response of soils, one of the largest C reservoirs. The world’s soils play a major role in the exchange of greenhouse gases with the atmosphere, in sustaining primary production, and in providing food security. Despite this, the sensitivity of soils to disturbance is highly uncertain. One reason for this is geographic variability in the importance of different mechanisms regulating soil C turnover. Most of our understanding of factors influencing soil organic C dynamics comes from research in temperate soils, despite the major role of tropical soils in the global C cycle. Even in the tropics, the diversity of soil environments is grossly underrepresented in the literature. This has important implications for predictions of soil C change across latitudes. We discuss results from the response of soil C pools and microbial communities to land use legacies on two contrasting tropical soil environments.\nUncertainties in the response of soil C to disturbance also stem from a historic focus on shallow depths and the assumption that deep soil C is unreactive to landscape change. Growing evidence indicates that soil C pools in deep mineral horizons can be sensitive to changes in land cover and climate. This realization highlights the need to reassess the source of soil C at depth and the processes contributing to its stabilization. We discuss results from the interaction between multiple disturbances: drought, fire and erosion, on the accumulation of soil C at depths beyond those typically included in regional or global inventories. Our data show that deep soil C can be reactive and be a potential source of C if reconnected to the atmosphere. A deeper, mechanistic appreciation for a landscape’s history of disturbance is critical for predicting feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Crustal anatexis, together with melt extraction and ascent to upper crustal levels, generate plutons and volcanic edifices of granitoid composition. This process constitutes the main mechanism for the differentiation of the continental crust. A recent breakthrough in the study of crustal anatexis is the discovery of former melt inclusions in peritectic minerals of anatectic rocks. These melt droplets show now as glassy inclusions in rapidly cooled anatectic enclaves within volcanic rocks, or as polycrystalline aggregates (nanogranites) in migmatites. Analysis of glassy inclusions and of rehomogenized nanogranites provide direct information on the composition of crustal melts at the source of crustal magmas, on the extent of equilibration between melt and residue, and on the fluid regime during anatexis. A comprehensive geochemical study (≈350 EMP, 100 LA-ICPMS and 80 nanoSIMS analyses) of matrix glasses and glassy melt inclusions in Pl and Grt of anatectic enclaves within El Hoyazo dacite (Betic Cordillera, S Spain), recording melt compositions during regional anatexis at ≈700-850 ºC and 0.5-0.7 GPa, shows that melts are leucogranitic (FeOt+MgO+TiO2=1.0-2.0 wt%), moderately to strongly peraluminous (ASI=1.10-1.25), with H2O concentrations well below saturation (3-5 wt%). They are heterogeneous and spread around the 0.5-0.7 GPa haplogranite H2O-undersaturated eutectics. Glassy inclusions in Pl are more heterogeneous, richer in normative Qtz and H2O, and poorer in FeOt and CaO compared to glassy inclusions in Grt and matrix glass. All glasses have moderate to high concentrations of LILE and low to very low concentrations in FRTE, HFSE and REE. Glass inclusions in Pl and Grt have higher concentrations of LILE, lower concentrations of Y, Zr, REE, and lower values of Th/U compared to matrix glasses. Surprisingly, and in spite of the compositional heterogeneity, glasses are at or close to equilibrium with their residue regarding most of the trace elements, except for some degree of undersaturation in accessory minerals Zrn and Mnz. The compositions of glassy inclusions in Pl and Grt and matrix glasses are interpreted to record the compositional evolution of melt during the prograde melting of the enclaves from ≈700 to 800-850 ºC.",

            "abstract": "Land cover and climate interact at regional and global scales through biophysical, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. Land cover change (LCC) affects regional climate through impacts on surface albedo and surface net radiation, on the partitioning of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes, on the atmospheric heating, moisture flux convergence and circulation, and the partitioning of rainfall between evaporation and runoff. Meanwhile, the climate variability and change also affect the LCC.\nBased on historical anthropogenic land cover change data from 1948-2005, numerical experiments that were designed to test its impact using general circulation models indicate that the LCC enhances the global warming in past half century. This is because after land degradation, reduction of evaporation is dominant, leading to surface warming. The reduction of net radiation due to high surface albedo plays a secondary role. Meanwhile, its impact on the regional monsoon is significant. The produced monsoon rainfall anomaly is not only limited within the land degradation area but extend to much large area through its interaction with the atmospheric circulations.\nThe warming climate and climate variability also affect the vegetation distribution. For instance, with a coupled biophysical and dynamic vegetation model forced by the observed meteorological data, the North America leaf area index (LAI) shows an increasing trend after the 1970s in responding to warming. Meanwhile, the effects of the severe drought during 1987-1992 and the last decade in the southwestern U.S. on vegetation are also evident from the simulated and satellite-derived LAIs. The land covers in some parts of North America also show substantial changes. Evaluations of these simulations using satellite data are crucial. The critical issues in applying satellite data for LCC studies are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Some of the highest and most localized rates of lithospheric deformation in the world are observed at the transition between adjacent plate boundary subduction segments (syntaxes). The initiating perturbation of this deformation has long been attributed to vigorous, climate driven, erosional processes as observed at Nanga Parbat and Namche Barwa in the Himalaya and at Mt. St. Elias in Alaska. However, an erosion-dominated mechanism ignores the 3D geometry of curved subducting plates and changes in paleoclimate. Here we present an alternative explanation for rapid exhumation at these locations based on the 3D thermo-mechanical evolution of collisions between plates with nonplanar geometries. A set of numerical solutions and thermochronometer observations are presented for the interaction between a rigid indenter between subduction segments with an overriding viscous material. The model setup is intentionally simplified to identify how the 3D geometry of a subducting plate influences upper plate deformation, and therefore omits many of the complexities of collision interfaces, such as the transfer of mass between the downgoing and overriding plates. Temperatures are calculated using the 3D advection diffusion equation with radiogenic heat production and shear heating. The thermal and Stokes flow solutions are fully coupled and evolve throughout the simulation. Model predicted cooling ages are compared to observed cooling ages from published bedrock and detrital thermochronometer studies by calculating cooling rate dependent thermochronometer ages. Comparison of model predictions with existing thermochronometer data reproduces the defining characteristics of these mountains such as a localized “bulls-eye” pattern of rapid exhumation and young cooling ages above the rigid indenter between subduction segments. These results demonstrate a ‘bottom up’ tectonic rather than ‘top down’ erosional initiation of feedbacks between erosion and tectonic deformation. While the role of enhanced precipitation as an instigator of enhanced deformation has been suggested, we demonstrate that the geometry of subducting plates is important for producing many of the observations previously used to demonstrate a strong influence of climate on tectonic processes.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are a central component of Earth system models, and our ability to understand and simulate past, present and future changes in the Earth system is linked to the quality of DGVMs. A major limitation of most DGVMs is that they represent vegetation by a fixed number of static functional types that do not allow plants and plant communities to dynamically adjust to the biotic and abiotic conditions. Here, we present the aDGVM2, a novel individual- and trait-based dynamic vegetation model. The aDGVM2 simulates growth, reproduction and mortality of single plants as a function of the plant-specific combination of trait values. Concepts from genetic optimization are used to simulate trait inheritance, crossover and mutation. These processes ensure that well-performing plants can pass their traits to the next generation and that vegetation can adjust to potentially changing environmental conditions. Thereby, the model iteratively assembles plant communities that are adapted to the environment. The aDGVM2 simulates responses of plant traits along climate, soil and disturbance gradients and associated responses in community structure, diversity and biome types. More specifically, we show that rooting strategies emerging in model simulations are related to soil characteristics and rainfall regimes and that community assembly processes can buffer impacts of disturbances on vegetation. The aDGVM2 model approach integrates aspects of community assembly theory, Earth system modeling and optimality theory and it has a high potential to improve our understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental changes.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this presentation is to describe a quantitative framework for determining how energy limits microbial activity, biomass and, ultimately, biogeochemical processes. Although this model can be applied to any environment, its utility is demonstrated in marine sediments, which are an attractive test habitat because they encompass a broad spectrum of energy levels, varying amounts of biomass and are ubiquitous.\nThe potential number of active microbial cells in Arkonas Basin (Baltic Sea) sediments are estimated as a function of depth by quantifying the amount of energy that is available to them and the rate at which it is supplied: power. The amount of power supplied per cubic centimeter of sediment is determined by calculating the Gibbs energy of fermentation and sulfate reduction in combination with the rate of particulate organic carbon, POC, degradation. The Reactive Continuum Model (Boudreau and Ruddick, 1991), RCM, is used to determine the rate at which POC is made available for microbial consumption. The RCM represents POC as containing a range of different types of organic compounds whose ability to be consumed by microorganisms varies as a function of the age of the sediment and on the distribution of compound types that were initially deposited. The sediment age model and RCM parameters determined by (Mogollon et al., 2012) are used.\nThe power available for fermentation and sulfate reduction coupled to H2 and acetate oxidation varies from 10-8 W cm-3 at the sediment water interface to between 10-11 – 10-12 W cm-3 at 3.5 meters below the seafloor, mbsf. Using values of maintenance powers for each of these catabolic activities taken from the literature, the total number of active cells in these sediments similarly decreases from just less than 108 cell cm-3 at the SWI to 4.6 x 104 cells cm-3 at 3.5 mbsf. The number of moles of POC decreases from 2.6 x 10-5 to 9.5 x 10-6, also becoming more recalcitrant with depth.\nBoudreau, B. P. and Ruddick, B. R.

            "abstract": "Extensive groundwater pumping from the aquifer system in the San Joaquin Valley, California, between 1926 and 1970 caused widespread aquifer-system compaction and resultant land subsidence that locally exceeded 8 m. The importation of surface water in the early 1970s resulted in decreased pumping, recovery of water levels, and a reduced rate of subsidence in some areas. Recently, land-use changes and reductions in surface-water availability have caused pumping to increase, water levels to decline, and subsidence to recur. Reduced freeboard and flow capacity of several Federal, State, and local canals have resulted from this subsidence.\nVertical land-surface changes during 2005–14 in the San Joaquin Valley were determined by using space-based [Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS)] and subsurface (extensometer) data; groundwater-level and lithologic data were used to understand and estimate properties that partly control the stress/strain response of the aquifer system. Results of the InSAR analysis indicate that two areas covering about 7,200 km2 subsided 20–540 mm during 2008–10; GPS data indicate that these rates continued through 2014. Groundwater levels (stress) and vertical land-surface changes (strain) were used to estimate preconsolidation head and aquifer system storage coefficients. Integrating lithology into the analysis indicates that in some parts of the valley, the compaction occurred primarily within quickly-equilibrating fine-grained deposits in deeper parts of the aquifer system. In other parts of the valley, anomalously fine-grained alluvial-fan deposits underlie one of the most rapidly subsiding areas, indicating the shallow sediments may also contribute to total subsidence. This information helps improve hydrologic and aquifer-system compaction models, which in turn can be used to consider land subsidence as a constraint in evaluating water-resource management options.",

            "abstract": "MESSENGER plasma and magnetic field observations of Mercury’s magnetotail are reviewed and compared to that of Earth. Mercury’s magnetosphere is created by the solar wind interaction with its highly dipolar, spin-axis aligned magnetic field. However, its equatorial magnetic field is ~ 150 times weaker than at Earth. As a result the altitude of its subsolar magnetopause is typically only ~ 1000 km and there is no possibility for trapped radiation belts. Magnetopause reconnection at Mercury does not exhibit the “half-wave rectifier” response to interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) direction observed at Earth. Rather magnetopause reconnection occurs for all non-zero shear angles with plasma β as the primary parameter controlling its rate. The cross-magnetosphere electric potential drop derived from magnetopause and plasma mantle structure is ~ 30 kV in contrast to ~ 100 kV at Earth. This large potential drop at Mercury relative to its small size appears due to the lack of an electrically conducting ionosphere and the strong IMF found in the inner heliosphere. Structurally these magnetotails are very similar in most respects, but the magnetic field intensities and plasma densities and temperatures are all higher at Mercury. Plasma sheet composition indicates solar wind origin, but with 10% Na+ derived from it tenuous exosphere. Given Mercury's very slow rotation rate, once every 59 Earth days, most sunward plasma sheet convection will impact the nightside of the planet. Magnetic flux loading/unloading in Mercury's tail is similar to that seen at Earth during substorms. However, the duration and amplitude of these cycles are ~ 2 – 3 min and ~ 30 to 50 %, respectively, as compared to ~ 1 - 2 hr and 10 - 25 % at Earth. These episodic, substorm-like events are accompanied by plasmoid ejection and near-tail dipolarization similar what is seen at Earth. Mercury can also exhibit Earth-like steady magnetospheric convection during which plasmoid ejection and dipolarization becomes quasi-periodic. Unlike the Earth, solar wind dynamic pressure increases at Mercury couple directly to its large iron core. Magnetic fields due to induction currents in Mercury's interior strongly resist compression of the dayside magnetosphere. The effects of such inductive coupling on magnetotail dynamics at Mercury remains to be determined.",

This is an inherent psychological characteristic when conveying disturbing information to people. In this presentation, I will describe personal experiences of presenting climate change science in various public forums. In particular, I will describe two experiences: one in which I was able to effectively work with the emotional reactions to the scientific information and another in which the resistance was difficult to resolve within the group. Based on these experiences and others, I describe an innovative four-stage process for working with situations in which there is strong resistance to the science of climate change (or other challenging scientific issues).

            "abstract": "It is important to separate the role of hydrology from climate change when assessing the Holocene history of lake sediments. Big Soda Lake is a Holocene maar lake in the Great Basin of Nevada with a 9 m sediment record that covers the Holocene. The mm-scale laminations, diatoms, and δ18O and δ13C from bulk calcite in the core are consistent with a saline, closed-basin lake down to approximately 4.3 m below the sediment water interface. The top 7 cm of the core show the influence of human hydrologic modifications to the area. Below that, stable isotope data shows variable groundwater input that is mostly consistent with climate variation from other records in the western USA. Below 4.3 m depth, the laminations abruptly end and are replaced by unlaminated massive mud, sand, and gravel to the bottom. The isotopic composition of the calcite abruptly changes from covarying, to inversely varying compositions below this break. This break occurred at about 5,600 cal yr BP. In addition, the diatom assemblage below 4.3 m is similar to that found in modern Walker Lake; whereas the diatom assemblage above 4.3 m is similar to modern Mono Lake. The δ18O isotopic composition of the calcite is on average 6 ‰ more negative below 4.3 m than above the change, indicating that the lake contained fresher water before 5,600 cal yr BP ago. The cause for the abrupt change cannot be explained through climate shifts because climate in the Great Basin has been shown to be more arid between 8,000 and 5,000 cal yr BP. It has been hypothesized that the Walker River flowed to the Carson River Basin between about 14,000 and 5,000 cal yr BP, and this added water may have raised the groundwater table sufficiently in the Carson Basin to freshen Big Soda Lake. Once the Walker River diverted back to the Walker Basin, more saline conditions prevailed reflecting changes in climate and human influence at the top of the core.",

            "abstract": "Higher than normal accuracy is required to rigorously observe decadal climate change. But what level is needed? How can this be quantified? This presentation will summarize a new more rigorous and quantitative approach to determining the required accuracy for climate change observations (Wielicki et al., 2013, BAMS). Most current global satellite observations cannot meet this accuracy level. A proposed new satellite mission to resolve this challenge is CLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory). CLARREO is designed to achieve advances of a factor of 10 for reflected solar spectra and a factor of 3 to 5 for thermal infrared spectra (Wielicki et al., Oct. 2013 BAMS). The CLARREO spectrometers are designed to serve as SI traceable benchmarks for the Global Satellite Intercalibration System (GSICS) and to greatly improve the utility of a wide range of LEO and GEO infrared and reflected solar passive satellite sensors for climate change observations (e.g. CERES, MODIS, VIIIRS, CrIS, IASI, Landsat, SPOT, etc).\nProviding more accurate decadal change trends can in turn lead to more rapid narrowing of key climate science uncertainties such as cloud feedback and climate sensitivity. A study has been carried out to quantify the economic benefits of such an advance as part of a rigorous and complete climate observing system. The study concludes that the economic value is ~ $12 Trillion U.S. dollars in Net Present Value for a nominal discount rate of 3% (Cooke et al. 2013, J. Env. Sys. Dec.). A brief summary of these two studies and their implications for the future of climate science will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Recrystallized quartz is ubiquitous in crustal deformation zones. However it remains unclear how the mechanisms of recrystallization affect the substitution and mobility of trace elements (such as Ti) in the quartz structure and if the Ti content of deformed quartz accurately reflects the conditions at which recrystallization occurred. The sluggish diffusion of Ti at the T conditions of quartz ductile deformation predicts that the Ti concentration would not be significantly modified during a deformation event.\nTo explore the effect of dynamic recrystallization on Ti substitution in quartz, doped quartz aggregates were experimentally deformed to incrementally higher shear strain at a fixed P-T condition (1.0 GPa, 900 °C) where a specific Ti concentration is predicted. A novel doping technique is used to synthesize a quartz aggregate consisting of two layers of quartz with Ti concentrations above and below the predicted solubility, to create layers in which aTiO2=1 and aTiO2<1, respectively. Layered aggregates were deformed at constant strain rate for increasing intervals of time and compared with hydrostatic experiments held at P-T for the same duration to isolate the effect of dynamic recrystallization relative to static recrystallization. Electron probe (EMP) analysis of a large population of deformed quartz grains is combined with high-resolution cathodoluminescence (CL) analysis to assess intragrain variations in Ti content and electron-backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis to evaluate the strength of recrystallized fabrics. Results show that samples deformed to highest shear strain, which preserve the strongest crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), record a Ti concentration that is most similar to hydrostatic experiments, which exhibit a random CPO. Diffusion modeling of CL intensity halos in quartz reveals Ti in quartz diffusion coefficients that are (1) faster in our high P experiments relative to previous experimental calibrations at 1 atm and (2) faster in deformed quartz relative to hydrostatic quartz. These findings suggest that deformed quartz in shear zones could preserve a more continuum record of deformation relative to statically recrystallized quartz away from deformation zones.",

The literature is rich with studies that include preferred orientation generation in fault gouge, low-grade metamorphic rocks, sediments with variable clay content and during the smectite-to-illite transformation. Untangling the interplay between many competing factors in any one geologic situation has proven a significant challenge over many years. Understanding how, where and when clay minerals develop a preferred orientation has significant implications for permeability anisotropy in shallow burial, the way mechanical properties are projected from shallower to deeper settings in basin modeling packages and the way velocity anisotropy is accounted for in seismic data processing. The assessment of the anisotropic properties of fine-grained siliciclastic rocks is gaining significant momentum in rock physics research. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of how clay minerals develop a preferred orientation in space and time is crucial to the understanding of anisotropy of physical properties. The current study brings together a wealth of data that may be used in a predictive sense to account for fabric anisotropy that may impact any number of rock properties.",

            "abstract": "Sediment exchange between the channel and floodplain can occur via meander migration, overbank deposition or erosion, and channel widening or narrowing. Depending on channel and floodplain history, floodplains can act either as sources or sinks of bed material and/or wash load. The Morphodynamics And Sediment Tracers in 1D program (MAST-1D) is a numerical model built to describe grain size specific transport of sediment and tracers and the long-term - i.e. decadal and longer - evolution of channel floodplain complexes. MAST-1D differs from other 1D numerical models because it allows for 1) uneven exchange of sediment and tracers between the river channel and the floodplain, 2) temporal changes in channel geometry, bed elevation and floodplain thickness, which result in changes in the channel hydraulic capacity, and 3) temporal changes of size distribution and tracer content in the floodplain, in the load and in the underlying substrate. Under conditions of constant base level, water and sediment supply, the main assumptions in the model result in the system evolving asymptotically toward a steady state wherein channel bed erosion is balanced by channel bed deposition. When at this condition, the amount of sediment deposited on the floodplain through point bar deposition and overbank sedimentation is balanced by the erosion of sediment from the floodplain through lateral migration. However, imbalances in floodplain storage can persist for many years even when the channel bed elevation and size distribution are near steady state. The MAST-1D program is applied to study the long term response of a sand bed river, an 80 km long reach of the Minnesota River between Mankato and Jordan, Minnesota, to changes in flow regime and the sediment load due to the development of intensive agriculture in the watershed. The simulations are performed in successive phases, the model is first set up so that under the best estimates available for pre-agriculture conditions, channel floodplain exchange is even. Changes in flow regime, sediment load, and grain size of sediment load are then applied to represent agricultural development of the basin. The model is first validated against field data. It is then applied to investigate how the channel-floodplain response changes for different grain size distributions of the sediment load.",

            "abstract": "It is very difficult to reflect accumulated subsystem knowledge into holistic knowledge. Knowledge about a whole system can rarely be introduced into a targeted subsystem. In many cases, knowledge in one discipline is inapplicable to other disciplines. We are far from resolving cross-disciplinary issues. It is critically important to establish interdisciplinarity so that scientific knowledge can transcend disciplines. We need to share information and develop knowledge interlinkages by building models and exchanging tools. We need to tackle a large increase in the volume and diversity of data from observing the Earth. The volume of data stored has exponentially increased. Previously, almost all of the large-volume data came from satellites, but model outputs occupy the largest volume in general. To address the large diversity of data, we should develop an ontology system for technical and geographical terms in coupling with a metadata design according to international standards.\nIn collaboration between Earth environment scientists and IT group, we should accelerate data archiving by including data loading, quality checking and metadata registration, and enrich data-searching capability. DIAS also enables us to perform integrated research and realize interdisciplinarity. For example, climate change should be addressed in collaboration between the climate models, integrated assessment models including energy, economy, agriculture, health, and the models of adaptation, vulnerability, and human settlement and infrastructure. These models identify water as central to these systems. If a water expert can develop an interrelated system including each component, the integrated crisis can be addressed by collaboration with various disciplines. To realize this purpose, we are developing a water-related data- and model-integration system called a water cycle integrator (WCI).",

            "abstract": "Current ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet is a significant component of global sea-level rise. Observations suggest that both increasing ice flow speeds and sustained terminus retreat on most Greenland glaciers have increased mass loss via ice discharge over the last several decades. However, our understanding of the mechanisms causing retreat and how well connected terminus fluctuations are to other dynamic changes in the ice sheet remains limited. We examined terminus position, sea ice and ice mélange conditions, and seasonal velocity patterns for 16 northwestern glaciers during 2009-2012, with extended 1999-2012 records for 4 glaciers. On a seasonal scale, there is strong correspondence between terminus advance and retreat and sea ice/ice mélange conditions, with a distinct seasonal signature. Longer sea-ice-free periods and reductions in rigid mélange formation appear to induce sustained multi-year retreat outside of the seasonal signal. While seasonal terminus retreat is not clearly linked to seasonal velocity patterns, multi-year retreat is accompanied by interannual speedup on most glaciers. Projections of continued warming and longer sea-ice-free periods around Greenland indicate that notable retreat over wide areas may continue. This sustained retreat likely will contribute to multi-year speedup. Longer melt seasons and earlier breakup of mélange may also alter the timing of seasonal ice-dynamic patterns.",

            "abstract": "The capacity of pyrogenic biochar to mitigate soil surface exchange of greenhouse gases (GHG) is dependent on the influence of biochar on physiochemical transformations of C and N in soils. Incorporated biochar amendments are hypothesized to interfere with transformations of C and N as a result of the unique recalcitrant chemical structure and surface complexity of biochars. The nature of interference by biochar with C and N transformations are assumed to be dynamic not only due to their highly variable amphilicity inherited from feedstock source and controlled pyrolytic processing parameters but also to variation in soil factors. Experiments comprised of laboratory and field studies were designed to gain insight into the priming effect of incorporated non-native biochar materials on the transformations of C and N species in the soil. Molecular structure and surface functionality of plant based biochar materials produced from carbon optimized gasification of corn stover (Zea mays L.), Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson and C. Lawson) wood residue, and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) were studied in the laboratory using NMR and SEM-EdX. Biochar materials were found to be highly hydrophobic (low H/C values) with high aromaticity. The surface morphology of all the biochar materials was highly heterogeneous and pore size ranged from 1-22µm with the faces and edges of ordered sheets. In the field study, all the three biochar types were applied at a 1% (w/w) rate to a Maddock soil (Sandy, Mixed, Frigid Entic Hapludolls) located in an eroded upper landscape position and a Brookings soil (Fine-Silty, Mixed, Superactive, Frigid Pachic Hapludolls) located in a depositional landscape position. The crop rotation is a corn (Zea mays L.) followed by soybean (Glycine max L.). The priming effect of biochars on the transformations of C and N is determined by measuring the changes in soil C (total organic carbon, microbial biomass C, hydrolyzable C, and δ 13C) and N pools (microbial biomass N, inorganic N, and δ 15N). Greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O) were measured and correlation studies will be conducted to determine the relationship with the interference effect of biochars on C and N transformation in soil. Initial data shows that biochar has an impact especially on CO2, and N2O emissions.",

            "abstract": "In determining the risk lowland deltaic topography, as threatened by sea level rise and land subsidence, a number of important processes must be evaluated. Sea level rise is a global process but with local manifestations. Asian deltas have been experiencing higher rates of sea level rise due to the steric impact on dynamic (ocean) topography. Other large scale geophysical impacts on relative sea level at the local scale include the isostatic and flexural response to Holocene sea level history, Holocene sediment loads, and in former ice sheet zones --- glacial rebound. Tectonism does play a role on relative sea level rise, particularly in South America where the Eastern coastline, particularly Argentina, is rising relative to regional sea levels. Subsidence is impacted by both natural ground compaction, and accelerated compaction due to, for example, peat oxidation that often has a human driver (e.g. swamp reclammation). Subsidence is also impacted by the extraction of deeper deposits of petroleum and water. Rates of delta subsidence vary widely, depending on the magnitude of the anthropogenic driver, from a few mm/y to 100's of mm/y. Ground water withdrawal is the dominant reason behind much of the world's coastal subsidence, with important exceptions. On average subsidence rates (all causes) now contribute to local sea level innundations at rates four times faster then sea level is rising. New technologies, particularly InSAR and GPS methods, can often pin point the local cause (e.g. water withdrawl for agriculture versus for aquaculture). Subsurface soil or rock heterogeneity, and other very local geological patterns such as historical river pathways, also influence the temporal and spatial patterns associated with delta subsidence.

The k-function combines aspects of both Maxwellian and power law forms to provide a reasonably complete description of particle density, temperature, pressure and convection velocity, all of which are key parameters of magnetospheric physics. Krimigis et al (1979) used it to describe flowing plasma ions in Jupiter’s magnetosphere measured by Voyager 1, and obtained temperatures in the range of 20 to 35 keV. Sarris et al (1981) used the κ-function to describe plasmas in Earth’s distant plasma sheet. The κ-function, in various formulations and names (e. g., γ-thermal distribution, Krimigis and Roelof, 1983) has been used routinely to parametrize hot, flowing plasmas in the magnetospheres of the outer planets, with typical kT ~ 10 to 50 keV. Using angular measurements, it has been possible to obtain pitch angle distributions and convective flow directions in sufficient detail for computations of temperatures and densities of hot particle pressures. These ‘hot’ pressures typically dominate the cold plasma pressures in the high beta (β > 1) magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, but are of less importance in the relatively empty (β < 1) magnetospheres of Uranus and Neptune. Thus, the κ-function represents an effective tool in analyzing plasma behavior in planetary magnetospheres, but it is not applicable in all plasma environments.\n",

            "abstract": "The application of land data assimilation systems to operational agricultural drought monitoring requires the development of (at least) three separate system sub-components: 1) a retrieval model to invert satellite-derived observations into soil moisture estimates, 2) a prognostic soil water balance model to serve as the assimilation model, and 3) a sequential filter to update the assimilation model using the soil moisture retrievals. Each of these three components, in turn, requires a myriad of (often arbitrary) choices regarding their appropriate level of complexity and subsequent parameterization. Using a benchmarking strategy, this presentation will attempt to evaluate the performance of each of these sub-components relative to a baseline approach derived via simple linear regression of each sub-component’s inputs. Evaluation will be based on assessing the degree to which individual root-zone soil moisture predictions (or proxies thereof) can adequately anticipate temporal anomalies in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Variations in benchmarking performance for various sub-components can then be attributed to the success of their non-linear parameterization (versus a simple linear baseline). Results will highlight the loss of skill associated with the imposition of non-linear physics into a soil water balance model and offer evidence that large-scale land data assimilation system are commonly poorly parameterized. Once indentified, these weaknesses can be systematically addressed in the development of next-generation drought monitoring systems.",

This cruise also had the unique opportunity to retrieve deep cores from the Shimokita coal bed system in Japan with the aseptic and anaerobic conditions necessary to look for deep life. Onboard scientists prepared nearly 1,700 microbiology samples shared among five different countries to study life in the deep biosphere. Samples spanned over 1 km in sampling depths and include representatives of shale, sandstone, and coal lithologies. Findings from previous IODP and deep mine expeditions suggest the genetic potential for methylotrophy in the deep subsurface, but it has yet to be observed in incubations. A subset of Expedition 337 anoxic incubations were prepared with a range of 13C-methyl substrates (methane, methylamine, and methanol) and maintained near in situ temperatures. To observe 13C methyl compound metabolism over time, we monitored the δ13C of the dissolved inorganic carbon (by-product of methyl compound metabolism) over a period of 1.5 years. Elemental analysis (EA), ion chromatograph (IC), 13C volatile fatty acid (VFA), and mineral-associated microscopy data were also collected to constrain initial and endpoint conditions in these incubations. Our geochemical evidence suggests that the coal horizon incubated with 13C-methane showed the highest activity of all methyl incubations. This provides the first known observation of methane-activated metabolism in the deep biosphere, and suggests there are not only active cells in the deeply buried terrigenous coal bed at Shimokita, but the presence of a microbial community activated by methylotrophic compounds.",

            "abstract": "Gravity is at the same time the main force acting on spacecraft and an essential tool to investigate the interior structure of planetary bodies. The large infrastructure of NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN), developed to support telecommunications and navigation of deep space probes, became therefore also a crucial instrument in planetary geodesy and geophysics.\nThis dual role of the DSN was especially important in the Cassini mission, where the precise navigation of the spacecraft throughout the many flybys of Titan and the icy satellites of the Saturnian system was unavoidably entangled with the determination of the gravity fields and the ephemerides of those bodies. Thanks to precise range rate measurements enabled by the DSN and the onboard radio system, Cassini has been able to determine the density and the moment of inertia of Titan, and the presence of large tidal deformations indicating the presence of a global, internal, ocean. Gravity-topography correlations have also been used to infer the thickness and the rigidity of the satellite’s icy shell. Recently, Doppler data acquired during three Enceladus flybys revealed the presence of a gravity anomaly in the southern polar region that is compatible with a regional sea at a depth of about 40 km. This sea is the likely source of the Enceladus's water plumes.\nAlthough current planetary geodesy experiments exploited tracking systems at X band (7.1-8.5 GHz), much improved range rate measurements can be attained with Ka band radio links (32.5-34 GHz), because of their larger immunity to plasma noise. This advanced system, available at the DSS 25 tracking antenna in Goldstone (CA), has been already used in the Cassini cruise phase to carry out an accurate test of general relativity, and will be exploited again by Juno in 2016 to determine the gravity field of Jupiter. Additional uses of the DSN Ka band system have been proposed in several precise geodesy experiments with future planetary missions, both with orbiters and landers.",

            "abstract": "Macroseismic intensities — site-specific numerical representations of shaking assigned on the basis of observed earthquake effects without the aid of seismographs —have been used to express the shaking due to earthquakes for almost two centuries. Shaking intensities can be assigned retroactively to earthquakes for which descriptions of earthquake effects are available. Macroseismic intensities constitute a consistent set of earthquake observations for many land areas, which are often the longest-period of earthquake records and most spatially-dense reports for each earthquake. Since 1998, macroseismic intensities assigned by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have been determined using data contributed by the public through the “Did You Feel It?” web-site (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/.) In this study, we use the USGS ShakeMap methodology as a consistent strategy to combine earthquake source parameters, instrumental ground motion measurements and macroseismic intensity observations to create an interpolated map of individual earthquakes occurring from 1900 to 2012. Compositing the individual ShakeMaps, we produce summary maps of specific attributes of strong ground-motion such as peak intensity, peak ground acceleration, and occurrence rates of a particular intensity. Products of this study include: (1) an aggregate database of reported felt earthquakes and their observed intensities across the U.S. for 1900—2012; (2) a database of ShakeMaps for the same events; (3) database summaries such as peak intensity and peak ground motion maps for the entire U.S.; and (4) observed frequency of shaking occurrence and derived hazard curves for selected cities. Our peak intensity and frequency maps are representations of seismic hazard that complement probabilistic seismic-hazard maps.",

            "abstract": "Sugarcane production in U.S. involves either pre-harvest burning or after-harvest burning of the residue. Approximately 70-90% of the dry matter of harvested sugarcane trash is lost through open field burning. This practice has caused considerable concerns over air quality and soil sustainability. We propose an alternative conservation approach to convert the sugarcane residue to biochar and used as soil amendment to conserve carbon and potentially improve soil fertility. In this study, fundamental properties of biochars made from sugarcane residue along with rice residues were tested for agronomic and environmental benefits. Sugarcane and rice harvest residues and milling processing byproducts bagasse and rice husk were converted to biochars at different pyrolysis temperatures and characterized. In general, sugarcane leave biochar contained more P, K, Ca and Mg than sugarcane bagasse biochar. Rice straw biochar had more S, K Ca but less P than rice husk biochar. Both biochars had higher available fraction of total P than that of total K. Sugarcane leave biochar converted at 450oC was dominated with various lignin derived phenols as well as non-specific aromatic compounds whereas bagasse biochar was with both lignin derived phenol and poly aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Rice straw char was dominated with non-specific aromatic compounds. At 750oC, charred material was dominated with aromatic ethers while losing the aromatic C=C structures. These molecular and surface property differences likely contributed to the difference in water holding capacities observed with these biochars. On the other hand, rice straw biochars produced at different pyrolysis temperatures had no significant effect on rice germination. Soils treated with sugarcane leave/trash biochar significantly enhanced sugarcane growth especially the root length. Treating soil with either sugarcane leave or bagasse char also enhanced soil adsorption capacity of atrazine; a common herbicide used in sugarcane production, and reduced greenhouse gas emission. Overall, the conversion of sugarcane harvest residue to biochar as soil amendment improves sugarcane production for both agronomic and environmental benefits. Sugarcane residue biochar also showed the potential of other environmental use for remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous phenomenon in many varied space and astrophysical plasmas, and as such plays an important role in the dynamics of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). It is widely regarded that reconnection is instrumental in the formation and ejection of the initial CME flux rope, but reconnection also continues to affect the dynamics as it propagates through the interplanetary medium. For example, reconnection on the leading edge of the ICME, by which it interacts with the interplanetary medium, leads to flux erosion. However, recent in situ observations by Gosling et al. found signatures of reconnection exhausts in the interior. In light of this data, we consider the stability properties of systems with this flux rope geometry with regard to their minimum energy Taylor state. Variations from this state will result in the magnetic field relaxing back towards the minimum energy state, subject to the constraints that the toroidal flux and magnetic helicity remain invariant. In reversed field pinches, this relaxation is mediated by reconnection in the interior of the system, as has been shown theoretically and experimentally. By treating the ICME flux rope in a similar fashion, we show analytically that the the elongation of the flux tube cross section in the latitudinal direction will result in a departure from the Taylor state. The resulting relaxation of the magnetic field causes reconnection to commence in the interior of the ICME, in agreement with the observations of Gosling et al. We present MHD simulations in which reconnection initiates at a number of rational surfaces, and ultimately produces a stochastic magnetic field. If the time scales for this process are shorter than the propagation time to 1 AU, this result explains why many ICME flux ropes no longer exhibit the smooth, helical flux structure characteristic of a magnetic cloud.",

            "abstract": "Recently, we have shown that a significant crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of forsterite develops during Newtonian flow of the forsterite aggregate (Miyazaki et al., 2013 Nature). Since the aggregate also exhibits (i) superplasticity (>>100 % tensile strain) (Hiraga, 2010 Nature), (ii) the same phase aggregation at the direction of compression (Hiraga et al. 2013 Geology) and (iii) essentially no change in grain shape before and after the deformation, we concluded that grain boundary sliding (GBS) should have accommodated a majority of the sample strain. One of the distinct natures of the observed CPO was that the preexisting grain shape, which is controlled by crystallography of forsterite, controls CPO development and its pattern. Based on these results, we concluded that the preferential GBS at the boundary parallel to the specific crystallographic plane (i.e., low-index plane grain boundary) resulted in CPO. The development of CPO requires a grain rotation toward the specific direction in the sample geometry. Such rotation was well identified by the shape change of line markers imposed on the sample surface prior to the sample deformation. Further, scanning probe microscopy on the sample surface reveals the anisotropic grain rotation, that is, a significant rotation around the axis perpendicular to the compression axis whereas essentially zero rotation around the axis parallel to the compression axis.\nWe will demonstrate that such CPO, which is originated from crystallography-controlled GBS, is not limited to forsterite system but it is a common process in various mineral systems. CPO in rocks has been considered as a consequence of dislocation creep. Here we show an alternative model of CPO development in the earth’s interior.",

            "abstract": "In space and astrophysical plasmas, current sheets arise spontaneously from the interaction of large-scale flows or magnetic structures. As these current layers approach kinetic scales, they may become unstable to the collisionless tearing instability, resulting in the formation and interaction of magnetic flux ropes. While theoretical treatments of the tearing instability have largely focused on 1D equilibria with periodic boundary conditions, current sheets in nature have a finite spatial extent and are embedded within larger open systems.  In many applications, the field boundary conditions are line-tied as in the case of flux ropes on the dayside magnetopause where the ionosphere acts as a conducting surface.  To assess the applicability of existing tearing theory to these more realistic configurations, we consider a series of 3D kinetic simulations of initially force-free current layers with line-tied boundary conditions for the fields, and open boundaries for the particles. The geometry and plasma parameters are motivated by a new laboratory experiment on the Large Plasma Device at UCLA.  For sufficiently long systems, we demonstrate that key aspects of the theory remain valid, and a threshold condition is derived for the onset of reconnection in line-tied systems. To gain additional insight into the nonlinear evolution, field-line mapping diagnostics are employed to characterize the 3D structure of the magnetic field, the nonlinear reconnection rate and the dominant non-ideal terms in the generalized Ohm’s law.",

            "abstract": "Across the globe, macroclimatic drivers greatly influence coastal wetland ecosystem structure and function. However, changing macroclimatic conditions are rarely incorporated into coastal wetland vulnerability assessments. Here, we quantify the influence of macroclimatic drivers upon coastal wetland ecosystems along the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) coast. From a global perspective, the NGOM coast provides several excellent opportunities to examine the effects of climate change upon coastal wetlands. The abundant coastal wetland ecosystems in the region span two major climatic gradients: (1) a winter temperature gradient that crosses temperate to tropical climatic zones; and (2) a precipitation gradient that crosses humid to semi-arid zones. We present analyses where we used geospatial data (historical climate, hydrology, and coastal wetland coverage) and field data (soil, elevation, and plant community composition and structure) to quantify climate-mediated ecological transitions. We identified winter climate and precipitation-based thresholds that separate mangrove forests from salt marshes and vegetated wetlands from unvegetated wetlands, respectively. We used simple distribution and abundance models to evaluate the potential ecological effects of alternative future climate change scenarios. Our results illustrate and quantify the importance of macroclimatic drivers and indicate that climate change could result in landscape-scale changes in coastal wetland ecosystem structure and function. These macroclimate-mediated ecological changes could affect the supply of some ecosystem goods and services as well as the resilience of these ecosystems to stressors, including accelerated sea level rise. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating macroclimatic drivers within future-focused coastal wetland vulnerability assessments.",

            "abstract": "Ice clouds play an important role in the Arctic weather and climate system but interactions between aerosols, clouds and radiation are poorly understood. Consequently, it is essential to fully understand their properties and especially their formation process.\nExtensive measurements from ground-based sites and satellite remote sensing reveal the existence of two Types of Ice Clouds (TICs) in the Arctic during the polar night and early spring. TIC-1 are composed by non-precipitating very small (radar-unseen) ice crystals whereas TIC-2 are detected by both sensors and are characterized by a low concentration of large precipitating ice crystals. It is hypothesized that TIC-2 formation is linked to the acidiﬁcation of aerosols, which inhibit the ice nucleating properties of ice nuclei (IN). As a result, the IN concentration is reduced in these regions, resulting to a smaller concentration of larger ice crystals. Over the past 10 years, several parameterizations of homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation have been developed to reflect the various physical and chemical properties of aerosols. These parameterizations are derived from laboratory studies on aerosols of different chemical compositions. The parameterizations are also developed according to two main approaches: stochastic (that nucleation is a probabilistic process, which is time dependent) and singular (that nucleation occurs at fixed conditions of temperature and humidity and time-independent).\nThis research aims to better understand the formation process of TICs using a newly-developed ice nucleation parameterizations. For this purpose, we implement some parameterizations (2 approaches) into the Limited Area version of the Global Multiscale Environmental Model (GEM-LAM) and use them to simulate ice clouds observed during the Indirect and Semi-Direct Arctic Cloud (ISDAC) in Alaska. We use both approaches but special attention is focused on the new parameterizations of the singular approach. Simulation results of the TICs-2 observed on April 15th and 25th (polluted or acidic cases) and TICs-1 observed on April 5th (non-polluted cases) will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica document a dramatic, step-wise increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) as the Earth warmed during the last deglaciation. Marine sediment archives point towards concurrent millennial-scale shifts in ocean circulation, nutrient cycling, and biological productivity; all of these processes would have been involved in carbon cycle feedbacks. These abrupt events, Heinrich Stadial One (HS1) and the Younger Dryas (YD), are associated in time with large freshwater anomalies and ice-berg rafting in the North Atlantic - which are, in turn, thought to have caused a disruption in the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) through buoyancy forcing, and thus a major perturbation in heat and nutrient transport in the oceans.\nIntermediate waters, formed by a combination of wind-driven mixing and deep winter convection between the Polar and Subantarctic Fronts, represent the upper limb of the MOC that supplies nutrients (albeit relatively depleted in silicic acid compared to other nutrients) to lower latitude thermocline waters. There is widespread evidence throughout the North Atlantic for pulses of diatom productivity during HS1 and YD in regions where there is a low supply of silicic acid today. Were these diatom pulses a result of changes in nutrient supply as a result of a large-scale reorganisation of ocean circulation; changes in the supply rate, extent or relative silicic acid content of the northward flowing upper MOC limb; or do they represent more localised supply processes?\nHere, we investigate changes in intermediate water silicic acid supply using mid- and high-latitude North Atlantic sediment cores and the silicon isotope composition of deep-sea sponge spicules. Together with other proxy records our results, including new high-resolution records from off the south east of Iceland, shed light on the processes that influence silicic acid supply and uptake during periods of abrupt climatic change.",

            "abstract": "The silicon isotope composition of deep-sea sponges has been shown to reflect the concentration of dissolved silicon, silicic acid, in seawater. This discovery has lead to the development of a novel geochemical proxy for past deep water nutrient status, which has already been applied to a wide range of palaeoceanographic questions ranging from Southern Ocean silicic acid leakage on glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales, to the proliferation of diatoms at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. The initial calibrations based on modern sponge samples showed some scatter in the relationship between sponge silicon isotopes and silicic acid concentration, but without any apparent systematic influence from other environmental factors (temperature, pH, or other nutrients), morphology or species. However, a silicon isotope calibration of core top spicules, based on measurements made on a large number of spicules extracted from sediments, shows a tighter relationship with silicic acid concentrations, indicating that there are variations between and within individuals that are \"averaged out\" during palaeoceanographic studies. As is the case for all novel geochemical proxies, there is a need to test the proxy rigorously to ensure robust interpretation of any downcore signal. Here, we will present new studies of modern sponge specimens that have been carried out to shed light on the processes that could result in differences in silicon isotopic fractionation between and within individual sponges. Our findings highlight where caution is required in order to produce robust downcore records of past ocean silicic acid concentrations.",

            "abstract": "Marine sediments provide evidence for the periodic occurrence of centennial-scale events with enhanced iceberg discharge during the past 11.000 years. It has been suggested that these events were caused by reductions in solar activity, indicating that an external forcing that is considered small, could have a potential impact on climate due to feedback mechanisms. These proposed interactions between climate and solar irradiance have been investigated using numerical models, but so far without dynamically computing the Greenland ice sheet and iceberg calving.\nWe therefore use the earth system model iLOVECLIM coupled to the ice sheet/ice shelf model GRISLI and to a dynamic-thermodynamic iceberg module to investigate the effect of variations in total solar irradiance (TSI) on the Greenland ice sheet, as well as on iceberg calving and transport. We have performed fifteen different transient ensemble experiments of the last 6000 years, applying reconstructed atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, volcanic aerosol loads and orbital parameters as forcing. In ten of these fifteen experiments, we additionally apply reconstructed variations of the TSI that differ in amplitude (weak or strong).\nThe resulting transient evolution of the Greenland ice sheet fits well to observations and we do find strong fluctuations in the calving flux as computed by GRISLI. But these fluctuations occur in all the experiments performed, independent of the use of TSI forcing, indicating that internal ice sheet variability causes the simulated variations. Thus, we cannot confirm the impact of the total solar irradiance on the ice rafted debris in our coupled climate – ice-sheet – iceberg model, but our experiments do suggest that internal ice sheet variability may be a possible alternative explanation for the Holocene ice rafting events that have been observed in Atlantic sediment cores.",

            "abstract": "Compaction bands play an important role in reservoir engineering and geological storage. Their presence in geological formations may also provide useful information on various geological processes. Several mechanisms can be involved at different scales and may be responsible for compaction band instabilities [1]. Compaction bands can be seen as a particular instability of the governing mathematical system leading to localization of deformation [2-4]. In a saturated porous rock, the progressive mechanical damage of the solid skeleton during compaction, results in the increase of the interface area of the reactants and consequently in the acceleration of the dissolution rate of the solid phase [2,5]. Thus, the solid skeleton is degraded more rapidly (mass removal because of dissolution), the overall mechanical properties of the system diminish (contraction of the elastic domain – chemical softening), deformations increase and the solid skeleton is further damaged (intergranular fractures, debonding, breakage of the porous network etc.). The stability of this positive feedback process is investigated analytically through linear stability analysis by considering the strong chemo-poro-mechanical coupling due to chemical dissolution. The post bifurcation behavior is then studied analytically and numerically revealing the compaction band thickness and periodicity. The effect of various parameters is studied as for instance the influence of the hydraulic diffusivity on the compaction band thickness.\n[1] P. Baud, S. Vinciguerra, C. David, A. Cavallo, E.

Many changes in the river environment can be considered disturbances, but the effects of land-cover change on sediment and nutrient dynamics are poorly understood, especially in the context of changing climate and river management. Here we use a low-frequency suspended sediment sampling dataset to assess the spatial and temporal variations of sediment fluxes in the River Thames (UK). Our approach uses a sediment rating curve (SRC) to analyse both the spatial and the temporal variation of catchment erodibility and sediment transport. First, the variations in SRC parameters in several sub-catchments are assessed and related to environmental factors including land cover, geology and vegetation. Then, the seasonal and inter-annual variability of SRC parameters are analysed to reveal seasonal and secular changes associated with urbanization and changing land management practices. Lastly, a simple dynamic SRC model for the estimation of sediment transport in the Thames was implemented and evaluated against observations. The results quantify the spatial variability of sediment transport within the catchment and reveal a seasonal flushing effect, in which sediment loads are typically substantially higher during the first floods after the summer dry period. We estimate that, for the River Thames, the sediment loads of the first floods after summer are around double that of other floods. We observed a decrease in the flushing effect which began in the late 1990s.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting in subsurface formations, whether for groundwater, storage or oil & gas production, can rely on a wealth of geological information. Currently, most of this information remains underused in both the theory and practice of forecasting based on inverse models which heavily relies on spatial covariances and multi-Gaussian theory. By means of real field studies, I will provide an outline of how such geological information can be accounted through the construction and validation of a large set of training images and the generation of model realizations with MPS (multiple-point geostatistics). Often most critical in solving such inverse problems is the development of prior models that are later used for posterior sampling or stochastic search. I propose therefore a two-stage approach where the first stage consists of a validation of the training image-based prior with the geophysical and flow data. This stage will require only the generation of a few (100s) geological models and the forward modeling of the data response on these models. For geophysical data, the validation consists of comparing histograms of multi-scale wavelet transforms between the forward models and the field data. For flow data, the validation is based on a reduction of dimensionality of the forward response and the data using multi-dimensional scaling. The outcome of this validation is an estimate of the prior probability assigned to each training image, with several training images getting assigned zero probability (incompatible with field data). These prior probabilities are used in the second stage to actually invert for the data using stochastic search. In such stochastic search, I avoid parameterizing the model space and present methods that efficiently perform a direct search in the space of the validated training image-based prior model realizations.",

We implement a temperature- and stress-dependent rheology, and viscosity increases 30-fold from upper to lower mantle. Trench position evolves freely in response to plate dynamics.

Our results indicate that key controls on subduction dynamics and slab morphology are: (i) the evolution of slab strength; and (ii) the slab's ability to induce trench motion. We build a regime diagram that distinguishes four subduction styles: (1) a \"vertical folding\" mode with stationary trench; (2) young slabs that are \"horizontally deflected\" along the 660-km deep viscosity jump ; (3) an inclined slab morphology, resulting from strong trench retreat (old slabs and thinner overriding plates); and (4) a two-stage mode, displaying bent (rolled-over) slabs at the end of upper-mantle descent, that subsequently unbend and achieve inclined morphologies, with late trench retreat (strong overriding plates).\nWe find that the interplay between trench motion and slab deformation at depth dictates the subduction style, both being controlled by slab strength. We show that all seismically observed slab morphologies in the transition zone can arise just by changing the subducting-plate ages. However, to understand present-day slab morphologies, we have to analyse subduction history rather than just current age at the trench.",

            "abstract": "Bayesian inference is a powerful tool in inversion analyses of geophysical problems, because observed data are commonly inaccurate and insufficient in these problems. In Bayesian inference, we always encounter a problem in determining the relative weight between observed data and prior information. ABIC (Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion) gives a useful solution to this problem particularly for linear inverse problems, by maximizing the marginal likelihood for the relative weight. In general, we subjectively construct a Bayesian model, which consists of a family of parametric models with different values of the relative weight giving different parametric models; ABIC enables us to objectively select a specific model among the parametric models. In principle, ABIC gives us an inverse solution that mostly follows observed data when we have enough amount of data with good accuracy, and gives us an inverse solution that mostly follows prior information when observed data are insufficient and/or inaccurate (see the attached image).\nIn inversion analyses using ABIC, we do not manually adjust the relative weight. Hence, we quite easily obtain geophysically unrealistic results. Because of that, someone may think that inversion analyses using ABIC is difficult in dealing with or even unreliable. However, this characteristic is an excellent point of ABIC. If we obtain a geophysically unrealistic result, this implies that some problems are hidden in the inversion method.\nIn this talk, we show an example of the invention of inversion methods inspired by ABIC: the importance of covariance components including modeling errors. As shown by this example, we can get closer to the true solution not by manually adjusting the relative weight to obtain a seemingly good-looking result, but by determining the relative weight statistically. It is a harder way to determine the relative weight statistically, but we should pursue this way to understand geophysical problems more appropriately.",

A principal source of the current error in these SM data sets is due to heterogeneous topography below the native resolution of the PM instrument. A single PM instantaneous field of view (IFOV) may encompass surface water, dense and/or sparse vegetation, and bare soil. We show that by using satellite-based, high resolution (~250m) visible/infrared (VIS/IR) observations to estimate the fractions of water, vegetation, and bare soil in each PM IFOV, we can deconvolve the brightness temperatures from each individual component. This allows for greatly increased accuracy in the estimated soil moisture content. We will present our results in applying this technique to the WindSat soil moisture algorithm using WindSat PM data and vegetation and water fraction estimates derived from MODIS VIS/IR data.",

            "abstract": "The nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) determines the mechanical and compositional coupling between rigid plates and underlying convecting mantle. Seismological studies reveal distinct reflectors in the uppermost oceanic mantle that are sometimes interpreted as the LAB. These reflectors roughly correlate with the location of vertical gradients in radial seismic anisotropy. However, these proxies for the LAB 1) do not exhibit the depth-age relationship predicted by thermal models and 2) are not detected consistently throughout the major ocean basins. In contrast, gradients in azimuthal anisotropy in oceanic upper mantle do appear to coincide with the predicted thermal structure. This overall seismic signature is suggested to arise both from melt-related processes at mid-ocean ridges and from “freezing in” anisotropy during changes in the direction of plate motion.\nWe test recent interpretations of this upper-mantle seismic structure with measurements of crystallographic textures in experimentally and naturally deformed peridotites. Key observations: 1) Experimental deformation of nominally melt-free olivine aggregates reveals a protracted increase in texture strength and, therefore, in magnitude of elastic anisotropy with progressive deformation, 2) melt-rich systems attain a steady state at very low strain (<~1) with fast seismic directions normal to those in the melt-free case, and 3) textures measured in samples from peridotite massifs exhibit a cm- to m-scale compositional heterogeneity associated with melt production and extraction that could be a significant source of radial anisotropy.\nIn conjunction with constraints on finite strain and melting extent from geodynamic simulations, we use textural observations to predict seismic structure in an oceanic setting. Comparison of our predictions to observed seismic anisotropy provide insight into the role of composition, melting, and rheology in defining the LAB.",

In the case of the Amazon Basin, complexity in sediment pattern distribution is affected by the anabranching channel pattern of the Amazon River, inputs from tributaries (some of which are among the largest rivers on earth) and the existence of huge and complex floodplains. This study presents a remote sensing based platform that aims to improve the understanding of the patterns of sediment distributions over the Amazon River by estimating surface sediment concentration. Field acquired surface sediment concentration data were supplied from three gauging stations representing the upstream, midstream and downstream sections of the Amazon River from 2000 to 2010 and calibrated with over 1,300 MODIS daily surface reflectance images. Robust empirical models were derived (0.63<R2<0.92, N=207, 232, 313 respectively from each station) between field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data from each station; however, sensitivity of reflectance around each station was proved to be significantly affected by the local hydrological behaviors. Empirical models were applied to 8-day composite surface reflectance images to generate surface reflectance distribution maps. Overall, the capability of the MODIS-based platform introduced in this study is successfully demonstrated by capturing the spatial and temporal variability of surface sediments in the Amazon River Basin, the largest and the most complex river system on earth.",

Recently collected dinoflagellate cyst and acritarch records from the Norwegian and Iceland Seas reveal a wide-scale, major assemblage turnover including extinction of several taxa, disappearance of heterotrophic species and decrease in productivity around 4.5 Ma. These changes can most likely be attributed to a reorganization of the ocean circulation and can be interpreted as the establishment of a more modern-like Norwegian Atlantic Current and proto-East Greenland Current. The timing at around 4.5 Ma corresponds favorably to the shoaling of the Central American Seaway and northward flow of Pacific water via the Bering Strait into the North Atlantic, the latter being evidenced by the first arrival of Pacific molluscs in the Iceland (Tjörnes section). The changes in ocean circulation are not restricted to the Nordic Seas, with increased sediment accumulation at several North Atlantic drifts (e.g. Gloria and Eirik drifts) also illustrating important changes in the North Atlantic deep-water circulation.",

            "abstract": "As a significant fraction of a carbon storage project’s budget is devoted to site characterization and monitoring, there has been an intense drive in recent years to both lower cost and improve the quality of data obtained. Two data streams that are cheap and always available are pressure and flow rate measurements from the injection well. Falloff testing, in which the well is shut-in for some period of time and the pressure decline curve measured, is often used to probe the storage zone and look for indications of hydraulic barriers, fracture-dominated flow, and other reservoir characteristics. These tests can be used to monitor many hydromechanical processes of interest, including hydraulic fracturing and fault reactivation. Unfortunately, the length of the shut-in period controls how far away from the injector information may be obtained. For operational reasons these tests are typically kept short and infrequent, limiting their usefulness. In this work, we present a new analysis method in which ongoing injection data is used to reconstruct an equivalent falloff test, without shutting in the well. The entire history of injection may therefore be used as a stand in for a very long test. The method relies upon a simple superposition principle to transform a multi-rate injection sequence into an equivalent single-rate process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using injection data from the Snøhvit storage project. We also explore its utility in an active pressure management scenario.

An association between the FAD of T. pedum and a negative carbon isotope excursion has previously been documented in Northwest Canada (Narbonne et al., 1994) and Death Valley (Corsetti and Hagadorn, 2000), and since then has been used as an chronostratigraphic marker of the boundary, particularly in siliciclastic poor sections that do not preserve T. pedum.\nHere we present new high-resolution carbon isotope (δ13C ) chemostratigraphy from multiple sections in western Mongolia and the western United States that span the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. High-resolution sampling (0.2-1 m) reveals that instead of one large negative excursion, there are multiple, high-frequency negative excursions with an overall negative trend during the latest Ediacaran. These data help to more precisely calibrate changes in the carbon cycle across the boundary as well as to highlight the potential problem of identifying the boundary with just a few negative δ13C values. We then use a simple carbon isotope box model to explore relationships between phosphorous delivery to the ocean, oxygenation, alkalinity, and turnovers in carbonate secreting organisms.\nCorsetti, F.A., and Hagadorn, J.W., 2000, Precambrian-Cambrian transition: Death Valley, United States: Geology, v. 28, no. 4, p. 299-302.\nNarbonne, G.M., Kaufman, A.J., and Knoll, A.H., 1994, Integrated chemostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Windermere Supergroup, northwestern Canada: Implications for Neoproterozoic correlations and the early evolution of animals: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 106, no. 10, p. 1281-1292.",

To accomplish these objectives, we employ a variety of numerical approaches, including global resistive MHD models that incorporate realistic energy transport processes. We also compare and contrast model results with both remote solar and in-situ measurements of ICMEs at 1 AU and elsewhere, including the so-called ``Bastille Day’’ event of July 14, 2000, and the more recent ``extreme ICME’’ observed by STEREO-A on July 23, 2012.",

            "abstract": "A new, phased-array antenna-steering capability has recently been added to an existing 50-MHz radar on Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, in the central Pacific region. This radar, which we refer to as PAR-50, is capable of scanning in the vertical east-west plane, ±60° about the zenith. The alignment in the magnetic east-west direction allows detection of radar backscatter from small-scale irregularities that develop in the equatorial ionosphere, including those associated with equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs). The coverage, about ±800 km in zonal distance, at an altitude of 500 km, is essentially identical to that provided by ALTAIR, a fully-steerable incoherent-scatter radar, which has been used in a number of studies of EPBs. Unlike ALTAIR, which has only been operated for several hours on a handful of selected nights, the PAR-50 has already been operated continuously, while performing repeated scans, since April 2014. In this presentation, we describe the PAR-50, then, compare it to ALTAIR and the Equatorial Atmospheric Radar (EAR); the latter is the only other phased-array system in use for equatorial studies. We then assess what we have learned about EPBs from backscatter radar measurements, and discuss how the PAR-50 can provide a fresh perspective to our understanding. Clearly, the ability to sort out the space-time ambiguities in EPB development from sequences of spatial maps of EPBs is crucial to our understanding of how EPBs develop.",

            "abstract": "Many earthquakes, including megathrust events in subduction zones, occur offshore. In addition to seismic waves, such earthquakes also generate tsunamis. We present a methodology for simultaneously investigating earthquake rupture dynamics and tsunamigenesis, based on solution of the elastic and acoustic wave equations, in the solid and fluid portions of the domain, respectively. Surface gravity waves or tsunamis emerge naturally in such a description when gravitational restoring forces are properly taken into account. In our approach, we adopt an Eulerian description of the ocean and within it solve for particle velocities and the perturbation in pressure, Δp, about an initial hydrostatic state. The key step is enforcing the traction-free boundary condition on the moving ocean surface. We linearize this boundary condition, in order to apply it on the initial surface, and express it as Δp−ρgη=0, where −ρg is the initial hydrostatic gradient in pressure and η is the sea surface uplift (obtained, to first order, by integrating vertical particle velocity on the initial ocean surface). We show that this is the only place one needs to account for gravity. Additional terms in the momentum balance and linearized equation of state describing advection of pressure and density gradients can be included to study internal gravity waves within the ocean, but these can be safely neglected for problems of interest to us. We present a range of simulations employing this new methodology. These include test problems used to verify the accuracy of the method for modeling seismic, ocean acoustic, and tsunami waves, as well as more detailed models of megathrust ruptures. Our present work is focused on tsunami generation in models with variable bathymetry, where previous studies have raised questions regarding how horizontal displacement of a sloping seafloor excites tsunamis. Our approach rigorously accounts for time-dependent seafloor motion, horizontal momentum transfer, and nonhydrostatic corrections to the commonly employed shallow water theory. We envision this approach being used to provide more accurate initial conditions for tsunami models.",

The algorithm remains O(n) and implicit in time with respect to slope. I will demonstrate through a few examples the efficiency of this algorithm and how it can be used to study landscape evolution across a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. In particular I will consider the time evolution of the predicted distribution of slopes during an orogenic cycle and compare it to a few natural systems, using high resolution SRTM-derived DEMs.",

            "abstract": "A series of tests have been performed on manually fractured and propped shale. The shale used in this study contained 5-10% porosity, and 10-40% clay. Samples were fractured subparallel to bedding. Quartz sand (0.60-0.85 mm) was used as a proppant; proppant was manually placed on a fracture surface, resulting in a monolayer with random distribution. The specimens were repeatedly subjected to reservoir conditions, 20.7 MPa confining, 6.9 MPa differential stress, and temperature of 75 C. System permeability was measured during testing by flowing DI water through the specimen, flow rates were set to 0.002 ml/min, with the downstream vented to atmosphere. Upstream pressure varied to maintain the flow rate, and was approximately 1.4 MPa in the most recent (lowest permeability) test. Between test periods, specimens were removed from the test system and scanned with x-ray μCT. There is significant decrease in flow with subsequent testing due fracture closure. This is attributed to observations of clay swelling, proppant embedment, proppant fracture and shale wall sloughing. These lead to a decrease in effective fracture aperture. Flow induced particle transport clogs flow paths and impedes flow. Isolated grains tend to crush whereas continuous grains in proppant patches tend fracture with little displacement and tend towards embedment. Corresponding numerical simulations are underway to capture the change in crack flow due to these mechanisms. Images from the CT scans of the proppant filled crack are segmented and meshed. Then flow simulations are performed via the finite element method. Preliminary results are discussed.\nThis work is a precursor to laboratory-scale shale fracture and proppant testing; cores will be hydraulically fractured and propped with appropriate proppant and fluid rheology. Proppant life and permeability reduction will be monitored and specimens will be scanned with μCT. Tests will be used to inform proppant flow models which seek to model proppant density and distribution within a fracture.

            "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges in atmospheric sciences is predicting heterogeneous ice nucleation, where one out of one million ambient aerosol particles induces ice crystal formation resulting in mixed-phase and cirrus clouds. A novel multi-modal methodology is presented that allows optical and micro-spectroscopic imaging of individual identified field-collected ice nuclei (IN) active in immersion freezing and deposition ice nucleation. The identified IN from an ambient aerosol population sampled in central California dominated by urban and marine aerosols belong to the most common particle types: organic coated sea salt, and Na-rich, secondary, and refractory carbonaceous particles. Based on these observations, the IN represent not particles with unique chemical composition and exceptional ice nucleation propensity; rather, they are common particles in the ambient particle population. The results suggest that particle-type abundance and surface area, together with particle-type ice nucleation efficiency, is crucial for determining ice formation within the particle population. Complementary to our findings, we introduce a new stochastic and time-dependent immersion freezing simulation able to reproduce a wide range of laboratory data in which all particles in an aerosol population are treated explicitly as IN accounting for variable surface area. Of particular interest is the impact of the uncertainty of particle surface area on interpretation of laboratory and field derived ice nucleation data. The model simulation and experimental results corroborate classical nucleation theory with important consequences for cloud modeling studies and field measurement strategies.",

            "abstract": "Seismo-electric measurements consist in recording the transient electric fields generated by seismic waves propagating in fluid-filled porous or fractured media. These electric fields are usually measured by voltage differences between two electrodes. Unfortunately, the electrode spacing and their locations on the ground surface have a direct influence on the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements, on the recorded waveforms and on their arrival times. Using a filter theory approach and full waveform numerical simulations of the coupled seismic and electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in porous media, we show that the co-seismic electric arrivals and the small-amplitude EM interface response can be severely distorted and/or attenuated by conventional surface electrode layouts. To this end, we have computed synthetic electrograms providing the electric potential, to allow us to determine voltage differences between two arbitrary locations of electrodes. Unlike the low-pass filter obtained by connecting two geophones in series, the filter associated with a voltage difference is shown to be a band-pass filter. As a result, not only horizontally and obliquely propagating waves but also vertically propagating waves undergo selective frequency attenuation in the 0-150 Hz frequency band used in field measurements. It also turns out that electrode spacing cannot be optimized to enhance the electric signature of typical seismic reflections and EM interface response, neither with horizontal dipoles nor with reasonably sized vertical dipoles. To circumvent this problem, we consider arrangements of 3 and 5 electrodes analogous to multilayer capacitors in electronics. We show that such arrangements are ideally described by low-pass filters preserving the quasi-plane waves corresponding to the EM interface response. However, in reality, these benefits are challenged by the imperfect coupling between the electrodes and the ground, represented by an electrode contact resistance which is possibly frequency-dependent and complex. Somewhat paradoxically, poorly grounded electrodes can in some cases improve the measurement of the electric field. This suggests that electrode contact resistance should be measured whenever possible to be accounted for in the dipole or multi-electrode electric response.",

It has been proposed that observed changes in salinity could be used to infer changes in the water cycle. Here salinity is characterized by the distribution of water masses in salinity coordinates. Mixing acts to collapse the distribution, homogenizing salinity, while evaporation and precipitation stretch the distribution, maintaining the contrast between water masses. A simple model is developed to describe the relationship between the breadth of the distribution, the water cycle and mixing, the later being characterized by an e-folding (mixing) timescale. From observations, mean E-P over the ocean maintains the mean salinity distribution with a mixing timescale of order 50 years. Using observed changes in salinity we thus estimate that the hydrological cycle has increased by approximately 3% over the 60-year record of observations - although the spread in observations is large. In state of the art climate models we compute both the mixing timescale setting the steady (or nearly steady) balance in the pre-industrial climate and the time scale setting the response of ocean salinity to water cycle change. The models tend to be more diffusive than observations, potentially explaining why they display weak salinity amplification in response to warming.",

The Garonne river (56 000 km2, in south-western France) has been selected owing to the availability of operational gauges, and the fact that different modeling platforms, the hydrometeorological model SAFRAN-ISBA-MODCOU and several fine scale hydraulic models, have been extensively evaluated over two reaches of the river. Several routing schemes, ranging from the simple Muskingum method to time-variable parameter kinematic and diffusive waves schemes with time varying parameters, are tested using predetermined hydraulic parameters. The results show that the variable flow velocity scheme is advantageous for discharge computations when compared to the original Muskingum routing method. Additionally, comparisons between water level computations and in situ observations led to root mean square errors of 50-60 cm for the improved Muskingum method and 40-50 cm for the kinematic-diffusive wave method, in the downstream Garonne river. The error is larger than the anticipated SWOT resolution, showing the potential of the mission to improve knowledge of the continental water cycle. Discharge computations are also shown to be comparable to those obtained with high-resolution hydraulic models over two reaches. However, due to the high variability of river parameters (e.g. slope and river width), a robust averaging method is needed to compare the hydraulic model outputs and the regional model. Sensitivity tests are finally performed in order to have a better understanding of the mechanisms which control the key hydrological processes. The results give valuable information about the linearity, Gaussianity and symetry of the model, in order to prepare the assimilation of river heights in the model.",

The French national observatory of glaciers “GLACIOCLIM”, in collaboration with local partners, has been developing such a strategy for several decades on glaciers in the French Alps, the tropical Andes, the Antarctic and the Himalayas. The policy supported by GLACIOCLIM in terms of data sharing relies on: (1) free access through an interactive database which has been recently redesigned; (2) a contribution to the World Glacier Monitoring Service database, sustained by an MoU; and (3) a contribution to the GLIMS initiative for multi-temporal glacier inventories.\nThis presentation will first present the GLACIOCLIM activities and data sets in the different regions where the observatory has been implemented. Secondly, we will focus on the case of the tropical Andes, showing the advantages of combining all the gathered information from \"reference glaciers\" (i.e. glaciers with in situ measurements of mass balance, surface energy balance and hydrological balance) and from glacier changes estimated from remote sensing data at the massif scale, to better understand the causes of the recent acceleration in glacier decrease over the last decades. Finally, we will present a promising method to retrieve annual mass balance data for individual glaciers at the massif scale on the basis of the end-of-summer snowline determined on satellite images, a highly relevant method to produce annual mass balance time-series allowing to spatially expand the information available on the small number \"reference glaciers\" benefiting of in situ monitoring.",

Based on the application of this method for atmospheric, glaciological and hydrological studies in High-Asian catchments, we present recommendations for key areas of uncertainty in the atmospheric modelling strategy.

            "abstract": "Deep-water sediment records in the South China Sea have the potential to allow environment in the adjacent landmasses to be reconstructed since the Eocene rifting of the basin if the effects of provenance and drainage capture can be quantified and accounted for. The rifted margin of South China, fed by the Pearl River, likely holds the simplest record, as until the uplift of Taiwan after ~5 Ma the sediment must be dominantly derived from southern China, which is relatively tectonically quiescent. Provenance data suggest that the Pearl River was likely not involved in the major drainage capture events that affect the Yangtze, Red and Mekong Rivers. Choosing the right monsoon proxy is difficult because heavier rain provides moisture, potentially increasing alteration of sediment, yet greater run-off also causes faster transport, which reduces the time available for alteration to occur. The Middle Miocene is generally identified as the time during which the most altered sediment accumulated, while seismic data also finger this period as one with the fastest sediment delivery rates, indicating rapid erosion onshore. Prior to 22 Ma and during the Mid Miocene Climatic Optimum (15.5-17.0 Ma) conditions were wet and tropical but not very seasonal, i.e. the summer monsoon was weak. Chemical weathering traced by clay minerals and geochemical proxies such as K/Al decreased as the Neogene advanced, likely reflecting falling global temperatures rather than weaker summer rainfall. Weathering decreased even faster between 10 and 8 Ma, when the summer monsoon is inferred to have weakened until 5 Ma, consistent with falling sediment delivery rates to the continental margin. Records after that time are more variable, but are also complicated by sediment flux from Taiwan. The onset of Northern Hemispheric Glaciation appears to be linked to short-lived periods of stronger and weaker monsoon. No simple relationship can be inferred between the intensity of the East Asian Monsoon and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, which is believed to have grown steadily to the SE since the end of the Oligocene.",

Free marketeers promoting the teaching of doubt and controversy to head off regulation. Education standards and curricula that skim over, omit, or misrepresent the causes, effects, risks and possible responses to climate change. Teachers who unknowingly foster confusion by presenting \"both sides\" of a phony scientific controversy. All of these contribute to dramatic differences in the quality and quantity of climate education received by U.S. students. Most U.S. adults and teens fail basic quizzes on energy and climate basics, in large part, because climate science has never been fully accepted as a vital component of a 21st-century science education. Often skipped or skimmed over, human contributions to climate change are sometimes taught as controversy or through debate, perpetuating a climate of confusion in many classrooms. This paper will review recent history of opposition to climate science education, and explore initial findings from a new survey of science teachers on whether, where and how climate change is being taught. It will highlight emerging effective pedagogical practices identified in McCaffrey's Climate Smart & Energy Wise, including the role of new initiatives such as the Next Generation Science Standards and Green Schools, and detail efforts of the Science League of America in countering denial and doubt so that educators can teach consistently and confidently about climate change.",

            "abstract": "The discharge of large volumes of freshwater from glacial lakes to the subpolar North Atlantic is repeatedly cited as one of the main triggers for abrupt centennial-to-millennial length climate cooling during the last deglaciation. Here we investigate an alternative mechanism focusing on whether the break-up and mobilization of thick, multiyear, Arctic sea ice – so called ‘paleocrystic’ sea ice – might have supplied enough freshwater to the Nordic Seas to reduce North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation and weaken the AMOC. Indeed, low biological productivity and extremely low, or absent, sediment deposition in the Arctic during glacial periods suggest that parts of the central and western Arctic Ocean were covered by very thick, perennial ice.\nHere we use a numerical climate model to assess: (1) whether paleocrystic ice covered much of the Arctic Ocean during glacial periods, (2) the mechanisms leading to the collapse and mobilization of Arctic sea-ice into the North Atlantic, and (3) the impact of melting sea ice on global ocean circulation. Preliminary results suggest that Arctic sea ice grows up to ~24 – 54 meters in LGM-type conditions and that the Arctic Ocean north of Fram Strait can store ~1.4 – 2.9x1014 m3 of freshwater as ice. If this ice was released from the Arctic in 1yr (10yrs) it would have been equivalent to a high-latitude freshwater forcing of 3–6 Sv (0.3–0.6 Sv), which is comparable (or larger) in magnitude than most estimates of meltwater emanating from glacial Lake Agassiz believed to have triggered episodes of dramatic global cooling during the last deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "We present new Lagrangian-based transport models for both the time-dependent effective retardation factor and the particle displacement variance of reactive solutes undergoing linear equilibrium sorption. The models represent the influence of hierarchical and multi-scale sedimentary architecture. The formulations are based on hierarchical expressions of the spatial covariance of log-permeability, Y=ln(k), log sorption distribution coefficient, Ξ=ln(Kd), and their spatial cross-covariance. The spatial correlation structure in these covariance expressions is the probability of transitioning across strata types of different scales, and they are parameterized by independent and quantifiable physical attributes of hierarchical sedimentary architecture including univariate statistics for Y, Ξ, and proportions and facies lengths. The models allow the study of the contribution of each scale of stratal architecture to the time-dependent effective retardation factor and the composite particle displacement variance, and thus the study of how hierarchical stratal architecture controls reactive plume spreading. The well-documented perchloroethene (PCE) tracer test at the Borden research site is used to illustrate the models. The models give a viable explanation for the observed PCE plume behavior. The results show that linear equilibrium sorption and heterogeneity in hydraulic and reactive attributes can explain both the PCE plume deceleration and the dispersion that was observed. The models give the contribution of each scale of stratal architecture to these processes.",

            "abstract": "The bulk of the Earth’s interior is not directly accessible, yet redox processes occurring deep within drive many of the events observed at its surface. Laboratory studies of the relevant minerals at the appropriate pressure and temperature conditions have been pivotal in advancing our understanding of the Earth’s interior. Iron plays an important role because it is the only major element with multiple electronic configurations (oxidation and spin state); however most of our knowledge regarding the oxidation state of iron in deep mantle phases is based on measurements of samples quenched from high temperature and sometimes also from high pressure. Mössbauer spectroscopy has been a key player in such studies and results on quenched samples have shown that the oxidation state of iron varies considerably through the mantle, from predominantly ferrous iron in upper mantle and transition zone phases to roughly 50% ferric iron in silicate perovskite (bridgmanite) due to the strong affinity of ferric iron for that phase in the presence of trivalent aluminium. Mössbauer measurements at pressures and temperatures along the geotherm are impractical using conventional radioactive sources due to their low brightness and the extremely limited possibilities for focusing in a laboratory setting. To address these limitations, we have developed an energy domain Synchrotron Mössbauer Source (SMS) on beamline ID18 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility that enables rapid collection of high quality energy domain Mössbauer spectra, and coupled with a portable double-sided laser heating system, SMS spectra can be collected on iron-containing mantle phases at pressures and temperatures up to those near the Earth’s core in only a few hours (or less). The presentation will showcase recent results documenting in situ determination of iron oxidation state in lower mantle phases and discuss their implications for redox sensitive processes taking place throughout the Earth’s interior.",

We investigate the 940‑m‑long drill core SG-1 from the western Qaidam Basin, which is characterized by a long-term transition from a semi-deep freshwater lake to nearly complete exsiccation of the water body, detected by several studies including geochemical and lithological observations. Based on magnetostratigraphy and optically stimulated luminescence dating, and refined by orbital tuning, the SG-1 core spans the interval from 2.69 to 0.1 Ma. Moisture availability in the western Qaidam Basin deduced from the pollen ratio Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae (A/C), suggests desert to steppe vegetation along core SG-1 as a long-term feature. Magnetic susceptibility (χ) is well suited for the high-resolution investigation of paleohumidity. The meaning of χ as a paleohydrology proxy is shown by comparing χ to other magnetic proxies for checking its relation to magnetic grain sizes and magnetic mineralogy as well as to pollen results. χ variations are analyzed to obtain regional information on the factors leading to the drying process of the Qaidam paleolake as well as potential driving factors for humidity fluctuations (e.g., insolation). An important topic that needs further investigation is the influence of monsoon in the Qaidam Basin. While the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau is directly affected by monsoon precipitation through the topographic barrier, its influence in the past is questionable in the hyper-arid Qaidam Basin. We check a potential coupling to the monsoon system in the western Qaidam Basin by comparing our χ record to reconstructions of the Asian monsoon system from other archives as well as searching evidence from orbital cyclicities found in the χ time series.",

The G is often associated with the LAB, but its sharpness and the low correlation between its depth and oceanic plate age suggest a compositional origin, in contradiction with tomographic models of isotropic wave velocities.\nHere, we inverted fundamental and higher mode anisotropic Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps to which we applied non-linear crustal corrections. Our model defines three layers within the upper 250km of the mantle. The bottom layer is characterized by relatively low velocities, strong (3%) azimuthal anisotropy, fast seismic directions that follow the absolute plate motion (APM), and strong (5%) radial anisotropy with VSH>VSV. This suggests alignment of olivine fast axes with mantle flow direction in the asthenosphere. The middle layer has fast axes aligned with the paleospreading directions, and the boundary between the bottom and middle layers follows a half-space cooling model. This suggests a thermal origin of the LAB if we use the change in alignment of the fast axes with the APM as a proxy for the LAB.\nRemarkably, a change in azimuthal anisotropy is found between the two top layers at a roughly constant depth that coincides with the location of the G. The G is therefore located within the thermal lithosphere and is primarily associated with a vertical gradient in azimuthal anisotropy, which may result from compositional changes. Dehydration of the mantle underlying mid-ocean ridges offers a possible explanation for our results. It could generate a chemically depleted, viscous layer that becomes overprinted by lowered temperatures as the plate cools and migrates away from the ridge. The olivine fast axes would align with the spreading direction at the ridge in the underlying hydrated, more deformable bottom layer, yielding an anisotropic discontinuity at the base of the dehydrated layer. This alignment would be frozen in the part of the lithosphere that lies below the chemical depletion boundary as the lid cools and thickens, whereas flow in the warmer asthenosphere would align with present-day APM.",

Ebullition is a major pathway for transporting anaerobically produced CH4 from lake sediments to the atmosphere, and represents a difficult to quantify CH4 source. In post-glacial arctic lakes during the ice-free season, solar shortwave energy input can constrain CH4 productivity via control of sediment temperature. Utilizing long-term temperature trends we calculate CH4 ebullition from three subarctic lakes in northern Sweden over the period of 1916-2079. Using observed energy trends, the average lake emission is estimated at 1128 mg m-2 yr-1 for 1916-1926; we predict an approximately 2000 mg m-2 yr-1 in the 2040-2079 period. Our study lakes and our measured CH4 ebullition rates are typical for the pan-Arctic, suggesting that such increases in CH4 ebullition might be widespread.",

            "abstract": "How and why Differentiation occurs has dominated Igneous Petrology since its beginning (~1880) even though many of the problems associated with it have been thoroughly solved. Rediscovery of the proverbial wheel with new techniques impedes progress. As soon as thin section petrography was combined with rock and mineral chemistry, rock diversity, compositional suites, and petrographic provinces all became obvious. The masterful 1902 CIPW norm in a real sense solved the chemical mystery of differentiation: rocks are related by the addition and subtraction of minerals in the anciently appreciated process of fractional crystallization. Yet few believed this, even after phase equilibria arrived. Assimilation, gas transfer, magma mixing, Soret diffusion, immiscibility, and other processes had strong adherents, even though by 1897 Becker conclusively showed the ineffectiveness of molecular diffusion in large-scale processes. The enormity of heat to molecular diffusion (today’s Lewis no.) should have been convincing; but few paid attention. Bowen did, and he refined and restated the result; few still paid attention. And in spite of his truly masterful command of experiment and field relations in promoting fractional crystallization, Fenner and others fought him with odd arguments. The beauty of phase equilibria eventually dominated at the expense of knowing the physical side of differentiation. Bowen himself saw and struggled with the connection between physical and chemical processes. Progress has come from new concepts in heat transfer, kinetics, and slurry dynamics. The key approach is understanding the dynamic competition between spatial rates of solidification and all other processes. The lesson is clear: Scholarship and combined field, laboratory and technical expertise are critical to understanding magmatic processes. Magma is a limitlessly enchanting and challenging material wherein physical processes buttressed by chemistry govern.",

            "abstract": "Many variables possess a hierarchical structure reflected in how their increments vary in space and/or time. Quite commonly the increments (a) fluctuate in a highly irregular manner; (b) possess symmetric, non-Gaussian frequency distributions characterized by heavy tails that often decay with separation distance or lag; (c) exhibit nonlinear power-law scaling of sample structure functions in a midrange of lags, with breakdown in such scaling at small and large lags; (d) show extended power-law scaling (ESS) at all lags; and (e) display nonlinear scaling of power-law exponent with order of sample structure function. Some interpret this to imply that the variables are multifractal, which explains neither breakdowns in power-law scaling nor ESS. We offer an alternative interpretation consistent with all above phenomena. It views data as samples from stationary, anisotropic sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to truncated fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) or truncated fractional Gaussian noise (tfGn). The fields are scaled Gaussian mixtures with random variances. Truncation of fBm and fGn entails filtering out components below data measurement or resolution scale and above domain scale. Our novel interpretation of the data allows us to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of all parameters characterizing the underlying truncated sub-Gaussian fields. These parameters in turn make it possible to downscale or upscale all statistical moments to situations entailing smaller or larger measurement or resolution and sampling scales, respectively. They also allow one to perform conditional or unconditional Monte Carlo simulations of random field realizations corresponding to these scales. Aspects of our approach are illustrated on field and laboratory measured porous and fractured rock permeabilities, as well as soil texture characteristics and neural network estimates of unsaturated hydraulic parameters in a deep vadose zone near Phoenix, Arizona. We also use our approach to investigate the scaling of statistics characterizing vertical increments in neutron porosity data, and extreme values of these increments, from six deep boreholes in three oil and/or gas producing depositional environments.",

Neither the underlying flow and transport phenomena nor their host environment can be observed or described with certainty at all scales and locations of relevance. It has thus become increasingly common to represent hydraulic and transport characteristics of geologic media by random functions of space and to model flow and transport in such media stochastically. One approach is to generate multiple random realizations of medium hydraulic and transport properties, primarily permeability and (less commonly) advective porosity, conditional on measured values of these quantities (when available) using geostatistical techniques; solving standard Darcian flow and Fickian transport equations in each conditionally generated random property field; and averaging the results. Quantities averaged in this manner constitute smooth but optimal estimates of their true but unknown counterparts. Significantly, fluid and solute fluxes estimated in this manner are respectively non-Darcian and non-Fickian. This is reflected unambiguously in the space-time nonlocal nature of equations governing (conditional) expectations (ensemble means) of flow and transport variables in which fluxes depend not only on current local but also on past and distant gradients of heads and concentrations. We present approximate computational solutions to these equations which illustrate non-Darcian mean flow and anomalous mean transport in two-dimensional domains as functions of flow regime, proximity to boundaries and extent of conditioning on measured parameter values. We also show approximate solutions of corresponding conditional second moment equations which provide measures of uncertainty associated with smooth estimates of concentration and flux.",

Two cases of particular relevance include the so-called injection problem at shock waves. In particular, the question of how particles are injected into the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism at a perpendicular shock can be addressed on the basis of a kappa distribution. We discuss briefly the possible formation of a kappa distribution at a shock and show how this is then accelerated at a quasi-perpendicular shock. These results are related to observed energetic particle spectra downstream of an interplanetary shock. The reverse question at the heliospheric termination shock is discussed viz., what form does the pickup ion distribution downstream of the heliospheric termination shock assume? We show that this closely resembles a kappa distribution.

            "abstract": "Fault roughness is commonly ~0.1-1% at the outcrop exposure scale. More mature faults are smoother than less mature ones, but the overall range of roughness is surprisingly limited which suggests dynamic control. In addition, the power spectra of many exposed fault surfaces follow a single power law over scales from millimeters to 10’s of meters. This is another surprising observation as distinct structures such as slickenlines and mullions are clearly visible on the same surfaces at well-defined scales.\nWe can reconcile both observations by suggesting that the roughness of fault surfaces is controlled by the maximum strain that can be supported elastically in the wallrock. If the fault surface topography requires more than 0.1-1% strain, it fails.\nInvoking wallrock strength explains two additional observations on the Corona Heights fault for which we have extensive roughness data. Firstly, the surface is isotropic below a scale of 30 microns and has grooves at larger scales. Samples from at least three other faults (Dixie Valley, Mount St. Helens and San Andreas) also are isotropic at scales below 10’s of microns. If grooves can only persist when the walls of the grooves have a sufficiently low slope to maintain the shape, this scale of isotropy can be predicted based on the measured slip perpendicular roughness data. The observed 30 micron scale at Corona Heights is consistent with an elastic strain of 0.01 estimated from the observed slip perpendicular roughness with a Hurst exponent of 0.8. The second observation at Corona Heights is that slickenlines are not deflected around meter-scale mullions. Yielding of these mullions at centimeter to meter scale is predicted from the slip parallel roughness as measured here.\nThe success of the strain criterion for Corona Heights supports it as the appropriate control on fault roughness. Micromechanically, the criterion implies that failure of the fault surface is a continual process during slip. Macroscopically, the fundamental nature of the control means that 0.1 to 1% roughness should be ubiquitous on faults and can generally be used for simulating ground motion. An important caveat is that the scale-dependence of strength may result in a difference in the yield criterion at large-scales. The commonly observed values of the Hurst exponent below 1 may capture this scale-dependence.",

            "abstract": "Emergency responders must “see” the effects of an earthquake clearly and rapidly for effective response. Mobile phone and information technology can be used to measure ground motion intensity parameters and relay that information to emergency responders. However, the phone sensor is an imperfect device and has a limited operational range. Thus, shake table tests were performed to evaluate their reliability as seismic monitoring instruments. Representative handheld devices, either rigidly connected to the table or free to move, measured shaking intensity parameters well. Bias in 5%-damped spectral accelerations measured by phones was less than 0.05 and 0.2 [log(g)] during one-dimensional (1-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) shaking in frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 10 Hz. They did tend to over-estimate the Arias Intensity, but this error declined for stronger motions with larger signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, much of the data about infrastructure performance and geotechnical effects of an earthquake are lost soon after an earthquake occurs as efforts move to the recovery phase. A better methodology for reliable and rapid collection of perishable hazards data will enhance scientific inquiry and accelerate the building of disaster-resilient cities. Post-earthquake reconnaissance efforts can be aided through the strategic collection and reuse of social media data and other remote sources of information. This is demonstrated through their use following the NSF-sponsored GEER response to the September 2013 flooding in Colorado. With these ubiquitous measurement devices in the hands of the citizen seismologist, a more accurate and rapid portrayal of the damage distribution during an earthquake may be provided to emergency responders and to the public.",

            "abstract": "Drastic reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the most obvious way to stabilize atmospheric CO2. However, there is growing risk that effective emissions reduction policies and technologies will not engage soon enough to avoid significant CO2-induced climate and ocean acidification impacts. This realization has lead to increased interest (e.g., IPCC AR5, 2014; NRC/NAS, 2014) in the possibility of pro-actively increasing CO2 removal (CDR) from the atmosphere above the 55% of our emissions that are already removed from air by natural land and ocean processes. While a variety of biotic, abiotic, and hybrid CDR methods have been proposed, those involving geochemistry have much to recommend them. These methods employ the same geochemical reactions that naturally and effectively remove excess planetary CO2 and neutralize ocean acidity on geologic time scales. These reactions proceed when the hydrosphere, acidified by excess air CO2, contacts and reacts with carbonate and silicate minerals (>90% of the Earth’s crust), producing dissolved bicarbonates and carbonates, i.e., ocean alkalinity. This alkalinity is eventually removed and the excess carbon stored via carbonate precipitation. So while the importance and global effectiveness of such reactions are not in question, it remains to be seen if this very slow, natural CDR could be safely and cost-effectively accelerated to help manage air CO2 levels on human rather than geologic time scales. Various terrestrial and marine, geochemistry-based CDR methods will be reviewed including: 1) the addition of minerals to soils and the ocean, 2) removal of CO2 from waste streams, esp. from biomass energy, via wet mineral contacting, and 3) the production and use of mineral derivatives, e.g. oxides or hydroxides, as CDR agents. The additional potential environmental benefits (e.g., reversal of ocean carbonate saturation loss) and impacts (e.g., increased mineral extraction), as well as potential economics will also be discussed.",

The ocean floor in this region exhibits many bathymetric features, most notably the multiple inactive fracture zones within the Wharton Basin and the Ninetyeast Ridge. The 11 April 2012 MW 8.7 and 8.2 strike-slip events that took place in this area are unique because their rupture appears to have extended to a depth where brittle failure, and thus seismic activity, was considered to be impossible. We analyze multiple intraplate earthquakes that have occurred throughout the Indian Ocean to better constrain their focal depths in order to enhance our understanding of how deep intraplate events are occurring and more importantly determine if the ruptures are originating within a ductile regime. Selected events are located within the Indian Ocean away from major plate boundaries. A majority are within the deforming Indo-Australian tectonic plate. Events primarily display thrust mechanisms with some strike-slip or a combination of the two. All events are between MW5.5-6.5. Event selections were handled this way in order to facilitate the analysis of teleseismic waveforms using a point source approximation. From these criteria we gathered a suite of 15 intraplate events. Synthetic seismograms of direct P-waves and depth phases are computed using a 1-D propagator matrix approach and compared with global teleseismic waveform data to determine a best depth for each event. To generate our synthetic seismograms we utilized the CRUST1.0 software, a global crustal model that generates velocity values at the hypocenter of our events. Our waveform analysis results reveal that our depths diverge from the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) depths, which underestimate our deep lithosphere events and overestimate our shallow depths by as much as 17 km. We determined a depth of 45km for our deepest event. We will show a comparison of our final earthquake depths with the lithospheric thickness based on halfspace cooling models and the local plate age.",

            "abstract": "The depth of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) and the change in properties across the lithosphere, asthenosphere, and LAB in various tectonic settings are captured in a variety of geophysical data, including seismic velocities and electrical conductivity. A sharp drop in shear wave velocity and increase in electrical conductivity can potentially be caused by the appearance of partial melt at or below the LAB but the chemical and dynamic stability of partial melt across lithosphere and at LAB remain debated.\nHere I apply the recent models of mantle melting in the presence of water and carbon [1, 2] to evaluate the domains of stability of partial melt both beneath continents and oceans. The model allows prediction of the possible presence, the fraction, and composition of partial melt as a function of depth, bulk C and H2O content, and fO2 [3] in various geologic/tectonic settings.\nThe results show that while a hydrous, carbonated melt is stable only beneath LAB and in the asthenospheric mantle beneath oceans, continental mantle can contain a carbonate-rich melt within the lithosphere. For geotherms corresponding to surface heat flux (SHF) of 40-50 mW m−2, which also match P-T estimates beneath cratons based on thermo-barometry of peridotite xenoliths [4], the solidus of fertile peridotite with trace amount of CO2 and H2O is crossed at depths as shallow as 80-120 km [5]. If elevated geotherms of the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic terrains are applied, carbonatitic melt becomes stable somewhat shallower. These depths are similar to those argued for a mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD) where a negative velocity gradient has been detected much shallower than the proposed depth of LAB in many places. With a drop in oxygen fugacity with depth, a freezing of carbonatitic melt may be expected at intermediate depths (~150-200 km). At 200-250 km a hydrous, carbonated silicate melt may reappear owing to the interplay of fO2 and freezing point depression effect of CO2 + H2O, but such melting may be variable depending on redox heterogeneity of the mantle at depths.\n[1] O’Leary et al.

Especially magnetic susceptibility (χ) turned out to be a useful proxy indicating past humidity changes in the study region. The causes of χ variation could be related to weathering (low-temperature oxidation) in the catchment area and a changing catchment area, respectively. To benefit further from magnetic properties as high-resolution paleoclimate proxies in the Qaidam paleolake, we expand our magnetic record to the late Miocene by investigating magnetic properties of the 723‑m deep drilling SG-1b. While SG-1 was drilled in the flat lying strata of the Chahansilatu sub-basin, SG-1b was recovered from the adjacent Jianshan anticline (in ~20 km distance from SG-1). Magnetostratigraphy of core SG-1b detects a time span ranging from 7.3 to 1.6 Ma, missing the younger sequence as a consequence of the anticline structure. We analyze climatic implications of the magnetic record of SG-1b, especially by observing 750 hysteresis loops and 20 FORC diagrams, and check for small-scale variations of the studied sediments by comparing χ of bulk samples (in the order of 10 g) and samples used for hysteresis measurements (in the order of 0.01 g). Spectral analysis based on the time scale provided by magnetostratigraphy reveals variations of χ in the order of Milankovitch cycles (precession, obliquity, and eccentricity) indicating insolation changes as one important driving factor of the magnetic concentration signal. The magnetic records of SG-1 and SG-1b are also used to check implications of the anticline structure on magnetic signatures by comparing the overlapping interval of both cores (2.69–1.6 Ma).",

Whether they are mirrored in the opposite hemisphere, following along geomagnetic field (B) lines, or not, remains an open question. We consider the issue of conjugacy in terms of electrical coupling, and two types of wavelike structures, those produced by plasma transport along B lines (via ion drag), and those produced by plasma transport transverse to B lines (via a polarization electric field). The presence or absence of conjugate plasma structures was investigated by analyzing total electron content (TEC) variations measured with a ground cluster of radio beacon receivers. Polar-orbiting beacon satellites (Cosmos series) and an equatorial-orbiting (Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System, or C/NOFS) beacon satellite were used. We present examples of conjugate and non-conjugate plasma structures, which are consistent with the notion that a polarization electric field develops, which then maps along B lines to the conjugate hemisphere.",

            "abstract": "The outer radiation belt consists of relativistic (≳0.5 MeV) electrons trapped on closed trajectories around Earth where its magnetic field is nearly dipolar. During increased geomagnetic activity electron intensities in the belt can vary by orders of magnitude at different spatial and temporal scale. The main phase of geomagnetic storms often produces deep depletions of electron intensities over broad regions of the outer belt. Previous studies identified three possible processes that can contribute to the depletions: fully adiabatic inflation of electron drift orbits caused the ring current growth, electron loss into the atmosphere due to pitch-angle scattering by plasma waves (e.g., EMIC and whistler waves), and electron escape through the magnetopause boundary. In this paper we investigate the relative importance of the magnetopause losses to the rapid depletion of the outer belt observed at the Van Allen Probes spacecraft during the main phase of March 17, 2013 storm. The intensities of > 1 MeV electrons were depleted by more that an order of magnitude over the entire radial extent of the belt in less than 6 hours after the sudden storm commencement. For the analysis we used three-dimensional test-particle simulations of global evolution of the outer belt in the Tsyganenko-Sitnov (TS07D) magnetic field model with the inductive electric field. The comparison of the simulation results with electron measurements from the MagEIS experiment shows that the magnetopause losses in the model accounts for most of the observed depletion. The individual electron motion the process is non-adiabatic; the third invariant is violated by global variations of the inner magnetospheric fields caused by the magnetopause compressions and the buildup of ring current, while the second invariant is violated at drift orbit bifurcations. The analysis shows that the observed deep depletion of radiation belt intensities is enabled by the change in the global configuration of magnetic field due to storm-time development of the ring current; a simulation of electron evolution without a ring current produces a much weaker depletion.",

Tides, winds, waves, and currents were measured from May 1 to 28, 2012 in and near New River Inlet, NC. Offshore significant wave heights were 0 to 3 m, and wind speeds ranged from 0 to 16 m/s. The long, narrow inlet is about 1000 m wide where it opens onto the ebb shoal, narrows to 100 m wide about 1000 m inland, and connects to the Intracoastal Waterway (which connects to additional ocean inlets about 12 and 36 km north and south, respectively) about 3000 m inland. Tides in the inlet are progressive and inlet flows are in phase with water depths. Measurements also were collected during the summers of 2011-2014, including during Hurricanes Irene and Sandy (offshore significant wave heights > 5 m and winds > 15 m/s), in Katama Bay, MA, which connects to Vineyard Sound via Edgartown Channel and to the Atlantic Ocean via Katama Inlet. During this period, Katama Inlet migrated east about 1000 m, narrowed from 400 to 100 m wide, changed depth from 7 to 2 m, and lengthened from 200 to 1000 m. Tidal flows in Katama Inlet are forced by sea level gradients resulting from the 3-hr phase lag between tides in Vineyard Sound and the Atlantic Ocean.\nAnalyses of the momentum balances suggest that waves drive flows into the mouths of the inlets during storms. The timing of the storms relative to ebb and flood, and wind effects, may affect the discharge and sediment transport through the inlet. Winds and waves also drive alongshore flows on the ebb shoals. Lateral flows at bends in New River Inlet, which may be important to the along-inlet transfer of momentum and to mixing, are affected by winds. The importance of connections to additional inlets in multi-inlet systems will be discussed.\nFunded by ONR, ASD(R&E), NSF, Sea Grant, and NDSEG.",

            "abstract": "The giant planet magnetospheres are filled with neutral and ionized gases originating from satellites orbiting deep within the magnetosphere. The complex chemical and physical pathways for the flow of mass and energy in this partially ionized plasma environment is critical for understanding magnetospheric dynamics. The flow of mass at Jupiter and Saturn begins, primarily, with neutral gases emanating from Io (~1000 kg/s) and Enceladus (~200 kg/s). In addition to ionization losses, the neutral gases are absorbed by the planet, its rings, or escape at high speeds from the magnetosphere via charge exchange reactions. The net result is a centrifugally confined torus of plasma that is transported radially outward, distorting the magnetic field into a magnetodisc configuration. Ultimately the plasma is lost to the solar wind. A critical parameter for shaping the magnetodisc and determining its dynamics is the radial plasma mass transport rate (~500 kg/s and ~50 kg/s for Jupiter and Saturn respectively). Given the plasma transport rates, several simple properties of the giant magnetodiscs can be estimated including the physical scale of the magnetosphere, the magnetic flux transport, and the magnitude of azimuthal magnetic field bendback. We will discuss transport-related magnetic flux conservation and the mystery of plasma heating—two critical issues for shaping the giant planet magnetospheres.",

            "abstract": "Since the majority of crustal and mantle rocks are polymineralic, it is important to consider the effects of secondary mineral phases on their rheological properties. To examine these effects, we have conducted grain growth and deformation experiments on samples composed of different volumetric fractions of forsterite (Fo) and enstatite (En) at 1 atmosphere and temperatures from 1260 to 1360°C.\nThe results of our grain growth experiments indicate that the grain size ratios of Fo and En in annealed (reference) and deformed samples follow a Zener relationship with dI/dII = b/fIIz, where dI/dII is the grain size of the primary or secondary phase, b and z are the Zener parameters relating grain boundary energies and location of secondary phase, and fII is the volume fraction of the associated phase. Grain growth in the reference samples conforms to the relationship ds 4-d04 = kt, where ds is the grain size under static conditions, d0 is the initial grain size, k is the grain growth coefficient, and t is time. The growth coefficient of Fo decrease with increasing En volume fraction (fEn), and is consistent with theoretical predictions of Ardell's grain growth model that incorporates physical parameters such as diffusivity and interfacial energy of the mineral phases.\nThe results of our deformation experiments at constant temperature and strain rate indicate that the flow stress decreases with increasing fEn, for samples with 0 < fEn < 0.5, and increases with increasing fEn, for samples with 0.5 < fEn < 1. The values of the pre-exponential term, stress and grain size exponents, and activation energy in the constitutive equation for a wide range of fEn were determined. The majority of samples exhibited diffusion accommodated grain boundary sliding creep (i.e., stress exponent = 1). The viscosity measured for all samples is fit well by a model that takes into account (1) grain size calculated from grain growth laws established in our experiments and (2) the flow laws for monomineralic systems of forsterite and enstatite determined here. Our results have important implications for the lower crust and upper mantle where lithologies ranging from dunite to pyroxenite are prevalent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be extended to make predictions of viscosity in other mineral assemblages.",

            "abstract": "A number of studies have posited that coastally-generated eddies could cool the southeast Pacific Ocean (SEP) by advecting cool, upwelled waters offshore. We examine this mechanism by characterizing the upper-ocean properties of mesoscale eddies in the SEP with a variety of observations. Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies observed during two cruises featured deep positive salinity anomalies along the 26.5 kg m-3 isopycnal, indicating that the eddies had likely trapped and transported coastal waters offshore. The cyclonic eddies observed during the cruises were characterized by shoaling isopycnals in the upper 200 m and cool near-surface temperature anomalies, whereas the upper-ocean structure of anticyclonic eddies was more variable. Using a variety of large-scale observations, including Argo float profiles, drifter records, and satellite sea surface temperature fields, we show that, relative to mean conditions, cyclonic eddies are associated with cooler surface temperatures and that anticyclonic eddies are associated with warmer surface temperatures. Within each data set, the mean eddy surface temperature anomalies are small, and of approximately equal magnitude but opposite sign. Eddy statistics drawn from satellite altimetry data reveal that cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies occur with similar frequency and have similar average radii in the SEP. A satellite-based estimate of the surface-layer eddy heat flux divergence, while large in coastal regions, is small when averaged over the SEP, suggesting that eddies do not substantially contribute to cooling the surface layer of the SEP.",

            "abstract": "50 years ago, Gast, Tilton and Hedge demonstrated that the oceanic mantle is isotopically heterogeneous. 28 years ago, Zindler and Hart formalized the concept of geochemical mantle components, with an attendant, to some, odious, acronym soup. Work on a marriage of mantle geochemistry and dynamics continues unabated. We know unequivocally that the mantle is chemically heterogeneous; we do not know the scale lengths of these heterogeneities. We know unequivocally that these heterogeneities have persisted for eons (Gy); we do not know where they were formed or where they are stored. Through the kind auspices of the Plume Model, we plausibly have access to the whole mantle.\nThe most accessible and well understood mantle reservoir is the upper depleted MORB mantle (DMM). Classically, this mantle was depleted by extraction of oceanic and continental crust from a “chondritic” bulk silicate Earth. In this post-Boyet and Carlson world, the complementary enriched reservoir may instead be hidden in the deepest mantle. In this case, DMM will become an endangered acronym.\nHofmann and White (1982) argued that radiogenic Pb mantle (HIMU) is re-cycled ocean crust, and this is a comfortably viable model. It does require some ad hoc chemical manipulations during subduction. Given 2 Gy of aggregate mantle strains, the mafic component in HIMU may be of small length scale (< 50 m), possibly subsumed into the dominant peridotitic lithology. This mantle species is globally widespread.\nEnriched mantles (EM1 and EM2) almost certainly reflect recycling of enriched continental material. This was splendidly verified by Jackson et al (2007), with 87Sr/86Sr in Samoan EM2 lavas up to 0.721. The lithology and length scale of EM1 and EM2 is unconstrained. EM1 is globally present; EM2 is confined to the SW Pacific hotspots.\nFOZO is a work in progress; many would like to see it become extinct!\nThe trace element signatures of HIMU and FOZO mantles have been constrained using melting models; in both cases the spidergrams are “enriched” with peaks at Nb-Ta of 2x and 4x bulk silicate earth, respectively, but with quite different shapes. As is typical with OIB, the derived source compositions are incompatible with the isotopic signatures, requiring a fairly recent “enrichment” event (possibly auto-metasomatism).",

            "abstract": "Understanding current and projected trends in extreme precipitation, and climate model capability to simulate such events, is essential for evaluation of present and future climate change impacts on agriculture, life, and property throughout the United States. While several studies have examined annual trends in extreme precipitation, little is known about seasonal trends and projections. Annually, the Extreme Precipitation Index (EPI) shows that over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS), as a whole, extreme precipitation events have been increasing in frequency over time but with large disparities among various regions in the U.S. We expand on our previous study (Janssen et al., Earth’s Future, 2014) by evaluating trends in seasonal extreme precipitation events, for the CONUS, from observations and available historical and projected simulations from CMIP5 climate models. Based around variations of the EPI, seasonal changes and trends are examined using two methods. The first method looks at each year as a whole and tracks where within each year the changes in frequency of extreme precipitation events are happening. This determines within which season(s) the observed and simulated annual changes are occurring. Using this method we discovered that increases in events during the summer give the greatest contribution to the annual increase in the Midwest region, with fall showing the greatest increase for both the Northeast region and for the CONUS overall. The second method, rather than considering all the seasons collectively for each year, tracks changes individually by analyzing each season directly relative to itself throughout the time period. Thus, summer is compared to previous summers, winters compared to previous winters, and so on. This shows that each season, when taken in relation to itself, has individually experienced an overall increasing trend in extreme precipitation events over the last century. Model performance was also analyzed by season showing similar results to those seen annually. This presentation will examine the findings of historical and projected seasonal trends for extreme precipitation over the CONUS, with the objectives of identifying trends and evaluating climate model performance on a seasonal timeframe.",

            "abstract": "We report Goldstone radar (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) observations and shape and spin state modeling of near-Earth asteroid (214869) 2007 PA8. We observed 2007 PA8 on 16 days between Oct 16-Nov 13, 2012 when the asteroid was within 0.14 AU of Earth. Closest approach was on Nov 5 at a distance of 0.043 AU (17 lunar distances). Images obtained with Goldstone's new chirp system achieved range resolution as fine as 3.75 m, placing thousands of pixels on the asteroid’s surface and revealing that 2007 PA8 is an elongated, asymmetric object. Surface features include angularities, multiple facets, and a concavity approximately several hundred meters in diameter. We used the Shape software [1, 2] to estimate the asteroid's 3D shape and spin state. The initial shape of the asteroid was parameterized as an ovoid with dimensions of 1.85 kmx1.25 kmx1.20 km in principal axis (PA) rotation with rotational rates of 80-100 deg/day to match the progression of features visible in the images. This yielded two candidate spin states: one near the south ecliptic pole and another near ecliptic longitude and latitude of (270, +17) deg. However, PA spin state models predict that images from Oct 31 and Nov 11 should be very similar, but the images on those two days appear dramatically different. As a result, we expanded the spin state search to include non-principal axis (NPA) rotation. The best fit was obtained with NPA rotation in short-axis mode with an average period of precession by the long axis around the angular momentum vector of 4.25 days and an oscillatory period around the long axis of 20.16 days. The amplitude of rolling around the long axis is 42 deg. The angular momentum vector points within 10 deg of ecliptic longitude and latitude of (273, +16) deg. 2007 PA8 is only the second confirmed short-axis mode NPA rotator found in the near-Earth asteroid population, after (99942) Apophis [3].\n",

We describe an integrated research effort involving observations, modeling and prediction to explore how climate and weather-related forcing in conjunction with changing human activity can alter the transfer of water, carbon and nutrients through various terrestrial reservoirs into rivers, estuaries, and coastal ocean waters, ultimately impacting the biogeochemistry and trophic dynamics of the coastal ocean. We refer to recent NSF- and NASA-funded research applying an integrated suite of models in conjunction with remotely sensed as well as targeted in situ observations to understand processes controlling fluxes on land and their coupling to riverine, estuarine and ocean ecosystems. Past and present conditions across land-ocean continua are examined, as well as coupled model projections of future scenarios for climate, land-use and other human activity. Finally, we provide examples of approaches for determining an overall carbon balance in coastal margins and for describing and predicting how climate and land use changes impact coastal water quality, including coastal eutrophication, hypoxia and ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "River modeling is the processing of setting up a physically-based hydrodynamic model that can simulate the water flow dynamics of a stream network against time varying boundary conditions. Such river models are an important component of any flood forecasting system that forecasts river levels in flood prone regions. However, many large river basins in the developing world such as the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna (GBM), Indus, Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong and Niger are mostly ungauged. Such large basins lack the necessary in-situ measurements of river bed depth/slope, bathymetry (river cross section), floodplain mapping and boundary condition flows for forcing a river model. For such basins, proxy approaches relying mostly on remote sensing data from space platforms are the only alternative. In this study, we share our experience of setting up the widely-used 1-D river model over the entire GBM basin and its stream network. Good quality in-situ measurements of river hydraulics (cross section, slope, flow) was available only for the downstream and flood prone region of the basin, which comprises only 7% of the basin area. For the remaining 93% of the basin area, we resorted to the use of data from the following satellite sensors to build a workable river model: a) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for deriving bed slope; b) LANDSAT/MODIS for updating river network and flow direction generated by elevation data; c) radar altimetry data to build depth versus width relationship at river locations; d) satellite precipitation based hydrologic modeling of lateral flows into main stem rivers. In addition, we referred to an extensive body of literature to estimate the prevailing baseline hydraulics of rivers in the ungauged region. We measured success of our approach by systematically testing how well the basin-wide river model could simulate river level dynamics at two measured locations inside Bangladesh. Our experience of river modeling was replete with numerous hurdles that we did not anticipate, and often required a change in plan. In this study we summarize these key hurdles faced and offer a step by step approach to setting up river models for large ungauged river basins. Such a guide can be useful for the community wishing to set up RAS type models in basins such as Niger, Mekong, Irrawaddy, Indus etc.",

            "abstract": "The essential feature of magnetic reconnection is that it energizes plasma particles by converting magnetic energy to particle energy [1]. This talk addresses this key unresolved question; how is magnetic energy converted to plasma kinetic energy during reconnection? The mechanisms responsible for the energization of plasma particles in the magnetic reconnection layer have been investigated in the MRX device together with quantitative evaluation of conversion of magnetic energy to ions and electrons. An analysis is made in terms of two-fluid physics based on the measurements of two-dimensional profiles of 1) electric potential, 2) flow vectors of electrons and ions, and 3) the electron temperature, Te and the ion temperature, Ti in the layer [2,3]. It is shown that more than 50 % of magnetic energy is converted to plasma particles, of which 2/3 transferred to ions and 1/3 to electrons, at a remarkably fast speed (~0.2VA) in the reconnection layer [3]. In a reconnection region of effectively similar size in the Earth’s magnetotail, the energy partition was recently measured during multiple passages of the Cluster satellites [4]. The half length of the tail reconnection layer (L) was estimated to be 2000–4000 km namely 3–6di; the scale length is very similar to the MRX case, L ~ 3di. Reconnection in the magneto-tail is driven by an external force, i.e., the solar wind, and the boundary conditions are very similar to the MRX setup. The observed energy partition is notably similar, namely, more than 50% of the magnetic energy flux is converted to the particle energy flux, which is dominated by the ion enthalpy flux, with smaller contributions from the electron enthalpy and heat flux. A broad implication will be discussed.\nWork supported by DOE, NASA, and NSF. Fig.1: Measured ion flow vectors in the reconnection plane with measured 2-D profile of the plasma potential φ_p.

            "abstract": "Tsunamis are a leading natural threat to coastal communities, and events such as the 2011 Japan and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis caused widespread, crippling damages to coastal infrastructure. Yet, these events also called attention to the role of coastal forest as sustainable mitigation against tsunami hazard. Here, we present large-scale experiments of tsunami runup and withdrawal on a steeply sloping beach in the presence of patchy forest.\nThe forest is modeled using 1.2-m diameter macro-roughness patches of varying resistance were constructed from staggered arrays of 2.7-cm diameter rigid cylinders. Macro-roughness patches were affixed in a staggered arrangement with mean spacing of 3.2 m between patches (Fig. 1). The basin depth and wave height at the wavemaker were 0.73 m and 0.43 m, respectively, such that a broken roller formed offshore of the still-water line.\nPoint measurements of velocity and flow depth were made at twenty locations using co-located acoustic Doppler velocimeters and sonic wave gauges, respectively, in order to construct a flow field in the vicinity of three macro-roughness patches. Simultaneous, high-resolution video was also collected in order to track the runup bore position in time.\nAnalysis of mean flow conditions reveals that patchy roughness induces non-uniform changes in momentum flux throughout the patch array (Fig. 2). During runup, momentum flux is generally reduced in the lee of the patches. However, flow channelization between cross-shore rows of patches leads to an increase in momentum flux. During withdrawal, the strong gravity-driven flows that develop as a result of the steep 1:10 beach lead to an increase in momentum flux in areas behind the patches, which benefited from reduced momentum flux during runup.\nThe experiment findings indicate that flow interactions with the natural environment are indeed complex and that care must be exercised when considering the use of coastal forest as a tsunami bioshield.\nAcknowledgements: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number CMMI-1206271.

            "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing of aerosols started in 1979 using data from the AVHRR series of instruments on NOAA polar orbiters. Though limited to the oceans only, AVHRR clearly showed the basic latitudinal, longitudinal, and seasonal patterns in global aerosol fields that have been confirmed by more advanced instruments. In the early 90s a surprising discovery was made that UV instruments, such as TOMS, designed primarily to measure atmospheric ozone, can enhance this information by tracking the aerosol absorption signal of smoke and dust plumes over both land and water, as well as over bright surfaces covered by low level clouds, snow and ice. While more recent VIS/IR mapping instruments, such as SeaWIFS, MISR, MODIS, and VIIRS have greatly enhanced aerosol remote sensing capability compared to AVHRR, similar improvements have been made in UV remote sensing of aerosols, particularly with the launch of OMI on Aura in 2004. More recently, several successful approaches have been developed to combine MODIS and OMI data to estimate aerosol single scattering albedo over cloud-free areas and aerosol optical thickness over cloudy areas. I will discuss how these advanced techniques could be applied to combine VIIRS and OMPS data from Suomi NPP and what improvements are planned for JPSS-1. These techniques could also be applied to process data from the EPIC instrument, scheduled to be launched on the DSCOVR satellite next year. It will be located 1.5 million km from the Earth along the Sun-Earth axis at the first Lagrange point. Several other UV/VIS instruments are planned to be launched in LEO and GEO orbits in this decade that can take advantage of this synergy.",

            "abstract": "Integrated geological and geophysical studies of three fault intersections in central California reveal an abundance of serpentinite and related ultramafic ophiolitic rocks in the subsurface; this is a significant discovery that not only constrains the geometry of structures, but also helps to explain fault development and fault behavior. We present and compare fault framework models from the Hayward-Calaveras, Calaveras-San Andreas, and Hosgri-Shoreline fault intersections and discuss the importance of ultramafic ophiolitic rocks and the implications for seismic hazard. Fault framework models were created based on integrated analysis of geology, potential-field, seismic-reflection, multibeam bathymetry, and seismicity data. In each case, ultramafic ophiolitic rocks have very limited surface expression, but are prevalent in the subsurface from ~1 to ~8 km depth. High-resolution aero- and marine-magnetic data are particularly important for determining the geometry of these strongly magnetic rock bodies and the faults along which they occur. At each fault intersection, the ultramafic ophiolitic rocks characterize a pre-existing structure that either promotes or represents a barrier to faulting, and significantly influences local deformation patterns. Although the faults at each intersection do not connect directly at the surface, combined geologic and geophysical data suggest that these faults connect in the subsurface either along a single through-going fault plane or along multiple splay faults. The continuity of these fault intersections at seismogenic depths suggests the possibility of a combined rupture that should be evaluated in future seismic hazard studies.",

            "abstract": "Climate models project less summer precipitation and hotter temperatures in the Pacific Northwest. These changes will bring earlier snowmelt and reduced summer flow, which will increase stream temperature. Many cold water species will be adversely affected by such changes. However, the spatial and temporal extent of how each stream responds to climate change and how fish species respond to varying degrees of changes in flow and stream temperature across multiple streams has not been thoroughly studied. Using a combination of representative downscaled climate data, a watershed hydrologic model, and regression analysis, we projected future changes in streamflow and temperature and the responses of fish habitat to these changes for several tributaries of the Willamette River basin that exhibits distinct hydrologic landscape regions. Our simulation results suggest that streams located in the High Cascades where groundwater input is high will experience less warming and less flow reduction, thus more resilient to warming. In contrast, streams in transient areas where snow cover is projected to decline substantially will experience the most declines in fish diversity as a result of reduction in flow and highest rise in stream temperature. Our results suggest spatially targeted adaptive management strategies for fishes in a large heterogeneous river basin will be necessary in a rapidly changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The speciation, reactivity and mobility of carbon in the near surface environment is intimately linked to the prevalence, diversity and dynamics of native microbial populations. We utilize this relationship by introducing 13C-labeled acetate to sediments recovered from a shallow aquifer system to track both the cycling of carbon through multiple redox pathways and the associated spatial and temporal evolution of bacterial communities in response to this nutrient source. Results demonstrate a net loss of sediment organic carbon over the course of the amendment experiment. Furthermore, these data demonstrated a source of isotopically labeled inorganic carbon that was not attributable to primary metabolism by acetate-oxidizing microorganisms. Fluid samples analyzed weekly for microbial composition by pyrosequencing of ribosomal RNA genes showed a transient microbial community structure, with distinct occurrences of Azoarcus, Geobacter and multiple sulfate reducing species over the course of the experiment. In combination with DNA sequencing data, the anomalous carbon cycling process is shown to occur exclusively during the period of predominant Geobacter species growth. Pyrosequencing indicated, and targeted cloning and sequencing confirmed the presence of several bacteriovorous protozoa, including species of the Breviata, Planococcus and Euplotes genera. Cloning and qPCR analysis demonstrated that Euplotes species were most abundant and displayed a growth trajectory that closely followed that of the Geobacter population. These results suggest a previously undocumented secondary turnover of biomass carbon related to protozoan grazing that was not sufficiently prevalent to be observed in bulk concentrations of carbon species in the system, but was clearly identifiable in the partitioning of carbon isotopes. The impact of predator-prey relationships on subsurface microbial community dynamics and therefore the flux of carbon through a system via the microbial biomass pool suggests a diversity of processes that should be considered for inclusion in reactive transport models that aim to predict carbon turnover, nutrient flux, and redox reactions in natural and stimulated subsurface systems.",

We present multi-instrument observations from the Van Allen Probes spacecraft RBSP-A and RBSP-B at ~6 Re in the midnight sector magnetosphere and from ground based ionospheric sensors during a substorm dipolarization followed by rapid re-energization of multi-MeV electrons. At ~ 5 Re radial distance, a 50% increase in magnetic field magnitude occurred simultaneously with dramatic increases in 100 keV electron fluxes and a 100x increase in VLF wave intensity. The 100 keV electrons and intense VLF waves provide a seed population and energy source for subsequent radiation belt enhancements. During the event, the two Van Allen Probes spacecraft were separated by ~ 1 hr along the same orbital track enabling a <~1-hr temporal specification of the multi-MeV electron re-energization. Assocated with the substorm, highly relativistic (> 2 MeV) electron fluxes increased immediately at L* ~ 4.5, and ultra-relativistic 4.5 MeV electron flux increased >90x at L*=4 in a time interval of 5 hours or less. Although plasmasphere expansion brings the enhanced radiation belt multi-MeV fluxes inside the plasmasphere several hours post-substorm, we localize their prompt re-energization during the event to regions outside the plasmasphere.",

            "abstract": "Tuzo Wilson’s ground breaking realization that the progressively increasing ages of volcanism along linear chains of Pacific islands are best explained by movement of the Pacific plate over a stationary heat source was followed by Jason Morgan’s physically more plausible plume theory. Hawaii, the “mother” of all plumes/hotspots, has become the focus of a continuing burden-of-proof battle about the existence of mantle plumes. The monotonic age progression of this island chain has been amply confirmed, but the hotspot locus is not perfectly fixed, and this has been taken to be a failed test of the plume model. Numerous numerical experiments in bottom-heated settings have demonstrated that plumes are a physically natural mode of convection, but antiplumers focus on the fact that in internally heated media, plumes are unlikely. Early proposals of propagating lithospheric fractures with magma tapped from the underlying asthenosphere have never been sufficiently developed to seriously compete with the convection models. Geochemists eagerly adopted the plume model and developed highly model-dependent criteria for identifying mantle plumes, but these are easily knocked down, because most geochemical tracers carry no information about the specific mantle depth being sampled. Conversely, petrological-geochemical models invoking exclusively asthenospheric magma sources have not explained how, in the absence of a Bunsen burner, high melt production can be localized in one geographic spot for 108 years. Our work has focussed on using dynamic modelling to trace the path of geochemical heterogeneities from the base of the mantle to the volcanoes. We find that large-scale heterogeneities existing in the lower thermal boundary layer are drawn into close proximity in the plume conduit and in the erupting volcanoes. Geochemistry cannot prove mantle plumes, but plumes offer a promising path to understanding the geochemistry of the deep mantle.",

Although TRI can be applied to a variety of fields including bridge and landslide monitoring, it is ideal for studies of the highly dynamic terminal zones of marine-terminating glaciers. Our TRI instrument is the Gamma Portable Radar Interferometer, which operates at 17.2 GHz (1.74 cm wavelength), has two receiving antennas for DEM generation, and generates amplitude and phase images at minute-scale sampling rates. Here we review preliminary results from Breiðamerkurjökull in Iceland and Helheim and Jakobshavn in Greenland. We show that the high sampling rate of the TRI can be used to observe velocity variations at the glacier terminus associated with calving, and the spatial distribution of tidal forcing. Velocity uncertainties, mainly due to atmospheric effects, are typically less than 0.05 m/d. Additionally, iceberg tracking using the amplitude imagery may provide insight into ocean currents near the terminus when fjord or lagoon conditions permit.",

The model provides two important predictions: (1) estimates of the magnetic field strength and orientation of the CME Bz component at 1AU (2) estimates of the arrival time of the magnetized CME ejecta. The model calculates the evolving magnetic field inside the CME ejecta (in three dimension Bx, By, Bz) in relation to the initial geometry of the CME at the Sun and height-time data measured directly in white-light images.\nWe present an application based on this type of model that computes the magnetic field vector components seen by a probe/planet traversing the CME for any orientation of the flux rope.",

            "abstract": "The widely applied Webster–Yang index (WYI), which measures the broad-scale dynamical features of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), has experienced robust interannual and interdecadal variations and a decreasing tendency, with apparent shifts in 1972. The WYI exhibits moderate variability and frequent positive phases before 1972, intensive interannual variability during 1972–98, and an obvious decreasing tendency and mainly negative phase afterward. The vertical shear easterly anomalies over the tropics/subtropics and the anomalous vertical shear anticyclonic circulation over Eurasia (Eu) are the background for the decreasing WYI, associated with reduced summer precipitation around the Bay of Bengal and Sumatra.\n On interdecadal time scales, the negative (positive) Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) is characterized by cooling (warming) in Eurasian tropospheric temperature (TT) via the North Atlantic Oscillation. Global warming manipulates the increasing tendency and the interannual variability of TT over the Indian Ocean (IO). The mutual effects of AMO on Eurasian TT and global warming on Indian Ocean TT correspond to the similar decreasing tendency and interdecadal shift of the difference in TT between Eurasia and the Indian Ocean (EuTT - IOTT) with those of the ASM. Thus, the AMO and global warming seem to cause the interdecadal variability of ASM. Although the interannual relationship between Niño-3 SST and ASM weakens recently as a result of the weakening tendency of ASM, the Niño-3 SST still plays an important role in ASM variability via EuTT - IOTT anomalies. In addition, the WYI in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) reanalysis shows a larger decreasing tendency for 1999–2010 compared to other reanalysis products, a plausible reason for the inconsistent variations between land–sea thermal contrast and the NCEP–NCAR WYI during that period.",

Compared with the model obtained by using only the initial phase, the resolution just above the 410 km discontinuity is especially improved, and low-velocity anomalies beneath the Changbai volcano are clearly observed down to the 410 km discontinuity. Compared with previous models [Tang et al., 2014, Nature Geosci.; Obayashi et al., 2011, AGU Fall Meeting], low-velocity anomalies atop the 410 are more pronounced.

            "abstract": "In this paper, several years of multi-constellation global navigation satellite scintillation data collected at Alaska, Peru, and Ascension Island are analyzed to characterize scintillation features observed at high latitude and equatorial locations during the current solar maximum. Recognizing that strong scintillation data are often lost due to the lack of robustness in conventional GPS receivers used for ionosphere scintillation monitoring (ISM), an autonomous event driven scintillation data collection system using software-defined raw RF sampling devices have been developed deployed at a number of strategically selected high latitude and equatorial locations since 2009. This unique scintillation data recording system is triggered by indicators computed from a continuously operating ISM receiver and the raw RF data is post processed using advanced receiver signal processing algorithms designed to minimize carrier phase cycle slips and loss of lock of signals during strong scintillations. Based on scintillation events extracted from the raw data, several statistical distributions are established to characterize the intensity, duration and occurrence frequency of scintillation. Results confirm that scintillation at low latitudes is generally more intense and longer lasting, while high-latitude scintillation is milder and usually dominated by phase fluctuations. Results also reveal the impacts of solar activity, geomagnetic activity and seasons on scintillation in different areas. Combining measurements from a co-located geo-magnetometer and corresponding global geomagnetic activities, qualitative and quantitative correlations between scintillation and both local and global geomagnetic activities have been obtained. Results show that in Alaska, the occurrence frequency and intensity of scintillation, especially phase fluctuations, have strong correlations with geomagnetic field intensity disturbances, while in equatorial stations, the correlation is not obvious.",

It seems reasonable to conclude that the former causes the latter, but to our knowledge no one has actually tested that. We do so here by analyzing one chemistry-climate model in detail (the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model, GEOSCCM) and find that the warming of the TTL explains only a fraction of the increase in humidity of air entering the stratosphere. We do this by using meteorological fields from the model to drive a trajectory model, which estimates the water vapor variations in response to the large-scale temperature field. Water vapor simulated by the trajectory model increases by about one quarter of the amount it increases in the GEOSCCM. We conclude that, over the 21st century, an increase in the flux of ice through the TTL is responsible for most of the increase in the humidity of air entering the stratosphere in this model.",

It was found that both the pressure head and specific flux in this case are temporally non-stationary. The variance is zero at early time due to a deterministic initial condition used, then increases with time, and approaches anasymptotic limit at late time.Both pressure head and specific flux arealso non-stationary in space since the variance decreases from source to sink. The unsaturated-saturated systembehavesasa noise filterand it damps both the pressure head and specific flux, i.e., reduces their variations and enhances their correlation. The effect is stronger in upper unsaturated zone than in lower unsaturated zone and saturated zone. As a noise filter, the unsaturated-saturated system is mainly a low pass filter, filtering out the high frequency components in the time series of hydrological variables. The damping effect is much stronger in the saturated zone than in the saturated zone.",

The core is gravity one (St#822), 4.5 m long, and in 1089 m water depth. The study of benthic and planktic foraminifera is used to determine the microhabitat of the bottom sediments during warm and cold periods. Sapropels S1, S3 and S4 are encountered in the studied gravity core sample from the eastern Mediterranean. The sapropel layers S1, S3 and S4 were deposited during interglacial periods, characterized by a low foraminiferal numbers, reflecting eutrophic conditions. Glacial periods are characterized by high foraminiferal numbers due probably to an enhanced glacial productivity. Sapropel layers are distinguished by increase of Fe, TOC% (TOC%≥ 1.2%) and decrease of Ca concentrations as a result of the Blue Nile suspended particulate matter discharge during summer monsoon. Clay content increases at the sapropel depths that indicate an increase in the terrigenous input derived from the weathering of Ethiopian basalts. Temporal distribution of planktic and benthic foraminifera in the Nile deep sea fan sediments besides geochemical charcterization, palaeohydrological fluctuations, palaeoenvironment and microhabitat of foraminifera were reconstructed for the last 100000 years including glacial and interglacial periods. Formation of the Sapropel layers are synchronized with the decreasing of δ18O which means that the Mediterranean Sea received high amount of fresh water from the Nile river discharge. Clay content, TOC%, Ca–Fe cycles, oxygen and carbon isotopes and planktic foraminifera document the pluvial and arid periods throughout the 100000 years and define clearly the contributions of terrigenous and TOC% in the sapropel layers. Infauna/epifauna ratio and benthic foraminifera assemblages were used to reconstruct the microhabitat of the sea bottom during sapropel and cold periods.",

            "abstract": "With their unique orbit, the Van Allen Probes (RBSP) spacecraft are well suited to investigate near-Earth substorm injections that penetrate into the heart of outer radiation belts. Substorms are generally conceived to inject 10s-100s keV electrons but intense substorm electric fields have been shown capable of injecting ~MeV electrons as well at the geosynchronous altitude. An intriguing question is whether such MeV electron injections can penetrate to lower L shells and directly contribute to the relativistic electron population of the outer radiation belt. In this talk, we present RBSP observations of near-Earth substorm injection of MeV relativistic particles and associated intense dipolarization electric field at L ~5.5. The substorm injection occurred during a moderate storm (DST~-30 to -20) with steady solar wind conditions. RBSP-A observed dispersionless injection of electrons from 10s keV up to 3 MeV in the pre-mid night sector (MLT=22UT). The injection was associated with unusually large (60mV/m) dipolarization electric fields that lasted 1 minute. At about the same time, THEMIS-D observed energy-dispersive injection of electrons at energies as high as at least 720keV at L~6.8 in the pre-dawn sector. Injection of energetic protons (~1MeV) and proton drift echos were observed at RBSP-A as well. RBSP-A observed a broad spectrum of nonlinear electric field structures but no whistler waves at the injection. The properties of the observed dipolarization electric field constrain the acceleration mechanism responsible for the MeV electron injection. We will discuss the implications of these observations on the direct impact of substorms on the outer radiation belt.",

            "abstract": "Forest canopy has crucial roles in regulating energy and material exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems and in ecological processes with respect to carbon cycle and growth in the ecosystems. Challenges to the canopy of tall forests for such research involve the access to the leaves for ecophysiological observations, responses of leaves to the changing environments from seconds to years, and up-scaling the leaf-level phenomena to canopy and landscape-levels. A long-term, multidisciplinary approach has been conducted in a cool-temperate deciduous broadleaf forest in Takayama site (ca. 1400m a.s.l.) in central Japan. This forest canopy is dominated by Quercus crispula and Betula ermanii. We have been focusing on the phenology of photosynthetic productivity from a single leaf to canopy, and to landscape level, by combining leaf ecophysiological research, optical observations by spectroradiometers and time-laps cameras with the aid of “Phenological Eyes Network (PEN)”, and process-based modellings. The canopy-level photosynthesis is then compared with the micrometeorolgical observation of CO2 flux at the site. So far we have been clarifying that (1) inter-annual variations in seasonal growth rate and senescence rate of leaf photosynthetic capacity and canopy leaf area are largely responsible for the inter-annual change in forest photosynthesis, and (2) spectral vegetation indices such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and chlorophyll index (CCI) can be the indicator to observe the phenology of forest canopy photosynthesis. In addition to these efforts since 2003, we established an open-field warming experiment on the branches of the canopy trees, to investigate the possible influence of temperature increase on leaf photosynthetic and optical properties and then to examine whether the optical satellite remote sensing can detect the changes in photosynthetic capacity and phenology by ongoing global warming.",

            "abstract": "The Northeast U.S. is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather from winter cyclones (heavy precipitation, wind, and storm surge). This presentation will highlight the future changes (up to year 2098) of cool season (November through March) extratropical cyclones over the Northeast U.S. using the Coupled Intercomparison Modeling Project (CMIP5) as well as an ensemble of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) members down to 20-km grid spacing downscaled using NCEP reanalysis and a few CMIP5 models. The 6-h output from CFSR (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) and CMIP5 models was used to provide initial and boundary conditions for the historical and future WRF runs, respectively.\nSome processes responsible for the model differences and future cyclone changes in cyclone intensity along the U.S. East coast were diagnosed using storm-relative composites of temperature, winds, precipitation, etc… within a 20 x 20 degrees box around each cyclone center. For example, during 2069-2098 (for RCP8.5), there is a significant increase in cyclone-relative precipitation, especially over continent at middle and high latitudes (20-40% by the later 21st century). This precipitation increase is mainly for the strong and moderate cyclones, which get more intense in several models, therefore suggesting the importance of latent heating with the additional moisture in a warmer climate.\nSince many of the CMIP5 models do a realistic job with extratropical cyclones, we developed a generalized parametric downscaling technique to create a point-based storm surge time series for the cool season using 6-h CMIP5 data. The statistical model for New York City is trained and evaluated using Oct-March 10-m wind and mean sea level pressure from the NARR renanalysis between 1979-2012. Overall, there is a significant decrease in the ensemble mean number of >= 1.0 m surge events. However, if one includes a sea-level rise of at least 0.5 m during the next several decades, all models have a significant increase in the number of coastal flooding events.",

            "abstract": "This study explores the time-lagged impacts of the spring sensible heat (SH) source over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) on summer rainfall anomaly in east China by using the WRF model. Numerical experiments for the 2003 case indicates that spring SH anomaly over the TP can maintains its impact until summer and leads to the overall strong atmospheric heat source, which is characterized by the enhanced both SH over the western TP and condensation latent heat to the east. The wave activity diagnosis revealed that the enhanced TP heating forces a Rossby wave train to the downstream regions. The cyclonic response to the northeast TP brings about the low level northerly anomaly over the northern China, while the anticyclonic response over the western Pacific enhances the subtropical high and the low level southerly in its western flank. As a result, cold and dry airflows from mid-high latitudes and warm and wet airflows from tropical oceans converge around the Huaihe River basin. In addition, warm advection originated from the TP induces vigorous ascending motion over the convergence belt. With such a favourable circulation condition, the eastward propagating vortexes initiated over the TP intensify the torrential rainfall processes over the Huaihe River basin. Another case study of 2001 with weak spring SH over the TP and the overall southward retreat of summer rainfall belt in east China further demonstrates the role of spring SH over the TP in regulating the interannual variability of EASM in terms of wave activity and synoptic disturbance.",

However, investigating groundwater trends and groundwater-surface water linkages is extremely challenging in a data-scarce environment where basins are largely ungauged so there is very little historical data; often the data are missing, flawed or biased. Moreover, hard-rock aquifer data are very difficult to interpret.\nIn the absence of reliable data, establishing a trend let alone the causal linkages is a severe challenge. We used a combination of low-cost, participatory, satellite based and conventional data collection methods to maximize spatial and temporal coverage of data.\nFor instance, long-term groundwater trends are biased because only a few dug wells with non-representative geological conditions still have water - the vast majority of the monitoring wells drilled in the 1970s and 1980s have dried up. Instead, we relied on “barefoot hydrology” techniques. By conducting a comprehensive well census, engaging farmers in participatory groundwater monitoring and using locally available commercial borewell scanning techniques we have been able to better establish groundwater trends and spatial patterns.",

The net eastward volume transport by Rossby rip currents over the global ocean is estimated to be of order 10 Sv.

The long-term magma flux controls the thermal evolution of these magmatic reservoirs and therefore the possibility of accumulating eruptible magma in the plumbing system of volcanoes. Magma flux, in combination with the periodicity of magma injection, regulates the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions. We combined thermal and mechanical modelling with Monte Carlo simulations to compute the temporal evolution of the chemistry of eruptible magma (<50 vol. % crystals) in systems growing at different characteristic magma fluxes. We simulated the periodic injection of andesitic magma in the upper crust and trace the volume and chemistry of the eruptible magma together with the evolution of the overpressure within the reservoir. Eruptions are prescribed to occur once overpressure reached critical values (1-40 MPa).\nThe calculations show that eruptions of rhyolitic compositions are rare and can only occur after a stage of prolonged thermal maturation of a magmatic reservoir (lasting a few hundredths of thousands of years). Additionally, eruptions of chemically evolved rocks are restricted to a specific range of physical conditions. Interestingly, the probability of eruptions of rhyolitic compositions increases substantially once the injection of magma into the magmatic reservoir ceases, which would imply that rhyolitic eruptions (not produced by partial melting of continental crust) are most likely to occur during the waning (not waxing) stages of magmatic activity.",

The Ocean Basalt Simulator version 1 (OBS1) uses a thermodynamic model of adiabatic melting of a pyroxenite-bearing peridotite with experimentally parameterized liquidus–solidus and melting intervals and thermodynamically/experimentally parameterized source mineralogy of pyroxenite and peridotite. OBS1 uses a sequence of adiabatic melting with pyroxenite melting, melt metasomatism in the host peridotite, and melting of the metasomatized peridotite. OBS1 explores (1) the fractions of peridotite and pyroxenite, (2) mantle potential temperature Tp, (3) depth of termination of melting Pmt, (4) degree of melting F, and (5) residual mode Xa of the sources. The model also examines the mass balance of 26 incompatible trace elements in the sources and in the generated basalt. OBS1 can also calculate Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotope compositions in the sources and in the melt. OBS1 is coded in an Excel spreadsheet and runs with VBA macros. Using OBS1, we examine the source conditions of the mid oceanic ridge basalts (MORBs), plume-influenced ocean ridge basalts in Galápagos, Loihi–Loa–Koolau basalts in the Hawaiian hotspot, high-mu (HIMU) basalt from the St. Helena hotspot, and Shatsky Rise and Jurassic Mikabu oceanic plateau basalts and picrites. OBS1 is a unique model that provides an opportunity to examine the source mantle conditions using incompatible trace elements and relevant isotopes, which are key factors in global mantle recycling.",

Fluid paths are so clear to be fracture zones of particular fault zones by results of geological survey and resistivity analysis. It is also well known that fluids from Arima hot springs show specific isotopic compositions, which is inferred to be deep origin. In this presentation, we discuss about quantification of fluid flux from deep crust using long-term monitored chemical data from Arima hot spring.

Slip is initiated when contacts are broken via propagating ruptures. Characterization of the dynamic fields that drive these ruptures and how they couple to the dissipative mechanisms on the interface are critical to our fundamental understanding of both frictional motion and earthquake dynamics.\nWe experimentally investigate ruptures along rough spatially extended interfaces bounded by the same type of material. We perform simultaneous high-speed measurements (at μsec time scale) of the real contact area and the strain fields in the region surrounding propagating rupture tips. These measurements enable us to uncover the breakdown process near the tip of the slipping zone for rapidly propagating ruptures ranging from slow rupture fronts (~0.01CR) to nearly the Rayleigh wave speed, CR~1255m/s.\nThese rupture fronts are quantitatively described by classical singular solutions for rapid shear cracks. These singular solutions, originally derived to describe brittle fracture, are in excellent agreement with the experiments for slow propagation, whereas some significant discrepancies arise as the rupture velocity approaches CR. The energy dissipated by the fracture of the contacts (fracture energy) is nearly constant throughout the entire rupture velocity range, while the size of the dissipative zone undergoes a ‘Lorentz-like’ contraction as the rupture velocity approaches CR.\nWe then turn to both fully lubricated and partially lubricated interfaces and compare the dynamic strain fields measured to those of dry interfaces. The results of these studies are surprising.\nWe will show that:\nRapid rupture fronts still propagate in the stick-slip regime\nAlthough decreasing the overall friction coefficient along the interface, the addition of a lubricant significantly increases the fracture energy at the rupture tip\nIn the fully lubricated case, the form of the fields surrounding the rupture tip may belong to a different class of solutions than the classical solutions given by dynamic shear fracture.\nThis coupling between friction and fracture is critical to our fundamental understanding of frictional motion and related processes, such as earthquake dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Water scarcity is increasing globally and is most evident in arid zones. Most rainfall is evaporated and runoff coefficients of 5 to 10% are common in arid zone river basins. Evaporation is the most important hydrological process, not only because of its magnitude, but also because it can be managed and regulated by withdrawals, irrigation equipment, agricultural practices, land use changes and soil treatments. Hence, evaporation can be modified and the looming water crisis prompt us to think more careful on how water is consumed and the services and benefits we render on return in terms of agricultural production, ecosystem services, hydropower, leisure etc. Several lead research groups have developed global evaporation products, at least for the African continent. Most of these products have a pixel size varying between 1 to 3 km, and this is a reasonable tradeoff between what is technically preferred (evaporation by land use class) and what can be operationally inferred from the newest earth observation satellites (100 to 1000 m pixels with revisit time of 1 to 5 days). The evaporation variability from monthly SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, NBI version of MOD16, GLEAM and LandSAF model outputs for the main land use classes of the Nile will be demonstrated for the period 2005 to 2012. For 2007, there is also an evaporation data set from ETLook available. The largest variabilities occur on irrigated land, open water bodies and flood plains. The evaporation predictions are compared against flux tower data, and the water balance of paired catchments in Ethiopia and Southern Sudan. It is proposed to use ensemble averages and spreads of actual evaporation values for applications in water management, rather than using one single value and one single model. Some first thoughts on ensemble averaging will be provided. Ensemble evaporation values will be applied in the Water Accounting Plus (WA+) system, being a new analytical framework for water resources assessment reporting that is under development by IWMI, FAO and UNESCO-IHE (\nwww.wateraccounting.org\n).",

This requires a more accurate management of the water resources at river basin scale and understanding of withdrawals and return flows; both naturally and man-induced. Many basins and their tributaries are, however, ungauged or poorly gauged. This hampers sound planning and monitoring processes. While certain countries have developed clear guidelines and policies on data observatories and data sharing, other countries and their basin organization still have to start on developing data democracies. Water accounting quantifies flows, fluxes, stocks and consumptive use pertaining to every land use class in a river basin. The objective is to derive a knowledge base with certain minimum information that facilitates decision making. Water Accounting Plus (WA+) is a new method for water resources assessment reporting (\nwww.wateraccounting.org\n). While the PUB framework has yielded several deterministic models for flow prediction, WA+ utilizes remote sensing data of rainfall, evaporation (including soil, water, vegetation and interception evaporation), soil moisture, water levels, land use and biomass production. Examples will be demonstrated that show how remote sensing and hydrological models can be smartly integrated for generating all the required input data into WA+. A standard water accounting system for all basins in the world - with a special emphasis on data scarce regions - is under development. First results of using remote sensing measurements and hydrological modeling as an alternative to expensive field data sets, will be presented and discussed.",

Current continuity requires that these currents are closed, either locally or via other current systems. We have investigated whether magnetopause surface currents can contribute to ring current closure. Using 10 years of measurements from the Cluster constellation of spacecraft, we calculated the magnetopause current density for a large number of flank magnetopause traversals. For each event, we also consulted sectorial ring current indices, derived from SuperMAG - a large constellation of ground based magnetometer stations. SuperMAG results show a significant and persistent dawn-dusk asymmetry in ground magnetic perturbations which indicates a more intense ring current on the dusk side. The asymmetries become more pronounced during disturbed magnetospheric conditions, indicating an increased divergence of the current and closure through other current systems. A similar response to geomagnetic activity is also observed at the magnetopause. Duskside magnetopause current densities are generally higher than their dawnside counterparts, and the magnetopause asymmetry becomes more pronounced during disturbed conditions. Although the two current systems are related to different processes - gradient drift of energetic plasma sheet particles for the ring current and a surface current due to differential motion of ions and electrons inside the magnetopause interface for the magnetopause current - the results demonstrate a mutual relation between the two current systems.",

            "abstract": "The seismoelectric method is based on the interpretation of the electrical field associated with the conversion of mechanical to electromagnetic energy during the propagation of seismic waves in heterogeneous porous media. We propose a poroacoustic model. This model takes into account fluid flow and the effect of the partial saturation of the water phase and is coupled with an electrokinetic model accounting for the effect of saturation. The model is in agreement with available experimental data in a variety of porous media. We also developed new scaling laws for the permeability, the streaming potential coupling coefficient, and the capillary entry pressure of porous media. The theory is developed for frequencies much below the critical frequency at which inertial effects starts to dominate in the Navier-Stokes equation (>10 kHz). The equations used to compute the propagation of the P-waves and the seismoelectric effect in unsaturated condition are solved with finite elements using triangular meshing. A first example demonstrates the usefulness of the seismoelectric beamforming, to localize saturation fronts by focusing seismic waves and looking at the resulting seismoelectric conversions. This method is applied to a cross-hole problem showing how a saturation front characterized by a drop in the electrical conductivity and compressibility is responsible for seismoelectric conversions. These conversions can be used in turn to determine the position of the front over time. The figure shows the dipolar anomaly resulting from the beamforming of seimiec energy at point A and associated with a resistivity contrast. Finally, we show how a complete two-phase flow seismoelectric theory can be developed based on the extension of the dynamic Biot theory to two-phase flow conditions and how this theory can be numerically implemented.",

The dry zone is exposed to drought-like conditions for several months each year. Due to the sporadic nature of rainfall, dry zone livelihoods depend on the successful storage, capture, and distribution of water. Traditionally, water has been captured in rain-fed tanks and distributed through a system of dug canals. Recently, the Sri Lankan government has diverted the waters of the nation’s largest river through a system of centrally managed reservoirs and canals and resettled farmers to cultivate this newly irrigated land. This study uses remotely sensed MODIS and LANDSAT imagery to compare vegetation health and cropping patterns in these distinct water management regimes under different conditions of water scarcity. Of particular interest are the socioeconomic, infrastructural, and institutional factors that affect cropping patterns, including field position, water storage capacity, and control of water resources. Results suggest that under known conditions of water scarcity, farmers cultivate other field crops in lieu of paddy. Cultivation changes depend to a large extent on the institutional distance between water users and water managers as well as the fragmentation of water resources within the system.",

            "abstract": "Although earthquake early warning (EEW) has shown great promise for reducing loss of life and property, it has only been implemented in a few regions due, in part, to the prohibitive cost of building the required dense seismic and geodetic networks. However, many cars and consumer smartphones, tablets, laptops, and similar devices contain low-cost versions of the same sensors used for earthquake monitoring. If a workable EEW system could be implemented based on either crowd-sourced observations from consumer devices or very inexpensive networks of instruments built from consumer-quality sensors, EEW coverage could potentially be expanded worldwide. Controlled tests of several accelerometers and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers typically found in consumer devices show that, while they are significantly noisier than scientific-grade instruments, they are still accurate enough to capture displacements from moderate and large magnitude earthquakes. The accuracy of these sensors varies greatly depending on the type of data collected. Raw coarse acquisition (C/A) code GPS data are relatively noisy. These observations have a surface displacement detection threshold approaching ~1 m and would thus only be useful in large Mw 8+ earthquakes. However, incorporating either satellite-based differential corrections or using a Kalman filter to combine the raw GNSS data with low-cost acceleration data (such as from a smartphone) decreases the noise dramatically. These approaches allow detection thresholds as low as 5 cm, potentially enabling accurate warnings for earthquakes as small as Mw 6.5. Simulated performance tests show that, with data contributed from only a very small fraction of the population, a crowd-sourced EEW system would be capable of warning San Francisco and San Jose of a Mw 7 rupture on California’s Hayward fault and could have accurately issued both earthquake and tsunami warnings for the 2011 Mw 9 Tohoku-oki, Japan earthquake.",

            "abstract": "TEX86, an organic palaeothermometer based upon the distribution of isoprenoidal glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in marine Thaumarchaeota, is regularly used to reconstruct spatial and temporal sea surface temperature patterns, especially in older (Mesozoic and Palaeogene) settings. The TEX86 proxy assumes that Thaumarchaeota in modern oceans are representative of those living in ancient settings, but even in today’s oceans Thaumarchaeotal phylogeny is diverse. In the Red Sea, phylogenetically distinct archaeal communities occur both above and below the thermocline and correspond to core-top sediments in which TEX86 values consistently overestimate satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) by 6-8°C [1]. These elevated SSTs are associated with an unusual GDGT distribution characterised by low GDGT-0 (<10%) and high GDGT-4’ (>10%). Here we propose the %GDGTRS index (= ([GDGT-4’]/[GDGT-4’]+[GDGT-0])*100) as a way to identify Red Sea-type GDGT distributions in ancient sediments.\nIn a Paleogene (65-34Ma) compilation, Red Sea-type GDGT distributions are common and geographically widespread, and could lead to SST overestimates. The underlying ecological controls that govern the occurrence of these distributions remain unclear, but they are especially common during times of elevated warmth (i.e. EECO, PETM). During the EECO and the PETM, the occurrence of Red Sea-type GDGT distributions coincides with the presence of hypersaline and/or lagoonal dinocysts in at least four global localities. We suggest that the high %GDGTRS values during these very hot intervals reflect the presence of unique Thaumarchaeotal or Euryarchaeotal clusters responding to the development of more saline conditions, similar to or perhaps exceeding those observed in the Red Sea today.\n1.

            "abstract": "The potential impact of a changing climate on Andean-Amazonian hydrology is an important question for scientists and policymakers alike, because of its implications for local ecosystem services such as water resources availability, river flow regulation, and eco-hydrology. This study presents new projections of climate change impacts on the hydrological regime of the upper Amazon river in Peru, and the consequent effect on two vulnerable species of freshwater turtle populations Podocnemis expansa (Amazon turtle) and Podocnemis unilis (yellow-spotted side neck turtle), which nest on its banks.\nTo do this, the global climate model outputs of radiation, temperature, precipitation, wind, and humidity data from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are propagated through a hydrological model to simulate changes in river flow. The model consists of a land surface scheme called the Joint-UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) that is coupled to a distributed river flow routing routine, which also accounts for floodplain attenuation of flood peaks. It is parameterized using a combination of remote sensing (TRMM, MODIS, an Landsat) and ground observational data to reproduce reliably the historical floodplain regime.\nThe climate-induced shifts are inferred from a comparison between the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 projections against the historical scenario. Changes in the 10th and 95th percentile of flows, as well as the distributions in the length of the dry and wet seasons are analysed. These parameters are then used to construct probability models of biologically significant events (BSEs - extreme dry year, extreme wet year and repiquete), which are negative drivers of the turtle-egg ovipositioning, nesting and hatching. The results indicate that the projected increase in wet-season precipitation overcome the increase in evapotranspirative demand from an increase in temperature, resulting in more frequent and longer term flooding that causes a net loss of total turtle-egg counts. Additionally, changes in air and water temperature may alter the male / female ratio of the turtles.",

            "abstract": "Increasing the world population, food security in the sense of supplying enough food has become more important. Cereals are considerable matter in food security issues, and production of cereals are heavily threatened by climate change. In 2012, terrible drought which might happen once in a hundred years, caused massive damage to the soybean and corn harvest. This event had impact on the agriculture industry in U.S., and led drastic increase of commodity price. To ensuring food security, influence of climate risk to food production should be comprehended quantitatively.\nWe used ERA-Interim which includes temperature, dew-point, pressure, precipitation, solar radiation and wind speed product, to analyze the world condition of climate changes, and calculated warmth index and dew-point depression. Kira (1977) developed warmth index which has close relationship between distribution of plants living. Dew-point depression represents the wetness of atmosphere. Also, we analyzed crop yields statistics from USDA to clarify what kind of climate condition affect crop yields.\nFigure 1 shows variance distribution of warmth index. It can be said that area where contains high value of variance, is subject to extreme climatic changes. Figure 2 is a distribution map indicating whether warmth index was higher or lower than average value. In 2012, it was very hot in the wide range of the Russia and North America.\nFigure 3 shows correlation between yield index and ERA-Interim climate data at each month. Crop yields have been in trend of increasing because technology enhancements such as improving of breeds and cultivation have been occurred. Therefore, we calculated simple moving average as normal value and calculated yield index by dividing the normal value and annual yields (left Figure 3). If yield index was under 100, it was harvest failure in that year. In contrast, if yield index was higher than 100, it was good harvest in that year. In this result, temperature, warmth index and dew-point depression had nearly 0.7 negative correlation coefficient between yield index during July and August. Also, precipitation had nearly 0.5 correlation coefficient during July. Thus, corn yields were strongly affected by the high temperature or condition of vapor in the atmosphere during the summer season. ",

            "abstract": "Theory and experiments have shown that the Earth’s Transition Zone (TZ) could be a major repository for water, due to the ability of the higher-pressure polymorphs of olivine - wadsleyite and ringwoodite - to host up to ~2.5wt. % H2O. Despite experimental demonstration of the water-bearing capacity of these phases, geophysical probes such as electrical conductivity have provided conflicting results, and the issue of whether the TZ contains abundant water remains highly controversial. We report X-ray diffraction, Raman and infra-red spectroscopic evidence for the first terrestrial occurrence of any higher pressure polymorph of olivine: ringwoodite, included in a diamond from Juína, Brazil. The ringwoodite occurs with a Ca-walstromite phase that we interpret to be retrogressed Ca-silicate perovskite. The most likely interpretation of this two-phase assemblage is that it represents a partially retrogressed portion of a somewhat Fe-rich peridotitic mantle, in which hydrous ringwoodite, and former CaSiO3- perovskite co-existed above 15GPa. The ringwoodite has a Mg# of ~ 75, suggesting that it may be mantle hybrised with a more fertile component such as subducted oceanic crust. The water-rich nature of this inclusion (~1.5 wt%), along with the preservation of ringwoodite, is the first direct evidence that, at least locally, the TZ is hydrous, to about 1 wt%. As well as being in agreement with recent magnetotelluric estimates of the TZ water content, this amount of water helps to reconcile measured TZ seismic velocities with those predicted from lab experiments. The finding also indicates that some kimberlites must have their primary sources in this deep mantle region. The high water content of the ringwoodite suggests that it was not close to the mantle geotherm when trapped in the diamond. This may be an indication that the the assemblage was part of a water-rich subducted slab out of thermal equilibrium, within the transition zone. The water-rich nature of the ringwoodite inclusion provides support for the notion that the lower P and S wave velocities expected from hydrous peridotite based on laboratory experiments are consistent with a hydrous transition zone.",

            "abstract": "Increased changes in land cover and global climate have led to increased frequency and/or intensity of dust storms in some regions of the world. Early detection and warning of dust storms, in conjunction with effective and widespread information broadcasts, will be essential to the prevention and mitigation of future risks and impacts to people and the environment. Since frequency and intensity of dust storms can vary from region to region, there is a demonstrated need for more research to be conducted over longer periods of time to analyze trends of dust storm events [1]. Dust storms impact their origin area, but also land, water and people a great distance away from where dust finally settles [2, 3]. These transboundary movements and accompanying impacts further warrant the need for global collaboration to help predict the onset, duration and path of a dust storm. Early warning systems can help communicate when a dust storm is occurring, the projected intensity of the dust storm and its anticipated physical impact over a particular geographic area. Development of regional dust storm models, such as CUACE/Dust for East Asia, and monitoring networks, like the Sand and Dust Storm Warning Network operated by the World Meteorological Organization, and the use of remote sensing and satellite imagery derived products [4], including MODIS, are currently being incorporated into early warning and monitoring initiatives. However, to increase future certainty of impacts of dust storms on vulnerable populations and ecosystems, more research is needed to analyze the influences of human activities, seasonal variations and long-term climatic patterns on dust storm generation, movement and impact.\nSources: [1] Goudie, A.S.

In cold climates, freeze/thaw cycles and short growing seasons can enhance soil N2O production contributing to the temporal variability of fluxes. Year-round measurements of N2O fluxes in multiple cropping systems are needed to decrease the uncertainty of annual emission estimates and to devise mitigation practices for emission reduction in cold climates. We have deployed a micrometeorological flux-gradient approach coupled to a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy system at two long-term sites in Canada: Elora, Ontario (2000-2014) and Glenlea, Manitoba (2006-2014). Quasi-simultaneous half-hourly flux measurements on four 4-ha fields within a level and aerodynamically homogeneous landscape were obtained allowing for comparison of crop type and/or management practices within and between years. Annual crops such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley received typical inorganic fertilizer and/or manure applications, and best management practices such as timing of application and reduced tillage were studied. Perennial grass-alfalfa hayfields were compared to annual crops during selected time periods. Here we synthesize the long-term datasets from these two sites, and quantify the overall contribution of non-growing season (mainly freeze/thaw cycles) and growing season (mainly nitrogen application) to annual emission totals. Uncertainties of regional estimates for cold-climates will be assessed using these long-term datasets.",

            "abstract": "During the last years the research field of decadal predictions gained increased attention. Its intention is to exploit the predictability derived from slowly varying components of the climate system on inter-annual to decadal time-scales. Such predictions are mostly performed using ensembles of global earth system models.\nThe prediction systems are able to achieve a relatively high predictive skill over some oceanic regions, like the North Atlantic sector. But potential users of decadal predictions are often interested in forecasts over land areas and require a higher resolution, too. Therefore, the German research program MiKlip develops a decadal ensemble predictions system with regional downscaling as an additional option. Dynamical downscaling and a statistical-dynamical downscaling approach are applied within the MiKlip regionalization module. The global prediction system consists of the MPI-ESM model. Different RCMs are used for the downscaling, e.g. CCLM and REMO. The focus regions are Europe and Western Africa.\nHindcast experiments for the period 1960 – 2013 were performed to assess the general skill of the prediction system. Of special interest is the value added by the regional downscaling. For mean quantities, like annual mean temperature and precipitation, the predictive skill is comparable between the global and the downscaled systems. For extremes on the other hand there seems to be an improvement by the RCM ensemble. The skill strongly varies on sub-continental regions and with the season. The lead time up to which a positive predictive skill can be achieved depends on the parameter and season, too.\nA further goal is to assess the potential for valuable information, which can be derived from predicting long-term variations of the European climate. The leading mode of decadal variability in the European/Atlantic sector is the Atlantic Multidecadal Variation (AMV). The potential predictability from AMV teleconnections especially for extreme value anomalies over Europe is explored using re-analysis driven RCM simulations. It is evaluated how such teleconnections are represented in the RCM. For instance, the multi-year mean soil water content is correlated to the AMV index in Europe. This provides the potential to predict drought tendencies, which is relevant for agricultural applications.",

            "abstract": "Increases in atmospheric water vapor concentrations and convective precipitation over land provide evidence of intensification of the global hydrologic cycle in response to surface warming. The extent to which terrestrial ecosystems modulate these two components of the hydrologic cycle is important to understanding biophysical feedbacks in the climate system and the availability of water resources. Here, we use a multi-year oxygen-18 and deuterium isotope record of liquid water (precipitation, soil, and plants), atmospheric vapor, tall tower flux measurements, and Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian (STILT) modeling to constrain the importance of evapotranspiration, and other source terms, in the humidification of the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Using an isotope tracer approach we estimated that mid-continental water vapor in the PBL can be derived from as much as 75% local evaporation during the growing season. This result is supported using an inverse modeling approach for cases of extreme dew-point events that have a strong agricultural fingerprint. The isotope observations of water vapor and precipitation were combined with a Monte-Carlo simulation to help constrain a mixing model to estimate the fraction of evaporated terrestrial water in precipitation. The results indicate that growing season precipitation has a median recycling signature of about 30% and is used to help diagnose recycling ratios in mesoscale models. Our land surface modeling results highlight that regional evaporation has changed little over the last 50 years and that the expansion of agricultural crops in the US Midwest has likely reduced the local annual contribution to atmospheric water vapor. These findings are consistent with observed increases in the regional stream-flow data. The compressed growing season of agricultural crops and their high transpiration rates may amplify precipitation intensity and runoff.",

            "abstract": "Magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits document the interplay between saline fluid flow and rock permeability. Numerical simulations of multi-phase flow of variably miscible, compressible H20-NaCl fluids in concert with a dynamic permeability model can reproduce characteristics of porphyry copper and epithermal gold systems. This dynamic permeability model incorporates depth-dependent permeability profiles characteristic for tectonically active crust as well as pressure- and temperature-dependent relationships describing hydraulic fracturing and the transition from brittle to ductile rock behavior. In response to focused expulsion of magmatic fluids from a crystallizing upper crustal magma chamber, the hydrothermal system self-organizes into a hydrological divide, separating an inner part dominated by ascending magmatic fluids under near-lithostatic pressures from a surrounding outer part dominated by convection of colder meteoric fluids under near-hydrostatic pressures. This hydrological divide also provides a mechanism to transport magmatic salt through the crust, and prevents the hydrothermal system to become “clogged” by precipitation of solid halite due to depressurization of saline, high-temperature magmatic fluids. The same physical processes at similar permeability ranges, crustal depths and flow rates are relevant for a number of active systems, including geothermal resources and excess degassing at volcanos. The simulations further suggest that the described mechanism can separate the base of free convection in high-enthalpy geothermal systems from the magma chamber as a driving heat source by several kilometers in the vertical direction in tectonic settings with hydrous magmatism. This hydrology would be in contrast to settings with anhydrous magmatism, where the base of the geothermal systems may be closer to the magma chamber.",

            "abstract": "Ray-based or approximate forward modeling techniques have been often used to reduce the computational demands for inversion purposes. Due to increasing computational power and possible parallelization of inversion algorithms, accurate forward modeling can be included in advanced inversion approaches such that the full-wavefield content can be exploited. Here, recent developments of large-scale quantitative electromagnetic induction (EMI) inversion and full-waveform ground penetrating radar (GPR) inversions are discussed that yield higher resolution of quantitative medium properties compared to conventional approaches due to the use of accurate modeling tools that are based on Maxwell’s equations. For a limited number of parameters, a combined global and local search using the simplex search algorithm or the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) can be used for inversion. Examples will be shown where calibrated large-scale multi-configuration EMI data measured with new generation multi-offset EMI systems are inverted for a layered electrical conductivity earth, and quantitative permittivity and conductivity values of a layered subsurface can be obtained using on-ground GPR full-waveform inversion that includes the estimation of the unknown source wavelet. For a large number of unknowns, gradient-based optimization methods are commonly used that need a good start model to prevent it from being trapped in a local minimum. Examples will be shown where the non-linearity invoked by the presence of high contrast media can be tamed by using a novel combined frequency-time-domain full-waveform inversion, and a low-velocity waveguide layer can be imaged by using crosshole GPR full-waveform inversion, after adapting the starting model using waveguide identification in the measured data. Synthetic data calculated using the inverted permittivity and conductivity models show similar amplitudes and phases as observed in the measured data, which indicates the reliability of the obtained models.",

In this talk we apply a new global model of N2O (based on GEOS-Chem) and its adjoint to assess the strengths and weaknesses of this network for quantifying N2O emissions. We employ an ensemble of pseudo-observation analyses to evaluate the relative constraints provided by ground-based (surface, tall tower) and airborne (HIPPO, CARIBIC) observations, and the extent to which variability (e.g. associated with pulsing or seasonality of emissions) not captured by the a priori inventory can bias the inferred fluxes. We find that the ground-based and HIPPO datasets each provide a stronger constraint on the distribution of global emissions than does the CARIBIC dataset on its own. Given appropriate initial conditions, we find that our inferred surface fluxes are insensitive to model errors in the stratospheric loss rate of N2O over the timescale of our analysis (2 years); however, the same is not necessarily true for model errors in stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Finally, we examine the a posteriori error reduction distribution to identify priority locations for future N2O measurements.",

            "abstract": "Earth is not the only planet in the Solar System with a natural magnetic shield. Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are similarly protected from the solar wind and cosmic rays. However, like our planet, the magnetic shielding of each of these magnetized planets can break down, driving energy flow through each planetary magnetosphere. Although studies of the magnetopause boundary of Earth’s magnetosphere have shed considerable light on the processes that lead to this breakdown, the extent to which we can apply this understanding to the diverse space plasma environments surrounding other planets remains unclear. Here we review what we have learnt so far about the operation of magnetopause boundary processes at all the magnetized planets in the Solar System, and outline some of the relevant outstanding questions. We start by consolidating present understanding of terrestrial magnetopause processes, which is our reference when considering other boundaries. We focus on selected processes (magnetic reconnection, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability), compare how we expect them to operate at each planetary magnetopause, and assess whether or not this is consistent with in situ spacecraft observations. For each planetary magnetosphere we then discuss the nature of the total interaction with the solar wind, and whether this is expected to be dominant over internal drivers of magnetospheric dynamics. A combination of further spacecraft exploration and dedicated numerical modeling is required in order to address the many outstanding questions concerning this topic. Progress in this direction would have broad implications for other space plasma systems, in our solar system and beyond.",

            "abstract": "One of the primary goals of paleo-sea level research is to assess the stability of ice sheets and glaciers in warming climates. In this context, the 20th century may be thought of as the most recent, recorded, and studied of all past episodes of warming. Over the past decade, a consensus has emerged in the literature that 20th century global mean sea level (GMSL), inferred from tide gauge records, rose at a mean rate of 1.6-1.9 mm/yr. This sea-level rise can be attributed to multiple sources, including thermal expansion of the oceans, ice sheet and glacier mass flux, and anthropogenic changes in land water storage. The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC summarized the estimated contributions of these sources over 1901-1990 and computed a total rate, using a bottom-up approach, of ~1.0 mm/yr, which falls significantly short of the rate inferred from tide gauge records. Using two independent probabilistic approaches that utilize models of glacial isostatic adjustment, ocean dynamics, and the sea-level fingerprints of rapid land-ice melt to analyze tide gauge records (Kalman smoothing and Gaussian process regression), we are able to close the 20th century sea-level budget and resolve the above enigma. Our revised estimate for the rate of GMSL rise during 1901-1990 is 1.1–1.3 mm/yr (90% credible interval). This value, which is ~20-30% less than previous estimates, suggests that the change in the GMSL rate from the 20th century to the last two decades (2.7 ± 0.4 mm/yr, consistent with past estimates) was greater than previous estimates. Moreover, since some forward projections of GMSL change into the next century are based in part on past estimates of GMSL change, our revised rate may impact projections of GMSL rise for the 21st century and beyond.",

This is especially true in meteorology, a form of geophysical fluid dynamics many people encounter on a daily basis. Meteorologists often need to know specialized computer skills, including the use of scripting languages to automate handling large bundles of data, manipulating four-dimensional arrays (with three spatial dimensions and one time dimension), visualizing said datasets simply and effectively for publication, and performing statistical analysis of those datasets. Such topics are often addressed only at the senior undergraduate level or graduate school. At SUNY Oneonta, we are piloting a course that teaches these skills to third-semester students with the intent of building confidence in these skills throughout students' careers and with the of building a tool-box of skills that can be used in upper-division courses and undergraduate research. This poster will present the methods used in building this course, the kinds of activities designed, the desired student learning outcomes, and our assessment of those outcomes, and new initiatives engaged since the completion of the NSF-funded portion of the project in 2012.",

            "abstract": "The magnetotelluric (MT) data always exhibits nonstationarities due to variations of source mechanisms causing MT variations on different time and spatial scales. An additional non-stationary component is introduced through noise, which is particularly pronounced in marine MT data through motion induced noise caused by time-varying wave motion and currents. We present a new heuristic method for dealing with the non-stationarity of MT time series based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The EMD method is used in combination with the derived instantaneous spectra to determine impedance estimates. The procedure is tested on synthetic and field MT data. In synthetic tests the reliability of impedance estimates from EMD-based method is compared to the synthetic responses of a 1D layered model. To examine how estimates are affected by noise, stochastic stationary and non-stationary noise are added on the time series. Comparisons reveal that estimates by the EMD-based method are generally more stable than those by simple Fourier analysis. Furthermore, the results are compared to those derived by a commonly used Fourier-based MT data processing software (BIRRP), which incorporates additional sophisticated robust estimations to deal with noise issues. It is revealed that the results from both methods are already comparable, even though no robust estimate procedures are implemented in the EMD approach at present stage. The processing scheme is then applied to marine MT field data. Testing is performed on short, relatively quiet segments of several data sets, as well as on long segments of data with many non-stationary noise packages. Compared to BIRRP, the new method gives comparable or better impedance estimates, furthermore, the estimates are extended to lower frequencies and less noise biased estimates with smaller error bars are obtained at high frequencies. The new processing methodology represents an important step towards deriving a better resolved Earth model to greater depth underneath the seafloor.",

On the outer slope, most calderas display radial fissures and, in limited cases, also circumferential fissures. Despite many hypotheses, the conditions controlling the formation of radial and/or circumferential fissures, and thus the shallow magma transfer within the volcano slopes, are still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate with numerical and analog models that the mass redistribution associated with caldera formation promotes shallow sill-shaped magma chambers and controls the orientation of eruptive fissures. We find that depending on the initial injection depth, dikes will bend or twist about an axis parallel to propagation resulting in circumferential and radial eruptive fissures, respectively. This mechanism is governed by the competition between gravitational unloading pressure and dike overpressure. We apply our results to Fernandina (Galapagos, Ecuador), the best case of caldera with radial and circumferential fissures, showing that the predicted stress field caused by the caldera unloading is consistent with the pattern of eruptive fissures and the dynamics of magma propagation.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation for Aviation Safety (NAIRAS) model is a real-time, global, physics-based model for predicting exposure to cosmic radiation to air travelers from both galactic and solar sources. Tabular and graphical data products from the prototype operational NAIRAS model have been available to the public since April 2011. An initial validation of the NAIRAS model was recently conducted by comparing predicted dose rates with tabulated reference aircraft measurement data and recent aircraft radiation measurements taken in 2008. However, aircraft measurements alone do not provide an unambiguous constraint on the model such that the predominant source of uncertainty in the NAIRAS model could be uniquely identified. High altitude measurements above the Pfotzer maximum are needed to characterize the extent to which the NAIRAS model can predict the cosmic radiation primaries, which are the source of the secondary particles that are responsible for radiation exposure at aircraft flight altitudes. The Radiation Dosimetry Experiment (RaD-X) is a NASA high-altitude balloon flight mission with the goal of improving model characterization of cosmic radiation primaries by taking dosimetric measurements above the Pfotzer maximum. A second goal of the RaD-X mission is to facilitate the pathway toward data assimilative predictions of atmospheric cosmic radiation exposure by identifying and characterizing low-cost radiation measurement solutions. RaD-X is scheduled for launch at Fort Sumner, NM in September 2015. Here we briefly describe the NAIRAS model, present the science and mission overview of the RaD-X mission, and show preliminary results from instrument beam tests and calibration.",

Some of these ultramafic bodies have previously been proposed to represent relicts of residual mantle. In this study we present new bulk-rock major, trace and platinum-group element data, as well as mineral chemistry for these rocks in order to constrain their origin. The ultramafic rocks form two distinct geochemical trends, which project away from local tholeiitic basalts and boninite-like volcanic rocks, respectively. The ultramafic rocks have FeOt contents of up to 16 wt.% and Al2O3 up to 11 wt.%, with abundant normative orthopyroxene (opx). Their trace element patterns are broadly parallel with the two types of volcanic rocks with which they are associated. All analysed rocks have fractionated chondrite-normalised platinum-group element patterns with relatively low Os and Ir abundances. The few spinel grains that were found to be potentially primary (Fe3+# <10) have Cr# of around 73 and most have Mg# of about 23. None of the above geochemical features are compatible with a residual mantle origin of the ultramafic rocks in the Isua supracrustal belt. Instead, these data suggest an origin of the ultramafic rocks by accumulation of mainly olivine+spinel during fractional crystallisation of the tholeiitic basalts and the boninite-like volcanic series, and possibly continued crystallisation of plagioclase (plag) ±opx to form the more Al-rich cumulates. Depending on the amount of accumulated plag and opx, the observed bulk-cumulate requires additional input from the evolving liquids to account for the elevated SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, normative opx and the trace element abundances of the ultramafic rocks.",

Emergency managers track flood potential, particularly in years with above-normal snow conditions. The Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC) of the National Weather Service issues operational streamflow forecasts in the western United States. Runoff during the critical April through July period is predominantly driven by snowmelt; therefore, the CBRFC and users of its forecasts consider snow observations to be highly valuable.\nIn CBRFC’s area of responsibility, the density of stations within gauge-based observation networks is not ideal. Snowpack estimates from satellite-borne instruments may aid in filling data gaps where information from point networks is unavailable. CBRFC has partnered with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) under funding from NASA to incorporate remotely-sensed snow data from NASA’s MODIS instrument into CBRFC forecasts. The partnership will enter its third year in 2015 and demonstrates an invaluable collaboration between operational and research scientists.\nResearch indicates that streamflow prediction errors could be reduced through use of remotely-sensed snow data. In the first two years of collaboration, CBRFC and JPL increased forecaster awareness of snow conditions via the MODIS datasets, which subsequently increased forecaster confidence in manual modifications to snowpack simulations. Indication of the presence or lack of snow by MODIS assisted CBRFC forecasters in determining the cause of divergence between modeled and gauged streamflow. Indication of albedo conditions at the snow surface provided supporting information about the potential for accelerated snowmelt rates. CBRFC and JPL also continued retrospective analysis of relationships between the remotely-sensed snow data and streamflow patterns.\nUtilization of remotely-sensed snow data is an important piece of the snowmelt-driven streamflow prediction challenge. The CBRFC-JPL collaboration is expected to continue over the next several years as CBRFC and JPL work together to improve estimates of snowpack conditions used in operational forecasting of snowmelt-driven streamflow.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties in aerosol distributions, properties, and processes allow for a wide diversity of aerosol representations in global models, which complicates the attribution of simulated climate change, for example, to specific forcing agents. A component of model diversity results from fundamental unknowns in critical aerosol parameters, such as optical properties. Other components of model diversity, however, arise from structural considerations of the models themselves, for instance, spatial resolution and basic model physics. We investigate these sources of diversity using different instances of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) Earth system model. GEOS-5 runs the Goddard Chemistry, Aerosol, Radiation, and Transport (GOCART) aerosol module online and radiatively coupled within its atmospheric general circulation model. Three specific structural considerations are addressed: horizontal spatial resolution, meteorology, and model physics. For all cases the GOCART aerosol module is held fixed. Results of the different simulations are intercompared and evaluated in the context of aerosol remote sensing observations from MODIS, MISR, AERONET, and CALIOP. Spatial resolution is considered by running the system at grid resolutions varying from about 2º (typical of climate simulations) to 0.25º (typical of global weather forecasting systems). Meteorology is considered by driving the model with either internally generated winds or else by replaying from the MERRA meteorological reanalysis. Model physics is considered by testing two versions of the GEOS-5 system. For all cases we consider the resulting diversity among the simulated aerosol distributions and properties, in comparison with observations, as well as the impact on computed aerosol radiative fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Plasma sheet transport is bimodal, consisting of both large-scale adiabatic convection and bursty flows. The bursty flows are associated with plasma sheet bubbles, containing lower entropy parameter PV5/3 than their neighbors. Although bubbles are major contributors to plasma sheet transport, it is still unclear whether they play a critical role in the formation of the storm-time ring current, since bubbles are much more frequently observed tailward of 10 Re in the magnetotail than inside geosynchronous orbit. In this paper, we use RCM-E, which combines the Rice Convection Model (RCM) with the magnetic field in force balance with particle pressure, to simulate an idealized geomagnetic storm. In the simulation, random bubble injections through the high latitude boundary are superimposed on a background of large-scale enhanced convection. We use the RCM-E solutions with the test particle approach to determine the relative roles of the three mechanisms of formation of the storm-time ring current: (1) energization of particles already trapped on closed drift trajectories; (2) localized injection of plasma sheet particles in flow channels associated with bubbles; (3) large-scale cross-tail particle transport from the tail into the inner magnetosphere under enhanced convection. We will discuss the fractional contribution of each of the three sources to the storm-time ring current and provide a picture of how each mechanism works.",

            "abstract": "This work develops a non-linear Bayesian inversion to infer the spatio-temporal evolution of earthquake rupture on a fault surface from seismic data with rigorous uncertainty estimation. The fundamental problem of estimating slip on an unknown fault surface from incomplete and noisy data is highly non-linear, non-unique, and challenging to address without making substantial assumptions about some of the unknowns. To date, uncertainties of rupture parameters are poorly understood, and the effect of choices such as fault discretisation on uncertainties has not been studied. We show that model choice is closely linked to uncertainty estimation and can have profound effects on results.\nThe inversion is based on a trans-dimensional fault model, avoids regularization, and provides rigorous uncertainty estimation that accounts for model-selection ambiguity associated with the fault discretisation. In particular, the fault is parametrized using irregular grids which match the local resolving power of the data and provide simple solutions requiring few parameters to capture complex rupture characteristics. Causal first rupture times are obtained by solving the Eikonal equation for a spatially variable rupture-velocity field. The inversion is applied to W-phase waveforms (vertical components) from the 2010 Maule (Chile) earthquake. Residual errors are highly correlated and likely dominated by theory error, necessitating iterative estimation of a non-stationary data covariance matrix. Slip is concentrated in two zones up-dip of and north and south of the hypocentre, respectively. While this aspect of the slip distribution is similar to previous studies, we show that the slip maximum in the southern zone is poorly resolved compared to the northern zone. Both slip maxima show larger slip than reported in previous studies, which we speculate may be due to the lack of bias caused by the regularization used in other studies.",

            "abstract": "We present 3D ThermoHydroMechanical (THM) and HydroMechanical (HM) numerical simulations to study the mechanisms of induced seismicity and the role of mechanical stress transfer due to the injection of cold water within a geothermal reservoir strongly impacted by a network of minor faults. Modeling assumptions are based on the results of previous modeling of the Northwest Geysers EGS Demonstration Project in California. We used the data collected during a one-year injection program to calibrate the hydraulic and mechanical properties and the in situ stress field. To estimate the impact of the thermal effects, we compared the results of the THM simulations to those of the HM simulations; then, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the initial stress conditions. We investigated the link between the direction of the maximum horizontal stress, the propagation of mechanical stress transfer, and the reactivation of the preexisting fractures. Our simulations suggest that the mechanism of inducing microseismicity is related to injection-induced pressure, and the stress reduction caused by the thermal effect promotes additional displacements along the fault during the rupture. During the injection, the reservoir expansion caused by the pressure increase led to mechanical stress transfer, which prevented or delayed the reactivation of preexisting fractures. After injection had stopped, there was an inversion of the mechanical stress transfers that favored shear reactivation. Thermomechanical processes affecting microseismicity are complex. Thermal processes lead to stress reduction, which may cause shear reactivation along the fracture network channeling the fluid flow, depending on the fluid-flow direction and the initial state of stress. Overall, our study shows the importance of considering the orientation of the stress field in relation to the main flow direction, which has a significant impact on the temporal and spatial evolution of the fracture network reactivation.",

            "abstract": "Modeling soil processes across broad spatial scales to predict trends in soil C stocks is a challenging but manageable task using process-based models, large datasets and sufficient computing resources. Efforts to model soil processes and estimate trends in carbon stocks across broad scales began over two decades ago, and with the production of new and more comprehensive datasets as well as advances in computing technology, these analyses are becoming more tractable over time. We have used the DayCent ecosystem model to estimate soil C stock changes across US agricultural lands from 1990 to 2007, combining land survey data from about 400,000 locations with soil profile data from SSURGO, weather data from the NARR product, vegetation indices from MODIS EVI products, and management information from a variety of data sources. We assessed the accuracy and precision in the model estimates based on measurements of soil C stocks from long-term agricultural experiments. From 1990 to 2007, soil C stocks increased in US agricultural lands between 7 and 24 Tg C per year, but uncertainties generally exceeded ±50%.\nKey challenges moving forward include continued production of large datasets and reducing uncertainty in the model-based estimates. Large datasets can be costly to produce and continually update, but are critical for evaluating broad scale patterns in soil C and other environmental variables, and support for the programs compiling these data is essential. The majority of the uncertainty can be traced back to limited measurements of soil C for evaluating the model and incomplete process understanding of soil C dynamics. Ongoing research along with increased monitoring of soil C through networks of measurement sites should help to fill this need.",

            "abstract": "Plasma transport and energization of ions in the magnetotail has been shown to largely occur in the form of injections of hot plasma, localized in MLT, associated with bursty bulk flows and sharp dipolarizations of the magnetic field. However, the relationship of these transient tail phenomena to energetic particle injections into the inner magnetosphere is not well understood. Recent results by the RBSPICE instrument of the Van Allen Probes mission showed that the occurrence of energetic ion injections inside geosynchronous orbit can be very frequent throughout the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, and indicated that the contribution of such injections to the ring current buildup could be substantial. Understanding the formation and evolution of energetic ion injections in the inner magnetosphere and their relationship to transient phenomena in the tail is, therefore, of great importance. In order to differentiate between temporal and spatial variations, it is essential to investigate injections via multi-point observations. We study a substorm event that occurred during a small storm (Dst ~-40 nT), where two injections of energetic ions (50 – 300 keV), 10 minutes apart, were observed by RBSPICE instrument inside geosynchronous orbit, and six LANL and two GOES spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit. Geosynchronous spacecraft ETS-8, at a similar MLT with Van Allen Probe B, also observed the dipolarization signatures associated with these two injections. At the same time, two THEMIS spacecraft were monitoring the night-side magnetosphere at ~ 10 RE. Using ground-based magnetometer data, we are able to identify the eastward and westward edges of the current wedge associated with each one of these injections. The two injections, as observed in the inner magnetosphere, exhibit distinct differences in their dipolarization signatures as well as their duration. With all the above data at hand, we investigate the inward propagation of the injections into the inner magnetosphere, their MLT extent, their duration, as well as their relationship to activity farther down the magnetotail, in order to address the causes of the differences in the injection signatures.",

            "abstract": "Streamers are non-thermal filamentary plasmas developing in insulating mediums under influence of strong external electric fields. Decades of extensive research have been dedicated to the understanding of streamer physics and their related applications. It is now well known that streamers are fundamental components in many types of gas discharges in laboratory and in the Earth’s atmosphere, such as the dielectric-barrier discharges, the lightning discharges in thunderstorms, and the sprite discharges in the upper atmosphere. Recent studies also suggest that streamers might play an essential role in the production of terrestrial gamma ray flashes in thunderstorms. In industry, streamers have a long history of being used for various applications such as ozone production, plasma-assisted combustion, and pollution control. Moreover, benefiting from their non-thermal property, streamers have recently shown a great medical potential, for example, in wound healing and treatment of skin diseases. Understanding of the streamer propagation mechanism is of essential importance for the studies of the above-mentioned electrical discharge phenomena, as well as the industrial and medical applications of streamers. According to the present knowledge on the streamer physics, the applied electric field plays a decisive role in controlling the streamer dynamics. In this study, we propose a new understanding of the streamer propagation mechanism, in which we refine some fundamental concepts in the streamer physics. We will discuss possible ways to flexibly control the streamer parameters in applications, and also implications of this new mechanism for understanding of fundamental sprite physics.",

            "abstract": "Water resources decision-making commonly depends on monthly to seasonal streamflow forecasts, among other kinds of information. The skill of such predictions derives from the ability to estimate a watershed’s initial moisture and energy conditions and to forecast future weather and climate. We investigate the first two sources of predictability in an idealized experiment using calibrated hydrologic simulation models for 424-watersheds that span the continental US. Earlier work in this area outlined an ensemble-based strategy for attributing streamflow forecast uncertainty between two endpoints representing zero and perfect information about future forcings (ie, the National Weather Service ensemble streamflow prediction, or ESP approach) and initial conditions. This study expands this approach to characterize the influence of varying levels of uncertainty in each area on streamflow prediction uncertainty, and, importantly, we calculate derivatives in predictability throughout the initial conditions and future forcing space to illustrate how science investments can improve streamflow forecasts. Ensemble hindcasts are initialized on a monthly basis for each basin’s periods of record, and forecasts of streamflow for the 1, 3 and 6 month periods following the initialization are evaluated. Regional and seasonal variations in watershed hydroclimatology largely determine the relative importance of initial hydrologic conditions and seasonal climate forecasts, leading to striking differences between rainfall driven and snowmelt driven watersheds. We use the flow forecast skill derivatives – elasticities relative to skill in either predictability source – to characterize the regional, seasonal and predictand variations in flow forecast skill dependencies. The resulting analysis provides insights on the relative benefits of investments toward improving watershed monitoring (through modeling and measurement) versus improved climate forecasting. Among other key findings, the results suggest that climate forecast and initial condition skill improvements can be amplified in streamflow prediction skill, which means that climate forecasts may have greater benefit for monthly-to-seasonal flow forecasting than is apparent from climate forecast skill considerations alone.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization, one of the major human induced land cover and land use change, has profound impacts on the Earth system, and plays important roles in a variety of processes such as biodiversity loss, water and carbon cycle, and climate change. Accurate information on urban areas and their spatial distribution at the regional and global scales is important in both scientific and policy-making communities. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime stable light data (NTL) provide a potential way to map urban area and its dynamics economically and timely. In this study, we developed a cluster-based method to estimate the optimal thresholds and map urban extents from the DMSP/OLS NTL data. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness of the derived optimal thresholds and the reliability of the cluster-based method. Compared to existing threshold techniques, our method reduces the over- and under-estimation issue, when mapping urban extent over a large area. Using this cluster-based method, we built new global maps of 1-km urban extent from the NTL data (Figure 1) and evaluated its temporal dynamics from 1992 to 2013. Supported by the derived global urban maps and socio-economic drivers, we developed an integrated modeling framework by integrating a top-down macro-scale statistical model with a bottom-up urban growth model and projected future urban expansion.",

            "abstract": "Radial and azimuthal anisotropy has long been observed using surface waves and are believed to be controlled by earlier episodes of deformation within the Earth’s crust and uppermost mantle. Although radial and azimuthal anisotropy reflect important aspects of anisotropic media, few studies have tried to interpret them jointly. In this study, we describe a method of inversion that reconciles simultaneous observations of radial and azimuthal anisotropy under the assumption of a hexagonally symmetric medium with a tilted symmetry axis defined by a dip and strike angle. Our inferences occur within the framework of Bayesian Monte Carlo method, which yields a posterior distribution that reflects both the data and prior constraints.\nWe show that observations of radial anisotropy and the 2ψ component of azimuthal anisotropy for Rayleigh waves obtained using USArray data in the western US can be fit well assuming tilted hexagonally symmetric elastic tensors in the crust and uppermost mantle. Major results include the following. (1) Inherent S-wave anisotropy (γ) is fairly homogeneous vertically across the crust, on average, and spatially across the western US. (2) Averaging over the region of study and in depth, γ in the crust is approximately 4.1%±2%. (3) The crustal strike angle of anisotropy (defined by the intersection of the foliation plane with earth’s surface) in the posterior distribution bifurcates into two disjoint sets of models. (4) γ in the crust is approximately the same in the two groups of models. (5) Dip angles in the two groups of models vary spatially in similar ways and display geological coherence. (6) However, Rayleigh wave fast axis directions are ambiguously related to the strike of anisotropy and are oriented orthogonal to the strike angle in the geologically preferred group of model. (7) The estimated dip angle may be interpreted in two alternative ways. It is either an actual measurement of the dip of the foliation plane of anisotropic material within the crust or it is proxy for another non-geometric variable, most likely a measure of the deviation from hexagonal symmetry of the medium.\nOverall, joint analysis of radial and azimuthal anisotropy provides a more comprehensive, although still incomplete, estimation of the inherent crustal elastic moduli that cannot be achieved by either data alone.",

            "abstract": "Since the early 1990s, Ken Ludwig’s Isoplot software has been the tool of choice for visualization and analysis of isotopic data used for geochronology. The software is an add-in to Microsoft Excel that allows users to generate visual representations of data. However, recent changes to Excel have made Isoplot more difficult to use and maintain, and the software is no longer supported.\nIn the last several years, the Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences (CIRDLES), at the College of Charleston, has worked collaboratively with geochronologists to develop U-Pb_Redux, a software product that provides some of Isoplot’s functionality for U-Pb geochronology. However, the community needs a full and complete Isoplot replacement that is open source, platform independent, and not dependent on proprietary software.\nThis temporary lapse in tooling also presents a tremendous opportunity for scientific computing in the earth sciences. When Isoplot was written for Excel, it gained much of the platform’s flexibility and power but also was burdened with its limitations. For example, Isoplot could not be used outside of Excel, could not be cross-platform (so long as Excel wasn’t), could not be embedded in other applications, and only static images could be produced. Nonetheless this software was and still is a powerful tool that has served the community for more than two decades and the trade-offs were more than acceptable.\nIn 2014, we seek to gain flexibility not available with Excel. We propose that the next generation of charting software be reusable, platform-agnostic, and interactive. This new software should allow scientists to easily explore—not just passively view—their data.\nBeginning in the fall of 2013, researchers at CIRDLES began planning for and prototyping a 21st-century replacement for Isoplot, which we call Topsoil, an anagram of Isoplot. This work is being conducted in the public domain at https://github.com/CIRDLES/topsoil. We welcome and encourage community participation and contributions.",

            "abstract": "Marine Synechococcus are some of the most diverse and ubiquitous phytoplankton in the ocean, and are major contributors to global primary productivity. Iron (Fe) is a micronutrient required for maintenance of the photosynthetic apparatus that limits productivity in many parts of the ocean. To investigate how marine Synechococcus strains adapt and acclimate to Fe availability, we compared the growth, photophysiology, and protein abundance in two Synechococcus strains over a range of Fe concentrations. Synechococcus strain WH8102, from the permanently stratified southern Sargasso Sea in a region that receives significant dust deposition, had few acclimation strategies under low Fe and showed impaired growth rates and photophysiology as Fe declined. Coastal isolate WH8020, from the dynamic, seasonally variable North Atlantic Ocean, displayed a range of acclimation responses, including changes in Fe acquisition, storage, and photosynthetic electron transport proteins, substitution of flavodoxin for ferredoxin, and modified photophysiology. Each of these acclimation responses occurred at different Fe threshold concentrations over which growth rate remained remarkably stable. This study demonstrates that genomic streamlining in waters with low nitrogen and phosphorus may favor the loss of Fe acclimation genes when the Fe supply is consistent over time, and expands the regions where Fe stress is thought to occur to most coastal environments.",

This presentation synthesizes previous and new findings and highlights challenges with specific focus on remote-sensing data, their validation and processing. Research examples covering various spatial and temporal scales will be given from western, central, and eastern High Mountain Asia (HMA). The following three key points will be addressed: First, spatial patterns and magnitudes of climatic gradients along and across strike of HMA will be analyzed. This includes, for example, quantifying the differences between the high-elevation parts of western HMA that are dominated by winter snowfall and the central Himalaya that have a larger summer-monsoon rainfall component. Second, an assessment of the impact of climatic gradients on hydrologic budgets will be presented. Third, an attempt is made to assess an often overlooked, but potentially very important process: What is the impact of rare hydrometeorologic events on annual water budgets and how may they impact decadal water resources?",

In the past, N2O emissions have been difficult to quantify from atmospheric data because of the large measurement uncertainties relative to the small signal from surface sources. We overcome these challenges to estimate N2O emissions at large scale across the US agricultural belt and at regional scale over the California Central Valley using data collected from tall towers and aircraft, respectively. In general, we find N2O emissions from agriculture that exceed state and national government estimates. Furthermore, we estimate the seasonal cycle of emissions, a cycle that differs between the Great Plains and California. Finally, we will preview the results from an ongoing project to directly estimate emissions factors from fertilizer using atmospheric N2O data.",

            "abstract": "During periods of fast plate motion (e.g. Cambrian, Jurassic), plate velocities in excess of ~20 cm/yr (200 km/Myr) relative to the Earth’s spin axis have been suggested. Pinning down the position of fast moving plates requires paleomagnetic poles (paleopoles) with age resolution of a few million years. Modern generations of apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) are becoming increasingly sophisticated in handling ever-growing volumes of data, usually by applying moving windows (e.g., 10 Myr) to the available paleopoles. Averaging paleopoles of fast moving plates may however result in loss of resolution whereby abrupt (but real) changes in APWP may appear subdued when a multimillion-year moving window is applied. Episodes of fast motion are better captured by using paleopoles with best age resolution (coupled with good structural control and provided with inclination flattening estimates) grouped within discrete and independent time windows. Best age control is attained when paleopoles are retrieved from laterally reproducible magnetostratigraphic sections calibrated with biostratigraphy and/or radiometric dating and correlated with reference timescales.\nThis approach was recently applied to the construction of the Adria-Africa APWP (Muttoni et al. 2013). Paleopoles from parautochthonous regions of Adria and obtained either from biostratigraphically dated sedimentary rocks, corrected for inclination shallowing, or from radiometrically dated igneous rocks that are regarded as free from inclination shallowing, were compared with coeval, and inclination flattening-free, paleopoles from stable Africa. The resulting composite APWP shows a remarkable agreement with the Kent and Irving (2010) APWP, and displays a rapid polar shift of ~40° during the Jurassic that other APWPs tend to underestimate. This Jurassic monster shift is also predicted for Eurasia. Paleomagnetic data from the Kimmeridgian–Tithonian Garedu Formation of Iran, which was part of Eurasia since the Triassic, indicate a paleolatitude of deposition that is in excellent agreement with the latitude drop predicted by the monster shift (Mattei et al. 2014), which stands as a major and generalized plate motion event of vast and as yet unexplored paleogeographic implications.

            "abstract": "The timing of India-Asia collision is critical to the understanding of crustal deformation processes. In the NW Himalaya, a number of workers have proposed a ~55-50 Ma age for collision along the Indus suture zone which separates India from the Kohistan-Ladakh Intraoceanic Island arc (KLA) to the north. This is based on a number of factors including the age of youngest marine sediments in the suture (\ne.g. Green et al. 2008\n), age of eclogites indicative of onset of Indian continental subduction (\ne.g. de Sigoyer et al. 2000\n), and first evidence of detritus from north of the suture zone deposited on the Indian plate (\ne.g. Clift et al. 2002\n). Such evidence can be interpreted as documenting the age of India-Asia collision if one takes the KLA to have collided with the Asian plate prior to its collision with India (\ne.g. Petterson 2010 and refs therein\n). However, an increasing number of workers propose that the KLA collided with Asia subsequent to its earlier collision with India, dated variously at 85 Ma (\nChatterjee et al. 2013\n), 61 Ma (\nKhan et al. 2009\n) and 50 Ma (\nBouilhol et al. 2013\n). If correct, then the previous constraints to dating the collision as outlined above have in fact been dating the timing of India-arc collision, rather than the final ocean closure and terminal collision of India+arc with Asia as previously believed. This, plus the questioning of earlier provenance work of Clift et al. (\n2002\n) regarding the validity of their data for constraining the time when detritus from north of the suture first arrived on the Indian plate (\nHenderson et al. 2011\n) suggests that the time is right for a reappraisal of this topic. But which method to use? A provenance study now brings with it a requirement to distinguish between detritus from the KLA and Southern margin of Asia. Recently, Bouilhol et al (\n2013\n) undertook a detailed study of the KLA, using temporal and spatial variation of zircon U-Pb and Hf as well as Sr-Nd bulk analyses, to document the arc’s collision with India at 50 Ma and its subsequent collision with Asia at 40 Ma. Such variation should be reflected in the detrital record of material eroded from the arc. We use zircon U-Pb and Hf analyses from Palaeogene sediments deposited in and adjacent to the Indus suture in Ladakh, to further explore the interpretations presented in that research.",

            "abstract": "We use the oscillatory pore pressure method for simultaneous measurements of rock transport properties, such as intrinsic permeability and specific storage capacity. The pore pressure pulsing method has been described by several researchers; however we examine the relationship between a rock’s transport properties and dynamic pressure parameters, such as amplitude and frequency. We confirm that the oscillating pore pressure method accurately measures permeability; however storage capacity values suffer from measurement uncertainties. We further developed a novel method to infer the permeabilities from frequency-dependent data. Permeabilities are calculated by non-linear least-squares fitting of the pressure attenuation and phase data, measured on three rock samples at various confining pressures and oscillating pore pressure frequencies.\nPermeabilities estimated for three tested specimen were in close agreement with steady-state values. Storage capacities, however, exhibit significant absolute errors. Frequency dependence of derived values were furtherexplored, and an apparent increase in permeability has been noticed. These observations do not necessarily indicate a dispersion effect of the absolute permeability of the rock sample. We explain this effect by the deviation in phase shifts, caused by non-Darcy or radial flow. Permeabilities still can be inverted with high accuracy from the frequency-dependent amplitude ratio data, as well as lower frequency limit of phase data by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the theoretical permeability curve. Our future work includes measuring lower permeability rocks, such as tight gas sandstones and shales. We also plan to expand the working frequency range by utilizing pore pressure intensifier as a source of pressure oscillations.",

            "abstract": "Contamination of the subsoil is a major concern in industrially developed as well as developing countries. Liquids introduced into the unsaturated zone will migrate as a liquid phase, however, they will also vaporize and migrate in a gaseous state. In particular, vapor (gas) plumes migrate easily in the unsaturated zone. Heavy vapors migrate, preferentially downward, due to their greater density and thus pose a potential threat to aquifers.\nLarge scale column experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate migration of carbon disulfide vapor. Carbon disulfide (CS2), amongst others used for the manufacture of viscous rayon, is an industrial, non-polar solvent. It is highly volatile and characterized by a higher density than water (ρ = 1.263 g/cm3) and, above all, denser than air when in a gaseous state (1.6 compared to air).\nThe goals of these investigations were to quantitatively describe density-driven vapor migration in the subsurface at a large scale with clearly defined and controlled boundary conditions. The experiments were conducted in vertical, large columns (ID = 0.109 m) of 4 m length packed with dry porous medium in which the migration behavior of CS2vapor was characterized. Different types of glass beads were used to investigate the influence of permeability. The porous medium was kept dry to avoid partitioning effects due to pore water. The upper and lower boundaries were open to the atmosphere and hence constant pressure boundaries which allowed for an unhindered migration of the heavy vapor injected in the middle section of the column. Gas samples were taken along the column throughout the experiment and analyzed using a GC (HP 6890 Series) to quantify time and space dependent migration.\nThe set-up of the experiment was numerically reproduced employing a 1-D, two-phase, two-component, isothermal model. Simulation results were compared with data from vapor migration experiments to verify the model. Variations were performed to investigate the parameter sensitivity and delineate influences from boundary conditions. The results of the numerical model confirmed the experimental results, thus the work greatly contributes to the general process understanding of density-driven vapor migration.",

            "abstract": "A large body of THEMIS-era research has made significant progress in studying both the morphology and the impact on substorm development of pre-onset auroral streamers. Specifically, beginning in 2010, a series of papers by Nishimura, Lyons, and others has laid out a scenario in which pre-onset white light streamers that appear to move from hight to low latitude represent low entropy flux tubes propagating to the near-Earth transition region. These entropy depleted flux tubes trigger an instability which then grows exponentially, rapidly leading to substorm onset. In the context of previously established terminology, this is considered a hybrid triggered inside-out scenario. More recent work has also challenged the traditional interpretation that Pi2 pulsations, the initiation of the substorm current wedge, and auroral onset are nearly simultaneous, as predicted by a model of onset driven by magnetotail flow bursts. Instead, it has been argued that auroral onset occurs many minutes earlier, and that further development is fed by post-onset auroral streamer activity. In this talk, I assess the role of of pre-onset auroral streamers in substorm onset and development, and review how the observations and interpretations relate to our current understanding of magnetotail processes.

            "abstract": "Geogenic As contamination of groundwater is an enormous public health problem in West Bengal and neighboring Bangladesh. The source of As and its release mechanisms are investigated at a field site in rural West Bengal where As concentrations up to 531 μg/L are measured in domestic wells. The shallow groundwater system is hosted by sediments deposited in a meandering fluvial environment, a typical setting in the Bengal Delta Plain. A numerical groundwater flow model is developed in order to establish the hydrogeological context for As contamination patterns. Reverse particle tracking is then used to map the flow path from each well screen back to its point of recharge. High-As groundwaters are found to be recharged in ponds marking an abandoned river channel; however, the source of As is located within the underlying channel-fill sediments. Analyses of environmental tracers reveal that As release within these sediments is accompanied by a concomitant release of Br and DOC indicating that these species may be decay products of natural organobromines co-deposited along with As. Mass transfer of As to the dissolved phase and its flushing from source sediments are described using a simplified reactive solute transport model. By fitting this model to observations, a characteristic reaction time for mass transfer is estimated at 6.7 years. With the advent of intensive irrigation pumping, bulk groundwater residence times in the source are estimated to have declined from 16.6 to 6.6 years. The ratio of residence and reaction times, a Damköhler number, has declined correspondingly from 2.49 to 0.99, indicating a shift from transport to reaction rate limited As mobilization. Greater insight into the As problem in Asia may be achieved by switching the focus of field investigations from plumes in aquifers to potential contamination sources in aquitards.",

This transformation is necessary to gain efficiencies in maintaining operational ocean observation networks and to increase their reliability, which will reduce maintenance costs. The presentation will also compare and contrast existing and planned systems.\nThe Self-Contained Ocean Observations Payload (SCOOP) takes advantage of the advances in communications and small, efficient, multi-purpose sensors to reduce the size and costs of systems and expand the suite of available real-time ocean observations. The communications will allow NDBC to increase the precision and decrease the latency of the observations. The hallmark of SCOOP is the modularity of the payloads that allow NDBC to host specialized systems, for the oceanographic research community, which may include observing ocean acidification and algal blooms, and tracking marine life, alongside its standard suite of meteorological, oceanographic, and wave systems. SCOOP will include cameras, primarily to document vandalism incidents, but they can also serve to corroborate many of the automatic observations.\nThe two-year integration project – focused on recapitalization of NDBC’s network of Hurricane Weather buoys - is aided by NDBC’s 40 years of experience with marine observations and its continually improving approach to testing. Testimony to the rigor of NDBC’s development and test procedures is that the World Meteorological Organization and the Intergovernmental Ocean Commission have designated NDBC as the first Regional Marine Instrumentation Center (RMIC).\nIntegral to the fielding of these new systems is a Mission Control Center (MCC) performing the real-time, specialized monitoring and analyses and operating marine autonomous vehicles and sub-surface profiling vehicles that augment and expand upon the moored buoy observations.\nPlans are to make the first operational deployments of SCOOP in the Atlantic Ocean in time to provide the expanded suite of ocean observations during the 2015 hurricane season.",

Droughts, in particular, can add significant stress to the water and energy systems by reducing water supply that constrains not only water use but also energy production.

The Platform for Regional Integrated Modeling and Analysis (PRIMA), an integrated framework designed to address water-energy nexus, is being tested in its ability to simulate the meteorological and hydrological conditions of the 2012 drought and the consequent impacts on water supply, stream temperature, and energy demand and production. Driven by regional scenarios of climate change and the RCPs, the models are also being used to project changes in water deficits in the U.S. Changes in droughts and their compounding effects through changes in multiple variables such as precipitation, temperature, streamflow, and stream temperature will be analyzed to provide insights on vulnerability of the water and energy systems.",

            "abstract": "In the Dry Andes of Chile (17 to 35° S), debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers are differentiated from “true” glaciers based on the percentage of surface debris cover, thickness of surface debris, and ice content. These landforms are more numerous than glaciers in the Central Andes; however, there are often omitted from inventories. Glaciers, debris covered glaciers, and rock glaciers are being removed by mining, while agricultural expansion and population growth have placed an additional demand on water resources. As a result, it is important to identify and locate these features to implement sustainable solutions. The objective of this study is to develop a classification system to identify debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers based on satellite imagery interpretation. The classification system is linked to field observations and measurements of ice content. Debris covered glaciers have three subclasses: surface coverage of semi (Class 1) and fully covered (Class 2) glaciers differentiates the first two forms, whereas debris thickness is critical for Class 3 when glaciers become buried with more than 3 m of surface debris. The amount of ice decreases from more than 85%, to 65-85%, to 45-65% for semi, fully, and buried debris-covered glaciers, respectively. Rock glaciers are characterized by three stages. Class 4 rock glaciers have pronounced transverse ridges and furrows that arch across the surface, which indicate flow produce via ice. Class 5 rock glaciers have ridges and furrows that appear linear in the direction of flow, and Class 6 rock glaciers have subdued surface topography that has been denudated as the rock glacier ceases movement. Ice content decreases from 25-45% ice, to 10-25% ice, to less than 10% ice from Class 4 to 6, respectively. The classification scheme can be used to identify and map debris covered glaciers and rock glaciers to create an inventory to better estimate available water resources at the basin-wide scale.",

The general methods on network analogies were presented in a terse monograph (Madden, 1972) which came to be called “The Grey Peril” by his students, named more for the challenge of deciphering the material as for the color of its cover. This talk will focus on Ted’s first major use of the transmission line analogy in treating the Earth’s Schumann resonances. This approach in Madden and Thompson (1965) provided a greatly simplified two-dimensional treatment of an electromagnetic problem with a notable three-dimensional structure. This skillful treatment that included the role of the Earth’s magnetic field also led to predictions that the Schumann resonance energy would leak into space, predictions that have been verified nearly 50 years later in satellite observations. An extension of the network analogy by Nelson (1967) using Green’s function methods provides a means to treat the inverse problem for the background Schumann resonances for the global lightning activity. The development of Madden’s methods will be discussed along with concrete results based on them for the monitoring of global lightning.",

            "abstract": "Spectral detections from VNIR imaging spectrometers OMEGA and CRISM suggest feldspar-bearing rocks with <5% mafic minerals in restricted locations on Mars. The detections have been interpreted as anorthositic, or alternatively, felsic lithologies such as granite. The detections occur in a variety of contexts, including crater central peaks, walls, and floors, intercrater plains of Noachis Terra, and the Nili patera caldera floor. Here we focus on the Noachis Terra feldspathic rock detections, and present constraints from geologic context and complementary thermal infrared measurements. We also examine mechanisms for forming feldspar-rich lavas from crystal fractionation at the base of thick Martian crust. Noachis Terra exposures exhibit high thermal inertias and deep spectral contrast, consistent with competent, non-porous rock. They commonly overlie olivine basaltic bedrock and are ~20-25 m thick. THEMIS spectra from these units are inconsistent with quartz abundances > 5%, ruling out felsic compositions. THEMIS spectra are consistent with both anorthositic and basaltic lithologies; laboratory spectra of these lithologies are indistinguishable at THEMIS resolution. TES spectra do not match library anorthosites, with ~20-30% modeled pyroxene and ~5-10% olivine. Strong contribution from basaltic sediment to the TES spectra is unlikely given the deeper spectral contrast associated with the feldspathic units than underlying olivine basaltic bedrock. Future work will include spectral comparison with other low silica, feldspathic rocks to determine if there is an analog material that is consistent with both the VNIR and TIR observations. The geologic context of the Noachis units suggests volcanic, rather than plutonic origins, although shallow sills or subglacial eruptive units are possible. Previous experimental and modeling work by Nekvasil showed that feldspar-rich (up to 75 wt%), low-silica lavas may be produced from known Martian basalt by shallow crystallization of liquids residual to partial fractionation at the base of a thick Martian crust. The plagioclase fraction increases with both the extent and depth of fractionation. Given that Noachis Terra is associated with thick highlands crust, this mechanism would be a plausible explanation for feldspathic rock detections in this region.",

            "abstract": "Diamond formation coupled with metasomatic reactions involving the interaction of fluids with silicate host rocks provides important clues about the deep carbon cycle. However, quantitative modeling of diamond formation with silicate rock metasomatism has not been possible. Here the Deep Water (DEW) model [1] was used to generate equilibrium constants for irreversible chemical mass transfer calculations monitoring evolving fluid chemistry during diamond formation and coupled silicate reactions.\nConceptual models for diamond formation in two environments were constructed for the purpose of illustrating the role of pH in diamond-forming systems. For cratonic diamonds, fluid at 900°C and 5.0 GPa was derived in equilibrium with a carbonated mafic part of a subducting slab consisting of pure diopside, enstatite, pyrope, phlogopite, magnesite, diamond and pyrite. The fluid was assumed to infiltrate and react at constant T and P with a model metasedimentary eclogite (jadeite, pyrope, kyanite and coesite). Abundant diamond was predicted to precipitate as reactant silicate minerals were destroyed and secondary pyrope, jadeite and kyanite were precipitated, which could represent the solid inclusions in natural diamonds. The final fluid chemistry was extremely enriched in Si and depleted in Ca relative to the initial fluid, consistent with the worldwide fluid inclusion trend from carbonatitic fluid to silicic fluid. The logfO2 changed by only 0.2, whereas pH continuously decreased as reaction with jadeite and kyanite and precipitation of secondary pyrope removed Mg2+ and added H+ to the fluid. Most of the carbon precipitated as diamond was derived from decreasing concentrations of formate and propionate.\nIn the UHPM scenario, fluid at 600°C and 5.0 GPa in carbonated peridotite (forsterite, antigorite, clinochlore, magnesite, and pyrrhotite) in a subducting slab was assumed to infiltrate and react at constant T and P with a different model metasedimentary eclogite (jadeite, diopside, pyrope, almandine, coesite, magnesite and aragonite). Two generations of diamond were produced because of the relative rates of change of pH and fO2. The amount of diamond again correlated closely with the overall decrease in aqueous organic carbon species. [1] Sverjensky, D. A. et al., Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 129, 125 (2014).",

            "abstract": "Humans directly or indirectly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide variability on multiple time scales. While fossil fuel combustion and land use emissions are known to be the primary agents driving the long-term secular increase in atmospheric CO2, variability on interannual time scales has been attributed primarily to canopy-scale responses of terrestrial ecosystems to temperature and drought stress. Recent work by Wang et al. (2014) identifies a 2-fold increase in the sensitivity of the CO2 growth rate to interannual variations in temperature and attributes this trend to changing interactions between temperature and soil moisture. Here we provide an independent assessment of this trend using a different filtering approach, and describe several novel mechanisms by which humans have exerted direct control on changes in the CO2 growth rate variability over the past 50 years. These mechanisms include: 1) increasing use of fire by humans in dry and wet tropical forests, where fire behavior and fire spread is sensitive to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other climate modes, 2) modifications to ecosystems that increase their vulnerability to fire and drought stress, 3) land use responses to economic growth cycles, and 4) covariance between atmospheric transport variability and increasing regional (and interhemispheric) gradients of fossil fuel CO2. We conclude by reviewing how human and climate controls on CO2 growth rate variability are likely to change in future decades for different climate change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "A major historical limitation to geochemical studies assessing fluvial fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has been the issue of both temporal and spatial scaling. Examples will be presented from watersheds around the world highlighting how chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) measurements can be utilized as proxies for more intensive and expensive analytical analyses (e.g. molecular-level organic biomarkers). Utilizing these refined CDOM loads for terrigenous biomarkers results in improved temporal resolution and a significant change in flux estimates. Examining CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux data from an assortment of terrestrial biomes we establish a robust relationship between CDOM and DOC loads. The application of this relationship allows future studies to derive DOC loads from CDOM utilizing emerging in-situ or remote sensing technologies and thus refine river-to-ocean DOC fluxes, as well as exploit historic imagery to examine how fluxes may have changed. Calculated CDOM yields from a range of rivers are correlated to watershed percent wetland and highlight the importance of certain regions with respect to CDOM flux to the coastal ocean. This approach indicates that future studies might predict CDOM and DOC yields for different watershed types that could then be readily converted to loads providing for the estimation of CDOM and DOC export from ungauged watersheds. Examination of CDOM yields also highlights important geographical regions for future study with respect to the role of terrigenous CDOM in ocean color budgets and CDOM’s role in biogeochemical processes. Finally, examples will be presented linking CDOM parameters to DOM composition and biogeochemical properties with the aim of providing measurements to improve the spatial and especially temporal resolution of the role DOM plays in fluvial networks.",

This has resulted in rise of groundwater levels followed by degradation of soils through water logging and secondary saltbuild-up in many canal commands, and caused millions of hectares of irrigated agricultural land to go out of production. On the other hand, extensive pumping of groundwater for irrigation in some freshwater aquifers has lowered hydraulic heads and induced cross-formational flow from underlying highly mineralized older formations, which led to groundwater mixing between the formations and rise insalinity levels in the overlying fresh water aquifers over time. Some examples related to irrigation induced soil and groundwater salinization from India and the United States will be presented. Potential causes of salinization and possible solutions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Cloud cover and relative humidity in the tropics are strongly influenced by organized atmospheric convection, which occurs across a range of spatial and temporal scales. One mode of organization that is found in idealized numerical simulations is “self-aggregation”, a spontaneous transition from randomly distributed convection to organized convection despite homogeneous boundary conditions. We explore the influence of domain geometry on the mechanisms and temperature-dependence of self-aggregation of tropical convection. Specifically, the System for Atmospheric Modeling is used to perform 3-d simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium in a non-rotating framework, with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea surface temperature. The results of simulations employing a highly elongated 3-d channel domain, in which self-aggregation takes the form of multiple moist and dry bands, are compared to that of a square domain, in which self-aggregation takes the form of a single moist cluster. For both domain types, and across a range of temperatures, we characterize the fundamental physical mechanisms that lead to self-aggregation as well as its growth rate and spatial scale. The variance budget equation for the vertically integrated frozen moist static energy is used to quantify the mechanisms governing self-aggregation and characterize its time scale. We find that diabatic processes dominate the evolution of self-aggregation in the elongated channel simulations. In contrast, in the square domain simulations, similar diabatic processes dominate the initial stages of aggregation but up-gradient advection by the circulation plays a role in the later stages. Self-aggregation occurs across a much wider range of temperatures with elongated channel geometry than with square geometry. As the sea surface temperature is increased in the channel simulations, the aggregated state is characterized by smaller spatial scales and more regularity. An advantage of the channel geometry is that a separation distance between convectively active regions can be defined, which is a prerequisite for developing a spatial scaling theory.",

Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used technique to create fractures in the rock and allow oil and gas to flow into the production well. During this process, microseismics are usually accompanying fractures. These signals can be recorded by 3-component geophone arrays to provide effective monitoring to the fracture process. By locating microseismic events associated with fractures, it is possible to determine the geometry of the fracture zone and the effective production volume; observe any interactions with existing faults or events located out of fault zone.\nA set of quasi-linear equations relating observed P and S wave arrival times with source locations and velocity parameters were formulated. With this equation, both source and medium parameters can then be simultaneously determined by a least squares method. As an example, we document here the successful application of this method to hydraulic fracturing data observed at Shengli Oilfield. The proposed joint inversion can reduce the misfit between the picked and modeled traveltimes while provide correct locations for microsesmic sources and velocity model parameters. The final estimation of hypocenter for all 12 phase after 7 iterations is shown in Figure 1, where their colors denote fractures in different hydraulic stages and sizes indicate the event magnitudes. The microseismic activities are mostly around the horizontal fracturing well or close to the monitoring well, with rest events scattering throughout the entire model space.",

These earthquakes produced great site effects on the sedimentary layers that in turn significantly influenced earthquake ground motions in the area. Mapping of site response using microtremor measurements compared with geological and borehole data of Alkhobar city is the main target of this work. The resonance frequency and their H/V values have been calculated using Nakamura technique through deployed of seismograph instruments at 113 sites in AlKhobar city for different time periods. The recording length was about one hour with sampling frequency of 100 Hz. Most of the measured sites present three peaks for the resonance frequency; the first peak ranges from 0.33 to 1.03 Hz, the second peak ranges from 1.03 to 1.23 Hz, while the third peak ranges from 1.23-1.73. Tests have been conducted to ensure that these peaks are natural in origin. The northern zones of AlKhobar City have lower values of resonance frequency indicating great thickness of sediments. In contrast, the southern parts of the city have higher values of resonance frequency illustrating shallow depths of the bedrock. Furthermore, twenty of boreholes have been conducted through AlKhobar City to different depth. Standard penetration test (SPT) data has been corrected and used to calculate the resonance frequency at their locations. Borehole results clarified that the resonance frequency values range from 0.27 to 1.95 Hz. These results are correlated well with that of the microtremor measurements. Accordingly, the first peak have been interpreted due to the impedance contrast between the limestone and the overlying sediments, while the third peak is originated from a boundary between the upper most surface layer and the underlying sediments. These results must be applied for earthquake risk mitigation in AlKhobar City.",

Clear acoustic and gravity wave signatures have also been reported in ionospheric data above strong tropospheric convection [Nishioka, GRL, 40(21), 2013], and prior modeling results suggest that convectively-generated acoustic waves with ~3-4 minute periods are readily detectable above their sources in TEC [Zettergren and Snively, GRL, 40(20), 2013]. These observations have provided quantitative insight into the coupling of processes occurring near Earth’s surface with the upper atmosphere and ionosphere over short time-scales.\nHere, we investigate acoustic waves and short-period gravity waves generated by sources near ground level, and the observable responses of the mesosphere, lower-thermosphere, and ionosphere (MLTI) systems. Numerical simulations are performed using a nonlinear, compressible, atmospheric dynamics model, in cylindrically-axisymmetric coordinates, to investigate wave generation, upward propagation, steepening, and dissipation. Acoustic waves may produce observable signatures in the mesospheric hydroxyl airglow layer [e.g., Snively, GRL, 40(17), 2013], and can strongly perturb the lower-thermosphere and E- and F-region ionosphere, prior to the arrival of simultaneously-generated gravity waves. Using a coupled multi-fluid ionospheric model [Zettergren and Semeter, JGR, 117(A6), 2012], extended for mid and low latitudes using a 2D dipole magnetic field coordinate system [Zettergren and Snively, GRL, 40(20), 2013], we investigate its response to realistic acoustic wave perturbations. In particular, we demonstrate that the MLT and ionospheric responses are significantly and nonlinearly determined by the acoustic wave source geometry, spectrum, and amplitude, in addition to the local ambient state of the ionosphere.

Advances in swath sonar mapping technology over the past 30 years have led to dramatic improvements in our capability to map the seabed. However, the oceans are vast and only an estimated 10% of the seafloor has been mapped with these systems. Furthermore, the available coverage is highly heterogeneous and focused within areas of national strategic priority and community scientific interest. The major plate boundaries that encircle the globe, most of which are located in the submarine environment, have been a significant focus of marine geoscience research since the advent of swath sonar mapping. While the location of these plate boundaries are well defined from satellite-derived bathymetry, significant regions remain unmapped at the high-resolutions provided by swath sonars and that are needed to study active volcanic and tectonic plate boundary processes. Within the plate interiors, some fossil plate boundary zones, major hotspot volcanoes, and other volcanic provinces have been the focus of dedicated research programs. Away from these major tectonic structures, swath mapping coverage is limited to sparse ocean transit lines which often reveal previously unknown deep-sea channels and other little studied sedimentary structures not resolvable in existing low-resolution global compilations, highlighting the value of these data even in the tectonically quiet plate interiors.\nHere, we give an overview of multibeam swath sonar mapping of the major plate boundaries of the globe as extracted from public archives. Significant quantities of swath sonar data acquired from deep-sea regions are in restricted-access international archives. Open access to more of these data sets would enable global comparisons of plate boundary structures and processes and could facilitate a more coordinated approach to optimizing the future acquisition of these high-value data by the global research community.",

            "abstract": "Soils in watershed 3 (WS3) of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest have been divided into functional groups, called hydropedological units (HPUs), based on the thickness and presence/absence of specific horizons. HPUs had distinct biogeochemical functioning and water tables that developed in the solum after catchment wetness thresholds were exceeded. We were able to predict the spatial distribution of HPUs using digital soil mapping with 80% accuracy using digital elevation model derived topographic metrics and field mapped bedrock outcrop locations. The spatial distribution of HPUs and threshold water table behavior were used to estimate event-scale water table patterns throughout the catchment at different levels of catchment storage. The results of this analysis imply that runoff is generated differently from the classic variable source area (VSA) concept, with shallow soils in channel heads contributing stormflow on an event basis and near stream water tables that rarely expand up adjoining hillslopes. In order to investigate how these active areas in the channel head region may contribute flow to the stream network, we used dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations as a tracer of water sources from shallow organic soils. Due to their proximity to organic soil-covered bedrock outcrops and thick O-horizons, DOC concentrations in the channel head region were often the highest in the catchment. We therefore hypothesized that if shallow water tables in channel heads were connected to the stream on an event basis, their contribution would be detected at the outlet. DOC concentrations at the WS3 outlet were found to vary closely with water table fluctuations in channel heads, suggesting those areas were in fact hydrologically connected to the stream network during events. In contrast, outlet DOC concentrations did not correlate with near-stream water table fluctuations, suggesting the near-stream zone was not a major DOC source to the stream. These results illustrate the importance of understanding the spatial structure of soils distributed throughout a catchment when investigating runoff generation processes, hydrologic connectivity, and solute export.",

            "abstract": "Reservoir forecasting and management are increasingly relying on a data-driven approach, which involves data assimilation to calibrate and keep up to date the complex model of multi-phase flow and transport in the geologic formation and to evaluate its uncertainty using monitoring data of different types and temporal resolution. The numbers of unknowns and measurements are usually very large, which represents a major computational challenge. Kalman filter (KF), the archetypical recursive filter, provides the framework to assimilate reservoir monitoring data into a dynamic system but the cost of implementing the original algorithm to large systems is computationally prohibitive. In our work, we have developed several Kalman-filter based approaches that reduce the computational and storage cost of standard KF from O (m2) to O (m), where m is the number of unknowns, and have the potential to be applied to field-scale problems. HiKF, a linear filter based on the hierarchical matrix approach, takes advantage of the informative high-frequency data acquired quasi-continuously and uses a random-walk model in the state forecast step when the a state evolution model is unavailable. A more general-purpose nonlinear filter CSKF achieves computational efficiency by exploiting the fact that the state covariance matrix for most dynamical systems can be approximated adequately through a low-rank matrix, and it allows using a forward simulator as a black-box for nonlinear error propagation. We will demonstrate both methods using synthetic CO2 injection cases and compare with the standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF).",

            "abstract": "Although water is a primary controller of microbial function and we expect climate change to alter water availability in the future, our understanding of how microbial communities respond to a change in moisture and what that means for soil carbon cycling remain poorly understood. In part, this uncertainty arises from a lack of understanding of microbial response mechanisms and how those lead to aggregate soil function. Environmental tracking would be facilitated if microbial communities respond to new climatic conditions via rapid physiological acclimatization, shifts in community composition, or adaptation. In contrast, historical contingencies could be created by dispersal limitation or local adaptation to previous conditions. To address environmental tracking vs. legacies, we examined how soil microbial communities were affected by precipitation at multiple scales and asked whether rainfall was a primary driver of the observed responses. We leveraged a local steep rainfall gradient with field surveys, lab incubations, reciprocal transplants, and rainfall manipulations to approach this problem.\nAcross a steep rainfall gradient, we found that soil microbial communities were strongly associated with historical rainfall, with two-thirds of the variation in community composition explained by mean annual precipitation. In 12-month experimental lab manipulations of soil moisture, soil functional responses were constrained by historical rainfall, with greater activity in soils subjected to their original moisture condition. The constraints of historical rainfall held even after 18 months in reciprocal transplant common gardens along the rainfall gradient and with manipulated dispersal of regional microbial communities. Yet, when water was manipulated at a single site over 4 years, legacies did not develop. Overall, these findings are consistent with long-term rainfall acting as a strong habitat filter and resulting in a legacy of both microbial community composition and physiological capacity that can affect soil carbon cycling. Placing the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities in the context of historical and future environmental variation may thus provide us with a framework for improving prediction of ecosystem responses to climate change.",

Among the many observed and expected impacts of this on our climate and biosphere, one is the so-called CO2 fertilisation effect. In this effect the efficiency with which vegetation can acquire carbon relative to its water use increases proportionally with CO2 concentration, and this biological response has implications for both carbon and water balances. Despite considerable research into the impacts of CO2 fertilisation, there is still uncertainty on the catchment scale response of vegetation to elevated CO2.\nHere we present a simple, conceptually based, generic model for quantifying how CO2 fertilisation affects the structure, water use and productivity of vegetation. Using this new Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE) model we can account for Free Air Carbon Enrichment (FACE) experimental results from a diverse range of sites. We use the CUE model to estimate the effect of the ~18% rise in CO2 over the past three decades on the globe’s vegetation cover, and transpiration and carbon assimilation rates.",

This is because electromagnetic (EM) energy propagates horizontally as well as vertically. Thus energy entering through resistive windows can illuminate targets from the side and even from below. This also implies that structure far outside an array can sometimes be reliably imaged. These concepts will be illustrated using strategies developed to assess model feature validity in three-dimensional (3D) inversions of two large MT arrays in Argentina. We demonstrate the existence of electrically conductive plumes (possibly buoyant and conductive due to water content not temperature) that appear related to interaction of subducted slabs and the mantle transition zone (MTZ), to back-arc intraplate volcanism and to episodes of \"flat\" subduction in which the plate dip is substantially less than typical. Although these plumes are confirmed only in the area we have studied, we suspect that they are a worldwide phenomenon that could result in an entirely new paradigm for how the subduction process evolves after slabs leave the shallow Earth and in particular how they interact with the MTZ.",

The discovery of hydrothermal vents and their extraordinarily productive communities, along with the discovery of the deep subsurface biosphere and their slow-growing, energy-starved microbial communities have changed our ideas about the nature and extent of microbial life in the deep sea. Moreover, the avent of genomics and other -omics further reshaped our understanding of microbial evolution and ecology.\nNevertheless, after decades of research, there remain a number of long-standing questions regarding the distribution and activity of microbes in situ. For example, we know that hydrothermal vents are energy-rich environments, and the energy for microbial primary productivity at hydrothermal vents is primarily derived from compounds that are in disequilibria between hot, reduced thermal fluids and the ambient, oxidized bottom seawater. However, we have a rudimentary understanding of how microbes are distributed within this geochemical gradient, and how temporal variability in fluid flow and even eruptions influences primary and secondary productivity. At the other extreme, deep subsurface environs can be very energy limiting, and microbes are seemingly limited in their access to either electron donors (e.g. dissolved organic matter, or DOM) or electron acceptors (e.g. oxygen). Yet here, recent data revealed patterns of microbial activity in the deep subsurface that are inconsistent with our conventional wisdom, and suggest that the availability of electron donors/acceptors may be greater than previously thought.\nHere we present our latest data, as well as the technologies and methods that allow us to synoptically measure geochemistry and microbial processes (community composition and gene expression) over space and time. Our findings reveal striking patterns of microbial distribution, gene expression and activity within a vent field and in the deep subsurface that begin to shed some light on the relationship between microbial ecology and physiology and biogeochemical cycles.",

            "abstract": "The circulation of water in riverine mangrove swamps is expected to be influenced by mangrove roots, which in turn affect the nutrients, pollutants and sediments transport in these systems. Field studies were carried out in mangrove areas along the coastline of Singapore where Avicennia marina and Sonneratia alba pneumatophore species are found. Geometrical properties, such as height, diameter and spatial density of the mangrove roots were assessed through the use of photogrammetric methods. Samples of these roots were harvested from mangrove swamps and their material properties, such as bending strength and Young’s modulus were determined in the laboratory. It was found that the pneumatophores under hydrodynamic loadings in a mangrove environment could be regarded as fairly rigid. Artificial root models of pneumatophores were fabricated from downscaling based on field observations of mangroves. Flume experiments were performed and measurements of mean flow velocities, Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy were made. The boundary layer formed over the vegetation patch is fully developed after x = 6 m with a linear mean velocity profile. High shear stresses and turbulent kinetic energy were observed at the interface between the top portion of the roots and the upper flow. The experimental data was employed to calibrate and validate three-dimensional simulations of flow in pneumatophores. The simulations were performed with the Delft3D-FLOW model, where the vegetation effect is introduced by adding a depth-distributed resistance force and modifying the k-ε turbulence model. The model-predicted profiles for mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and concentration were compared with experimental data. The model calibration is performed by adjusting the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosities and diffusivities. A skill assessment of the model is performed using statistical measures that include the Pearson correlation coefficient (r), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE).",

            "abstract": "Isotope ratios in oceanic basalts, first reported by Gast and co-workers 50 years ago, are unique tracers of mantle composition, because they are expected to mirror the composition of their mantle sources. While the latter is certainly true for homogeneous sources, the plethora of studies over the last 50 years have shown that mantle sources are isotopically heterogeneous on different length scales. Isotopic differences exist between basalts from different ocean basins, volcanoes of individual ocean islands, lava flows of a single volcano, and even in µm sized melt inclusions in a single mineral grain. Diffusion, which acts to homogenize isotopic heterogeneity over Gyr timescales, limits the length scale of isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle to anywhere between several mm to 10s of meters. Melting regions, however, are typically several 100 km wide and up to 100 km deep. The scale of melting is thus generally orders of magnitude larger than the scale of isotopic heterogeneity. How partial melts mix during melting, melt transport, and melt storage then inevitably influences how isotopic heterogeneity is conveyed from source to melt. The isotopic composition of oceanic basalts hence provides an integrated signal of isotopically diverse melts. Recent mixing models and observed isotopic differences between source (abyssal peridotites) and melts (MORB) show that the range of isotopic heterogeneity of erupted melts need NOT directly reflect that of their source(s), nor need observed isotopic endmembers in source and melts be congruent. Many geochemical models, however, implicitly assume equivalence of source and melt composition. Especially when attempting to infer spatial patterns of isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle from those observed in erupted melts, or for linking isotopic diversity to geophysical structures in the mantle requires a more profound understanding to what extent erupted melts represent the isotopic composition of their mantle sources.",

            "abstract": "Detrital thermochronology offers a unique advantage over traditional bedrock thermochronology because of its sensitivity to sediment production and transportation to sample sites. In mountainous regions, modern fluvial sediment is often collected and dated to determine the past (105 to >107 year) exhumation history of the upstream drainage area. Though potentially powerful, the interpretation of detrital thermochronometer data derived from modern fluvial sediment is challenging because of spatial and temporal variations in sediment production and transport, and target mineral concentrations. Thermochronometer age prediction models provide a quantitative basis for data interpretation, but it can be difficult to separate variations in catchment bedrock ages from the effects of variable basin denudation and sediment transport.\nWe present two examples of quantitative data interpretation using detrital thermochronometer data from the Himalaya, focusing on the influence of spatial and temporal variations in basin denudation on predicted age distributions. We combine age predictions from the 3D thermokinematic numerical model Pecube with simple models for sediment sampling in the upstream drainage basin area to assess the influence of variations in sediment production by different geomorphic processes or scaled by topographic metrics. We first consider a small catchment from the central Himalaya where bedrock landsliding appears to have affected the observed muscovite 40Ar/39Ar age distributions. Using a simple model of random landsliding with a power-law landslide frequency-area relationship we find that the sediment residence time in the catchment has a major influence on predicted age distributions. In the second case, we compare observed detrital apatite fission-track age distributions from 16 catchments in the Bhutan Himalaya to ages predicted using Pecube and scaled by various topographic metrics. Preliminary results suggest that predicted age distributions scaled by the rock uplift rate in Pecube are statistically equivalent to the observed age distributions for ~75% of the catchments, but may improve when scaled by local relief or specific stream power weighted by satellite-derived precipitation. Ongoing work is exploring the effect of scaling by other topographic metrics.",

Especially in the D\" region, differential travel times of the two polarised S-waves provide information on the polarisation direction and strength of the anisotropy. Another possibility to test for the presence of anisotropy in the deep Earth is given by using the reflectivity of seismic waves: the reflection coefficient of P and S-waves is distance dependent but in the case of anisotropic material also azimuth dependent. Using P- and S-waves simultaneously allows for testing and ruling out several possible candidate mechanisms of anisotropy. The region in D\" beneath Eurasia is characterised by a number of crossing ray paths which opens the possibility for the detection of reflected P- and S-waves from three different directions and the results show a clear variation in the polarity of the reflected seismic waves. Although a number of models produce the observed P-wave reflectivity, they fail to give the correct result for the S-wave reflectivity and vice versa. The model containing a phase transition from isotropic perovskite to anisotropic post-perovskite can explain the P- and S-wave observations. We also extend our observation and analysis to other regions in the Earth where we have a sufficient number of crossing paths, and compare the anisotropic signature of these regions.",

            "abstract": "To determine the longterm sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to a warmer climate, we explored how the southern Greenland ice sheet responded to climatic changes the last 10,000 years and in particular the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), when local atmospheric temperatures in Greenland were 2-4°C higher than the present. We have used a number of threshold lakes to show that the ice margin was retracted behind its present-day extent in all sectors for a limited period between ~7 and 5 cal. kyr BP and in most sectors also from ~1.5 to 1 cal. kyr BP, in response to higher atmospheric and ocean temperatures. Ice-sheet simulations constrained by observations show good correlation with the timing of minimum ice volume indicated by the threshold lake observations. The simulated volume reduction was 0.11 to 0.19 m sea-level equivalent with centennial ice loss rates of ~87-105 Gt/yr during the HTM. Our results provide an estimate of the long-term rates of volume loss that can be expected in the future as regional air and ocean temperatures approach those reconstructed for the HTM.",

            "abstract": "The moisture storage capacity in the root zone of ecosystems acts as a buffer against climatic variability and is a critical factor controlling many physical, biogeochemical and biological processes including land-atmosphere exchanges, rainfall-runoff generation, carbon cycling and nutrient dynamics. Notwithstanding its importance this storage capacity cannot be directly observed at catchment scale.\nApproaching this problem from a different angle, we can try to understand how adaptive systems cope with the variability of essential inputs through the creation of buffers. Surprisingly, there appears to be a strong correspondence between how societies and ecosystems try to safeguard their water supply. People build reservoirs to buffer against periods of water shortage; ecosystems essentially do the same by creating sufficient moisture storage in their root zone. Both try to do this at minimum expense: people by optimizing the amount of storage at minimum costs; and ecosystems by creating an optimum root zone buffer at minimum biomass investment.\nA classical engineering way for designing the size of a reservoir is the Rippl (1883) diagram, where tangents to the accumulated inflow determine the required storage. It is a logical method for people to size the storage required to satisfy the long-term water demand. Using this principle, over time, many societies have tried to regulate their rivers, leveling out the natural dynamics of the system. But are people unique in trying to even out unwanted fluctuations or to bridge periods of water shortage?\nLike societies, ecosystems adjust their storage buffer to climatic variability. Similar to the way in which engineers design reservoirs, we can estimate the root zone storage capacity at catchment scale on the basis of observed climate and hydrological data. This approach was proven to be remarkably accurate not only in 11 catchments of the Ping river in Thailand but also in 413 catchments across the USA, with diverse climate and land surface conditions. The results illustrate that ecosystems adjust their root zone storage to periods of drought or wetness, and that the maximum root zone storage is essentially a function of climate and land cover.",

            "abstract": "While numerical weather prediction is quite accurate, prediction of regional and local climate variability remains a great challenge. One of the factors hampering skillful seasonal prediction (forecasts for future times ranging from about two weeks to a year) is a lack of understanding of the relevant feedbacks between climate subsystems, especially in the extratropics. Sources for seasonal predictability of surface atmospheric anomalies in middle latitudes have been previously sought in teleconnections to the tropical phenomenon of El-Niño-Southern Oscillation and among various extratropical drivers including sea surface temperature anomalies, Arctic sea ice cover extremes, continental snow variability and tropospheric-stratospheric interactions. However, impacts of extratropical subsurface ocean variability on atmospheric teleconnections are poorly known. Here we use a lagged regression analysis between an index of the observed summertime Atlantic water temperature (AWT) anomalies at the entrance to the Barents Sea in the period 1982-2005 and the corresponding year-round data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis to show that subsurface oceanic heat anomalies heading the Arctic Ocean are significant precursors of wintertime atmospheric anomalies over the mid-latitude Eurasia and North Pacific. We find that the remote tropospheric response arises from modification of planetary waves and interaction of mean winds with synoptic eddies leading to a reorganization of the mid-latitude storm tracks. Moreover, we show that this response may occur via a „stratospheric bridge”. As about 50% of the variance of relevant wintertime meteorological fields (storm-track activity, air temperature, winds) in some regions is explained by the previous summer AWT anomalies, we recommend incorporation of subsurface ocean temperature variability in high latitudes into seasonal prediction systems.",

            "abstract": "For the derivation of the temporal evolution and the spatial pattern of the mining induced subsidence in Sondershausen, Germany, this study employs persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) to multiple sets of SAR scenes from different sensors. The work is a part of the ongoing INFLUINS project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. In order to improve the model of subsidence derived from a single sensor, a novel methodology for integration of multiple PSI data sets is introduced. The proposed approach allows the combination of subsidence information derived from different SAR data sets with different temporal coverage and/or spatial resolution.\nAfter long and intensive mining activities, the subsidence rate in Sondershausen has gradually increased almost to a rate of 250 mm/year reaching its maximum in the early 1990s. However, since 1996 the mine is backfilled leading to a gradual decrease in the subsidence rate in the undermined part of the city. The SAR scenes cover the period of backfilling between 1995 and 2010. The displacement rates for the first ten years (1995 -2005) are derived by ERS-1/2 scenes and by an ENVISAT-ASAR stack for the following years (2004-2010). In addition, for the span of 3 years from 2007 to 2010 an ALOS-PALSAR stack is processed in order to exploit the different information provided by different sensors.\nThe vertical linear deformation rates derived by PSI clearly indicate the regions of subsidence in each set. Furthermore, they confirm the influence of backfilling, i.e. gradual decreasing of subsidence rates. These results are compared and validated with leveling measurements collected by the mine management company during 1995-2010.\nAfter the validation, the results are integrated in order to improve the quality of the subsidence model for the entire time span. With the objective of spatially refining the model derived from a single sensor, the approach exploits the PS points available in the other stacks by transferring them with a scaling factor.",

Results indicate a rise in SWT parallel to air temperature (AT) since the mid-1960s. On an annual basis, changes in water temperature were the greatest in spring and summer. As a consequence of increasing water temperatures, the duration of thermal stratification expands, mixing and retention time are affected. Changes in the food web are expected to occur, but will strongly depend on local environmental conditions and will therefore be different for individual lakes. Trends in SWT are analysed in detail for four of the lakes having the longest data records (>100 years), representing different lake types and climate provinces.",

Pilot systems are pre-breakdown phenomena that usually attributed to stepped leader development.\nIn Eindhoven University of Technology we investigate meter-scale laboratory discharges looking for similarities with natural lightning and its related phenomena. Negative lightning possesses step-like propagation behaviour which is associated with space leader formation in front of its main leader. Meter-scale laboratory sparks also develop via formation of a space stem that transforms into a pilot system and finally develops into a space leader in longer gaps. With ns-fast photography we investigated the pilot system formation and found striking similarities with high-altitude sprites. But sprites are different in size, environment and polarity. Laboratory pilot barely reaches 70 cm and develops in STP air, while high-altitude sprites reaches ionosphere stretching for dozens of kilometres. Also sprites are assumed to be of opposite to the pilot polarity. Besides that, the pilots are directly involved in x-ray generation in long laboratory sparks.\nThe detailed pilot system development process will be shown, in particular focusing on similarities with natural sprites. Basic properties of the x-ray emission will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Natural earthquake fault systems are highly heterogeneous in space; inhomogeneities occur because the earth is made of a variety of materials of different strengths and dissipate stress differently. Because the spatial arrangement of these materials is dependent on the geologic history, the distribution of these various materials can be quite complex and occur over a wide range of length scales. Despite their inhomogeneous nature, real faults are often modeled as spatially homogeneous systems. Here we present a simple earthquake fault model based on the Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) and Rundle-Jackson-Brown (RJB) cellular automata models with long-range interactions that incorporates a fixed percentage of stronger sites, or ‘asperity cells’, into the lattice. These asperity cells are significantly stronger than the surrounding lattice sites but eventually rupture when the applied stress reaches their higher threshold stress. The introduction of these spatial heterogeneities results in temporal clustering in the model that mimics those seen in natural fault systems. We observe sequences of activity that start with a gradually accelerating number of larger events (foreshocks) prior to a mainshock that is followed by a tail of decreasing activity (aftershocks). These recurrent large events occur at regular intervals, as is often observed in historic seismicity, and the time between events and their magnitude are a function of the stress dissipation parameter. The relative length of the foreshock to aftershock sequence depends on the amount of stress dissipation in the system, resulting in relatively long aftershock sequences when the stress dissipation is large versus long foreshock sequences when the stress dissipation is weak. This work provides further evidence that the spatial and temporal patterns observed in natural seismicity are strongly influenced by the underlying physical properties and are not solely the result of a simple cascade mechanism. We find that the scaling depends not only on the amount of damage, but also on the spatial distribution of that damage (Dominguez et al., 2011; Kazemian et al., 2014). These results are compared to natural earthquake sequences from around the world.",

            "abstract": "Long-term observations of large active rockslides show accelerating deformation over many thousands of years since the last deglaciation. The effect of deglaciation on slope stability is however poorly understood due to (1) limited long-term observations and (2) a complex interaction between glacier retreat and hydrogeological, mechanical, and morphological processes. To assess the sensitivity of rockslide dynamics to these different processes, a model of progressive damage through intact rock mass is developed in this study, based on the finite element method. This model uses time-to-failure laws based on rock laboratory creep experiments. It is able to reproduce progressive damage localization along shear bands associated with strain rate acceleration as observed during tertiary creep. The model reproduces the different phases of deformation associated with morphologies typical of large rockslides. This model is thus suitable for simulating the dynamics of large rockslides and the transition from initiation to rapid sliding. The sensitivity of rockslide kinematics and morphology to different mechanical properties is analyzed. This analysis shows that the time evolution of the rockslide can be inferred with the knowledge of only one time parameter, independent of the knowledge of the mechanical properties of the rock mass. This parameter is here chosen as the time when the summit slope displacement has reached 10 m, a parameter that can be estimated with cosmogenic dating. The model is then used to study the effects of deglaciation on the valley flank stability and the formation of large rockslides. This study shows that the deglaciation velocity can affect the morphology of the rockslide, with the shear band of the rockslide emerging at higher elevation as the velocity decreases.We also show that the response to the deglaciation can last several thousands of years after the glacier retreat.",

            "abstract": "Dry deposition of atmospheric oxidants to the Earth's surface or vegetation is important as both a major removal pathway governing their atmospheric abundance and as a key input of oxidants and nutrients to sensitive vegetation surfaces. By linking the atmosphere and biosphere, dry deposition processes contribute to wider climate and Earth system feedbacks which need to be adequately quantified for a full understanding of Earth system responses. In addition, they have immediate policy-relevant implications for air quality, ecosystem health and crop productivity that need to be assessed on local, regional and global scales. In this study we use results from the recent Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (HTAP) model intercomparison to explore how dry deposition of ozone varies across 15 current atmospheric chemistry and transport models. While most models take a similar, resistances-based approach to parameterising dry deposition, there are substantial differences across the models in the magnitude and variability of the annual and monthly ozone deposition fluxes which contribute to the differences in modelled surface ozone and in the global tropospheric ozone budget. We find that the range in global ozone deposition flux over the HTAP model ensemble spans about 30% with deposition to ocean, grass land and tropical forests being particularly variable. Further, we compare modelled dry deposition of ozone to measurements made at a variety of locations in Europe and North America, noting differences of up to a factor of two but no clear systematic bias over the sites examined. We extend this analysis by running sensitivity studies to determine the importance of key parameters in the ozone dry deposition process, including soil moisture and leaf area index. This study provides an important first step towards quantifying the uncertainty in ozone dry deposition and permitting a more thorough, observation-based evaluation of this important process.",

            "abstract": "Surface roughness is a crucial parameter of studies concerning (paleo) flood peak discharge estimation and related factors (cf. stream power). Usually, the analysis requires preliminary knowledge of grain size distribution of the study site. However, in some cases this is impractical, especially when investigating large areas, or even impossible due to inaccessibility. In addition, the particles in the channel are usually hidden by other particles or incorporated into finer sediment. Therefore, removing particles from the channel bottom is not suitable, because it falsifies the results.\nHere, the application of noninvasive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offers new possibilities. The indirect recording of the surface leads to a significant reduction of the workload. Furthermore, form roughness and burial/imbrication are taken into account. However, there are some disadvantages in using TLS. The resolution of the TLS data is a limiting factor when defining surface roughness, because coarseness at finer detail will not be captured at lower resolution (Baewert et al. 2014). There are numerous other factors, which may alter the results. We would like to further understand how the noise associated with TLS data alters the outcome and whether the interpolation method has an influence.\nThis study focuses on the latter two issues. For this purpose, a braidplain in the forefield of the glacier Gepatschferner in Austria was surveyed using a terrestrial laser scanner. The images were taken from different angles and with different resolutions. Subsequently, the outliers are removed from the point cloud in order to investigate the influence of the noise. Thinning the point cloud is another method used to understand the effects of the point density.\n",

But how far would neutrons and protons propagate and where could they be measured? To calculate the energy losses and the absorption of hadrons in air, we have reviewed the latest literature on cross sections for hadron scattering at air molecules and implemented them into a three dimensional Monte Carlo code. Then we calculate two type of data: 1. the energy dependent absorption length of hadrons and leptons in a given column density of air in the absence of electric fields, providing absorption data for arbitrary orientations and altitudes of air columns, and 2. specific generation, propagation and absorption data for generic leader events in thunderstorms, both directed upwards in the cloud and propagating downwards towards the ground.",

Scientific experts may be asked to develop communications with the goal of improving people’s understanding of weather and climate risks, and informing people's decisions about how to protect against these risks. Unfortunately, scientific experts' communication efforts may fail if they lack information about what people need or want to know to make more informed decisions or what wording people prefer use to describe relevant concepts. This presentation provides general principles for developing effective risk communication materials that aim for widespread dissemination, such as brochures and websites. After a brief review of the social science evidence on how to design effective risk communication materials, examples will focus on communications about extreme weather events and climate change. Specifically, data will be presented from ongoing projects on flood risk perception, public preparedness for heat waves, and public perceptions of climate change. The presentation will end with specific recommendations about how to improve recipients’ understanding about risks and inform decisions. These recommendations should be useful to scientific experts who aim to communicate about extreme weather, climate change, or other risks.",

            "abstract": "Mantle convective simulations are often used to predict present-day dynamic topography on Earth. Most of these models suggest that dynamic topography is dominated by degree 2 and 3 patterns which have peak amplitudes of 1–2 km. In order to test the applicability of these results, it is useful to construct an accurate global observational database. We have collated ~1000 seismic reflection profiles and ~500 wide-angle refraction experiments from the oceanic realm. This dataset can be used to calculate residual depth anomalies with respect to the well-known age-depth cooling relationship by carefully taking sedimentary and crustal loading effects into account. Resulting anomalies have wavelengths of 103–104 km with typical amplitudes of ±1 km. Average uncertainties are ±150 meters. We have combined these oceanic residual depths with onshore estimates from GRACE gravity anomalies to generate a spherical harmonic map of present-day dynamic topography. The resultant power spectrum is significantly less red than most predictive models. In other words, there is significantly less power at degrees 2 and 3 and much greater power at degrees 20 to 30 (i.e. wavelengths of 2000–1300 km). This mismatch implies that predictive models are currently compromised by limited resolution of mantle density structure and weak constraints on viscosity variation. Inclusion of accurate shallow mantle structure, which is the likely source of dynamic topography at degrees 20–30, is particularly important for future convective simulations.",

            "abstract": "Recent investigations showed that the winter climate in the lake district south of the Alps was strongly affected by specific prominent modes of low-frequency atmospheric variability relevant for the Mediterranean area (namely the East Atlantic pattern, EA, and the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern, EMP). In Lake Garda, the winter interannual fluctuations of EA and EMP triggered a long-chain of causally-linked effects on the physical structure of the lake and biological communities. Since 1991, and contrary to the summer months, the long-term increase of the mean winter water temperatures in the mixolimnion (0-50 m, ca. 0.01 °C yr-1) was statistically not-significant, coinciding, as confirmed by longer annual 1971-2014 series, with a period of relatively winter stable temperatures. Superimposed to the long-term trend, the deep hypolimnion showed different periods of warming caused by a downward transport of heat by turbulent diffusion during stratification. These phases were terminated by sudden cooling and overturn during harsh winters associated with negative EA and positive EMP values. The long term saw tooth temperature dynamics had a strong impact on the transport of hypolimnetic nutrients towards the surface, fuelling the development of eutrophic species, namely toxic cyanobacteria during the summer months. Other changes in the trophic webs included modifications in the phenology of the dominant zooplankton cladocerans. In the subalpine lake district, changes were documented not only at the level of species, but also genotypes, with a positive selection of cyanobacterial strains with strong gas-vesicles (i.e. best adapted to higher hydrostatic pressures) in lakes experiencing deep mixing. The study of the effects of climatic fluctuations and long-term changes was based on monthly field data. In this work, the evaluation will be further investigated also using high resolution satellite temperature data recorded using Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Along Track Scanning Radiometer (Advanced ATSR/ATSR-2) sensors.",

            "abstract": "A significant fraction of the magma that is added from the mantle to the subvolcanic plumbing system ultimately erupts at the surface. The initial volatile content of the magmas as well as the interplay between volatile loss and magma ascent plays a significant role in determining the eruption style (effusive versus explosive) as well as the magnitude of the eruption.\nThe October 17, 1974 sub-Plinian eruption of Volcán de Fuego represents a particularly well-characterized system in terms of volatile content and magma chemistry to investigate the relation between initial water content of the magmas and the ascent rate. By modeling volatile element distribution in melt embayments through diffusion and degassing during ascent we can estimate magma ascent from the storage region in the crust to the surface. The novel aspect is the measurement of concentration gradients multiple volatile elements (in particular CO2, H2O, S) at fine-scale (5–10 μm) using the NanoSIMS. The wide range in diffusivity and solubility of these different volatiles provides multiple constraints on ascent timescales over a range of depths. H2O, CO2, and S all decrease toward the embayment outlet bubble documenting the loss of H2O and CO2 compared to an extensive melt inclusion suite from the same day of the eruption.\nThe data is best described by a two-stage model. At high pressure (>145 MPa) decompression is slow (0.05– 0.3 MPa/s) and CO2 is bled off predominantly. At shallow levels decompression accelerates to 0.3–0.5 MPa/s at the point of H2O exsolution, which strongly affects the buoyancy of the ascending magma. The magma ascent rates presented are among the first for explosive basaltic eruptions and demonstrate the potential of the embayment method for quantifying magmatic timescales associated with eruptions of different vigor.\n[1] Lloyd et al.

            "abstract": "Improved climate prediction requires an understanding of the processes controlling the flow of energy within the Earth-atmosphere system. This in turn requires an accurate description of how radiant energy is distributed at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA), within the atmosphere, and at the surface for a range of time and space scales. A central objective of the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) is to produce a long-term climate data record of Earth’s radiation budget. CERES relies on a number of data sources, including broadband radiometers, high-resolution spectral imagers, meteorological, aerosol and ozone assimilation data, and snow/sea-ice maps based on microwave radiometer data. While TOA radiation budget is largely determined directly from accurate broadband radiometer measurements, the surface radiation budget is derived indirectly through radiative transfer model calculations initialized using imager-based retrievals and assimilation data. In order to accurately characterize surface radiation budget variations from interannual to decadal timescales, it is paramount that the input stream be free of artificial jumps associated with instrument and/or algorithm changes. Otherwise, distinguishing real climate system changes from artifacts in the data record will be exceedingly difficult.\nCERES instruments are currently flying on Terra (1999), Aqua (2002) and Suomi-NPP (2011) satellites. Aerosol retrievals for CERES Terra and Aqua data products are inferred from the MODIS imager. The aerosol retrievals are directly averaged over CERES footprints when the CERES level-2 products are created, and ingested into an aerosol assimilation system for generating computed Level-3 surface fluxes. The prime dataset for Terra and Aqua aerosol retrievals are generated from the MODIS Atmosphere team at NASA GSFC. In order to ensure consistency with MODIS, our current plan is to eventually adapt the MODIS algorithm to VIIRS imager radiances in order to minimize algorithm changes between the satellites.\nThis presentation will discuss the importance and challenges of using input datasets that seamlessly transition across multiple platforms flying CERES instruments with special emphasis on aerosols and surface radiation budget.",

            "abstract": "The basal sliding of glaciers is modulated by the presence of basal water and more precisely its pressure. On one hand, where the basal water pressure increases, the ice friction on the bedrock is reduced and the basal sliding velocity increases. On an other hand, an increase of basal sliding will influence the development of the basal hydrology systems. These processes leads to non-steady ice velocities and have a seasonal or even diurnal signature. In this study, a basal hydrology model is coupled with an ice flow model through a water pressure dependent friction law. The basal hydrology model includes an inefficient cavity-type water sheet and a network of efficient discrete channels. Both systems are connected and evolve in time in response to the water inputs. Ice flow is modelled either solving the full-Stokes equations or the shallow shelf approximation. Basal hydrology and ice flow are connected through a Coulomb type friction law which depends on the basal water pressure. The equations of both ice flow and hydrology are implemented in the open source, finite element, ice sheet / ice flow model Elmer/Ice. The coupling of basal hydrology and ice flow is studied for different glacier geometries and external forcing having different amplitude and temporal signatures. The classically used one way coupling, where only the hydrology influence the ice flow, is compared to a two way coupling where both hydrology and ice flow interact in a fully coupled way.",

            "abstract": "We present a literature study on controversies concerning the degradation of lignin and other aromatic litter components in soils. Lignin concentrations control rates of litter decomposition within biomes worldwide, implying that lignin is among the most resistant litter components. Consequently, lignin has been traditionally linked to the concept of soil organic matter (SOM) stability due to recalcitrance. However, studies using molecular-level analytics (e.g., CuO oxidation) suggest significant chemical alterations and losses of lignin components during litter decomposition. Lignin degradation occurs step-wise, including (i) depolymerization and (ii) further transformation of water-soluble depolymerization products. The long-term fate of depolymerization products and of other soluble aromatic litter components in mineral soils is still a mystery. Research on dissolved organic matter (DOM) indicates that they are important precursors of stable SOM attached to mineral surfaces. In laboratory experiments, aromatics were among the most resistant DOM components and prone to bind strongly to minerals. In accord, field data from various sites showed decreases of aromatic DOM during passage of mineral soil, presumably due to organic-mineral interaction. Recent research on composition of solid-phase SOM, however, contradicts DOM research. It finds that mineral-associated SOM is rather dominated by non-aromatic, microbial-derived compounds. Other studies suggest the turnover of lignin in soil to be faster than the turnover of bulk SOM. We assume that the contradictions might be due to difficulties in the analysis of aromatics. We conclude that we currently lack of understanding on long-term fate of major litter constituents and on contribution of aromatics to stable SOM. Careful data re-interpretation of available data, critical assessment of analytical limitations, and combined studies on DOM and solid-phase SOM might be ways to overcome contrasting perspectives.",

            "abstract": "The 17Oexcess of dissolved O2 (17Δ) in the ocean is a unique property which is useful for telling apart O2 produced by marine photosynthesis (bio-O2) from atmospheric O2. Unlike O2 concentration, 17Δ is not affected by respiration and thus behaves conservatively in the deep sea. In general, 17Δ in the oceanic mixed layer is low due to the dominance of air-sea gas exchange. In contrast, in the Arctic mixed-layer 17Δ is higher because sufficient light penetrates through the sea-ice cover and drives photosynthesis, but air-sea gas exchange is retarded by sea ice cover. We have preliminary 17Δ data from depth profiles in the Eurasian and Makarov basins. In both, the fraction of bio-O2 is about 20 % in the surface mixed layer. However, the vertical distribution beneath the mixed layer at the two stations is substantially different. In the Makarov Basin there is a layer of Pacific Water centered at about 100 m, which enters the Arctic Ocean through Bering Strait and is modified as it flows across the wide Chukchi and Siberian shelves. It has a strong maximum in 17Δ, equivalent to ~30% bio-O2. 17Δ then decreases through the underlying halocline to a minimum between 500 and 700 m, which lies within the Barents Sea Branch of Atlantic Water (BSBW) indicating ~15% bio-O2. At the Eurasian Basin station, 17Δ decreases from the mixed layer through the halocline reaching a minimum at the temperature maximum of Atlantic Water. This temperature maximum marks the core of the Fram Strait Branch of Atlantic Water (FSBW). 17Δ then increases to a maximum indicating ~20% bio-O2 between 500 and 700 m. The BSBW is produced as Atlantic Water flows through the shallow Barents Sea becoming denser than FSBW and enters the Eurasian Basin through the Santa Anna Trough beneath the FSBW. Our 17Δ measurements suggest that waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that transit across the wide Arctic continental shelves acquire a high 17Δ signal indicative of photosynthesis in ice covered water.",

This global cooling is puzzling because it is opposite to the expected and simulated global warming trend due to the retreating ice sheets and rising atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs).

            "abstract": "Close to becoming part of a UNESCO world heritage site, the Chaine des Puys monogenetic alignment has > 80 effusive centers. Lava flows extending east enter valleys cut into the Limagne fault scarp. Flow emplacement dynamics depend on the slope of the terrain. We focus here on two cases: (i) the Grave Noire (60 ka) lavas – emplaced on steep slopes before transiting abruptly to shallow slopes; (ii) the Tiretaine (44 ka) lava – emplaced on gentle slopes, before entering a steeply sloping valley. Both flow fields underlie the city of Clermont Ferrand, and so have been used to test a GIS to assess impact due to lava inundation of an urban area close to an active monogenetic system.\nThe fountain-fed flows of Grave Noire poured down the Limagne fault scarp at velocities of 8 m/s. On encountering shallower slopes at 1 km, the lava stalled to form a perched pond contained by a barrier of its own breccia and ramped-up sediment. Intrusions through the barrier fed flow that advanced a further 4 km at velocities of a few tens of m/day. Distally, Tiretaine lavas built an inflated flow field with its front at the head of the Tiretaine valley. Failure of this front fed lava that entered the valley at effusion rates of several hundred m3/s. Lava descended as far as the current town of Royat, where it encountered, and ponded behind, a barrier built by Grave Noire lavas. If occurring today, these flows would impact more than 8422 addresses, 0.065 km² industrial land, 177 km of roads and 110 ha of agricultural land.\nOutcrop exposure of lavas is outstanding throughout the Chaine des Puys, allowing 3D viewing of such effusive systems. At Grave Noire and Tiretaine, we have analogs for perched ponds, channels, and satellite shields experiencing flank collapse to feed flow at high local effusion rates. The juxtaposition of central France’s capital, and the lavas themselves, vividly demonstrate effusive hazards faced by urban areas located in active monogenetic systems.",

One of these models is fostered through the NSF's Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) program, which pairs a graduate fellow with a science teacher at a local school for an entire school year. In our project, a PhD Earth Sciences student was paired with a local middle school science teacher with the goal of installing a weather station, and incorporating the station data into the 8th grade science curriculum. Here we discuss how we were able to use a school weather station to introduce weather and climate material, engage and involve students in the creative process of science, and motivate students through inquiry-based lessons. In using a weather station as the starting point for material, we were able to make science tangible for students and provide an opportunity for each student to experience the entire process of scientific inquiry. This hands-on approach resulted in a more thorough understanding the system beyond a knowledge of the components, and was particularly effective in challenging prior weather and climate misconceptions. We were also able to expand the reach of the lessons by connecting with other weather stations in our region and even globally, enabling the students to become members of a larger system.",

            "abstract": "Borehole electrokinetic wavefields have been theoretically simulated and experimentally recorded. However, it is still challenging to explain some of the signals in the full seismoeletric waveform. Similarly, while earthquake coseismic electric and magnetic signals were recorded and theoretically modeled, there are some basic questions to be answered regarding the formulation of the earthquake electrokinetic field.\nFirst, an electromagnetic signal appears at the same time in all recorded full waveforms when an acoustic wave is incident on the borehole wall or an interface between two porous media. Is it a traveling electromagnetic wave or a field? This is explained by a comparison between the waveforms obtained by solving the full Pride equations and those by a quasi-static approximation to the seismic-to-electric conversion.\nSecond, a magnetic signal accompanies the borehole P-wave. Does that contradicts to Pride’s prediction that no magnetic signal travels with a P-wave? We will show that the borehole P-wave consists of plane fast-P, slow-P and shear waves. It is the plane S-wave that brings about the magnetic field.\nThirdly, it was proposed that there were no seismoelectric signal accompanying the collar wave during seismoelectric logging while drilling, because the electrokinetic conversion occurs only in the porous formation. Why there is an electric signal accompanies the acoustic collar wave? A detailed study of the acoustic field in the formation reveals that there is a wave propagates with the collar wave speed in the formation. This wave is present in the calculated full waveforms, either by the discrete wavenumber method or by the finite-difference-time-domain algorithm. That explains the existence of a noise signal with collar-wave speed in the full waveform of the electric field recorded during seismoelectric logging while drilling.\nFinally, an earthquake is usually modeled by a double couple in an elastic medium, and the displacement field is described by a convolution of the derivative of the Geen function with the moment tensor. Is there an equivalent moment tensor for a dislocation in a porous medium? Is the convolution expression valid for the seismoelectric field in a porous medium? We present some of our results.",

            "abstract": "We report model results for quantifying grain packing resistance to particle motion. Packing resistance was modeled as the difference between the total resistance acting on individual grains (measured with a load cell) and the resistance that occurs when grains interact with the geometry of their resting pocket (measured with a tilt board). Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to develop distributions of packing resistance from observed distributions of total and pocket angle resistance because paired measurements were not available. Results show that packing was the dominant form of resistance to grain motion, exceeding pocket angle resistance by up to 88%. Expressed as coefficients of friction, packing resistance was close to 18 times higher for smaller grains because such particles tend to be more embedded, increasing the extent of packing by surrounding grains. We developed a predictive equation from these data, expressing packing resistance as a function of grain size, embeddedness, and the standard deviation of grain sizes on the bed surface (sorting), which collectively control the frictional surface area of the grain. I\nncluding observed values of packing resistance in calculations of critical bed shear stress increased thresholds of grain motion by 8 to 46% (21% on average) over that calculated with pocket angle resistance. This has significant implications for bed load transport predictions, which are typically nonlinear functions of the difference between applied and critical shear stresses; as such, small differences in critical shear stress can cause large prediction errors. Given the importance of packing resistance, future studies are warranted to better understand the physical and biological controls on packing, as well as the mechanics of packing resistance.",

            "abstract": "The engineering roots of hydrology served society well in solving problems of flood control, prediction under limited observations, river basin management, water availability and distribution, and water allocation at the intersection of the natural and built environment. Scientific hydrology over the past two decades has advanced the physical understanding of hydrologic and related processes and their complex interactions and has generalized ideas and frameworks of estimation and prediction. Equipped with the engineering and scientific aspects of a field, hydrologist are in the best possible position to address new challenges related to sustainability of water quantity and quality under increasing stresses of climate and human perturbations while protecting ecosystem services and economic development. The first line of defense in studying a complex system for sustainability (ability to maintain the system integrity and functionality under perturbations) is to identify its vulnerable spots (places, times, processes that are more susceptible to change). A reductionist approach to such an endeavor is limited. Studying the system in parts with the most sophisticated distributed highly parameterized physically-based models and under non-stationarity might not provide insight into the emergent behavior at larger scales and longer times, exactly what is needed for identifying vulnerabilities that would inform policy and management for a sustainable future. We will present some ideas on a revised systems-approach to vulnerability science in hydro-geomorphologic systems under change via two examples. One example is a dynamic connectivity river network approach for predicting hotspots of geomorphic change in a Midwestern US river basin which is undergoing land-use and hydrologic changes. The other example relates to a new vulnerability assessment framework for delta systems undergoing change where network connectivity and delivery of fluxes dictates local places and actions that would most drastically affect the system as a whole.",

We\nuse here the EOT11a model of Savcenko & Bosch (2012), which is extended for\nsome additional minor tides (e.g. M1, J1, T2). Furthermore, the number of tidal\nconstituents in the model is increased from 71 (IERS conventional model) to 120,\nby which additional minor tides are considered for the admittance approach.\nAs empirical tidal models do not provide ocean tidal currents, which are required\nfor the computation of oceanic relative angular momentum, we implement\nan approach first published by Ray (2001) to estimate ocean tidal current velocities\nfor all tides considered in the extended EOT11a model. The approach itself is\ntested by application to tidal heights from hydrodynamic ocean tide models, which\nalso provide tidal current velocities. Based on the tidal heights and the associated\ncurrent velocities the oceanic tidal angular momentum (OTAM) is calculated.\nFor the computation of the related short period variation of Earth rotation, we\nhave re-examined the Euler-Liouville equation for an elastic Earth model with a\nliquid core. The focus here is on the consistent calculation of the elastic Love numbers\nand associated Earth model parameters, which are considered in the Euler-\nLiouville equation for diurnal and sub-diurnal periods in the frequency domain.\nWe combine the observed tidal heights, estimated tidal current velocities and\ncalculated response of an elastic Earth to our improved model of short period ocean\ntidal variation of Earth rotation. The preliminary version is used in the analysis of\nVLBI data (e.g. CONT11), which enable us to evaluate independently the preliminary\nmodel and to improve it further in a next step.",

Stocks of SOC can be affected by a variety of natural and human-induced drivers, including climate and land management practices which collectively could affect intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to SOC, for example, soil texture, soil microclimate, and biomass accumulation rates . In intensely managed agricultural landscapes (IMLs), i.e., regions of significant land use change where significant degradation of SOC has been reported due to soil erosion, enhancing the sequestration or storage potential of SOC is of paramount importance to the ecosystem well-being of these landscapes.\nA literature review reveals that aspects of the SOC research have received considerable attention in the bioegeochemical, ecological, and agricultural disciplines because available SOC stocks within a soil column affect the evolution of key soil biogeochemical constituents. However, at the landscape scale the quantitative assessment of the SOC storage potential suffers in parts from lack of understanding of the collective effects that tillage and water-driven erosion have on the transport and burial of the eroded SOC. In this study an integrative process-based modeling framework that couples an established biogeochemical soil column model with a physically-based, landscape oriented watershed model capable of replicating the collective erosion effects on the mobilization and redistribution of SOC is developed. All simulations are conducted in an agricultural watershed in the U.S. Midwest Clear Creek, IA which has experienced intense agriculture since the beginning of the century to also assess the legacy effects that land use change and SOC initialization periods have on current SOC stock estimations.",

            "abstract": "Data provenance, also called lineage, records the derivation history of a data product. The history could include the algorithms used, the process steps taken, the computing environment run, data sources input to the processes, the organization/person responsible for the product, etc. Provenance provides important information to data users for them to determine the usability and reliability of the product. In the science domain, the data provenance is especially important since scientists need to use the information to determine the scientific validity of a data product and to decide if such a product can be used as the basis for further scientific analysis.\nProvenance is a kind of metadata. In Earth science domain, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee 211 (ISO TC 211) have set geospatial metadata standards for geospatial data, including ISO 19115:2003-Metadata, ISO 19115-2:2009-Metadata-Part 2: Extensions for imagery and gridded data, and ISO 19115-1:2014 - Metadata -- Part 1: Fundamentals. ISO 19115 and ISO 19115-1 define the fundamental metadata for documenting geospatial data products, and ISO 19115-2 provides additional metadata classes for imagery and gridded data. ISO 19115-1:2014 is the revised version of ISO 19115:2003.\nISO 19115 and ISO 19115-1 define fundamental lineage information classes and subclasses. They miss some key information classes needed for documenting the provenance in the Web service environment, such as the running environment, the algorithms, and software executables. However, ISO 19115-2 extends the lineage model in ISO 19115 and provides additional metadata classes needed for documenting provenance information. The combination of lineage models in ISO 19115 and ISO 19115-2 provides a comprehensive provenance information model needed for the web service environment. Currently the ISO Provence standard is not compatible with W3C Prov standard. The revision of ISO 19115-2 will be started in November 2014. The revision process will provide the opportunity for harmonizing the ISO provenance model with the W3C Prov standard and for the Earth science community to provide inputs for improving the ISO provenance model.",

            "abstract": "Monitoring the Earth for underground nuclear explosions requires a detailed understanding of the explosion source. In this context, “source” refers to the source of seismic waves, and it is generated by the complex nonlinear near-source motion that accompanies the nuclear explosion. In particular, nuclear monitoring requires understanding the transition from the hydrodynamic to elastic regimes, and propagation of waveforms from the source to stations at distances of hundreds to thousands of kilometers. In the transition region, shear strength is critically important, as are changes in shear strength as the shock wave propagates.\nNumerical modeling using 1D spherically symmetric, 2D axisymmetric and full 3D calculations provides important insights into the seismic source and the waveforms it generates. Important considerations for numerical modeling include emplacement conditions (tamped or in a cavity), source type (chemical or nuclear), material models for strength and strength reduction, and geologic conditions including topography and tectonic stresses in the source region. In addition to calculating the near source ground motion, we propagate the near source solution to regional and teleseismic distances where the observations of seismic signals from nuclear explosions are made.\nThe objectives of nuclear monitoring are detection of seismic events (earthquakes, quarry blasts and other sources in addition to nuclear explosions), accurate location of these events, discrimination of nuclear explosions from other types of sources, and estimation of nuclear explosion yield. Numerical modeling is particularly important for discrimination and yield estimation. Numerical modeling is used to understand unexpected anomalies that occur, such as the large surface waves generated by the three North Korean nuclear tests, which may have been caused by a difference in tectonic stress state between North Korea and other test sites. Another important issue that can be addressed by numerical modeling is generation of shear waves by explosions. While the idealized point explosion in an infinite medium is spherically symmetric, the free surface and variation of overburden pressure with depth makes the explosion source more conical that spherical and this directly generates shear waves (see Figure).",

We discuss here how the consideration of the water table as a dynamic lower boundary for the vadose zone and the inclusion of lateral flow driven by gravitation, which redistributes groundwater horizontally, create a persistent underlying pattern on soil moisture conditions linked to topography, with wetter valleys and drier hilltops. The long scales of evolution of groundwater induce soil moisture memory, and groundwater-surface water exchanges are fundamental for wetland, river and floodplain dynamics. One step further, this reshaping of the land-surface hydrology by groundwater has an important impact on climate and ecosystems, via evapotranspiration and sensible heat fluxes. We will show some examples of the key role of groundwater on the terrestrial water and energy cycles using a fully coupled groundwater-soil-vegetation-atmosphere model.",

            "abstract": "Variations in surface conditions can significantly influence the exchange of heat and moisture between the land and atmosphere. As a result, measurements of surface fluxes using disparate methods not only may differ, they may fail to represent the surrounding landscape due to localized differences in surface conditions. To illustrate this, data collected over adjacent cotton fields during the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote Sensing Experiment (BEAREX08) will be used. The evapotranspiration (ET) within each field was determined via lysimetry (LY), mass balance using neutron probe (NP) data, and a pair of eddy covariance (EC) systems. A comparison of the cumulative ET from each field showed that ET from LY was 20% to 25% greater than that derived from NP and 10% to 15% greater than those from EC. Additionally, the cumulative flux for the two fields collected using the same approach differed by 5% to 10%. These discrepancies can be explained, in large part, by the variations in vegetation density within the two fields. Not only were there substantial variations in the leaf area index (LAI) within the source areas of the different measurement systems – for example, the LAI within LY was, on average, 0.4 m2 m-2 greater than the LAI within the source area of NP – there were also significant differences in the LAI between the fields as a whole. The cumulative ET output by the remote sensing-based Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model was also compared to the cumulative ET from each of the three measurement approaches. Depending on which measurement technique is used, the model either underestimated the moisture flux by approximately 5%, in the case of LY, or overestimated the flux by nearly 20%, in the case of NP. Comparison of the model output with EC data also indicated that the model overestimated ET, in this case, by approximately 10%. Clearly, the choice of which dataset is used to validate the model significantly effects the conclusions drawn regarding the model’s accuracy and utility in estimating ET. The results of this study also underscores the limitations of each of these measurement techniques and the need to understand those limitations when using observational datasets to make general conclusions about field scale ET and validating model output.",

            "abstract": "Upwelling is an important physical process affecting biogeochemical cycling within the global ocean. Direct measurements are difficult because of the relatively small velocities involved, and must therefore be inferred by indirect methods such as those provided by tracer observations. Measurements of the cosmogenic radioisotope 7Be (half-life = 53.3 d) were used to derive upwelling rates and upper thermocline vertical diffusivities during the 2013 US GEOTRACES Eastern Tropical Pacific Zonal Transect. In the eastern, upwelling zone of this transect, the 7Be activity in the mixed layer varied between low values of 63 dpm/m3 in areas with the coldest sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to values of 190 dpm/m3 associated with warm SSTs. The 7Be inventory in the coldest water was only 5,150 dpm/m2 while that in the warmer water was 19,000 dpm/m2. The decrease in mixed layer 7Be with decrease in temperature occurs as 7Be ‘‘dead’’, cold water is upwelled from below. The deficit of the 7Be inventory relative to the non-upwelling stations provides a measure of the upwelling rate. For the eastern-most station with the lowest SST (17.6 deg C) an upwelling rate of 2.56 m/d was derived. Towards the west, as SST increased, derived upwelling rates decreased. At SST of 20.9 deg C, upwelling was zero. With knowledge of upwelling rates, 7Be and temperature profiles were used to constrain vertical diffusivity within the upper thermocline. Diffusivities derived from 7Be profiles were approximately twice that derived from temperature, likely reflecting the difference in vertical resolution of these measurements. Diffusivities derived from temperature were on the order of 1-4 x 10-4 m2/s. These parameters will be applied to profiles of nutrients and trace elements to derive fluxes of these species into the mixed layer.",

            "abstract": "Seismology provides powerful methods for imaging the interior of the Earth, not only through differences in seismic velocities, but also through attenuation contrasts. As seismic waves travel through the Earth they are attenuated in accordance with the viscoelastic properties of the material through which they pass. With proper constraints, we will someday be able to use seismic attenuation data as a prospecting tool to determine the grain size, temperature, pressure, melt content, and water content of the material along the ray path. Furthermore, it should be possible to determine active deformation structure, such as crystallographic preferred orientations that form in response to far-field natural tectonic loading. Laboratory studies are striving to provide these needed constraints. Using analogues to mantle rock, we isolate and scrutinize the physics of how microstructural elements affect macroscopic properties of attenuation and steady-state viscosity. An organic analogue, borneol, was used to measure the effects of grain size, temperature, and melt content over a broad frequency range. In these experiments, grain boundary processes were found to play a major role. Polycrystalline ice, which can be considered a rock analogue, has been used to explore the effect of accumulated strain on attenuation, particularly in material that is actively deforming via dislocation creep. Here, defect concentration and substructure are important. I will discuss the use of cyclic loading experiments on borneol and on polycrystalline ice to probe material response from seismic to tidal frequencies, from 10 Hz to 10-4 Hz respectively. These experiments, then, inform our knowledge of viscoelastic behavior of geologic materials at not only seismic frequencies, but also the tidal forcing frequencies experienced by tidewater glaciers and icy satellites.",

            "abstract": "Measurements and modeling have gone hand-in-hand since hydrology began as a science. In most early work, the same person took the measurements and developed the model, and iterated between them until all information collectively made sense. Over time, research has become more specialized, and now many people use a model developed by someone else, compare model simulations to data collected by another someone else, pronounce success and proceed with research if the two match, and face a black hole of uncertainty if they don’t match. In many cases, the model is calibrated to achieve a match. In perhaps many more cases, the work is shelved; the apparent failure swept under the rug.\nWe present two case studies of apparent modeling failure, wherein all efforts at model calibration failed, where traditional data quality-control measures detected no problems, and where only extreme stubbornness and repetitive iteration between modeling and observations led to discovery of the root of the problem. These two cases are by no means a complete sampling of data disasters that have occurred, or that may occur in the future, and are probably more likely to be outliers that will [hopefully] never occur again. The point is to exemplify that such odd cases do occur, and that while the specific-oddity varies widely, odd cases are likely much more common than we are aware of. To quote from Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes: “when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”\nThe first case presents an issue with the water balance in the snow-fed Tuolumne River, Sierra Nevada, California, combined with modeling using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM, Wigmosta et al. 1994), and the second case presents an issue with the energy balance at Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, combined with modeling using the Structure for Understanding Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA, Clark et al., submitted). The figure presents the fundamental problems: In the Tuolumne (case 1), streamflow in one year was off by a factor of two; at Snoqualmie (case 2), nighttime surface temperatures were biased by about 10°C. The reasons for and solutions to these problems will be presented, and they’re not what you might guess first.",

            "abstract": "In the last years, multiphysics (hybrid) modeling has attracted increasing attention as a tool to bridge the gap between pore-scale processes and a continuum description at the meter-scale (laboratory scale). This approach is particularly appealing for complex nonlinear processes, such as multiphase flow, reactive transport, density-driven instabilities, and geomechanical coupling.\nWe present a general framework that can be applied to all these classes of problems. The method is based on ideas from the Multiscale Finite-Volume method (MsFV), which has been originally developed for Darcy-scale application. Recently, we have reformulated MsFV starting with a local-global splitting, which allows us to retain the original degree of coupling for the local problems and to use spatiotemporal adaptive strategies. The new framework is based on the simple idea that different characteristic temporal scales are inherited from different spatial scales, and the global and the local problems are solved with different temporal resolutions.\nThe global (coarse-scale) problem is constructed based on a numerical volume-averaging paradigm and a continuum (Darcy-scale) description is obtained by introducing additional simplifications (e.g., by assuming that pressure is the only independent variable at the coarse scale, we recover an extended Darcy’s law).\nWe demonstrate that it is possible to adaptively and dynamically couple the Darcy-scale and the pore-scale descriptions of multiphase flow in a single conceptual and computational framework. Pore-scale problems are solved only in the active front region where fluid distribution changes with time. In the rest of the domain, only a coarse description is employed. This framework can be applied to other important problems such as reactive transport and crack propagation. As it is based on a numerical upscaling paradigm, our method can be used to explore the limits of validity of macroscopic models and to illuminate the meaning of macroscopic parameters.",

It is well-known that the solution to these equations exhibit disparate spatial and temporal scales. These mathematical scales occur due to relative dominance of either advec- tion, diffusion, or reaction processes. Hence, in a careful simulation, one has to choose appropriate time-integrators, time-steps, and numerical formulations for spatial discretization. Multi-time-step coupling methods allow specific choice of integration methods (either temporal or spatial) in dif- ferent regions of the spatial domain. In recent years, most of the attempts to design monolithic multi-time-step frameworks favored second-order transient systems in structural dynamics. In this presentation, we will introduce monolithic multi-time-step computational frameworks for ADR equations. These methods are based on the theory of differential/algebraic equations. We shall also provide an overview of results from stability analysis, study of drift from compatibility con- straints, and analysis of influence of perturbations. Several benchmark problems will be utilized to demonstrate the theoretical findings and features of the proposed frameworks. Finally, application of the proposed methods to fast bimolecular reactive systems will be shown. ",

            "abstract": "North-facing slopes in semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere are commonly steeper than south-facing slopes, whereas the converse is observed in the southern hemisphere. In the absence of a structural cause, the most common explanations for topographic asymmetry ultimately invoke aspect-related microclimate. Landscapes with asymmetric topography are therefore potential natural laboratories for investigating the sensitivity of surface processes to climate. However, the specific mechanisms driving asymmetry are not well understood, and studies using asymmetric topography to investigate landscape climate sensitivity may have to consider multiple origins of the asymmetry. Two leading hypotheses have emerged. One states that small differences in microclimate cause differences in the efficiency of erosional processes on slopes with different aspect. The more efficiently eroding slope erodes faster until the resulting slope asymmetry compensates for the difference in erosional efficiency. According to the other hypothesis, the difference in erosional efficiency is not sufficient to create the observed topographic asymmetry. Instead, sediment aggradation at the foot of the more quickly eroding slope forces lateral channel migration and undercutting of the opposing slope. These two explanations for topographic asymmetry predict different trajectories of long-term landscape evolution – sustained migration of asymmetric valleys would drive stream capture and drainage reorganization, whereas the mechanism without lateral channel migration would not – but there is no existing test capable of distinguishing between them. We develop such a test using a landscape evolution model that simulates different asymmetry-forming mechanisms, including asymmetric runoff production, channel incision threshold, soil creep, and lateral channel migration. For the case of topographic asymmetry produced by lateral channel migration, the model predicts that north-facing hilltops should be more concave-down than south-facing hilltops. We apply this criterion to a field site with strongly asymmetric slopes and evaluate the extent to which lateral channel migration has contributed to the development of the asymmetry.",

            "abstract": "The provision and regulation of water flows in catchments is probably the most important ecosystem functioning of tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF), however its hydrological dynamics and impacts associated with forest conversion remain very poorly understood. The present study aimed to compare the annual, seasonal and event-scale streamflow patterns and runoff generation processes of three neighbouring headwater catchments in eastern Mexico with similar pedological and geological characteristics, but different land cover: old-growth TMCF, 20 yr-old naturally regenerating TMCF and a heavily grazed pasture. We used a 2 yr record of rainfall and stream flow data in combination with isotope and chemical tracer data collected for a series of storms during a 6-week period of increasing antecedent wetness (wetting-up cycle). Our results showed that annual and seasonal streamflow patterns in the mature and secondary forest were similar. Conversely, the pasture showed higher annual streamflow (10%), however 50% on average lower baseflow at the end of the dry season, associated probably to more gentle slopes in combination with lower soil infiltration capacity, and thus reduced recharge of subsurface water storages. During the wetting-up cycle, storm runoff ratios increased at all three catchments (from 11 to 54% for the mature forest, 7 to 52% for the secondary forest and 3 to 59% for the pasture). With the increasing antecedent wetness, the analysis showed progressive increases of pre-event water contributions to total stormflow (from 35 to 99% in the mature forest, 26 to 92% in the secondary forest and 64 to 97% in the pasture). At all sites, rainfall-runoff responses were dominated by subsurface flow processes. However, for the largest and most intense storm sampled (typically occurring once every 2 yr), the event water contribution in the pasture (34%) was much higher than in the forests (5% on average), indicating that rainfall infiltration capacity of the pasture was exceeded. This suggests that the conversion of cloud forest to pasture can promote major increases in overland flow in response to extreme rainfall events, despite the high permeability of the volcanic soils. Our results also showed that 20 yr of natural regeneration may be enough to largely restore the original hydrological conditions of this TMCF.",

As researchers and educators it is good for us to regularly remember that our research and outreach efforts are critical to people around the world, many of whom are desperate for solutions to water quality and supply problems and their impacts on food supply, land management, and ecosystem protection. In this presentation, recommendations for successful applied research on agricultural impacts on water resources will be provided. The benefits of building multidisciplinary teams will be illustrated with examples related to the development and world-wide application of the ALMANAC, SWAT, and EPIC/APEX models. The value of non-traditional partnerships will be shown by the Soil Health Partnership, a coalition of agricultural producers, chemical and seed companies, and environmental advocacy groups. The results of empowering decision-makers with useful data will be illustrated with examples related to bacteria source and transport data and the MANAGE database, which contains runoff nitrogen and phosphorus data for cultivated, pasture, and forest land uses. The benefits of focusing on sustainable solutions will be shown through examples of soil testing, fertilizers application, on-farm profit analysis, and soil health assessment. And the value of welcoming criticism will be illustrated by the development of a framework to estimate and publish uncertainty in measured discharge and water quality data.\nThe good news for researchers is that the agricultural industry is faced with profitability concerns and the need to wisely utilize soil and water resources, and simultaneously state and federal agencies crave sound-science to improve decision making, policy, and regulation. Thus, the audience for and beneficiaries of agricultural research are ready and hungry for applied research results.",

The dataset, which spans a 40-years period (1973-2012; Kuwait airport), was used to examine climate variability in the N AG, and the relation to Shamal events (strong NW winds that commonly create large dust storms) and teleconnection patterns (North Atlantic Oscillation, El Nino Southern Oscillation, and Indian Ocean Dipole). Results of the analysis indicate that during the 40-year period the climate in the region experienced a general trend of increase in temperature (0.8 ^oC), decrease\nin barometric pressure (1 mb), reduction in humidity (6%), and decrease in visibility (9%). Signi cant correlations were found between the three teleconnection patterns and the meteorological conditions suggesting that seasonal variability in air temperature, barometric pressure, and precipitation are closely related to the teleconnection patterns. Analysis of the 40-year period suggests that on average Shamal events occur at a rate of 10 events per year with 85% of the events occuring during the summer and winter. These events resulted in abrupt changes in meteorological conditions: an increase in wind speed of 2.7 m/s, an increase in temperature during summer of 0.8 ^oC, and a decrease of -1.5 ^oC during winter, a decrease in barometric pressure during summer of -0.6 mb and a increase of 7.8 mb during winter, a decrease in visibility of -1.7 km, and reduction in humidity of -4.3 %.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of conditions of an impending disease outbreak remains a challenge but is achievable if the associated and appropriate large scale hydroclimatic process can be estimated in advance. Outbreaks of diarrheal diseases such as cholera, are related to episodic seasonal variability in river discharge in the regions where water and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate and insufficient. However, forecasting river discharge, few months in advance, remains elusive where cholera outbreaks are frequent, probably due to non-availability of geophysical data as well as transboundary water stresses. Here, we show that satellite derived water storage from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Forecasting (GRACE) sensors can provide reliable estimates on river discharge atleast two months in advance over regional scales. Bayesian regression models predicted flooding and drought conditions, a prerequisite for cholera outbreaks, in Bengal Delta with an overall accuracy of 70% for upto 60 days in advance without using any other ancillary ground based data. Forecasting of river discharge will have significant impacts on planning and designing intervention strategies for potential cholera outbreaks in the coastal regions where the disease remain endemic and often fatal.",

            "abstract": "Radar sounding and imaging of fast-flowing glaciers and ice-sheet margins are major challenges in radioglaciology. The extremely rough surfaces and lossy ice near the bed of these areas results in large attenuation of the signals propagating through this ice, making airborne radar sounding of these regions very challenging. High-sensitivity radars with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing and cross-track arrays are required to reduce the scattered signals caused by surface clutter to obtain discernable bed echoes. We developed such radars with cross-track arrays and have operated them on both medium- and long-range aircraft. Over the last several years, we have collected data over outlet glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, and we recently reprocessed data over some of the key glaciers with SAR and array processing algorithms to further reduce surface clutter. We also enhanced the resulting echograms with image processing techniques to bring out weak bed echoes, enabling the generation of both bed topographies and ice thickness estimates for the most challenging parts of these outlet glaciers. In this presentation, we will discuss relevant issues; show sample results of SAR-, array-, and image-processing algorithms; present bed topographies; and discuss what must be done to fully sound and image outlet glaciers and ice-sheet margins.",

            "abstract": "Undisturbed riparian zones, including river floodplains and field buffer strips, can significantly reduce phosphorus (P) export associated with agricultural production. However, riparian zones are frequently disturbed, including through conversion to agricultural land. Restoring disturbed riparian zones is promoted widely within agri-environment schemes. However, restoration presents significant challenges, two of which are considered in this paper: understanding the impacts of restoration on legacy P within riparian zone soils; and maximising the efficacy of riparian zones for removal of all P fractions, including the more immediately bioavailable soluble P fractions. Firstly, we examine changes in porewater soluble P concentration following re-wetting of a river floodplain in Norfolk, UK, using laboratory mesocosms and in-situ field monitoring. Substantial release of P from sediment to porewater was observed following re-wetting (porewater soluble P concentration exceeded 6.5 mg P L-1), probably associated with reductive-dissolution of iron-bound P within floodplain sediments. Export of soluble P from porewater into adjacent receiving waters was observed following both natural hydrological events and management of the hydrological regime within the floodplain. Secondly, we examine how retention of soluble P with grass buffer strips can be enhanced through application of reactive industrial by-products, focussing on ochre and aluminium-based water treatment residuals. Application of these by-products to buffer strips increased removal of soluble P from surface runoff by over 50% compared to non-amended buffer strips. The long-term effectiveness of reactive amendments is also considered, using repeated runoff events under field conditions. Taken together, the research offers new insights into riparian zone P biogeochemistry within agricultural landscapes.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a prototype system for estimating the economic costs of landslides due to winter storms in California. This system uses some of the basic concepts and estimates of the value of structures from the HAZUS program developed for FEMA. Using the only relatively complete landslide loss data set that we could obtain, data gathered by the City of Los Angeles in 1978, we have developed relations between landslide susceptibility and loss ratio for private property (represented as the value of wood frame structures from HAZUS). The landslide loss ratios estimated from the Los Angeles data are calibrated using more generalized data from the 1982 storms in the San Francisco Bay area to develop relationships that can be used to estimate loss for any value of 2-day or 30-day rainfall averaged over a county. The current estimates for major storms are long projections from very small data sets, subject to very large uncertainties, so provide a very rough estimate of the landslide damage to structures and infrastructure on hill slopes. More importantly, the system can be extended and improved with additional data and used to project landslide losses in future major winter storms. The key features of this system—the landslide susceptibility map, the relationship between susceptibility and loss ratio, and the calibration of estimates against losses in past storms—can all be improved with additional data. Most importantly, this study highlights the importance of comprehensive studies of landslide damage. Detailed surveys of landslide damage following future storms that include locations and amounts of damage for all landslides within an area are critical for building a well-calibrated system to project future landslide losses. Without an investment in post-storm landslide damage surveys, it will not be possible to improve estimates of the magnitude or distribution of landslide damage, which can range up to billions of dollars.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the sensitivity of hydrological processes to climate change in alpine areas with snow dominated regimes is of paramount importance as alpine basins show both high runoff efficiency associated with the melt of the seasonal snowpack and great sensitivity of snow processes to temperature change. In this study, meteorological data measured in a selection of alpine headwaters basins including Reynolds Mountain East, Idaho, USA, Wolf Creek, Yukon in Canada, and Zugspitze Mountain, Germany with climates ranging from arctic to continental temperate were used to study the snow and streamflow sensitivity to climate change. All research sites have detailed multi-decadal meteorological and snow measurements. The Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM) was used to create a model representing a typical alpine headwater basin discretized into hydrological response units with physically based representations of snow redistribution by wind, complex terrain snowmelt energetics and runoff processes in alpine tundra. The sensitivity of snow hydrology to climate change was investigated by changing air temperature and precipitation using weather generating methods based on the change factors obtained from different climate model projections for future and current periods. The basin mean and spatial variability of peak snow water equivalent, sublimation loss, duration of snow season, snowmelt rates, streamflow peak, and basin discharge were assessed under varying climate scenarios and the most sensitive hydrological mechanisms to the changes in the different alpine climates were detected. The results show that snow hydrology in colder alpine climates is more resilient to warming than that in warmer climates, but that compensatory factors to warming such as reduced blowing snow sublimation loss and reduced melt rate should also be assessed when considering climate change impacts on alpine hydrology.",

            "abstract": "Change in water availability is of great concern in the coastal southwest United States (CSWUS). Reconstructing the history of water pre–1800 AD requires the use of proxy data. Lakes provide long-lived, high-resolution terrestrial archives of past hydrologic change, and their sediments contain a variety of proxies. This study presents geochemical, sedimentological, and biological data from Zaca Lake, CA (Santa Barbara County) used to reconstruct a 3000 year history of winter season moisture source (dDwax) and catchment run-off (125–2000 mm sand) at decadal resolution. Vegetative response to hydrologic change is also investigated using pollen. Here we show that winter season moisture source and run-off are highly variable over the past 3000 years; superimposed are regime shifts between wetter or drier conditions that persist on average over multiple centuries. Moisture source and run-off do not consistently covary indicating multiple atmospheric circulation modes where wetter/drier conditions prevail. Grain-size analysis reveals two intervals of multi-century drought with less run-off that pre-date the “epic droughts” as identified by Cook et al. (2004). A well-defined wet period with more run-off is identified during the Little Ice Age. Notably, the grain size data show strong coherence with western North American percent drought area indices for the past 1000 years. As a result, our data extend the history of drought and pluvials back to 3000 calendar years BP in the CSWUS. Comparison to tropical Pacific proxies confirms the long-term relationship between El Niño and enhanced run-off in the CSWUS. Our results demonstrate the long-term importance of the tropical Pacific to the CSWUS winter season hydroclimate.",

            "abstract": "Mega-earthquakes such as the Sumatra-Andaman (Mw=9.3, 26 dec. 2004), Maule-Chile (Mw=8.8, 27 feb. 2010) and Japan-Tohoku (Mw=9.1, 11 mar. 2011) earthquakes, are characterized by a large redistribution of mass. They induce instantaneous gravity anomalies at the local, regional and global scales. A first part of the gravimetric signal is concomitant with the rupture propagation and a second part is carried away by seismic waves originating in the rupture zone. We search for this kind of tiny instantaneous signal on gravimetric data presently available.\nSo far, only gravimetric data recorded by the superconductive gravimeter network (GGP) are sensitive enough to expect the detection of this signal. We investigate this kind of signal on the data recorded by the gravimeter at the Kamioka station during the Japan-Tohoku earthquake of 11th of March, 2011. We find that the first part of the signal, though extremely small, has been detected by this high precision gravimeter.\nThe amplitude of the observed signal is in agreement with the theoretical predictions calculated by different methods, (normal mode theory and Okubo's method (1991)). This gravimetric signal might be used for designing a future Early Warning System, but new innovative instruments must be designed to compete with present early warning systems.",

            "abstract": "The margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet are currently responding to present-day climate changes. Determining how the ice sheet margins have responded to past climate changes provides a means to understand how they may respond in the future. Here we present a multi-proxy record used to reconstruct the Holocene fluctuations of the Vindue glacier, an ice sheet outlet glacier in eastern Greenland.\nLake sediment cores from Qiviut lake (informal name), located ~0.75 km from the present-day Vindue glacier margin contain a sharp transition from medium sand/coarse silt to laminated gyttja just prior to 6,340±130 cal yr BP. We interpret this transition to indicate a time when the Vindue glacier retreated sufficiently to cease glacial sedimentation into the lake basin. Above this contact the core contains laminated gyttja with prominent, ~0.5 cm thick, silt layers. 10Be ages of boulders on bedrock located between Qiviut lake and the present-day ice margin date to 6.81 ± 0.67 ka (n = 3), indicating the time of deglaciation. These ages also agree well with the radiocarbon age of the silt-gyttja transition in Qiviut lake cores. 10Be ages on boulders on bedrock located more proximal to the ice margin (~0.5 km) yield ages of 2.67 ± 0.18 ka (n = 2). These ages indicate either the continued recession of the ice margin during the late Holocene or an advance at this time. Boulders on the historical moraines show that ice retreated from the moraine by AD 1620 ± 20 yrs (n = 2).\nThese results are in contrast with some areas of the western margin of the ice sheet where 10Be ages indicate that the ice sheet was behind its Historical limit from the middle Holocene (~6-7 ka) to Historical time. This may indicate that the eastern margin may have responded to late Holocene cooling more sensitively or that the advance associated with the Historical moraines overran any evidence of late Holocene fluctuations along the western margin of the ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial particulate organic carbon (tPOC) delivery to nearshore deltaic regions is an important mechanism of OC storage and burial, and continental margins worldwide account for approximately 90% of the carbon burial in the ocean. Increasing warming in the Arctic is leading to an acceleration of the hydrologic cycle, warming of permafrost, and broad shifts in vegetation. All of these changes are likely to affect the delivery, reactivity, and burial of tPOC in nearshore Arctic regions, making the Arctic an ideal place to study the effects of climate change on tPOC delivery. However, to date, most studies of tPOC delivery from North America to the Arctic Ocean have focused on large Arctic rivers like the Mackenzie and Yukon, and a significant portion of those watersheds lie in sub-Arctic latitudes, meaning that their tPOC delivery is likely not uniquely representative of the high Arctic tundra. Here, we focus on tPOC delivery by the Colville River, the largest North American river with a watershed that does not include sub-Arctic latitudes. Sediment samples from the river delta and nearby Simpson’s Lagoon were taken in August of 2010 and subsequently fractionated by density, in order to study the delivery of both discrete and sediment-sorbed tPOC. Samples were analyzed for stable carbon isotopes, bulk radiocarbon, terrestrial biomarkers (including lignin-phenols, and other CuO reaction products), and aquatic biomarkers (algal pigments), and additionally a subset of the samples were analyzed by ramped pyrolysis-14C. Results show that tPOC delivery near the river mouth is sourced from coastal plain tundra, with additional delivery of tPOC from peat released into the lagoon from the seaward limit of the tundra by coastal erosion. Ramped pyrolysis-14C analysis also shows a clear differentiation between tPOC delivered by the river and tPOC delivered by coastal retreat in the lagoon. Additionally, a significant portion of the OC released by the Colville River is relatively thermochemically reactive and sourced from Pleistocene-aged yedoma-like deposits, and could contribute to increased OC mineralization in the Beaufort shelf. These results are the first to combine biomarker and ramped pyrolysis-14C analyses in an Arctic setting.",

            "abstract": "Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the atmosphere lead to atmospheric deposition of sulfate (SO42-), which is the dominant strong acid anion causing acidification of surface waters and soils in the eastern United States (U.S.). Since passage of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, atmospheric deposition of SO2 in this region has declined by over 80%, but few corresponding decreases in stream-water SO42- concentrations have been observed in unglaciated watersheds. We calculated SO42- mass balances for 27 forested, unglaciated watersheds from Pennsylvania to Georgia, by using total atmospheric deposition (wet plus dry) as input. Many of these watersheds still retain SO42-, unlike their counterparts in the northeastern U.S. and southern Canada. Our analysis showed that many of these watersheds should convert from retaining to releasing SO42- over the next two decades. The specific years when the watersheds crossover from retaining to releasing SO42- correspond to a general geographical pattern of later net watershed release from north to south. The single most important variable that explained the crossover year was the runoff ratio, defined as the ratio of annual mean stream discharge to precipitation. Percent clay content and mean soil depth were secondary factors in predicting crossover year. The conversion of watersheds from net SO42- retention to release anticipates more widespread reductions in stream-water SO42- concentrations in this region.",

            "abstract": "Wide field electromagnetic method (WFEM) is a new controlled-source EM technology developed in China. It measures EM signal induced by a pseudo random current that contains multiple frequencies. Due to concurrent multiple-frequency transmission, WFEM works more efficiently than traditional CSAMT method. With improvement of equipment and data collections and by defining the wide field apparent resistivity, the anti-interference capability, the resolution and exploration depth are all enchenced. Due to its portable and flexiable equipments, WFEM is the best supplement or replacement in certain conditions to traditional seismic for oil & gas, especially for marine shale gas in South China, where the underground structures and surface conditions are very complex (high mountains, cliff, forest etc.).\nWe used WFEM for shale gas exploration in South China and selected the Bayan syncline in Huayuan block as a pilot area for data acquisition and interpretation. We deployed 7 survey lines, with the total covered area of about 150km2. The experiments show that, WFEM is an effective geophysical tool for marine shale gas exploration in China. Using this technology, we identified underground structures and faults in the area and find out the distribution, depth, thickness of target strata. The inversion results clearly define the resistivity and thickness of target shale stratum and surrounding rocks. Taking Line 5 for example (Fig.1) , the inverted WFEM section shows that the overburden in the survey area has a resistivity of 1000-2000ohm-m, a thickness of 1000-3000m, the target layer has a resistivity of 10-100ohm-m, a thickness of 300-500m, while the underlying half-space has a resistivity over 100ohm-m. Besides, from the resistivity distribution, we can also identify two faults at locations respectively between 6500m-7500m and 8000m-9000m in the profile.\nBy further analyzing the correlation between induced polarization rate, resistivity and TOC of shale formation, we found that both the resistivity and the polarization rate are correlated positively with the TOC, so that we can delineate favorable zones for shale gas reservoirs. By combining with borehole data, we determined the thresholds for resistivity and polarization rate and chose the most favorable areas (sweet spots) for shale gas development.",

            "abstract": "The Wind spacecraft was launched in the fall of 1994 to explore the nature of the solar wind and the interaction of the solar wind with the Earth. As the years have passed, and the rich datasets collected by the spacecraft have grown, the Wind mission has taken on an additional role as an interplanetary physics experiment, producing fundamental insights into processes in tenuous magnetized plasmas including kinetic instabilities, dissipation, heat flux, and heating. Results from Wind have helped us understand plasmas throughout the heliosphere, but they have also been applied to more exotic situations such as the accretion of matter onto black holes, and cooling of material within galaxy clusters. This talk will both highlight major recent results from Wind and examine the factors of the mission that have made this research possible. Beyond the sensitive statistical tests permitted by two decades of observations, Wind is equipped with a particularly diverse set of complementary instruments, permitting precise inter-calibration of observations and a detailed understanding of the nature of the solar wind that only improves with time.",

            "abstract": "The meridional overturning circulation and strati cation of the global ocean are shaped critically by processes in the Southern Ocean. The zonally unblocked nature of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) confers the region with a set of special dynamics that ultimately results in the focussing therein of large vertical exchanges between layers spanning the global ocean pycnocline. These vertical exchanges are thought to be mediated by oceanic turbulent motions (associated with mesoscale eddies and small-scale turbulence), yet the vastness of the Southern Ocean and the sparse and intermittent nature of turbulent processes make their relative roles and large-scale impacts extremely difficult to assess.\nHere, we address the problem from a new angle, and use measurements of the centimetre-scale signatures of mesoscale eddies and small-scale turbulence obtained during the DIMES experiment to determine the contributions of those processes to sustaining large-scale meridional overturning across the ACC. We find that mesoscale eddies and small-scale turbulence play complementary roles in forcing a meridional circulation of O(1 mm / s) across the Southern Ocean, and that their roles are underpinned by distinct and abrupt variations in the rates at which they mix water parcels. The implications for our understanding of the Southern Ocean circulation's sensitivity to climatic change will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Scientific evidence indicates wide-scale changes in Arctic climate. The Arctic contains large expanses of tundra with permafrost, or permanently frozen subsoil. Climate change impacts on the tundra have the potential to enhance biogenic methane (CH4) production in thawed, active soils or release CH4 trapped in or below the permafrost. Methane is a highly effective greenhouse gas so CH4 released from thawing tundra or melting massive ice features constitutes a potential positive feedback to Arctic climate change. In August, 2013 the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL-6114) led an expedition to investigate late-summer tundra CH4 concentrations and fluxes on the North Slope of Alaska near Prudhoe Bay. Permafrost cores were collected to measure tundra CH4 concentrations and soil parameters and a series of gas traps were deployed to measure tundra CH4 flux at 9 locations spread across a study area of ~1800 km2. Thaw probe measurements at each site provided information on the depth of the seasonally-thawed (active) layer. Results show large differences in tundra CH4 concentrations with depth through the active layer and into the upper permafrost terrain and fine-scale variability in daily CH4 flux over a relatively small spatial area. It is likely that variations in biogeochemical and geomorphological characteristics such as soil composition, microbial activity, moisture type, active layer composition and extent from site-to-site control the CH4 regime. In order to provide more accurate estimates of permafrost tundra CH4 storage and fluxes, controls on CH4 variability from location to location must be better understood. Further research is required to quantify and predict tundra CH4 flux in order to better understand the potential impact it will have on Arctic climate, particularly if, as predicted, climate warming leads to the liberation of permafrost carbon in these landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Despite sustained increase in computing power over recent decades, computational limitations remain a major barrier to the effective and systematic use of large-scale, process-based simulation models in rational environmental decision-making. Whereas complex models may provide clear advantages when the goal of the modelling exercise is to enhance our understanding of the natural processes, they introduce problems of model identifiability caused by over-parameterization and suffer from high computational burden when used in management and planning problems. As a result, increasing attention is now being devoted to emulation modelling (or model reduction) as a way of overcoming these limitations. An emulation model, or emulator, is a low-order approximation of the process-based model that can be substituted for it in order to solve high resource-demanding problems.\nIn this talk, an overview of emulation modelling within the context of the optimal operation of water systems will be provided. Particular emphasis will be given to Dynamic Emulation Modelling (DEMo), a special type of model complexity reduction in which the dynamic nature of the original process-based model is preserved, with consequent advantages in a wide range of problems, particularly feedback control problems. This will be contrasted with traditional non-dynamic emulators (e.g. response surface and surrogate models) that have been studied extensively in recent years and are mainly used for planning purposes. A number of real world numerical experiences will be used to support the discussion ranging from multi-outlet water quality control in water reservoir through erosion/sedimentation rebalancing in the operation of run-off-river power plants to salinity control in lake and reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "The American Climate Prospectus (ACP), the technical analysis underlying the Risky Business project, quantitatively assesses climate risks posed to the United States’ economy in a number of sectors [1]. Four of these - crop yield, crime, labor productivity, and mortality – draw upon research which identifies social impacts using contemporary variability in climate.\nWe first identify a group of rigorous studies that use climate variability to identify responses to temperature and precipitation, while controlling for unobserved differences between locations. To incorporate multiple studies from a single sector, we employ a meta-analytical approach that draws on Bayesian methods commonly used in medical research and previously implemented in [2]. We generate a series of aggregate response functions for each sector using this meta-analytical method. We combine response functions with downscaled physical climate projections to estimate climate impacts out to the end of the century, incorporating uncertainty from statistical estimates, weather, climate models, and different emissions scenarios.\nIncorporating multiple studies in a single estimation framework allows us to directly compare impacts across the economy. We find that increased mortality has the largest effect on the US economy, followed by costs associated with decreased labor productivity. Agricultural losses and increases in crime contribute lesser but nonetheless substantial costs, and agriculture, notably, shows many areas benefitting from projected climate changes. The ACP also presents results throughout the 21stcentury. The dynamics of each of the impact categories differs, with, for example, mortality showing little change until the end of the century, but crime showing a monotonic increase from the present day.\nThe ACP approach can expand to include new findings in current sectors, new sectors, and new geographical areas of interest. It represents an analytical framework that can incorporate empirical studies into a broad characterization of climate impacts across an economy, ensuring that each individual study can contribute to guiding policy priorities on climate change.\n",

            "abstract": "The importance of cumulative carbon emissions in determining long-term risks of climate change presents considerable challenges to policy makers. The traditional notion of \"total CO2-equivalent emissions\", which forms the backbone of agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the European Emissions Trading System, is fundamentally flawed. Measures to reduce short-lived climate pollutants benefit the current generation, while measures to reduce long-lived climate pollutants benefit future generations, so there is no sense in which they can ever be considered equivalent. Debates over the correct metric used to compute CO2-equivalence are thus entirely moot: both long-lived and short-lived emissions will need to be addressed if all generations are to be protected from dangerous climate change. As far as long-lived climate pollutants are concerned, the latest IPCC report highlights the overwhelming importance of carbon capture and storage in determining the cost of meeting the goal of limiting anthropogenic warming to two degrees. We will show that this importance arises directly from the cumulative carbon budget and the role of CCS as the technology of last resort before economic activity needs to be restricted to meet ambitious climate targets. It highlights the need to increase the rate of CCS deployment by orders of magnitude if the option of avoiding two degrees is to be retained. The difficulty of achieving this speed of deployment through conventional incentives and carbon-pricing mechanisms suggests a need for a much more direct mandatory approach. Despite their theoretical economic inefficiency, the success of recent regulatory measures in achieving greenhouse gas emissions reductions in jurisdictions such as the United States suggests an extension of the regulatory approach could be a more effective and politically acceptable means of achieving adequately rapid CCS deployment than conventional carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems.",

            "abstract": "Many existing models to infer paleoecological conditions from species assemblages are based on weak species-environmental relationships that are confounded by secondary variables, resulting in poor predictive power. We evaluated diatoms from Laurentian Great Lakes phytoplankton samples in the development of a total phosphorus (TP) transfer function based on weighted-average species abundance. Several tests were applied to validate our new indicator. Of the 118 common diatom taxa 76% had non-monotonous responses along the Great Lakes TP gradient. However, there was substantial autocorrelation among samples, justifying the need for further validation. A randomization procedure indicated that the actual transfer function consistently performed better than simulated functions. Further, TP was minimally confounded by other environmental variables. We then hindcasted TP using fossil diatom assemblages in a Lake Superior sediment core. Passive, multivariate analysis of the fossil samples against the training set data indicated that TP was a major determinant of historical diatoms, verifying that the function was well suited to reconstruct past TP. Collectively, these results show that diatom coefficients for water quality are robust indicators of Great Lakes condition. We recommend use in management when retrospective data are needed for tracking long-term degradation, remediation and trajectories.",

            "abstract": "Because of expected effects of climate changes on quantity and spatial distribution of available water resources, assessment of the changes in the balance between the demand and supply of water resources is critical for some regions. Historically, water deficiencies were overcome by planned water management such as dam regulation and irrigation. But only few studies have investigated the effect of anthropogenic factors on the risk of imbalance of water demand and supply under climate change conditions. Therefore, estimation of the potential deficiency in existing infrastructures under water-environment change is needed to support our society to adapt against future climate changes. This study aims to estimate the impacts of climate changes on the risk of water scarcity projected based on CMIP5 RCP scenarios and the efficiency of autonomous adaptation by anthropogenic water management, such as reservoir operation and irrigation using ground water. First, tendencies of the changes in water scarcity under climate change are estimated by an improved land surface model, which integrates natural water cycles and human activities. Second, the efficiencies of human-developed infrastructure are analyzed by comparing the naturalized and fully anthropogenic offline simulations.\nIt was found that number of hydrological drought days will be increased and decreased in approximately 70 % and 24 % of global land, respectively, considering anthropogenic water management, however, they are approximately 82 % and 16 %, respectively, under naturalized condition without anthropogenic water management. The differences indicate how autonomous adaptation through anthropogenic water management can reduce the impacts of climate change. Also, adequate enhancement of infrastructure is necessary against expected water scarcity under climate change because such positive and negative effects of artificial water regulation show comparable impact on water scarcity risk to that of climate change in regions where human activity is significant, even if it is under the worst-case RCP8.5 scenario. More realistic assessment of the impacts of climate change on water resources and the cost estimation of how much economic investments are needed to maintain the current level of the risks of water scarcity are necessary.",

There were suggestions that the dynamics of the glacier is driven by large subglacial lakes that initiate the ice stream flow (Bell et al., 2008). As the Recovery Glacier is one of the least surveyed ice streams due to its remote location, this hypothesis could not be tested rigorously so far. In austral summer 2013/14 AWI carried out a survey of the Recovery Glacier including radio echo sounding, gravimetry, magnetics, and laser scanner. In total more than 22000 km survey lines were flown.\nHere we present an ice thickness map of the main trunk of the Recovery Glacier, as well as its tributaries Blackwall and Ramp glaciers. The ice thickness varies between 70 m in the vicinity of the Shackleton Range and nearly 3800 m close to the Bell lakes.\nUsing different DEMs including one CryoSat-2 DEM (Helm et al., 2014), we determine the basal topography and the hydraulic head.\nWe estimate the basal reflection coefficient and assess by this locations with potentially wet ice base. The distribution shows that few of the formerly proposed lakes show indeed a wet base, while others are missing clear lake like basal reflections.",

            "abstract": "The burial of particulate organic carbon (POC) in marine sediments is an important process in the Earth’s carbon cycle. While some POC is buried for the long term, a substantial fraction is decomposed within the sediment, fueling subseafloor microbial life. The fundamental controls on the rate of POC decomposition are not well understood at present. Temperature has been proposed as an important factor, because at higher temperatures reaction rates are expected to be faster (as in the Arrhenius equation). To test the effect of temperature on POC decomposition, we assembled from the global scientific ocean drilling archive (DSDP, ODP, and IODP) a large data set of POC content in Cenozoic marine sediments. We concentrated on sites that are in regions of high POC deposition (continental margins and upwelling areas), have a reliable age model, and had in situ measurements of sediment temperature. Using the age and temperature data, we selected two sets of sites where sediments experienced either relatively high- or low-temperature histories that should have resulted in different rates of POC decomposition. We then compared average POC contents versus age in the high-T and low-T sets of sites. The POC content versus age in the low-T set (82 sites) follows a pattern similar to that of all the sites with an age model (419 sites): POC content (dry sediment weight fraction) starts around 1% at the seafloor, reaches a maximum of 1.2-1.3% at ~1.5 Ma, and then slowly decreases with increasing age to a nearly constant value of 0.6-0.7% at ages > 5 Ma. In the high-T set (83 sites), the average POC content shows a stronger decrease from a maximum of ~1.5% around 1 Ma to a low constant value of 0.4% at ages > 5 Ma. The more pronounced decrease in POC content and the lower amount remaining at ages > 5 Ma suggest that higher temperatures result in a greater extent of POC decomposition.",

            "abstract": "Human land use and natural processes contribute to the ability of ecosystems to store and sequester carbon and offset greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in land use (e.g. agricultural cultivation, timber harvest, urban development, and other land management strategies) and natural processes (e.g. climate, wildfire, disease, storm, and insect outbreak) drive the dynamics of ecosystem carbon pools. These carbon dynamics operate at different spatial and temporal scales, making it challenging to track the changes in a single integrative framework. Landowners, managers, and policy makers require data, information, and tools on the relative contributions of these drivers of ecosystem carbon stocks and fluxes in order to evaluate alternative policies and management strategies designed to increase carbon storage and sequestration. In this paper we explore preliminary results from efforts to simulate changes in ecosystem carbon at ecoregional scales, resulting from anthropogenic land use, wildfire, natural vegetation change, and climate variability under a range of future conditions coherent with a range of global change scenarios. Simulations track the fate of carbon across several pools, including living biomass, deadwood, litter, soil, and wood products. Carbon fluxes are estimated based on simulations from the Integrated Biosphere Simulator model (IBIS). Downscaled land-use projections from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathways drive changes in land use, along with extrapolations based on local-scale data. We discuss the sensitivity of the model to individual drivers, and the overall uncertainty associated with the wide range of scenario projections, as well as explore alternative policy and management outcomes and their ability to increase carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.",

Little, however, is known about the hydrologic pathways that route surface melt within the ice sheet. Radar imaging provides a tool to investigate the englacial water storage and pathways across the GrIS. Here, we present data from the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets’ radars flown by NASA’s Operation IceBridge (OIB). OIB flights occur in the spring, before significant GrIS melt. The airborne radar echograms collected in the supraglacial lake regions show a unique attenuation signal attributed to over-winter storage of water, referred to here as buried lakes. The Snow Radar (~2-8 Ghz), that images the top 10’s of meters of the ice sheet at high vertical resolution in the snow/firn (~4 cm), is used to map the spatial extent and depth of the retained water along OIB flight lines from 2009-2012. The buried lakes are distributed extensively around the margin of the GrIS. The subsurface water can persist through multiple winters and is, on average, ~4.2 + 0.4 m below the surface. Most buried lakes have no visible surface expression at the time of overflight but the few buried lakes that are visible have a unique visible signature associated with a darker blue color where subsurface water is located. The volume of retained water in the buried lakes is small compared to the total mass loss from the GrIS but the water will have important implications locally for the development of the englacial hydrologic network, ice temperature profiles and glacial dynamics. The buried lakes represent a year-round source of meltwater in the GrIS englacial hydrologic system.",

The PIC domain can cover the regions where\nkinetic effects are most important, such as reconnection sites. The\nBATS-R-US code, on the other hand, can efficiently handle the rest of\nthe computational domain where the MHD or Hall MHD description is\nsufficient. As one of the very first applications of the MHD-EPIC\nalgorithm (Daldorff et al. 2014, JCP, 268, 236) we simulate the\ninteraction between Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma with Ganymede's\nmagnetosphere, where the separation of kinetic and global scales\nappears less severe than for the Earth's magnetosphere. Because the\nexternal Jovian magnetic field remains in an anti-parallel orientation\nwith respect to Ganymede's intrinsic magnetic field, magnetic\nreconnection is believed to be the major process that couples the two\nmagnetospheres. As the PIC model is able to describe self-consistently\nthe electron behavior, our coupled MHD-EPIC model is well suited for\ninvestigating the nature of magnetic reconnection in this\nreconnection-driven mini-magnetosphere. We will compare the MHD-EPIC\nsimulations with pure Hall MHD simulations and compare both model\nresults with Galileo plasma and magnetic field measurements to assess the\nrelative importance of ion and electron kinetics in controlling the\nconfiguration and dynamics of Ganymede's magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Since 1988, the National Ground Water Association has formally supported recognition, through certification or some other means, of the unique qualifications necessary to perform hydrogeologic investigations. NGWA has believed reliance on professional engineers or individuals certified in an allied field without a determination as to their knowledge of groundwater science is not a justified position.\nObservation today suggests a need remains for greater hydrogeologic awareness among those that may create infrastructure intrusions into the groundwater environment, such as those designing and installing large-scale installations of geothermal heating and cooling systems. NGWA has responded with development of hydrogeologic guidelines for such projects.\nAlso in partial response to the above named circumstances, the Association has begun development of an ANSI/NGWA standard defining the skills and competencies of groundwater personnel – from the trades to the science, and has explored the potential value of creating a career pathways guidance document for groundwater science professionals.\nHistorically, NGWA scientific members have resisted the idea of accreditation of academic geosciences programs, including those for hydrogeology, although such discussions continue to be raised from time to time by groups such as the Geological Society of America and the American Geosciences Institute. The resistance seems to have been born out of recognition of the multi-disciplinary reality of groundwater science.\nNGWA funded research found that more than half of the respondents to a study of the business development practices for consulting groundwater professionals had been involved with groundwater issues for more than 20 years, and less than one percent had worked in the field for fewer than two years, raising the question of whether too few young people are being attracted to hydrogeology.\nSome speculate the seemingly minor emphasis on Earth science education in the U.S. K-12 system may lead to (1) employers of ground water hydrologists finding, on average, fewer applicants; (2) applicants with less depth of training in ground water hydrology; (3) need for additional on-the-job training among entry level personnel; and (4) greater salaries of all hydrology professionals.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates possible links between seismicity and wastewater injection in the Williston Basin and Bakken Formation in North Dakota and Montana. To identify Bakken earthquakes we analyzed seismic records collected by the EarthScope USArray temporary network of seismograph stations, deployed on a grid with 70-km spacing.\nDuring the September 2008 – May 2011 study period we identified only nine earthquakes; of these only three were near injection wells. Thus, possibly triggered earthquakes are rarer near injection wells in the Bakken than in the Barnett Shale of Texas, or in central Oklahoma.\nThe reason why Bakken earthquakes are so scarce is unclear. In many respects the Bakken/Williston region is similar to the Barnett Shale/Fort Worth Basin of Texas. In both regions injection volumes increased significantly in late 2007, and both areas have low levels of natural seismicity. Yet, in Johnson and Tarrant counties in the Barnett, earthquakes near injection wells were numerous; in the Bakken and elsewhere in the Barnett, earthquakes near wells were scarce.\nAn important result of these surveys is that the relationship between seismicity and injection/production activities varies considerably in different geographic areas. In the Bakken and western counties of Texas’ Barnett Shale, there is almost no seismic activity near injection wells. In Oklahoma, Arkansas, parts of the Barnett, and near Timpson in east Texas, there are earthquakes associated with high-volume injection wells. In the Eagle Ford of Texas earthquakes are associated primarily with production (not injection). And near Snyder, TX, recent earthquakes are associated with CO2injection.\nThis variability in response to injection complicates efforts to craft uniform policies or regulations to mitigate potential seismic hazards associated with injection practices. At a minimum it suggests that within particular geographic regions it is important to survey the relationship between seismicity and injection before considering possible policy responses or regulations. For these regional surveys, the records collected during the two-year deployment of USArray stations are valuable, although these may need to be augmented by continuing coverage.\nFigure: Earthquakes, explosions, injection wells, and coal mines in the Bakken (shaded area).",

The spectral coverage of M-Bands allows for the high quality retrieval of sea surface temperature (SST) under cloud-free conditions. In particular, the M-Band suite includes a “split window” in the 10 to 12 micrometer range with which correction for atmospheric water vapor can be made while avoiding issues associated with solar reflection, which afflicts observations in some of the shorter wave-length spectral windows during daylight hours. Unfortunately, there is only one I-Band channel in the 10 to 12 micrometer range precluding the same approach used for M-Band retrievals. In this presentation, we discuss an algorithm developed at the University of Rhode Island that makes use of the atmospheric correction available from M-Band retrieval algorithms together with I-Band radiances to produce a high quality 375 m SST product. The M-Band retrievals used are those from NOAA’s Advanced Clear Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) program. In comparisons with ship-borne radiometer SST retrievals, we show that the I-Band retrievals are of similar quality to the underlying M-Band retrievals. We then go on to demonstrate the sub-kilometer scale of the features resolved in the I-Band retrievals as well as how these data may be used to infer near-surface currents on a spatial grid of order 10 kilometers.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric plasmas have thermal speeds much smaller than orbital (escape) velocities, so they appear to orbiting spacecraft as a relatively narrow beam from the ram direction. But one of the very interesting things about ionospheric plasmas is that they are heated strongly in the auroral zones, and accelerated such that their thermal or directed speeds exceed orbital or escape velocity. Then they do just that: orbit or escape the Earth into the magnetosphere and beyond at velocities spread over a large range of angles and magnitudes. This has created a dichotomy between the observation of cold, rammed plasmas in the ionosphere proper and the observation of hot plasmas with a large range of velocities in both direction and magnitude, well above the ionosphere proper. The former are usually observed from attitude-stabilized, ram-pointed spacecraft, while the latter are usually observed from spinning spacecraft. We review measurements that illuminate the way forward, particularly from the Swarm mission, and propose a new sciencecraft configuration that overcomes the divergent requirements to facilitate direct observations of processes that heat and accelerate ionospheric plasmas across this transition from gravitationally bound to unbound and escaping into space.",

Results demonstrate the predominance of microbial-like signatures within the borehole environment, with densities in the range of 105 cells/mL.

Previous work has suggested that turbulent structure and formation of hydrometeors, including rain, graupel and ash aggregates, are likely to play important roles in the plume charging process. We examine these phenomena with 3D large-eddy simulations of volcanic plume development that include cloud microphysics, using the Active Tracer High-resolution Atmospheric Model (ATHAM). Three relatively recent eruptions are targeted, each with different plume heights, degrees of wind interaction, and amounts of surface water interaction. We have compared the simulated evolution of turbulence and precipitation formation with data from lightning mapping arrays to address the following question – what can lightning tell us about the initiation and development of a volcanic plume in near-real time?",

            "abstract": "Recent simulations and observations have shown that when solar wind rotational discontinuities (RDs) approaching Earth’s bow shock interact with ions backstreaming in the foreshock they can result in a new phenomenon, foreshock bubbles (FBs). FBs result in very intense pressure perturbations upstream of and inside Earth’s magnetosphere and are therefore important for solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. To examine the time evolution of FBs and compare FBs with hot flow anomalies (HFAs), we examined multi-point THEMIS observations of both FBs and HFAs in which 4 or more spacecraft all observed the same events. Such observations allow us to disambiguate between spatial and temporal evolution of the FBs and HFAs. Our results show that FBs form further upstream from the bow shock and then expand with a higher speed to a much larger size compared to HFAs. We discuss how these results are consistent with simulations. Particle acceleration caused by the bouncing motion of particles between the earthward moving shock upstream of the FBs and the Earth’s bow shock as revealed in simulations is also discussed based on our observations of ion distribution functions.",

These potential ecosystems may play a significant role in biogeochemical processes and elemental fluxes that are known to be regulated by these systems. I will discuss the nature of ridge flank hydrothermal environments, and present a framework for delineating a continuum of conditions and processes that are likely to be important for defining subseafloor microbial \"provinces.\" The basis for this framework is three governing conditions that help to determine the nature of subseafloor biomes: crustal age, extent of fluid flow, and thermal state. A brief overview of subseafloor conditions, within the context of these three characteristics for select sites will be described. Technical challenges remain and likely will limit progress in studies of microbial ridge flank hydrothermal ecosystems, which is why it is vital to select and design future studies so as to leverage as much general understanding as possible from work focused at a small number of sites. A characterization framework that perhaps includes alternative or additional physical or chemical characteristics is essential for achieving the greatest benefit from multidisciplinary microbial investigations of oceanic ridge flank hydrothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of the project was to provide information on the mineralogical, chemical and physical interrelationships of re-suspended mineral dust samples collected as grab samples from global dust sources. Surface soil samples were collected from about 65 desert sites, including the southwestern USA (12), Mali (3), Chad (3), Morocco (1), Canary Islands (8), Cape Verde (1), Djibouti (1), Afghanistan (3), Iraq (6), Kuwait (5), Qatar (1), UAE (1), Serbia (3), China (5), Namibia (3), Botswana (4), Australia (3), and Chile (1).\nThe < 38 µm sieved fraction of each sample was re-suspended in an entrainment chamber, from which the airborne mineral dust could be monitored, sampled and analyzed. Instruments integrated into the entrainment facility included two PM10 and two PM2.5 filter samplers, a beta attenuation gauge for the continuous measurement of PM10 and PM2.5 particulate mass fractions, an aerodynamic particle size (APS) analyzer, and a three wavelength (405, 532, 781nm) photoacoustic resonator with integrating reciprocal nephelometer for monitoring absorption and scattering coefficients during the dust re-suspension process. Filter sample media included Teflon® membrane and quartz fiber filters for chemical analysis (71 species), and Nuclepore® filters for individual particle analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The < 38 µm sieved fractions were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction for their mineral content while the > 38 µm, < 125 µm soil fractions were mineralogically characterized by optical microscopy.\nWe will be presenting results on the optical measurements, also showing the relationship between single scattering albedo (SSA) at three different wavelengths, and chemical as well as mineralogical content and interdependencies of the entrained dust samples. Examples showing the relationships between the single scattering albedos of airborne dusts, and iron (Fe) in hematite, goethite, and clay minerals (montmorillonite, illite, palygorskite), will be discussed. Differences between the clay minerals in samples from Mali and those from other localities are demonstrated.\nWe intend establishing a data base for applications in climate modeling, remote sensing, visibility, health (medical geology), ocean fertilization, and damage to equipment.",

            "abstract": "U-series isotopes fractionate during chemical weathering and their activity ratios have been used to determine timescales and rates of soil formation. Such soil formation rates are measured at soil profile scale and provide an important link to compare chemical weathering rates measured across different spatial scales.\nWe analyzed U-series isotope compositions in a ~12m deep soil profile in Basse-Terre Island of French Guadeloupe. The tropical Bras David watershed is developed on andesitic pyroclastic flows. Field observations have shown heterogeneity in color and texture in this profile. However, major element chemistry and mineralogy show some general depth trends.\nFirst, Al, Fe, and Ti show a depletion profile relative to Th from 12m to 4m depth, an addition from 4m to 2m, and depletion from 2m to the surface. Second, mobile elements such as Ca, Mg, and Sr have undergone intensive weathering, therefore show almost complete depletion even in the deep profile, and an addition profile near the surface. This addition trend is most likely related to atmospheric dust and marine aerosol signatures. Finally, K, Mn, and Si show a partial depletion profile at depth. The main minerals present throughout the soil profile are halloysite and gibbsite.\n238U/232Th ratios in this profile ranged from 0.374 to 1.696, while the 230Th/232Th ratios ranged from 0.367 to 1.701. A decrease of (238U/232Th) in the deep soil profile from 12m to 4m depth is observed, and an increase in the shallow profile from 4m to the surface. The (230Th /232Th) ratios showed a similar trend as (238U/232Th). Marine aerosols and atmospheric dust are responsible for the addition of U in shallow soils while intensive chemical weathering is responsible for the loss of U at depth.\nU-series chemical weathering model suggests that the weathering duration from 12m to 4m depth is about 250kyr, with a weathering advancing rate of ~30 m/Ma. The rate is also about one order of magnitude lower than the weathering rate (~300 m/Ma) determined by river chemistry for the Brad David watershed. In this profile, the augered core didn’t reach the unweathered bedrock. Hence, the derived slow weathering rate most likely represents the intensive weathering of clay minerals, not the transformation of fresh bedrock to regolith, which occurs at much great depth beneath the thick regolith.",

            "abstract": "The Atlantic coast of North America provides a sedimentary record of Common Era sea levels with the resolution to identify the mechanisms that cause spatial variability in sea-level rise. This coast has a small tidal range, improving the precision of sea-level reconstructions. Coastal subsidence (from glacial isostatic adjustment, GIA) creates accommodation space that is filled by salt-marsh peat and preserves accurate and precise sea-level indicators and abundant material for radiocarbon dating. In addition, the western North Atlantic Ocean is sensitive to spatial variability in sea-level change, because of static equilibrium effects from melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet, ocean circulation and wind-driven variability in the Gulf Stream and GIA induced land-level change from ongoing collapse of Laurentide forbuldge.\nWe reveal three distinct patters in sea-level during the Common Era along the North American Atlantic coast, likely linked to wind-driven changes in the Gulf Stream: (1) Florida, sea level is essentially flat, with the record dominated by long-term geological processes; (2) North Carolina, sea level falls to a minimum near the beginning of the second millennium, climbing to an early Little Ice Age maximum in the fifteenth century, and then declining through most of the nineteenth century; and (3) New Jersey, a sea-level maximum around 900 CE, a sea-level minimum around 1500 CE, and a long-term sea-level rise through the second half of the second millennium.\nWe combine the salt-marsh data from North American Atlantic coast with tide-gauge records and lower resolution proxies from the northern and southern hemispheres. We apply a noisy-input Gaussian process spatio-temporal modeling framework, which identifies a long-term falling global mean sea-level (GMSL), interrupted in the middle of the 19th century by an acceleration yielding a 20th century rate of rise extremely likely (probability P = 0:95) faster than any previous century in the Common Era.",

            "abstract": "The Alberta oil sands (OS) region represents a strategic natural resource and is a key driver of economic development. Its rapid expansion has led to a need for a more comprehensive understanding of the associated potential cumulative environmental impacts. In summer 2013, airborne measurements of various gaseous and particulate substances were made in the Athabasca oil sands region between August 13 and Sept 7, 2013. In particular, organic aerosol mass and composition measurements were performed with a High Resolution Time of flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) supported by gaseous measurements of organic aerosol precursors with Proton Transfer Reaction (PTR) and Chemical Ionization (CI) mass spectrometers. These measurement data on selected flights were used to estimate the potential for local anthropogenic OS emissions to form secondary organic aerosol (SOA) downwind of precursor sources, and to investigate the importance of the surrounding biogenic emissions to the overall SOA burden in the region. The results of several flights conducted to investigate these transformations demonstrate that multiple distinct plumes were present downwind of OS industrial sources, each with differing abilities to form SOA depending upon factors such as NOx level, precursor VOC composition, and oxidant concentration. The results indicate that approximately 100 km downwind of an OS industrial source most of the measured organic aerosol (OA) was secondary in nature, forming at rates of ~6.4 to 13.6 μgm-3hr-1. Positive matrix factor (PMF) analysis of the HR-ToF-AMS data suggests that the SOA was highly oxidized (O/C~0.6) resulting in a measured ΔOA (difference above regional background OA) of approximately 2.5 – 3 despite being 100 km away from sources. The relative contribution of biogenic SOA to the total SOA and the factors affecting SOA formation during a number of flights in the OS region will be described.",

In this investigation, the NRL SAMI3 ionosphere/plasmasphere code[1], coupled to the solar wind via the Weimer05 magnetospheric potential, is used to simulate H+ and He+ populations in the plasmasphere during strongly-disturbed (Dst < -100), moderate (-100 < Dst < -9) and quiet (-9 < Dst <-3) geomagnetic conditions. The SAMI3 ionosphere code includes 7 ion species (H+, He+, O+, N+, O2+, N2+, NO+), each treated as a separate fluid, with temperature equations being solved for H+, He+, O+ and e-. Model results from two different time periods in 2001 are compared to statistical results for number density and mass density versus L shell, based on measurements during 1999-2001[2]. Preliminary results suggest that the heavy ion torus, a configuration where the average ion mass increases with L, may be largely a dayside phenomenon.

To this end, we used the potential intensity (PI), the theoretical upper limit of the tropical cyclone intensity given the large-scale environmental conditions.\nThe multi-model mean PI averaged over the tropical North Atlantic showed a significant increase toward the end of the 21st Century under both the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 emission scenarios. The anthropogenically induced warming would put the North Atlantic PI largely above the historical mean by the mid-21st Century even considering the multidecadal natural variability. We further show that the sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Variablity (AMV) are more effective than that associated with climate change in causing Atlantic PI changes, due to the localized nature of the AMV SST anomalies, confirming the role of remote SST impact on hurricane PI in the climate change scenarios.\nDuring the historical period, both aerosols and greenhouse gases contribute to the forced changes in PI. The decrease in PI caused by aerosol forcing and the increase due to greenhouse gas forcing largely canceled each other, and the sharp increase in PI in the recent 30 years was dominated by the multi-decadal natural variability associated with the positive phase of the AMV.",

Deployed aboard the NASA Langley King Air on the DISCOVER-AQ field mission in Houston in September 2013, HSRL-2 flew a pattern that included 18 ground sites, repeated four times a day, coordinated with a suite of airborne in situ measurements. The horizontally and vertically resolved curtains of HSRL-2 measurements give an unparalleled view of the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol, which provide broad context for interpreting other measurements and models. In Houston, HSRL-2 generally observed significant variability with distinct layering: boundary layer, residual layer, and frequent upper layers of smoke transported from the Mississippi Valley. The period from Sep. 11-14 is notable for a large aerosol build-up and persistent layers in the free troposphere. We investigate the aerosol properties and evolution using the vertically resolved HSRL-2 measurements, typing and mixture analysis techniques, and boundary layer detection. Between morning and afternoon overpasses, as the boundary layer grows, many distinctions between the layers are lost as the aerosols become mixed. As the boundary layer collapses overnight, the aerosols are cut off and are observed in a distinct residual layer the following morning. HSRL-2 measurements of the upper smoke layers suggest slightly different properties each day as new smoke enters the region, while the morning boundary layer indicates more similarity in local emissions day-to-day. HSRL-2 intensive variables (indicators of aerosol type) reflect complex yet predictable mixing. We will present the analysis of aerosol mixtures, and explore the WRF-Chem chemical transport model along the HSRL-2 flight path.",

A model 602 BetaPlus Teledyne Advanced Pollution Instrumentation (TAPI, San Diego, CA USA) particulate measurement system was used to collect particulate matter on a 47 mm diameter cation exchange membrane (CEM, PN# MSTGS3R Mustang S, Pall Corp. Port Washington, NY) at a rate of 16.7 lpm for 24 hours to four days. Particulate concentrations were calculated using beta attenuation across the filters (non-destructive to filter material); the CEM filters were then analyzed for total Hg on a Tekran Total Hg Analysis system (model 2600, Tekran Instruments Corp. Knoxville, TN, USA). Concurrently, samples were collected on an active Hg membrane system. The active Hg membrane system consisted of 3 CEM filters sampling at a rate of 1 lpm for one to two weeks. CEM filters were then analyzed on the Tekran 2600. A Tekran speciation unit (model 1130, 1135, 2537) was also in operation and ambient air samples were analyzed for gaseous elemental Hg (GEM), gaseous oxidized Hg (GOM), and particulate bound Hg (PBM). Both the 602 BetaPlus system and the active Hg membrane system should collect RM on the CEM filters. The active Hg membrane system most likely captures mainly GOM based on previous tests with the Teflon inlet setup that indicated there was high static electricity effective in removing particulate matter. Flow rate and length of measurement (24 hours vs. four days) affected the Hg concentrations on the 602 BetaPlus system. Based on these measurements we hypothesize that, due to the high flow rate, and therefore short retention time, the 602 BetaPlus only captured PBM. It is also possible that there was loss of Hg to inlet walls due to the longer inlet on the 602 BetaPlus system compared to the active Hg membrane system.",

            "abstract": "The Molas Formation is a loessite consisting of reddish silt of Early Pennsylvanian (Bashkirian) age. U-Pb age spectra of accessory zircons indicate long-distance (>2000 km) transport from the Grenville province in northeastern North America plus sources from the peri-Gondwanan terranes in southeastern North America and local sources in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains uplift. These eolian sediments formed a blanket deposit <30 m thick above a paleokarst landscape in southwestern Colorado, infilling solution valleys and burying karst towers developed on the underlying Mississippian (Tournaisian-Visean) Leadville Limestone. The loessite is an eolian signal for the probable onset of glaciation at multiple locations in tectonically uplifted mountainous areas in North America. However, the loessite is easily eroded and has low preservation potential.\nPrior to lithification, significant amounts of the loess were remobilized and transported into the underlying karst system. As paleo-cave deposits, encased in limestone and dolostone, the silt-rich deposits have a higher preservation potential, and the eolian signal of the onset of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age in North America is still recognizable. However, the following signal modification processes need to be understood: (1) source area weathering and pedogenesis; (2) land-atmosphere transfer processes; (3) deposition effects of paleotopography, vegetation and moisture conditions, and infiltration into open fractures and/or the matrix of colluvium; (4) remobilization by surface runoff into open fractures and/or groundwater piping/sapping processes in loess soils; (5) transport into vadose and phreatic karst passageways by episodic (“streamflood”) hydrologic events, forming event deposits (debrites, inundites, and jointites); (6) breakout dome collapse (forming interbedded cave sediments, karst breccias, and speleothems); (7) lithification and diagenesis; (8) post-lithification modification including pervasive hydrothermal mineralization; and (9) correctly recognizing the age of the signal.",

            "abstract": "There has been increasing recognition of the importance of interaction between aquifers and aquitards on contaminant fate and transport. Aquitards can serve as long-term contaminant sources to aquifers because contaminant mass diffuses out of the aquitards when source mass is depleted by aquifer remediation. This study describes analytical and experimental approaches to understand reactive and non-reactive solute transport in a thin aquitard bounded by an aquifer system. We solved a one-dimensional solute diffusion and transport equation for an aquifer with a finite aquitard using the method of images, and we demonstrated the application in a series of well-controlled laboratory experiments. Solute concentrations in the aquitard were measured in situ using dyes and a light-reflection visualization technique. The analytical solutions with image sources showed very good agreement with aquitard concentration distributions measured in situ in laboratory experiments (mean goodness of fit coefficient of efficiency, E = 0.97). Additionally, reactive and non-reactive solute concentration breakthrough curves (BTCs) were measured from effluent samples and compared to analytical solutions. These results enabled quantitative assessment of the effect of back diffusion on plume persistence. The measured BTCs were predicted very well by solutions that included image sources (E = 0.98) compared to E = 0.82 without image sources. Low-retardation solutes accumulated more stored mass with greater penetration distance in the aquitard, and then generated relatively higher back diffusion flux compared to high-retardation solutes that stored less mass with lower penetration depth in the aquitard. However, because the duration of aquitard mass release was much longer, high-retardation solutes have a great effect on long-term back diffusion risk.",

            "abstract": "The National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program of the U.S. Geological Survey includes assessment of groundwater-quality changes with time. To better understand changes at a national scale, NAWQA has implemented smaller scale flow-path studies to evaluate the processes affecting these changes. Flow path studies are designed to sample groundwater of different ages. Wells are sampled for a suite of constituents, including tracers of groundwater age.\nIn the 1990s, a 4.6 km transect of monitoring wells was installed near Fresno in the southern Central Valley of California. The region is dominated by intensive agriculture. The wells were sampled in 1994-95, 2003, and 2013 to provide data on changes in water quality and groundwater age. In 2013, the flow path was extended to a regional scale (30 km) by using existing production wells.\nPreliminary interpretation of the local-scale flow path indicates that nitrate concentrations in the upper 25 m of the aquifer are higher than the USEPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for drinking water and variably increase or decrease with time. At intermediate depths (25-40 m), nitrate concentrations are lower and show small to moderate increases. The legacy pesticide 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) is degrading at a half-life of about 4-6 years. DBCP is present above the MCL at intermediate depths even though it is has been banned from use for more than 30 years. Both nitrate and DBCP appear to be moving vertically downward through the aquifer. Whereas uranium concentrations are generally below the MCL in the local-scale flow path, concentrations increase along the regional transect, with concentrations nearly an order of magnitude above the MCL in some wells. Further evaluation of processes affecting these constituents (such as source, redox, and mobilization factors) will provide important insight that can be applied to other regions and will assist local water managers.",

            "abstract": "The pacing of paleoclimatic change in the Great Basin of western North America is closely linked to the classical Milankovitch forcing of precessional-scale summer insolation variations. Cave stalagmites from Nevada show that oxygen isotope variations (δ18O) closely track summer insolation, and show a peak-to-peak match with insolation minima and maxima over the last 175,000 years. The strong correspondence between stalagmite δ18O and summer insolation suggests a fast-response of atmospheric circulation to orbital forcing in western North America. In particular, we observe very low δ18O values (cold conditions) during Marine Isotope Stage 5d that track a prominent summer insolation minima. The small change in global ice volume during MIS 5d contrasts with the large cooling of Great Basin paleoclimate, and suggests that changes in northern hemisphere ice sheet extent was not a dominant driving factor of Great Basin climate then. Further, records of eastern Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature do not closely track Great Basin δ18O minima, suggesting that the main forcing does not reside in the ocean. Instead, we suggest that a rapid increase in the areal extent of winter snow and sea-ice extent resulted in exceptionally cold continental interior climate during MIS5d, both through a direct thermal (cooling) effect, and indirect circulation effects (more northerly-sourced air masses). Extrapolating the MIS 5d climate by analogy, we suggest that the driving mechanism for orbital-scale paleoclimate variability relates to changes in the sea-to-land temperature gradient, which drove the δ18O values of atmospheric precipitation to low values by enhanced air mass distillation during insolation minima. Because of the long transport distance of air masses up and over major orographic barriers such as the Sierra Nevada, and the strong continentality of the interior Great Basin, this mechanism can explain the exceptional sensitivity of Nevada δ18O values to orbital forcing.",

            "abstract": "Recent technological advances in the recovery of unconventional natural gas, particularly shale gas, have served to dramatically increase domestic production and reserve estimates for the United States and internationally. This trend has led to lowered prices and increased scrutiny on production practices. Questions have been raised as to how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the life cycle of shale gas production and use compares with that of conventionally produced natural gas or other fuel sources such as coal. Recent literature has come to different conclusions on this point, largely due to differing assumptions, comparison baselines, and system boundaries. Through a meta-analytical procedure we call harmonization, we develop robust, analytically consistent, and updated comparisons of estimates of life cycle GHG emissions for electricity produced from shale gas, conventionally produced natural gas, and coal. On a per unit electrical output basis, harmonization reveals that median estimates of GHG emissions from shale gas-generated electricity are similar to those for conventional natural gas, with both approximately half that of the central tendency of coal. Sensitivity analysis on the harmonized estimates indicates that assumptions regarding liquids unloading and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of wells have the greatest influence on life cycle GHG emissions, whereby shale gas life cycle GHG emissions could approach the range of best performing coal-fired generation under certain scenarios. Despite clarification of published estimates through harmonization, these initial assessments should be confirmed through methane emissions measurements at components and in the atmosphere and through better characterization of EUR and practices.",

            "abstract": "Increased use of natural gas has been promoted as a means of decarbonizing the US power sector, because of superior generator efficiency and lower CO2 emissions per unit of electricity than coal. We model the effect of different gas supplies on the US power sector and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Across a range of climate policies, we find that more abundant natural gas decreases use of both coal and renewable energy technologies in the future. Without a climate policy, overall energy use also increases as the gas supply increases. With reduced deployment of lower‑carbon renewable energies and increased electricity consumption, the effect of higher gas supplies on GHG emissions is small: cumulative emissions 2013-2055 in our high gas supply scenario are 2% less than in our low gas supply scenario, when there are no new climate policies and a methane leakage rate of 1.5% is assumed. Assuming leakage rates of 0 or 3% does not substantially alter this finding. In our results, only climate policies bring about a significant reduction in future CO2 emissions within the US electricity sector. Our results suggest that without strong limits on GHG emissions or policies that explicitly encourage renewable energy, more abundant natural gas may actually slow the process of decarbonization, primarily by delaying deployment of renewable energy technologies.",

            "abstract": "Interpretation of observations from the MESSENGER spacecraft in orbit about Mercury benefit greatly from knowledge of solar wind “forcing” parameters. The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA)-ENLIL solar wind modeling tool has been used to calculate the values of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength (B), solar wind velocity (V) and density (n), ram pressure (~nV2), cross-magnetosphere electric field (VxB), Alfvén Mach number (MA), and other derived quantities of relevance for solar wind–magnetosphere–exosphere interactions. Such parameters as solar wind dynamic pressure are key for determining the Mercury magnetopause standoff distance, as just one example. The relatively high-time-resolution B-field data from MESSENGER can be used to estimate the strength of the product of the solar wind speed and southward IMF strength (Bs) at Mercury. This electric field drives many magnetospheric dynamical processes and can be compared with general magnetic activity indices and with the occurrence of energetic particle bursts within the Mercury magnetosphere. Such parameters also serve as input to the global magnetohydrodynamic and kinetic magnetosphere models that are used to explore magnetospheric and exospheric processes. Such modeling can help assess near-real-time magnetospheric behavior for MESSENGER (as well as other mission analysis and/or ground-based observational campaigns). This solar-wind forcing knowledge is a crucial continuing step toward bringing heliospheric science expertise to bear on solar-planetary interaction studies.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s ice cover is responding to the ongoing large-scale warming driven in part by anthropogenic forces. The highest tropical and subtropical ice fields are dramatically shrinking and/or thinning and unique climate histories archived therein are now threatened, compromised or lost. Many ice fields in higher latitudes are also experiencing and recording climate system changes although these are often manifested in less evident and spectacular ways.\nThe Antarctic Peninsula (AP) has experienced a rapid, widespread and dramatic warming over the last 60 years. Carefully selected ice fields in the AP allow reconstruction of long histories of key climatic variables. As more proxy climate records are recovered it is clear they reflect a combination of expected and unexpected responses to seemingly similar climate forcings. Recently acquired temperature and precipitation histories from the Bruce Plateau are examined within the context provided by other cores recently collected in the AP. Understanding the differences and similarities among these records provides a better understanding of the forces driving climate variability in the AP over the last century. The Arctic is also rapidly warming. The δ18O records from the Bona-Churchill and Mount Logan ice cores from southeast Alaska and southwest Yukon Territory, respectively, do not record this strong warming. The Aleutian Low strongly influences moisture transport to this geographically complex region, yet its interannual variability is preserved differently in these cores located just 110 km apart. Mount Logan is very sensitive to multi-decadal to multi-centennial climate shifts in the tropical Pacific while low frequency variability on Bona-Churchill is more strongly connected to Western Arctic sea ice extent.\nThere is a natural tendency to focus more strongly on commonalities among records, particularly on regional scales. However, it is also important to investigate seemingly poorly correlated records, particularly those from geographically complex settings that appear to be dominated by similar large-scale climatological processes. Better understanding of the spatially and temporally diverse responses in such regions will expand our understanding of the mechanisms forcing climate variability in meteorologically complex environments.",

            "abstract": "In asymmetric reconnection, the reconnection rate (R) is expected to follow the Cassak-Shay formula with an aspect ratio of around 0.1. At the magnetopause, reconnection is asymmetric, with the dense shocked solar wind population on the magnetosheath side, and a normally hot and tenuous population on the magnetospheric side. However, the hot magnetospheric population can contain a significant O+ component that increases the mass density, and the magnetospheric population may also include a cold dense population of plasmaspheric origin. We perform a statistical study of 13 magnetopause reconnection events observed by Cluster to determine how the reconnection rate depends on these different populations. The events are mainly at high latitudes, due to the Cluster orbit. Our results show that the measured R generally follows the Cassak-Shay prediction when all populations are included. However, the predicted rate only considering the magnetosheath contribution also correlates well with the measured R. For individual events, cold ions can make a comparable contribution to the magnetosheath H+ when there are plasmaspheric drainage plumes; the contribution of the magnetospheric hot O+ can be up to ~30%. However, the variation of solar wind conditions has a larger effect on the variation in the reconnection rate. The aspect ratio does not vary systematically with the O+ content, and 0.1 is a reasonable estimation. The outflow velocity is around the hybrid Alfven speed, but there is not a strong correlation. This may be due to motion of the x-line, or effects of the magnetosheath shear flow.",

            "abstract": "A common way of addressing forecast uncertainty in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models is to use ensemble prediction. The idea behind ensemble prediction\nis to simulate the sensitivity of the forecast to the initial and boundary conditions, as well as model construction error, such as sub-grid physical parameterizations. Existing methods used in order to account for such model consturction uncertainty include; multi-model ensembles, adding random perturbations to the tendencies produced by the parameterizations, or perturbing parameters within the parameterizations. Although such methods are successful in a probabilistic sense, individual ensemble members can be degraded in a deterministic sense by adding random non-physical perturbations. Furthermore, different ensemble members can have different bias (and skill) since they are based on separate models and/or parameters. Another way of accounting for model uncertainty (due to sub-grid variability) is to introduce random variability in the convection parameterization itself. Here we will present the impact of the stochastic deep convection parameterization using cellular automata described in Bengtsson et. al. 2013, as implemented in the high resolution meso-scale ensemble prediction system HarmonEPS. The questions we would like to answer are; can we improve the forecast skill both in a deterministic and probabilistic sense using the stochastic convection scheme? Can the stochastic parameterization in terms of the spread/skill relationship compete with the multi-model approach? Furthermore, the stochastic parameterization proposed in Bengtsson et. al. 2013 addresses lateral communication between model grid-boxes by using a cellular automaton. It was demonstrated that the scheme in a deterministic model is capable of contributing to the organization of convective squall-lines and meso-scale convective systems. We study if and how uncertainties with origin on the sub-grid scale transfer to the larger atmospheric scales through such convective organization. This is done by studying the ensemble spread of the kinetic energy spectra at various forecast lead-times.

            "abstract": "The development of chute cutoffs and the resulting abandonment of meander bends have a substantial influence on the sedimentary dynamics of floodplains. The incision of a chute cutoff channel can rapidly mobilize a large volume of floodplain sediment. On the other hand, bar formation during bend abandonment and the subsequent deposition of sediment within the oxbow lake are key processes in the production of a heterogeneous floodplain sedimentary architecture. This paper describes the evolution of two recent chute cutoffs on the Wabash River, IL-IN. We follow these cutoffs from their initial incision in 2008-2009 through the early stages of bend abandonment. The volume of floodplain sediment mobilized by erosion of the two cutoff channels is estimated using channel bankline positions determined from RTK-GPS surveys and aerial orthophotographs; this flux is then assessed within the context of the sediment mobilized by lateral migration of bends. Repeat bathymetric surveys and aerial photography capture the evolution of bar forms associated with the chute cutoff, and data from ground-penetrating radar reveal the subsurface structure of the complex assemblage of bars that developed as the chute cutoff system shifted from a predominantly erosional to a mixed depositional-erosional phase. These results are combined with knowledge of chute cutoff hydrodynamics to develop an understanding of the dynamics of sediment exchange between river channels and floodplains at evolving meander bend cutoffs.",

            "abstract": "We have developed data assimilation methods for mapping low-mode phase-locked internal tides from altimetry data, using a reduced gravity (RG) approach. Dynamical equations are derived following the approach of Griffiths and Grimshaw (2007), with the vertical dependence of pressure and velocities in the linear Boussinesq 3D equations expanded in basis functions derived from local 1D modes for a stratified ocean. This results in a system of coupled 2D PDEs for the coefficients of the modal expansion. Excluding coupling terms between modes (which arise in the presence of variable bottomt opography) the resulting equations for each mode are analogous to the usual shallow water equations for the barotropic tide. With modest changes to the OSU tidal inversion software (OTIS) an assimilation scheme for this linear model is readily implemented. The coupling terms can be used to derive the forcing (by the barotropic tide), and also can be used to quantify the component of model error associated with unmodeled topographic scattering. Because the inversion yields currents as well as elevations, mode energy fluxes can obtained with minimal further calculation. Relatively high spatial resolution (at least 1/30 degree) is required for the RG dynamical model, so the inversion must be done in modest sized overlapping patches, which can then be merged to obtain global maps of phase-locked low-mode internal tides. To obtain reliable results some care with preliminary data processing has proved necessary, including correction for lower frequency SSH variations in areas of strong mesoscale activity, and filtering to reduce Long wavelength error, especially in ERS/Envisat data. Because the assimilation essentially derives dynamically consistent spatio-temporal basis functions for data fitting, the RG scheme may also provide a means to better quantify at least slowly varying incoherent internal tides.",

            "abstract": "Weather and climate of the new millennium has been unkind to the Southwest United States. Precipitation has been deficient, especially compared to prior decades of the late 20thCentury. Temperatures have been consistently above historical averages. And drought conditions have prevailed for a period now stretching 15 years in duration. Impacts of these dry and warm conditions have included compromised health of forests and ecosystems, more wildfires, reduced water resources most notably the declining elevations of Lake Mead and Powell and substantially diminished annual flows in the Colorado River.\nThe question remains open concerning the extent to which this protracted drought episode is strongly a symptom of human induced climate change. While the prolonged drought, including its recent regional expression over California, has been unusually severe relative to droughts of the 20thCentury, some droughts in the paleoclimate record were more severe. To be sure, various studies have detected the consequences of warming temperatures on the hydrologic cycle over the greater western United States, but the drought’s severity has principally resulted from deficient rains, the cause for which has yet to been determined.\nHere we present results from analysis of historical climate simulations to determine the factors contributing to a protracted reduction in Southwest regional precipitation. A parallel set of 2000 year-long equilibrium coupled ocean-atmosphere experiments, one subjected to late 19th Century radiative forcing and a second subjected to early 21st Century radiative forcing, is used to explore attributable impacts of long-term anthropogenic climate change. Historical atmospheric climate simulations are also used to address the effects of the specific observed evolution of sea surface temperatures. These are characterized by appreciable natural variations, one feature of which has been a cooling in the tropical east Pacific during the last 15 years related to the hiatus. Results are presented that demonstrate a strong link of the Southwest drought to this hiatus condition of the world oceans, and intercomparison with the equilibrium experiments permits us to disentangle that factor from impacts of long term global warming.",

In particular, measurements of physical properties and element partitioning in systems relevant to the core provide complementary data to narrow down the range of possible core compositions. We have performed both static and dynamic compression experiments and combined results from these with literature data to establish a reliable thermal equation of state of iron. This allows us to precisely determine the density deficit in the solid inner core. The combination of density and sound velocity measurements for both solid and liquid iron and its alloys provide tight constraints on the density deficit in the liquid outer core and the amount of sulphur required to match the geophysical observations. We then conducted element-partitioning experiments between solid and liquid iron in both multi-anvil apparatus and the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell to determine the sulphur, silicon, and oxygen partitioning between the liquid outer core and solid inner core. We present newly developed high-pressure experimental and nano-scale analytical techniques that allow us to simulate the conditions of the inner core boundary (ICB) and analyze the chemical compositions of coexisting phases in the recovered samples. We have established protocols to obtain high-quality partitioning data in the laser-heating diamond-anvil cell combined with FIB/SEM crossbeam technology. The partitioning data obtained up to at least 200 GPa provide additional criteria to explain the observed density and velocity jumps at the ICB.",

During these periods, the δ30Si of DSi was strongly negatively correlated to DSi concentrations. Fractionation (expressed in permil as ɛ) determined for the net nutrient drawdown periods was in range of -2.24 to -1.44 ‰ for Open system model and -1.92 to -1.26 ‰ for Closed system model. These results are somewhat higher than previous studies that did not follow changes in δ30Si and DSi over time (but relied more on snapshots like depth profiles) and therefore were more likely to include the effects of mixing of dissolved silicon up into the mixed layer, diminishing the estimate of fractionation.

            "abstract": "Next steps in developing next-generation crop models fall into several categories: significant improvements in simulation of important crop processes and responses to stress; extension from simplified crop models to complex cropping systems models; and scaling up from site-based models to landscape, national, continental, and global scales. Crop processes that require major leaps in understanding and simulation in order to narrow uncertainties around how crops will respond to changing atmospheric conditions include genetics; carbon, temperature, water, and nitrogen; ozone; and nutrition.\nThe field of crop modeling has been built on a single crop-by-crop approach. It is now time to create a new paradigm, moving from ‘crop’ to ‘cropping system.’ A first step is to set up the simulation technology so that modelers can rapidly incorporate multiple crops within fields, and multiple crops over time. Then the response of these more complex cropping systems can be tested under different sustainable intensification management strategies utilizing the updated simulation environments. Model improvements for diseases, pests, and weeds include developing process-based models for important diseases, frameworks for coupling air-borne diseases to crop models, gathering significantly more data on crop impacts, and enabling the evaluation of pest management strategies. Most smallholder farming in the world involves integrated crop-livestock systems that cannot be represented by crop modeling alone. Thus, next-generation cropping system models need to include key linkages to livestock. Livestock linkages to be incorporated include growth and productivity models for grasslands and rangelands as well as the usual annual crops. There are several approaches for scaling up, including use of gridded models and development of simpler quasi-empirical models for landscape-scale analysis.\nOn the assessment side, AgMIP is leading a community process for coordinated contributions to IPCC AR6 that involves the key modeling groups from around the world including North America, Europe, South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, and Australia and Oceania. This community process will lead to mutually agreed protocols for coordinated global and regional assessments.",

The project developed new methods integrating climate, crop, livestock and economic models to conduct climate change impact assessments that characterize impacts on smallholder groups. AgMIP projections of climate change impacts on agriculture are more realistic than previous assessments because they take agricultural development into account. Using the best available data and models, the assessments directly evaluated yield, income, and poverty outcomes including the effects of adaptation packages and development pathways.\nResults show that even with agricultural development, climate change generally will exert negative pressure on yields of smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Without adaptation, climate change leads to increased poverty in some locations in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia compared to a future in which climate change does not occur. Adaptation can significantly improve smallholder farmer responses to climate change. AgMIP expert teams identified improved varieties, sowing practices, fertilizer application, and irrigation applications as prioritized adaptation strategies. These targeted adaptation packages were able to overcome a portion of detrimental impacts but could not compensate completely in many locations. Even in cases where average impact is near zero, vulnerability (i.e., those at risk of loss) can be substantial even when mean impacts are positive.",

            "abstract": "Coseismic slip in the 2008 Wenchuan, China earthquake was highly heterogeneous in both magnitude and rake. The slip was predominantly thrust slip on shallow dipping fault segments near the epicenter, rotating to strike-slip on more steeply dipping fault segments to the northeast. The earthquake ruptured along the front of the Longmenshan, one of the steepest and highest mountain ranges on Earth. Fault segments that slipped in a reverse sense roughly correspond to regions of larger topographic gradients than segments that slipped in strike-slip. The weight of the mountains result in highly variable fault shear stresses on order of 10 MPa and normal stresses up to 80 MPa. The heterogeneity of coseismic slip might indicate a heterogeneity in pre-earthquake stresses, possibly influenced by the heterogeneity of topographic relief. We constrain the accumulated stress that led to the Wenchuan earthquake in a probabilistic manner using geodetically and seismically constrained coseismic slip models, aftershock focal mechanisms, and topographic stresses. We find that coseismic slip models are consistent with a homogeneous pre-earthquake stress orientation along the Longmenshan, although those models are unable to constrain the stress magnitude. We also find that the majority of the aftershocks are broadly consistent with the stress inferred from the mainshock, and that significant rotation of the stress during the Wenchuan earthquake is not required to explain the disparate mechanisms of the aftershocks. More importantly, we find that topographic shear stresses are generally opposed to the direction of fault slip, and thus that the Wenchuan earthquake worked against topographic loading. Given that tectonic stresses needed to overcome topographic stresses for the Wenchuan earthquake to have occurred, allows us to determine a minimum bound on the magnitude of accumulated tectonic stress, in addition to fault friction and pore-pressure. While we find that heterogeneities in topographic fault shear stresses likely did not lead to heterogeneities in the earthquake slip, a negative correlation between slip magnitude and topographic normal stress magnitude suggests that normal stresses may influence fault arrest.",

Compared to the broad gyre-scale wind-forced variability, the eddy-forced sea level changes\ntend to have sub-gyre scales and, in the North Pacific Ocean, they are largely confined to the Kuroshio Extension region (30-40N, 140-165E) and the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) region (18-28N, 130-165E). Using a two-layer primitive-equation model driven by the ECMWF wind stress data and the eddy momentum fluxes specified by the AVISO sea surface height anomaly data, we quantified the relative importance of the wind- and eddy-forced regional sea level trends in the past two decades. It is found that the increasing (decreasing) trend south (north) of the Kuroshio\nExtension is due to strengthening of the regional eddy forcing over the past two decades. On the other hand, the decreasing (increasing) sea level trend south (north) of the STCC is caused by the decadal weakening of the regional eddy momentum flux forcing. These decadal eddy momentum flux changes are caused by the background Kuroshio Extension and STCC changes in connection with the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) wind pattern shifting from a positive to negative phase over the past two decades.",

In addition to long-standing questions about the rate at which reconnection processes magnetic flux, there has been recent experimental, observational, and theoretical interest to understand how the converted energy is partitioned - how much energy flowing into the immediate surroundings of the reconnection site leaves the dissipation region as kinetic energy, how much leaves as thermal energy, and how much leaves as non-thermal energy. The energy partition depends on system parameters, so energy conversion in disparate systems where reconnection occurs, such as solar eruptions, the solar wind, and planetary magnetospheres, can be manifested very differently. In this presentation, recent theoretical and numerical efforts to understand the partition of energy conversion will be discussed. How energy conversion near the reconnection site relates to energy conversion outside the reconnection site will be briefly discussed.",

            "abstract": "If we are to make robust projections of the probability of sea level rise from the ice sheets, these must be founded in both glaciological theory, represented by dynamical ice sheet models, and statistical inference, i.e. formal uncertainty quantification (UQ). No such studies yet exist for either the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheet. Therefore projections risk being physically implausible, difficult to interpret, or both.\nMore optimistically, ice sheet models have many advantages over climate models with respect to uncertainty quantification. They are computationally cheaper, simpler to understand, and have fewer input parameters and output variables. It is relatively straightforward to switch between different model structures, such as physics approximations, basal drag laws, and resolution. Moreover the ice sheet modelling community is relatively small and is not constrained methodologically or culturally by the legacy - and pitfalls - of the CMIP multi-model \"ensemble of opportunity\".\nThese advantages present us with a golden opportunity to create a new vision for policy-relevant sea level projections: we can design a grand ensemble that quantifies multiple modelling uncertainties in a statistically rigorous and efficient way. Such an ensemble systematically samples model parameters and structures, initial and boundary conditions, in the most informative way given the available resources and also allows statistical inference.\nI will review some of the UQ steps that have been taken in ice sheet modelling, such as Bayesian calibration of parameters and projections, history matching (statistically-formalised ruling out of poor parameter values), and emulation (statistical surrogates of numerical models). I will then describe how to implement these and other techniques in a multi-model ensemble design, including: sequential experimental design, which is more efficient than the usual Latin Hypercube; quantifying uncertainty in Full Stokes and high resolution models with the help of cheaper models; how to calibrate models with observations; and how emulation can improve all of these. The proposed design will not only generate more robust and meaningful sea level projections but also provide thorough sensitivity analyses to prioritise future model development and observational campaigns.",

            "abstract": "Alberta is a large province with diverse forested landscapes and heavy industrial, range and recreation use. Hillslopes are generally stable but the cumulative surface erosion from bare areas (e.g. roads, well pad, trails, burns and pipelines) is a major concern for downstream water users, aquatic ecology and stream habitat. Most streams are not exhibiting issues from additional coarse soil (e.g. obvious changes to geomorphology) however, soils with high proportion of fines and phosphorus have been attributed to long lasting aquatic ecology impacts and associated downstream water quality issues. For this project we take a watershed scale approach to determine if we can reduce field effort by using high quality digital terrain data available for most of Alberta combined with tools such as the Geomorphic Road Analysis and Inventory Package (GRAIP) and landscape scale GIS assessment and modeling tools such as NetMap. We examine two contrasting regions of Alberta: (1) a tributary of the Oldman River in southwest Alberta that has steep topography, intense storms and heavy motorized recreation from the neighboring 1.5 Million people, and (2) the Foothills area that has fine lacustrine soil, low topography and extremely heavy industrial activity from energy, mining and forestry.\nWe present the initial results of field data combined with GIS analysis for the eastern slopes as part of a larger project that is assessing these tools in represented end member watersheds for forested areas within the foothills and eastern slopes region (area of Alberta where watersheds have meaningful topography). Initial results suggest that GIS and associated modeling are very useful in providing rapid direction for field campaigns to refine the level of uncertainty, make prescriptive field plans and will likely be platforms that can track changes in predicated watershed scale erosion rates through time.",

Here, we report on the status of ice sheets and glaciers mass balance throughout the world and their contribution to sea level rise using time series of time-variable gravity from the NASA/DLR GRACE satellite mission for the time period 2003-2014. We also evaluate static regional sea level variations (or sea level fingerprints, SLF) from these observations of ice sheet and glacier loss, combined with observations of changes in global land hydrology also from GRACE, and water input from the atmosphere from re-analysis data. We evaluate the relative contribution of each component to regional sea level. We compare the cumulative SLF signal at global scale and at the scale of large ocean basins with satellite altimetry data corrected for the steric component from Argo floats. We find an excellent agreement between the two datasets. Although the regional SLF do not include sea level variations from ocean dynamics that re-distributes water mass around the world’s oceans at the analyzed scales, we find that the SLF represent a large fraction of the trend and annual amplitude of the sea level signal. We also show an analysis of the contributions of regional sea level from mass changes in Greenland and Antarctica going back to the 1970s.

            "abstract": "Gaseous nitrogen losses from cropped and grazed soils are an important, but poorly constrained component of the N budget. Most observational data sets of N gas fluxes are for N2O measured using ground based chambers at small spatial and temporal resolution and interpolation and extrapolation are used to estimate annual emissions at the plot scale. These plot level data are then used to develop and test models of varying complexity, ranging from empirical models based mainly on N application rates to process based models that account for how vegetation, land management and environmental factors interact to control N gas losses. This is problematic for two reasons; first, N gas emissions are highly variable in space and time so annual plot level emission estimates based on infrequent sampling are suspect and second, testing of models that predict daily fluxes is limited because models often predict spikes in emissions on days when gas fluxes were not measured. Recent high temporal resolution N2O observations help solve these problems. We show that the latest version of the DayCent biogeochemical model, which includes a varying N2O product ratio for nitrification, has improved accuracy for simulated N2O emissions from continuous chamber measurements for cotton and wheat systems in Australia, and frequent measurements for alfalfa and grass pastures in North Dakota. Model developers are currently working on implementing a NH3 volatilization sub model. This highlights the need for field data with more complete N gas (N2O, NH3, NOx) data to perform further model development and more rigorous testing.",

            "abstract": "Drill coring at Lake El’gygytgyn (Far East Russia) in 2009 retrieved a 3.6 Ma long sediment core, which is presently the oldest continuous sedimentary record available from the terrestrial Arctic. This unique Plio-Pleistocene record allows for the response of the Arctic to global climate events under a variety of different boundary conditions to be examined. Here we present results of ongoing organic geochemical analyses of Lake El’gygytgyn sediments focusing on the mid-Pliocene warm period, the Plio-Pleistocene transition, the mid-Brunhes transition, and warm Pleistocene interglacial periods including Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5, 9, 11, 19 and 31. Despite the ultra-oligotrophic nature of Lake El'gygytgyn and the generally low sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content, we find abundant branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) throughout the entire record and use the methylation and cyclization indices of branched tetraethers (MBT and CBT, respectively) to reconstruct past temperature (Weijers et al., 2007). We hypothesize that the majority of brGDGTs are produced in the lake during the brief summer period of ice free conditions and that MBT/CBT likely reflects a warm season temperature. Trends noted in the MBT/CBT record are in close agreement with pollen-based temperature estimates throughout the entire core. For example, we note a dramatic ~6°C cooling associated with the mid-Pliocene M2 event and thus far MIS 31 has emerged as the warmest period at Lake El’gygytgyn during the past ~ 1 Ma, corroborating the pollen data. Interestingly, a number of abrupt and relatively short-lived cooling events of 2 to 4°C are noted within several of the particularly warm interglacial periods (e.g. MIS 5e, MIS 11 and MIS 31) and are the subject of ongoing investigation. Overall, application of the MBT/CBT paleothermometer to Lake El’gygytgyn sediments is a highly promising technique for generating a Plio-Pleistocene temperature record from the continental Arctic although a site specific calibration is required before absolute temperature can be reconstructed with confidence from brGDGTs.",

            "abstract": "The rate of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet quadrupled over the last two decades and may be due in part to changes in ocean heat transport to marine-terminating outlet glaciers. Meltwater commonly discharges at the grounding line in these outlet glacier fjords, generating a turbulent upwelling plume that separates from the glacier face when it reaches neutral density. This mechanism is the current paradigm for setting the magnitude of net heat transport in Greenland’s glacial fjords. However, sufficient observations of meltwater plumes are not available to test the buoyancy-driven circulation hypothesis. Here, we use an ocean general circulation model (MITgcm) of the near-glacier field to investigate how plume water properties, terminal height, centerline velocity and volume transport depend on the initial conditions and numerical parameter choices in the model. These results are compared to a hydrodynamic mixing model (CORMIX), typically used in civil engineering applications. Experiments using stratification profiles from the continental shelf quantify the errors associated with using far-field observatons to initialize near-glacier plume models. The plume-scale model results are then integrated with a 3-D fjord-scale model of the Rink Isbrae glacier/fjord system in west Greenland. We find that variability in the near-glacier plume structure can strongly control the resulting fjord-scale circulation. The fjord model is forced with wind and tides to examine how oceanic and atmospheric forcing influence net heat transport to the glacier. ",

            "abstract": "U.S. annual precipitation has increased in recent decades, especially over the Northeast where totals have risen about 15% since 1901. Accompanying this increase in total precipitation have been increases in the frequency and intensity of very heavy rain events. Is this regional wetness a new normal, and furthermore does the upward trend portend even wetter conditions for upcoming decades?\nOne view on the mechanism for these U.S. increases in precipitation is that they are consistent with increasing water vapor in a warmed climate (U.S. National Climate Assessment; Melilo et al. 2014). It remains to be determined if alternate mechanisms could also be operating. To what extent, for instance, could multi-decadal changes in regional U.S. precipitation arise naturally, either via coupled modes of atmosphere-ocean variability or from purely atmosphere-land low frequency variability? Could the sign of recent precipitation change over the Northeast U.S. be consistent with a signal due to global warming, with the magnitude of the increased wetness reflecting mainly a particular phase of internal variability? The issue of fully characterizing the increase in regional U.S. precipitation thus hinges critically on knowing not just the anthropogenic climate change signal but also knowing the statistics of internal variability.\nHere we use very long integrations of atmosphere and coupled atmosphere –ocean models to diagnose statistics in the variability of 20-yr averaged precipitation over a region of the Northeast U.S. that has witnessed substantial recent increases in precipitation. Parallel 2000-yr long equilibrium integrations of the coupled model are diagnosed, one that was subjected to radiative forcing of the late 19th century and the other to radiative forcing of the early 21st century. A large number of samples of 20-yr averaged regional precipitation are analyzed from each to 1) characterize the internally driven decadal-scale climate variability, and 2) to compare the magnitude of that variability to the signal of externally driven mean change. The importance of atmosphere-land only interactions is assessed by comparing with the statistics of 20-yr precipitation variations occurring in a parallel integration of an atmospheric model subjected to the fixed mean SSTs, sea ice, and radiative forcing.",

            "abstract": "Tephras preserved in lake sediments are commonly used to synchronize sedimentary archives of climate and environmental change, and to correlate them with terrestrial environments. They also provide an opportunity to reconstruct explosive volcanic activity, e.g., eruption frequency and tephra dispersal. Although it is known that sedimentary processes may affect the record of tephras in lakes, lake sediments are generally considered as one of the best archives of tephra stratigraphy. The June 2011 eruption of the Cordón Caulle (CC, Chile, 40ºS) offered an ideal opportunity to study the processes affecting tephra deposition in lakes. During the 2011 CC eruption, the prevailing westerly winds transported the erupted pyroclastic material away from Puyehue Lake. Yet, the tephra was identified within the lake with a thickness ranging from 1 cm to >10 cm. This is in contrast with smaller lakes, where tephra thickness was in agreement with ash fall distribution maps. Geomorphological observations and sedimentological analyses provide evidence that the tephra deposited in Puyehue Lake entirely consists of material reworked from the upper watershed, transported by rivers, and distributed by lake currents according to particle size and density. Proximal basins mostly received coarse tephra particles via underflows, while in distal basins the deposits consisted of low amounts of fine-grained particles transported by interflows. Pumice transported by overflows reached most lake basins. These results have important implications for tephrochronology and volcanology. First, they show that lakes do not act as passive tephra traps, and they illustrate how two nearby lakes can contain very distinct tephra records, simply due to the size and orientation of their drainage basins. Second, they show that lakes with large watersheds, such as Puyehue, record many more eruptions than smaller lakes, which only register direct ash falls, leading to very different conclusions regarding the recurrence of volcanic eruptions. Finally, our data show that using lakes with large watersheds for isopach mapping systematically leads to an overestimation of the area affected by ash deposition, and of the volume of erupted tephra. Smaller lakes with limited drainage basins are therefore better suited for volcanological studies.",

            "abstract": "The release and migration of metamorphic fluids from subducting slabs into overlying mantle is widely recognized as a major mechanism in producing arc geochemical signatures and returning fluid-mobile elements to earth’s crust and surface environments. Although the magnitudes of many geochemical fluxes are well constrained, the processes whereby mass transfer occurs in different portions of the subduction system are less well known. Chlorine stable isotopes provide a new perspective on some of these processes: Cl is hydrophilic, but decarbonation reactions favor Cl retention in minerals. Cl also shows less isotopic fractionation than other fluid-sensitive systems and may thus preserve evidence of specific fluid sources and/or fluid mixing events. Detailed studies of sedimentary sequences show that individual beds are isotopically homogeneous but large heterogeneities in δ37Cl exist across beds on a cm to m scale and vary as a function of depositional environment. Compositionally correlative medium-, high-, and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic sequences in the Alps record decreases of 30-50% in Cl contents in the earliest stages of metamorphism, but little change thereafter. No statistically significant change in isotopic composition occurs during prograde metamorphism of individual horizons, and the same large degree of isotopic heterogeneity (up to 6‰) persists throughout the prograde devolatilization history of the rocks. Likewise, analysis of HP/UHP serpentinites and altered oceanic crust show that heterogeneous protolith compositions are preserved during transport to sub-arc depths, despite large-scale devolatilization. However, upward transport of rocks within the subduction channel results in highly localized interaction with isotopically distinct, Cl-bearing fluid packets. Overlying forearc wedge rocks also record heterogeneous and channelized interaction with distinct fluid components with different δ37Cl. Within-layer fluid compartmentalization during continuous devolatilization reactions must thus be reconciled with discontinuous, cross-layer fluid percolation out of the slab and into the wedge. The resulting implications of the chlorine data for recent mechanical models of slab-to-wedge fluid transport will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Among all the physics-based earthquake theories, rate-and-state friction has been one of the most successful in explaining several features of the earthquake cycle. This indicates that the laboratory derived friction laws, although deduced from experiments on centimeter to meter scale rock samples, could also be used to model the behavior of kilometer scale heterogeneous fault systems where earthquakes occur. However, the question of whether the behavior of complex faults could be described with an effective rate-and-state friction law remains poorly addressed. In this framework, the study presented here focuses on fault zones experiencing both aseismic slip and earthquakes, such as the San-Andreas fault. These heterogeneous systems could be approximated by a planar rate-and-state frictional fault between elastic solids, coupling unstable velocity weakening patches and stable velocity strengthening areas (figure). The seismicity generated by such systems is computed numerically, and we show that the different regimes of activity obtained (swarms, major unstable events, continuous activity, regular events) are separated by an effective a-b friction parameter obtained as the spatial average of the steady-state a-b parameter. In order to further investigate what are the relevant effective friction parameters controlling the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous a-b faults, we analyze the transition between the regime of regular activity and the more unstable regime where accelerating swarms develop towards major failures destabilizing the entire fault. We compare in detail the nucleation process of a such major instabilities, to the acceleration of slip on a homogeneous rate-and-state fault. The similarity in the way the two systems accelerate provides a strong evidence that effective rate-and-state friction parameters control the nucleation on a frictionally heterogeneous structure.",

Yet, slow sediment accumulation rates in the main deeper basin of the lake have precluded analysis of the lake's most recent history at high resolution. To obtain a paleoclimate record of the last few millennia at multi-decadal resolution, we obtained five short cores, ranging from 139 to 181 cm in length, from the shallower Wiñaymarka sub-basin of of Lake Titicaca, where sedimentation rates are higher than in the lake's main basin. Selected cores have been analyzed for their geochemical signature by scanning XRF, diatom stratigraphy, sedimentology, and for 14C age dating. A total of 72 samples were 14C-dated using a Gas Ion Source automated high-throughput method for carbonate samples (mainly Littoridina sp. and Taphius montanus gastropod shells) at NOSAMS (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute) with an analytical precision higher than 2%. The method has lower analytical precision compared with traditional AMS radiocarbon dating, but the lower cost enables analysis of a larger number of samples, and the error associated with the lower precision is relatively small for younger samples (< ~8,000 years). A 172-cm-long core was divided into centimeter long sections, and 47 14C dates were obtained from 1-cm intervals, averaging one date every 3-4 cm. The other cores were radiocarbon dated with a sparser sampling density that focused on visual unconformities and shell beds. The high-resolution radiocarbon analysis reveals complex sedimentation patterns in visually continuous sections, with abundant indicators of bioturbated or reworked sediments and periods of very rapid sediment accumulation. These features are not evident in the sparser sampling strategy but have significant implications for reconstructing past lake level and paleoclimatic history.",

Paleomagnetism of the PLV basalts has been investigated since the 1960s, but most of the paleomagnetic datasets are affected by remagnetization due to an extensive mineralization event that affected the PLV flows in the central part of the Keweenaw Peninsula. We report new paleomagnetic data from 74 and 35 PLV lava flows exposed at the eastern tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula and on Isle Royale, respectively. These lava flows represent the uppermost part of the PLV sequence and are much less affected by mineralization and metamorphism than their counterparts in the center of the Keweenaw Peninsula and the older PLV flows. Detailed thermal demagnetization reveals multiple natural remanent magnetization (NRM) components. In addition to a soft, low-temperature NRM component, removed by heating to 350-375°C, two components carried by magnetite were observed. A secondary magnetite component was isolated between ~375 and 525°C. The characteristic component of NRM was isolated between ~525°C and 585°C. The primary origin of this component is supported by positive paleomagnetic field tests. While the magnetite components have the same declination, the primary remanence is characterized by systematically steeper inclinations. The PLV lava flows also reveal a high-temperature NRM component carried by hematite. The direction of the hematite remanence is indistinguishable from that of the primary magnetite component. The new high-quality paleomagnetic pole for the PLV is obtained. We will discuss implications of the new paleomagnetic data for the MCR evolution as well as for the North American apparent polar wander path and plate motion rate at ~ 1.1 Ga.",

            "abstract": "Predicting volcanic activity requires continuous monitoring for signals of magmatic unrest in harsh, often remote environments. BENTO is a next-generation monitoring system, currently in prototype testing, that is highly portable, low-cost, rapidly deployable, and entirely autonomous. Such a system could be used to provide critical monitoring and data collection capabilities during rapid-onset eruptions, or to provide a crude baseline monitor at large numbers of remote volcanoes to 'flag' the onset of unrest so that costlier resources such as specialized instrumentation can be deployed in the appropriate place at the appropriate time. The BENTO 1 (low-rate data) prototype currently comprises off-the-shelf volcanic gas sensors (SO2, CO2, Fl, Cl, and Br), a weather station (temperature, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, humidity, pressure), and telemetry via Iridium modem. In baseline mode, BENTO 1 takes a measurement from all of its sensors every two hours and automatically sends the measurements through Iridium to a server that posts them to a dedicated and customizable web page. The measurement interval and other sensor parameters (pumping time, sensor constants) can be adjusted directly or remotely (through the Iridium network) as needed. Currently, BENTO 1 is deployed at Mt. Etna, Italy; Telica Volcano, Nicaragua, Hengill Volcano, Iceland; and Hekla Volcano, Iceland. The BENTO 2 (high-rate) system is motivated by a need to avoid having to telemeter raw seismic data, which at 20-100 Hz/channel is far too voluminous for cost- and power-effective transmission through satellite networks such as Iridium. Our solution is to regularly transmit only state-of-health information and descriptions of the seismic data (e.g., 'triggered' seismic event rates and amplitudes), rather than the data itself. The latter can be accomplished through on-board data analysis and reduction at the installation site. Currently, it is possible to request specific time segments of raw seismic data from a BENTO 2 through the Iridium network, based on regularly transmitted lists of automated trigger times, allowing verification of any apparent changes in seismic event rate. BENTO 2 prototypes have recently been deployed at Telica Volcano, Nicaragua; and Hekla Volcano, Iceland.",

            "abstract": "Increasing climate variability and extreme weather conditions along with declining trends in both rainfall and temperature represent major risk factors affecting agricultural production and food security in many regions of the world. We identify regions where significant rainfall decrease from 1979-2011 over the entire continent of Africa couples with significant human population density increase. The rangelands of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia in the East African Horn remain one of the world’s most food insecure regions, yet have significantly increasing human populations predominantly dependent on pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livelihoods. Vegetation in this region is characterized by a variable mosaic of land covers, generally dominated by grasslands necessary for agro-pastoralism, interspersed by woody vegetation. Recent assessments indicate that widespread degradation is occurring, adversely impacting fragile ecosystems and human livelihoods. Using two underutilized MODIS products, we observe significant changes in vegetation patterns and productivity over the last decade all across the East African Horn. We observe significant vegetation browning trends in areas experiencing drying precipitation trends in addition to increasing population pressures. We also found that the drying precipitation trends only partially statistically explain the vegetation browning trends, further indicating that other factors such as population pressures and land use changes are responsible for the observed declining vegetation health. Furthermore, we show that the general vegetation browning trends persist even during years with normal rainfall conditions such as 2012, indicating potential long-term degradation of rangelands on which approximately 10 million people depend. These findings have serious implications for current and future regional food security monitoring and forecasting as well as for mitigation and adaptation strategies in a region where population is expected to continue increasing against a backdrop of drying climate trends.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis fundamentally changed the structure of the marine biosphere and the chemistry of Earth’s ocean-atmosphere system. Atmospheric oxygenation, however, was decoupled from the onset of biological O2 production—possibly lagging by as much as half a billion years—and O2 remained low for two billion years following initial O2 accumulation. Although uncertainties remain regarding the fate of biogenic O2 during the Precambrian, it is becoming clear that the consequences of oxygenesis were both spatially and temporally variable. Several lines of evidence support the existence of aerobic ecosystems associated with O2 oases within an otherwise anoxic Archean ocean; however—with notable exceptions—atmospheric O2 remained low enough to severely curtail oxidative weathering processes on long-term average throughout the Archean. During the subsequent Great Oxidation Event (GOE) in the early Paleoproterozoic, atmospheric O2 irreversibly increased above the sensitivity thresholds of several well-established proxies, but the level at which O2 eventually stabilized remains unclear. Consequently, the dynamics of O2 cycling are poorly characterized both before and after the GOE. Nevertheless, recent analytical and numerical results suggest exceptionally low O2 levels that may have favored Archean-style O2 oases in the mid-Proterozoic.\nWe used Fe speciation and trace metal records from Precambrian shales, including data from two new cores that target the 2.7 Ga Roy Hill Shale, to investigate pre- and post- GOE redox heterogeneity in Earth’s surface environments. Fe speciation supports the reconstruction of local marine redox conditions, and, in this context, trace metals can allow glimpses of redox conditions beyond the local environment, which may have throttled the supply of key redox-sensitive trace metals to the ocean. Then, using O2 constraints derived from these inorganic proxies, we use an Earth System model to explore C, O, and nutrient cycling in the late Archean and into the mid-Proterozoic. Although our results allow profound perturbation to several biogeochemical cycles and the climate system as a result of the GOE, we find that the GOE may have had only minor significance for the long-term average O2 content of typical surface seawater in the Proterozoic.",

            "abstract": "This study enhances an energy balance snowmelt model (Utah Energy Balance, UEB) to include the capability to quantify glacier melt. To account for clean and debris covered glaciers, substrate albedo and glacier outlines determined from remote sensing, are taken as inputs. The model uses the surface energy balance to compute the melting of seasonal snow and glacier substrate once the seasonal snow has melted. In this application the model was run over a 360 km2 glacierized watershed, Langtang Khola, in the Nepal Himalaya for a 10-year simulation period starting in water year 2003. The model was run on a distributed mesh of grid cells providing the capability to quantify both timing and spatial variability in snow and glacier melt. The distributed UEB melt model has a relatively high data demand, while the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region is a data-scarce region, a limitation that affects most water resources impact studies in this region. In this study, we determined model inputs from the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and Southern Asia Daily Rainfall Estimate (RFE2) data products. The model estimates that roughly 57% of total surface water input is generated from glacier melt, while snowmelt and rain contribute 34% and 9%, respectively over the simulation period. The melt model provided input to the USGS Geospatial Stream Flow Model (GeoSFM) for the computation of streamflow and produced reasonable streamflow simulations at daily scale with some discrepancies, while monthly and annual scale comparisons resulted in better agreement. The result suggests that this approach is of interest for water resources applications where monthly or longer scale streamflow estimates are needed. Mean annual streamflow was positively correlated with the total annual surface water input. However, mean annual streamflow was not correlated with total annual precipitation, highlighting the importance of energy balance melt calculation, in comparison to just using precipitation when considering streamflow availability. Overall, for a 10-year model run, the water equivalent of snow accumulation is 2.46 m compared to 7.13 m of glacier melt over the basin, suggesting a net loss in glacier mass.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies of oceanic transform faults have assumed that fluid circulation ends when the transition from brittle failure to plastic flow occurs. However, we have identified significant amounts of hydrous minerals in peridotite mylonites from St. Paul’s Rocks, a small set of islets on the St. Paul Transform Fault on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These rocks, which are highly deformed, are interpreted as having originated within the brittle-ductile transition zone. Our analyses show that the peridotites contain syn-deformational amphibole (12% on average) and minor phlogopite. In addition, the mylonites contain cm-scale veins of gabbro that are semi-parallel to foliation, which have been altered to amphibole, sodalite, and scapolite. Microprobe analysis indicates that the amphibole is pargasite, which is relatively rich in Na and Cl and requires temperatures >~700°C to form. In addition, sodalite and scapolite contain Na and Cl as essential elements. Initial stable isotope analysis indicates that δD of the pargasite lies between mantle δD (~70‰) and seawater (0‰).\nBased on our observations, we suggest that melt was introduced into the system either prior to or during deformation. In addition, we propose that either i) the melt was volatile-rich, providing the necessary water to form hydrous phases; or ii) seawater penetrated into the brittle-ductile transition zone by microfracturing, thus providing the necessary water, Na, and Cl to form the phases observed. While the 600°C isotherm is traditionally considered the limit of brittle deformation, this second hypothesis would suggest that seawater can penetrate to greater depths, in agreement with recent seismicity observations from an East Pacific Rise transform fault (McGuire et al., 2012). With additional stable isotope analysis and thermodynamic modeling, we plan to further constrain the source of melt/fluid at St. Paul’s Rocks and thus improve constraints on OTF processes. If seawater is the origin of syn-deformational hydrous phases in peridotite mylonites, our observations suggest that deep penetration of seawater on OTFs may be a pervasive process and possibly integral to deformation in the brittle-ductile transition zone.",

Using whole air sampling and high-precision measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and 97 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we performed an initial survey of air quality in Mecca, its tunnels, and surrounding holy sites during the 2012 Hajj (October 24-27; n = 77). This is the first time such a campaign has been undertaken. Levels of the combustion tracer CO and numerous VOCs were strongly elevated along the pilgrimage route, especially in the tunnels of Mecca, and are a concern for human health. For example CO reached 57 ppmv in the tunnels, exceeding the 30-min exposure guideline of 50 ppmv. Benzene, a known carcinogen, reached 185 ppbv in the tunnels, exceeding the 1-hr exposure limit of 9 ppbv. The gasoline evaporation tracer i-pentane was the most abundant VOC during Hajj, reaching 1200 ppbv in the tunnels. Even though VOC concentrations were generally lower during a follow-up non-Hajj sampling period (April, 2013), many were still comparable to other large cities suffering from poor air quality. Major VOC sources during Hajj included vehicular exhaust, gasoline evaporation, liquefied petroleum gas, and air conditioners. Of the measured compounds, reactive alkenes (associated with gasoline evaporation) and CO showed the strongest potential to form ground-level ozone. Therefore efforts to curb ozone formation likely require dual targeting of both combustive and evaporative fossil fuel sources. However, modeling and other measurements (e.g., nitrogen oxides) are also needed to fully understand Mecca’s oxidative environment. We also present specific recommendations to reduce VOC emissions and exposure in Mecca, and to strengthen air quality monitoring especially in Mecca’s tunnels.",

Drought has large economic impacts and significant environmental and societal effects. Although much research on drought at national, regional, and local scales has been conducted to mitigate drought impacts, still drought claims economic losses estimated at about $8.5 billion per year. One possible reason for such huge losses may be a lack of clear understanding of the characteristics of drought at local scales that the end user can relate to the particular water management constraints of their basin. Sustainable water management alternatives are explored and discussed to mitigate climate-induced drought impacts on western agriculture. Current drought monitoring, forecasting, and outlooks efforts are demonstrated along with visualization and research survey. Future direction for Big Drought research is also highlighted.",

            "abstract": "The role of wildfire in the Rockies continues to be a major concern—especially fire’s effect on water quantity and quality, thus protection of water resources is of great management importance as wildfire occurrence and water needs increase. Since high burn severity wildfires often affect soils, vegetation, and hydrologic processes, fuel treatments are often implemented to reduce the risk of high severity fires. The effects of fuel treatments and wildfire on runoff and sediment yields are often examined separately at the hillslope scale but few studies compare the effects of fuel treatments directly to those of wildfire or allow upscaling effects to the small catchment scale. We studied hillslope scale (0.01 ha) sediment yields and catchment scale (2 to 9 ha) runoff and sediment yields at seven fuel treatment sites and one high severity wildfire site in the northern Rockies. The fuel treatments consisted of thinning or timber harvest followed by low to moderate severity prescribed fire. Mean runoff rates from snowmelt and summer rainfall were often similar between the fuel treatments and wildfire catchments, sediment yields were two to three orders of magnitude higher in the wildfire site than in the fuel treatment sites, and much of the sediment was produced during summer rainfall. Comparing results across scales, sediment yields from the fuel treatments and wildfire sites decreased exponentially with increasing area. These results suggest that fuel treatments that reduce the risk of wildfire do not cause significant erosion.",

In addition, each wavelength is exactly registered in space with every other wavelength observed enabling one to formulate a wide range of auroral, thermospheric and ionospheric products. In this talk we present the SSUSI and GUVI auroral conductance observations. The steps and assumptions in the conductance calculations are described. Typical conductance products are presented. We will also discuss the difference between the conductance and conductivity profile.\nFUV optical instruments record the line-of-sight integrated radiance. The observed intensity depends on the integral along the line of sight of the volume emission. The volume emission rate depends on the flux of energetic electrons, the excitation cross section and the number density of the emitting species. At these wavelengths and for typical energies absorption of the FUV photons along the line of sight is not important. The flux of energetic electrons at any altitude depends on the characteristic or average energy of the energetic electrons at the top of the atmosphere and the atmospheric column and composition of that column traversed by the energetic electrons. These energetic electrons cause local ionization; thus, the volume excitation rate and the local ionization rate are related. In the E-region, ions are in local photochemical equilibrium so it is possible to calculate the height dependent ionization rate of E-region electron density profile which can be expressed in terms of conductivity.\nA montage of SSUSI F16 auroral images is shown in the figure. We currently have 4 DMSP satellites imaging the aurora. The revisit time is about every 15 minutes. The spatial resolution is 8km (native) and 25kmx25km for sensor data records. We can readily resolve structures 25km and smaller with excellent SNR.",

The observed meridional flow is on average poleward in the near-surface layers of the Sun and its amplitude varies with the solar cycle. The meridional circulation plays an important role in dynamo theories. For example, the structure and the strength of the meridional flow might determine the duration of the solar cycle and set the timing of the reversals of the Sun’s polar fields in flux-transport dynamo models. To improve the understanding of the relationship between dynamo and meridional flow, major topics that need to be addressed are the variation of the meridional flow with the solar cycle, its variation with depth, and the meridional flow at high latitudes. I will discuss recent results from helioseismic observations.",

In many cases these maps do reasonably well. However, recent large earthquakes that did great damage in areas predicted to be relatively safe illustrate the need to assess how well these maps are actually performing and how good they need to be to be useful. Economic analysis comparing the cost of mitigation to the expected reduction in loss shows that an inaccurate hazard estimate still is useful as long as it is not too much of an overestimate. Because better hazard forecasts can yield better mitigation policy, we need agreed ways of assessing how well a map performed and thus whether one map performed better than another. The metric implicit in current maps, that during the chosen time interval the predicted ground motion will be exceeded only at a specific fraction of the sites, is useful but permits maps to be nominally successful although they significantly underpredict or overpredict shaking, or to be nominally unsuccessful but do well in terms of predicting shaking. We explore some possible metrics that better measure the effects of overprediction and underprediction and can be weighted to reflect the two differently and to reflect differences in populations and property at risk. Although no single metric alone fully characterizes map behavior, using several metrics can provide useful insight for comparing and improving hazard maps.",

            "abstract": "Lignin mineralization represents a critical flux in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle, yet little is known about mechanisms and environmental factors controlling lignin breakdown in mineral soils. Hypoxia has long been thought to suppress lignin decomposition, yet variation in oxygen (O2) availability in surface soils accompanying moisture fluctuations could potentially stimulate this process by generating reactive oxygen species via coupled biotic and abiotic iron (Fe) redox cycling. Here, we tested the impact of redox fluctuations on lignin breakdown in humid tropical forest soils during ten-week laboratory incubations. We used synthetic lignins labeled with 13C in either of two positions (aromatic methoxyl and propyl Cβ) to provide highly sensitive and specific measures of lignin mineralization not previously employed in soils. Four-day redox fluctuations increased the percent contribution of methoxyl C to soil respiration, and cumulative methoxyl C mineralization was equivalent under static aerobic and fluctuating redox conditions despite lower total C mineralization in the latter treatment. Contributions of the highly stable Cβ to mineralization were also equivalent in static aerobic and fluctuating redox treatments during periods of O2 exposure, and nearly doubled in the fluctuating treatment after normalizing to cumulative O2 exposure. Oxygen fluctuations drove substantial net Fe reduction and oxidation, implying that reactive oxygen species generated during abiotic Fe oxidation likely contributed to the elevated contribution of lignin to C mineralization. Iron redox cycling provides a mechanism for lignin breakdown in soils that experience conditions unfavorable for canonical lignin-degrading organisms, and provides a potential mechanism for lignin depletion in soil organic matter during late-stage decomposition. Thus, close couplings between soil moisture, redox fluctuations, and lignin breakdown provide potential a link between climate variability and the biochemical composition of soil organic matter with important implications for soil C budgets.",

            "abstract": "Rapid warming in the Arctic is associated with important changes to the Arctic water cycle: loss of sea ice, increasing atmospheric humidity, permafrost thaw, and water-induced ecosystem changes. Understanding these complex modern processes is critical to interpreting past hydrologic changes preserved in paleoclimate records and assessing future Arctic changes. Cyclones are a prevalent feature of the Arctic and water vapor isotope ratios during these events provide insights into modern hydrologic processes that help explain past changes to the Arctic water cycle. Here we present continuous measurements of water vapor isotope ratios (δ18O, δ2H, d-excess) in northern Alaska from a 2013 Arctic cyclone event. This cyclone resulted in a sharp d-excess decrease and disproportional δ18O enrichment, indicative of an open Arctic Ocean water vapor source with higher humidity. Past transitions to warmer climates inferred from Greenland ice core records also reveal sharp decreases in d-excess values, hypothesized to represent reduced sea ice extent and an increase in oceanic moisture source to Greenland Ice Sheet precipitation. Thus, measurements of water vapor isotope ratios during an Arctic cyclone provide a critical processed-based explanation, and the first direct confirmation, of relationships previously assumed to govern water isotope ratios during sea ice retreat and increased input of northern ocean moisture into the Arctic water cycle.",

            "abstract": "On July 15, 2004 the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was successfully launched on board of NASA’s EOS-Aura spacecraft. OMI is the first of a new generation of UV/VIS nadir solar backscatter imaging spectrometers, which provides nearly global coverage in one day with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 13 x 24 km2. OMI measures solar irradiance and Earth radiances in the wavelength range of 270 to 500 nm with a spectral resolution of about 0.5 nm. OMI is designed and built by the Netherlands and Finland, and is also a third party mission of ESA.\nThe major step that was made in the OMI instrument compared to its predecessors is the use of 2-dimensional detector arrays (CCDs) in a highly innovative small optical design. These innovations enable the combination of a high spatial resolution and a good spectral resolution with daily global coverage. OMI measures a range of trace gases (O3, NO2, SO2, HCHO, BrO, OClO, H2O), clouds and aerosols. Albeit OMI is already 5 years over its design lifetime, the instrument is still fully operational. The successor of OMI is TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) on the Copernicus Sentinel-5 precursor mission, planned for launch in 2016.\nOMI's unique capabilities rely in measuring tropospheric trace gases with a small footprint and daily global coverage. The unprecedented spatial resolution of the instrument revealed for the first time tropospheric pollution maps on a daily basis with urban scale resolution leading to improved air quality forecasts. The OMI measurements also improve our understanding of air quality and the interaction between air quality and climate change by combining measurements of air pollutants and aerosols. In recent years the data are also used for obtaining high-resolution global emission maps using inverse modelling or related techniques, challenging the bottom-up inventories based emission maps. In addition to scientific research, OMI also contributes to several operational services, including volcanic plume warning systems for aviation, UV forecasts and air quality forecasts.\nIn this presentation an overview will be given of the unique contribution of the OMI instrument to atmospheric composition research from space",

            "abstract": "Data of the strength of Earth’s magnetic field (paleointensity) in the geological past are crucial for understanding the geodynamo. Conventional paleointensity determination methods (e.g., the Thellier-Thellier method) require heating a sample to a high temperature in one or more steps. Consequently, many rocks are unsuitable for these methods due to a heating-induced experimental alteration. Alternative non-heating paleointensity methods are investigated to assess their effectiveness and reliability using synthetic magnetite-bearing samples of multiple grain sizes. Paleointensity was measured from synthetic magnetite-bearing samples using the Pseudo-Thellier, ARM, REM, REMc, REM’, and FORC methods. Natural samples from Lemptégy Volcano, France were also analyzed. For the synthetic samples, the Pseudo-Thellier and ARM methods produced the most accurate results, while for the natural samples only the Pseudo-Thellier method was able to produce a reasonable paleointensity estimate consistent with previous paleointensity data. The Pseudo-Thellier method appears to be the best alternative to the heating-based paleointensity methods.",

            "abstract": "Bursty enhancements of hot electrons (~0.5 to 5 keV) with duration of minutes often occur in the tail magnetosheath. Determining the sources and energization of these hot electrons is important to understanding the coupling of the mangetosheath with the bowshock or magnetosphere. In this study we used the unique simultaneous measurements from the two ARTEMIS probes to investigate the likely source locations, spatial structures, and responsible processes for these hot electron enhancements. The enhancements can be seen at any distances across the magnetosheath, but those closer to the magnetopause more often have magnetosheath density and flow magnitudes decreased to more magnetosphere-like values. From simultaneous measurements of these enhancements with the two probes being on either side of magnetopause or both in the magnetosheath, it is evident that these hot electrons come from the magnetosphere near the current sheet without further energization, and that the enhancements are a result of bursty lateral magnetosphere intrusion into the magnetosheath, with weaker enhancements and smaller changes in the magnetosheath properties further outward from the intrusion. Using simultaneous observations having different separation distances and alignments between the probes, we estimated that a single isolated enhancement can have a thin and elongated structure as narrow as 2 RE wide in the X direction, as long as more than 7 RE in the Y direction, and as thin as 1 RE in the Z direction. From observed correlations between the enhancements seen on the magnetosheath side and magnetosheath intrusion seen on the magnetosphere side, we propose that Kelvin-Helmholtz perturbations at the magnetopause and subsequent magnetosphere-magnetosheath particle mixing due to reconnection or diffusion can plausibly explain the bursty magnetosphere intrusion deep into the magnetosheath and the different decreases of magnetosheath density and flow associated with the hot electron enhancements.",

The fluid’s electrical properties may also change due to dissolution and precipitation reactions with the soil minerals. The temporal and spatial changes of the fluid conductivity have the potential to change the interpretations of near-surface geophysical modeling.\nCrunchflow was used to model the changes in fluid content which occur during infiltration into a simple soil system. A number of modifications were also tested to determine the behavior of more general systems and to determine the usefulness of this type of analysis for real-world locations.\nThe results showed that the reactivity of the local minerals was, not surprisingly, an important parameter in determining the soil fluid conductivity. When reactive minerals were present, equilibrium was quickly established throughout the profile at a higher conductivity than the infiltrating water. When reactive minerals were absent, there were significant spatial and temporal variations which extended over several days before a relatively steady soil fluid conductivity was achieved.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) is formed through the partial decomposition and transformation of plant organic matter (OM) inputs. While much is known about how climate, litter chemistry, and decomposer community composition affect the rate at which plant inputs are decomposed, we argue that mass loss rates are of little importance to long-term net soil C and N balance. Rather, what really matters is the proportion of plant OM inputs that is eventually incorporated into SOM and further stabilized by spatial inaccessibility or through interactions with minerals versus the amount which is mineralized. Above ground plant inputs enter the soil in the form of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and litter fragments, yet we have very little data on those two fluxes and how DOM and litter fragments contribute to SOM formation and stabilization. Through an integrated set of laboratory and modelling work and a long-term field decomposition experiment using 13C and 15N labelled plant OM we are elucidating the controls of DOM versus CO2 production during decomposition and the fate and stabilization of DOM and litter fragments in soil, and soil fragments, to a 20 cm depth. Our work shows that during the early stages of decomposition, a sizable fraction of litter C is lost to the soil in the form of DOM, and that this flux is largely controlled by the initial litter chemistry (i.e., %N and lignocellulose index). This DOM appears to be fast transformed by microbes and to stabilize on mineral particles. Later, most of the litter enters the soil in the form of litter fragments, recovered as light fraction in the soil, where they accumulate, likely due to their chemical recalcitrance. In agreement with the Microbial Efficiency Mineral Stabilization framework we observed the highest litter-C mineral stabilization efficiency during the early stages of decomposition when the most labile litter components are lost.",

These observations illustrate two primary modes (although there are likely others), which we have so far called the European and North American modes after anomalous flux concentrations (lobes) in the late Holocene and historical time average field. Here we explore how mode variations translate into the tangent cylinder. Comparisons of high resolution paleomagnetic records derived from a series of cores retrieved from two Ellesmere Island lakes (Sawtooth Lake, 79º21 N, 83º56 W and Lower Murray Lake, 81°34 N, 69°54 W) with varve based chronologies allow us to define regional PSV and paleointensity (PI) patterns for the last 5kyr. Although Ellesmere Island PSV and PI are distinct from those observed at mid to high latitudes of North America, we observe consistencies in timing with the primary oscillations that at least partially illustrate how variations in the tangent cylinder compare with those at mid-latitudes. We find that Ellesmere Island PIs are weak and VGPs migrate towards the axis of rotation during times when European PIs are strong (European Mode), whereas high North American PIs (North American Mode) are associated with significant changes in Ellesmere Island VGP longitudes. Relative highs in Ellesmere Island PIs are temporally distinct from the timing of the other two. A repeating progression of PI highs are observed, showing than geomagnetic behavior in the tangent cylinder is distinct from, but influenced by large scale oscillations in flux observed at mid to high latitudes.",

They present a direct evidence of the existence of flux ropes in the corona prior to the impulsive phase of eruptions. In order to gain insight into their eruptive behavior and how they get destabilized we need to know their 3D magnetic field structure. We have performed highly data-constrained non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) models over the lifetime of several sigmoidal active regions and more specifically have captured their magnetic field structure around the times of major flares. We present this analysis of one region. We also look at the topology analysis for several sigmoidal regions and we show the probable sites of reconnection and put forward a scenario for eruption. We demonstrate the use of this topology analysis to reconcile the observed eruption features with the standard flare model. Finally, we show a glimpse of how such a NLFFF model of an erupting region can be used to initiate a CME in a global MHD code in an unprecedented realistic manner.",

We hypothesize that this additional dust in the atmosphere can accelerate the climate changes associated with the Heinrich events. To test this hypothesis, experiments are performed with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in which we examine the impact of dust, primarily from the African continent, on North Atlantic sea surface temperature, tropical precipitation, and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Further sensitivity studies are performed with the UVic earth system climate model to evaluate the mechanisms linking dust radiative forcing and the AMOC. Results show that the additional dust cools the North Atlantic surface and weakens the AMOC. Both of these impacts would accelerate the Heinrich event, implying that, indeed, dust may play a role in driving abrupt climate change in the Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Several cyberinfrastructures have emerged for sharing observational data collected at densely sampled and/or highly instrumented field sites. These include the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (HIS), the Critical Zone Observatory Integrated Data Management System (CZOData), the Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA) and EarthChem system, and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS). These systems rely on standard data encodings and, in some cases, standard semantics for classes of geoscience data. Their focus is on sharing data on the Internet via web services in domain specific encodings or markup languages. While they have made progress in making data available, it still takes investigators significant effort to discover and access datasets from multiple repositories because of inconsistencies in the way domain systems describe, encode, and share data. Yet, there are many scenarios that require efficient integration of these data types across different domains. For example, understanding a soil profile’s geochemical response to extreme weather events requires integration of hydrologic and atmospheric time series with geochemical data from soil samples collected over various depth intervals from soil cores or pits at different positions on a landscape. Integrated access to and analysis of data for such studies are hindered because common characteristics of data, including time, location, provenance, methods, and units are described differently within different systems. Integration requires syntactic and semantic translations that can be manual, error-prone, and lossy. We report information requirements identified as part of our work to define an information model for a broad class of earth science data – i.e., spatially-discrete, feature-based earth observations resulting from in-situ sensors and environmental samples. We sought to answer the question: “What information must accompany observational data for them to be archivable and discoverable within a publication system as well as interpretable once retrieved from such a system for analysis and (re)use?” We also describe development of multiple functional schemas (i.e., physical implementations for data storage, transfer, and archival) for the information model that capture the requirements reported here.",

            "abstract": "Existing data and models support a distinction between the hydrodynamics of the brittle upper crust, where topography, permeability contrasts, and magmatic heat sources dominate patterns of flow and externally derived (meteoric) fluids are common, and the ductile lower crust, dominated by devolatilization reactions and internally derived fluids. The permeability structure of the uppermost (~<1 km) crust is highly heterogeneous, and controls include primary lithology, porosity, rheology, geochemistry, and tectonic and time-temperature histories of the rocks. Systematic permeability differences among original lithologies persist to contact-metamorphic depths of 3-10 km, but are not evident at regional-metamorphic depths of 10-30+ km – presumably because, at such depths, metamorphic textures become largely independent of the original lithology. Permeability can vary in time as well as space, and its temporal evolution may be gradual or abrupt: streamflow responses to moderate to large earthquakes demonstrate that dynamic stresses can instantaneously change permeability by factors of up to 20 on a regional scale, whereas a 10-fold decrease in the permeability of a package of shale in a compacting basin may require 107years. Temporal variation is enhanced by strong chemical and thermal disequilibrium; thus lab experiments involving hydrothermal flow in crystalline rocks under pressure, temperature, and chemistry gradients often result in 10-fold permeability decreases over daily to sub-annual time scales. Recent research on enhanced geothermal reservoirs, ore-forming systems, and the hydrologic effects of earthquakes consistently shows that shear dislocation caused by tectonic forcing or fluid injection can increase near-to intermediate-field permeability by factors of 100 to 1000. Nonetheless, considering permeability as static parameter is often a reasonable assumption for low-temperature hydrogeologic investigations with time scales of days to decades.",

Here, we present a brief overview of recent efforts to model the evolution of active region magnetic fields and sunspots over a range of physical conditions and spatial and temporal scales. We will focus on how dynamic, physics-based numerical models can be used to better understand observed relationships between different measures of solar activity as a function of time (e.g., sunspot activity and morphologies, unsigned magnetic flux measured at the photosphere, coronal X-ray emissivity). We will determine whether local physics-based models of active region evolution can be used to better constrain proxies of solar activity such as the sunspot number, which remains the only direct record available to trace the very long-term influence of the solar dynamo on the earth's environment.",

            "abstract": "Although the occurrence of aeolian sands in sedimentary sequences has been widely used as indicators of desert formation or proxies of desert climate, one should be aware that accumulation of aeolian sands does occur along river channels, in lake shores not necessarily associated with arid environment. Our ongoing geomorphological and paleoenvironmental studies in the deserts of northern China reconfirm that formation of sand seas is dependent on not only erodibility (arising from bare surface due to aridity) and wind power but more importantly sand availability related to sediment cycles under interactions between fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian processes. Here we present our ongoing geomorphological and paleoclimatic research on the Late Quaternary landscape and climatic changes in the Taklamkan Desert of northwestern China, the largest sand sea of China in arid zone, and in the Hunshandake Sandy Land at the east part of the Asian mid-latitude desert belt under semiarid climate. We find out that the occurrence of tall sand dunes in the over 300,000 km2 large Taklamakan Sand Sea is closely related to the sites of intensive fluvial sedimentation and convergence zone of surface winds. In the case of Hunshandake, the dunes (although much smaller) mainly occur along the shorelines of the former lake basins, and sediment sources are generally limited because of open hydrological systems in the south and east portions of this desert. The sedimentological and geomorphological records suggest that the climate has changed between arid and less-arid conditions in both of these deserts during Late Quaternary. Under wetter conditions the Taklamakan acts as an important sink of sediments brought by rivers with headwaters in the Tibetan Plateau and Tianshan, while under more arid conditions it acts as an important global sediment source whose dust is transported not only to East Asia and Pacific but also to Greenland ice via westerlies. The Hunshandake has the same pattern of function in global sedimentary cycles but with a much smaller role because of smaller extension and weaker relief energy. The Taklamkan and Hunshandake are potentially ideal laboratories for understanding interactions between global sediments fluxes, climate change, hydrological systems and tectonics.",

            "abstract": "The vulnerability of coastal ecosystems, habitats, and infrastructure is largely dictated by how protective sand dunes respond to extreme waves and water levels during storms. Predicting the type of dune response (e.g., scarping, overwashing, breaching) is often done with conditional storm-impact scale models (e.g. Sallenger 2000) however, these models do not describe the magnitude of expected changes or account for the continuum of dune responses throughout the duration of a storm event. Alternatively, process-based dune erosion models like XBeach explicitly compute interactions between waves, water levels, and sediment transport but are limited in regional applications due to computational requirements and inadequate knowledge of required boundary conditions.\nUsing historical observations of storm-induced coastal change, we are developing and testing a variety of new static, probabilistic, and time-dependent models for dune erosion. Model development is informed by the observed dune response from four events that impacted geomorphically diverse regions along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines. Results from the static models indicate that alongshore differences in the magnitude of dune elevation change can be related to the depth of water over of the dune crest (e.g. freeboard) but that increasing freeboard does not always correspond to an increased lowering of the dune crest. Applying the concept of dune freeboard in a time-dependent approach that incorporates rising water levels that cause a dune to sequentially experience collision, overwash and then inundation shows that reasonable estimates of dune erosion are obtained. The accuracy of each of the models is now being evaluated along the large and diverse regions of coast that were impacted by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 where dune response was highly variable.",

            "abstract": "In the effort to explain the lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations observed during ice ages, two of the first hypotheses involved redistributing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) within the ocean. Broecker (1982) proposed a strengthening of the ocean’s biological pump during ice ages, which increased the dissolved inorganic carbon gradient between the dark, voluminous ocean interior and the surface ocean’s sun-lit, wind-mixed layer. Boyle (1988) proposed a deepening in the ocean interior’s pool of DIC associated with organic carbon regeneration, with its concentration maximum shifting from intermediate to abyssal depths. While not irrefutable, evidence has arisen that these mechanisms can explain much of the ice age CO2 reduction and that both were activated by changes in the Southern Ocean. In the Antarctic Zone, reduced exchange of water between the surface and the underlying ocean sequestered more DIC in the ocean interior (the biological pump mechanism). Dust-borne iron fertilization of the Subantarctic surface lowered CO2 partly by the biological pump mechanism and partly by Boyle’s carbon deepening. Each mechanism owes a part of its CO2 effect to a transient increase in seafloor calcium carbonate dissolution, which raised the ice age ocean’s alkalinity, causing it to absorb more CO2. However, calcium carbonate cycling also sets limits on these mechanisms and their CO2 effects, such that the combination of Antarctic and Subantarctic changes is needed to achieve the full (80-100 ppm) ice age CO2 decline. Data suggest that these changes began at different phases in the development of the last ice age, 110 and 70 ka, respectively, explaining a 40 ppm CO2 drop at each time. We lack a robust understanding of the potential causes for both the implied reduction in Antarctic surface/deep exchange and the increase in Subantarctic dust supply during ice ages. Thus, even if the evidence for these Southern Ocean changes were to become incontrovertible, conceptual gaps stand in the way of a theory of glacial cycles that includes Southern Ocean-driven CO2 change. There are more compelling proposals for the causes of deglacial change, with a sharp reduction in North Atlantic deep water formation implicated as a trigger of increased surface/deep exchange in the Antarctic and the resulting release of CO2 to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The effect of clouds on climate remains the largest uncertainty in climate change predictions, due to the inability of global climate models (GCMs) to resolve essential small-scale cloud and convection processes. We compare pre-industrial and quadrupled CO$_2$ simulations between a conventional GCM in which convection is parameterized and a ``super-parameterized'' model in which convection is explicitly simulated with a cloud permitting model in each grid cell. We find that the global responses of the two models to increased CO2 are broadly similar: both simulate ice-free Arctic summers, winter-time Arctic convection, and enhanced MJO activity. Super-parameterization produces significant differences at both CO2 levels, including greater Arctic cloud cover, further reduced sea ice area at high CO2, and a stronger increase with CO2 of the Madden-Julian oscillation.\nThe representation of clouds and convection has an enormous impact on simulation of the climate system. This study addresses concerns that conventional parameterizations may bias the response of climate models to increased greenhouse gases. The broadly similar response of two models with parameterized and non-parameterized convection and clouds suggests that state-of-the-art predictions, based on parameterized climate models, may not necessarily be strongly biased in either direction (too strong or too weak warming). At the same time, large differences in simulated tropical variability and Arctic sea ice area suggest that improvement in convection and cloud representations remain essential.",

            "abstract": "How magnetic energy and flux emerges from the turbulent convective interior of the Sun into the solar atmosphere is of great importance to a number of challenging problems in solar physics. With the wealth of data from missions such as SDO, Hinode, and IRIS, it is evident that the dynamic interaction of magnetic structures at the photosphere and in the solar atmosphere occurs over a vast range of spatial and temporal scales. Emerging active regions often develop magnetic connections to other regions of activity some distance away on the solar disk, and always emerge into a global coronal field whose structural complexity is a function of the solar cycle. Yet even small-scale dynamic interactions (e.g., processes at granular or supergranular scales in the photosphere) can trigger rapid changes in the large-scale coronal field sufficient to power eruptive events such as coronal mass ejections, or solar flares. The challenge of modeling this system in its entirety is that the magnetic field not only spans multiple scales, but also regions whose physical conditions vary dramatically. We will summarize recent progress in the effort to dynamically model the upper convection zone-to-corona system over large spatial scales, and will present the latest results from a new, global radiative-MHD model of the upper convection zone-to-corona system, RADMHD2S. We will characterize the flux of electromagnetic energy into the solar atmosphere as flux systems of different scales dynamically interact, and discuss how physics-based models of the convection zone-to-corona system can be used to guide the development and testing of data-driven models.",

            "abstract": "The sulfur isotopic compositions of sulfide minerals preserved in the rock record are widely used in reconstructions of past ocean and atmospheric chemistry, but little is known about how syn- and post-depositional processes may affect these compositions. Furthermore, recent discoveries of pyrite more enriched in 34S than coeval sulfate in the rock record (e.g., Ries et al., 2009) and in modern deltaic sediments (e.g., Aller et al., 2010) have indicated a need to develop a better understanding of the controls on isotopic fractionation during sulfur cycling in natural environments. Here, we report the results of a controlled laboratory experiment designed to simulate the repeated oxidative reworking of sediments using a series of sediment columns constructed with bulk carbonate mud from Florida Bay, Florida. A rapid decline in [H2S] was observed in reworked sediments during the first 12 weeks of the experiment. Decreases in the δ34S of sulfide phases and increases in Δ34SSO4-H2S (i.e., the difference between the δ34S of sulfate, δ34SSO4, and that of hydrogen sulfide, δ34SH2S, at a given depth) were also documented across all columns. These results indicate a decline in labile organic matter concentrations within the sediments and a corresponding decrease in MSR rates with time. Complete reoxidation did not generate superheavy pyrite in this study, but did stimulate biological activity through the generation of sharp redox boundaries. Partial oxidation of aqueous sulfide and an associated increase in residual δ34SH2S must thus be key if oxidation itself is important to superheavy pyrite formation. These findings further suggest that organic matter lability may have played a more fundamental role than [SO42-] in regulating MSR fractionation throughout Earth history and provide motivation for future research.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the links between environmental change and sediment transport in the mega-rivers that dominate the flux of terrestrial sediment to the oceans remains a major challenge. Many large river systems display significant seasonality in flow regime, which is affected to a greater or lesser degree by the influence of large tropical storms, which act to increase their variability and thus drive uncertainty in predicting the impacts associated with changes in future flow regimes. Here we quantify the significance of tropical storms in driving sediment flux from one of the world’s largest rivers, the Mekong. Data was collected at Kratie, Cambodia; this being the site of the Mekong’s final reliable flow gauging station before the Mekong delta. Suspended sediment fluxes were estimated by calibrating acoustic backscatter returns from an acoustic Doppler current profiler to observed suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) across a monsoon cycle. The retrieved SSCs were combined with flow velocity estimates to recover the sediment flux. These estimates of flux were then used to build sediment rating curves, taking account of hysteresis effects associated with sediment starvation on the falling limb of the Mekong’s flood pulse, to predict suspended flux as a function of flow discharge. The derived sediment rating curves were then employed in an effective discharge analysis, initially using gauged flows, which include the effects of tropical storms, for the period 1981-2013. A hydrological model was then used to estimate daily discharge values for the same historical period, but for a scenario in which the effects of tropical storms on the flow regime are isolated. This was achieved by forcing the hydrological model with daily precipitation values that account for precipitation anomalies associated with observed tropical storms. The difference in cumulative sediment transport estimated by combining the two flow discharge scenarios with the constructed sediment rating curves allowed the contribution of tropical storms to the Lower Mekong’s suspended sediment transport regime to be isolated. This paper will outline the details of the methods employed and discuss the implications of the finding regarding the influence of the monsoon-tropical storm system in effluxing sediment to the Mekong delta.",

Particular focus is placed on how the existence of and interactions between three MJO events, 10 Kelvin waves (KWs), and the diurnal cycle impact convective system properties. For example, the average MJO characteristics were generally consistent with past studies, although an increase in deep convective rain and echo tops appeared to precede relative humidity increases at low- to middle-levels. MJO convective organization was also impacted by deep tropospheric wind shear. The active and developing MJO KWs produced more rain and cloud than suppressed MJO KWs and had a secondary peak in stratiform rain potentially associated with subsynoptic-scale cloud clusters. The diurnal cycle of rain was also more pronounced during the active MJO. The suppressed MJO KW composite displayed previously documented structure of vertical moisture buildup prior to the KW passage, whereas the developing and active MJO KWs did not. Upper level moisture was enhanced after KW passages, regardless of MJO phase. However, upper level moisture was most enhanced after the developing MJO KW passage, providing deep tropospheric moisture that may have assisted MJO onset. Non-precipitating upper level cloud and midlevel altocumulus/altostratus also persisted after most KW passages with potential radiative impacts.",

            "abstract": "The standard approach to modeling injection-induced seismicity (IIS) considers Coulomb failure stress changes accounting only for pore-pressure changes, which are solved by the diffusion equation. However, this “diffusion” triggering mechanism is not comprehensive. Lab experiments indicate earthquake nucleation also depends on stress history. Here we add two effects in modeling IIS: 1) poro-elastic coupling between solid stresses and pore-pressure, and 2) time dependent earthquake nucleation under applied stresses.\nIn this model, we compute stress and pore-pressure changes due to a point source injecting in a homogeneous, poro-elastic full space (Rudnicki, 1986). The Coulomb stress history is used to compute seismicity rate changes based on the time-dependent nucleation model of Dieterich (1994). Our new model reveals: 1) poro-elastic coupling breaks the radial symmetry in seismicity, 2) nucleation introduces a characteristic nucleation time ta, which affects the temporal evolution of seismicity rates, and 3) for some fault geometries, the seismicity rate may increase following shut in.\nFor constant injection flux, the log of seismicity rate scales with the change in Coulomb stress at short time, consistent with diffusion profiles. At longer time, the model predicts seismicity rates decaying with time, consistent with some observations. The contour shape and decay time are characterized by ta. For finite injection with box-car flux history, seismicity rates plummet near the injector, but may continue for some time at greater distance. Depending on fault orientations, seismicity rates may increase after shut-in due to coupling effects. It has been observed in some cases that the maximum magnitude of induced quakes occurs after shut-in. This may be understood by the fact that the volume of perturbed crust increases with injection time, which influences probability of triggering an event of a given magnitude. Whether coupling effects are important in post shut-in behavior is unknown, however we show that gradually decreasing injection flux can eliminate the post shut-in seismicity increase.",

            "abstract": "During 18 years since the deployment of K-NET following the Kobe earthquake, our attention has mainly focused on rapidity of the data collection and an unfailing and reliable observation. In this presentation, we review three generations of the instruments employed by K-NET and KiK-net from these two points of view.\nAt beginning of the 2000’s, we newly developed the second generation instruments (K-NET02, K-NET02A, KiK-net06) to replace the first generation instruments (K-NET95, SMAC-MDK) employed when the networks were constructed in the 1990’s. These instruments have an automatic dial-out function. It takes typically 2–5 s to establish communication and a few seconds to send the pre-trigger data. After that, data is available typically within a 1.5 s delay. Not only waveform data but also strong motion indexes such as real-time intensity, PGA, PGV, PGD, and response spectra are continuously sent once a second.\nAfter the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, we have developed the third generation instruments (K-NET11, KiK-net11) and have replaced almost half of the all stations country wide. Main improvement of this instrument is more unfailing and reliable observation. Because we have often experienced very large ground motions (e.g. 45 records exceeding gravity), the maximum measureable range was expanded from 2000 gal to 4000 gal for the second generation instrument, and to 8000 gal for the third. For the third generation instrument, in case of power failure, observation (including transmission of data) works for seven days thanks to the backup battery, while for the second generation instruments it works only for one day. By adding an oblique component to the three-component accelerometers, we could automatically distinguish shaking data from noise such as electric pulses which may cause a false alarm in EEW. Implementation to guarantee the continuity of observation under severe conditions such as during the Tohoku earthquake is very important, as well as a highly efficient observation.\nOwning to the drastic progress of information technologies, continuous observation has become technically and economically feasible and some of stations are experimentally equipped with a continuous communication line. Continuous observation offers very important information to help mitigating ongoing earthquake disasters.",

            "abstract": "The 11 March 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami caused widespread devastation to coastal communities in Japan. This event however was merely the latest in a long line of similar occurrences throughout the Pacific over time. All the recent large tsunamis have had their predecessors, and a growing database of palaeotsunamis in the Pacific suggests that several past events have been either similar in magnitude or greater than their historical counterparts. Not only are we gathering data concerning Pacific palaeotsunamis but we are also identifying contemporaneous punctuated histories of changing human settlement patterns across the Pacific. In particular, the almost two millennia ‘long pause’ in eastward Polynesian migration and the abandonment of long distance sea-voyaging in the 15th century. It is suggested that large palaeotsunamis and their generating mechanisms forced major societal responses.\nGiven the unquestioned impacts of recent tsunamis on human societies, it is reasonable to suggest that past societal responses can be used as proxies for contemporaneous environmental forcing in those parts of the world where independent evidence of the effects of these events is still being gathered. In the Pacific there are a range of responses that extend well beyond the abandonment of long distance sea-voyaging such as the outbreak of region-wide conflict and the associated abandonment of settlements in exposed (coastal) locations. The contemporaneity of these effects across a vast region requires a driver that is external to particular island groups. Given that this must have impacted coastal resources severely and enduringly, the only possibility is that this driver was of oceanic origin. This hypothesis is compelling when considered alongside the growing database of more conventional lines of evidence. The question therefore is how well are similar threshold responses recognised throughout the World? Are there similar region-wide responses that have been pigeonholed under the more prosaic interpretations of archaeological dogma?",

Traversing through a diverse climatic regime across the Plain and through precipitation zones ranging from 600 mm/year near Delhi to 1200 mm/year in the eastern plains, the Ganga River system has formed very diverse landform assemblages in its major domains that include a) hinterlands, b) northern Plain, c) southern Plain, d) main valley system, e) interfluve systems, and f) major tributaries. Using satellite images, mapping of the Ganga River channel belt and its active floodplain from Gangotri (source) to Farakka (upstream of its confluence with the Brahmaputra) has brought out extreme diversity in channel form, active floodplain and valley margin characteristics, and reach-scale fluvial processes.\nFollowing a modified River Style Framework, we have recognized a total of 10 different river styles for the trunk river from Gangotri to Farakka based on a) landscape setting, b) channel and active floodplain properties, and c) channel planform parameters. The mountainous stretch is characterized by steep valleys and bedrock channels, and is dominated by large-scale sediment production and transport through hill slope processes. The alluvial part of the river is characterized by 8 different styles of varying reach lengths (60-300 km) many of which show sharp transitions in landscape setting e.g. from piedmont to valley-interfluve and from alluvial to craton margin. Each river style in the alluvial reaches has a distinctive set of morphological parameters primarily driven by the dominant fluvial process operating in that stretch such as channel instability and river dynamics, channel incision or aggradation and frequent flooding. Our study has provided a physical template for characterizing the complexity of a large river system and for reach-scale geomorphic assessment of river health, which is the first step towards developing ecology-based river management strategy.",

            "abstract": "Climate change vulnerability depends upon various factors and differs between places, sectors and communities. People in developing countries whose subsistence livelihood depends upon agriculture and livestock are identified as particularly vulnerable. Nepal, where the majority of people are in a mixed agro-livestock system, is identified as the world’s fourth most vulnerable country to climate change. However, there are few studies on how vulnerable mixed agro-livestock smallholders are and how their vulnerability differs across different ecological regions. This study aims to test two vulnerability assessment indices, livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and IPCC vulnerability index (VI-IPCC), around the Gandaki river basin of Nepal. A total of 543 households practicing mixed agro-livestock were surveyed from three districts (Dhading, Syangja and Kapilvastu) representing the mountain, mid-hill and lowland altitudinal belts respectively. Data on socio-demographics, livelihoods, social networks, health, food and water security, natural disasters and climate variability were collected. Both indices differed across the three districts, with mixed agro-livestock smallholders of Dhading district found to be the most vulnerable and that of Syangja least vulnerable. This vulnerability index approach may be used to monitor rural vulnerability and/or evaluate potential program/policy effectiveness in poor countries like Nepal. The present findings are intended to help in designing intervention strategies to reduce vulnerability of mixed agro-livestock smallholders and other rural people in developing countries to climate change.",

These datasets include grids of annual extremes indices to investigate changes in frequency, intensity and duration of extreme temperature events, and daily temperature grids to relate the changes in extremes to changes in the distribution function.\nResults show widespread and consistent changes in temperature extremes indices that are consistent with warming and include more frequent occurrence of warm days and nights, increased maximum temperatures and longer warm spell duration, for example. Similarly, observations show general changes towards less frequent and less intense cold extremes. These changes are consistent across multiple observational datasets including reanalyses.\nEmpirical probability distributions of daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures show significant shifts towards warmer conditions in almost all regions of the globe with sufficient observational coverage and globally. These shifts are stronger for daily minimum (i.e., night-time) temperatures. Changes in variance differ between regions but are generally not significant locally and no variance changes can be detected in the global distributions. Large regions show slight increases in skewness. In summary, shifts in the mean temperatures appear to be the dominant contribution to increased occurrence of hot extremes globally, while changes in higher statistical moments are less clear.",

            "abstract": "Water weakening is a well-known phenomenon which can lead to subsidence during the production of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The example of the Ekofisk oil field in the North Sea has been well documented for years. In order to assess water weakening effects in reservoir rocks, previous studies have focused on changes in the failure envelopes derived from mechanical tests conducted on rocks saturated either with water or with inert fluids. However, little attention has been paid so far on the mechanical behaviour during the fluid injection stage, like in enhanced oil recovery operations.\nWe studied the effect of fluid injection on the mechanical behaviour of Sherwood sandstone, a weakly-consolidated sandstone sampled at Ladram Bay in UK. In order to highlight possible weakening effects, water and inert oil have been injected into critically-loaded samples to assess their effect on strength and elastic properties and to derive the acoustic signature of the saturation front for each fluid. The specimens were instrumented with 16 ultrasonic P-wave transducers for both passive and active acoustic monitoring during fluid injection and loading.\nAfter conducting standard triaxial tests on three samples saturated with air, water and oil respectively, mechanical creep tests were conducted on dry samples loaded at 80% of the compressive strength of the dry rock. While these conditions are kept constant, a fluid is injected at the bottom end of the sample with a low back pressure (0.5 MPa) to minimize effective stress variations during injection. Both water and oil were used as the injected pore fluid in two experiments. As soon as the fluids start to flow into the samples, creep is taking place with a much higher strain rate for water injection compared to oil injection. A transition from secondary creep to tertiary creep is observed in the water injection test whereas in the oil injection test no significant creep acceleration is observed after one pore volume of oil was injected. The most remarkable difference is that water injection induces mechanical instability and failure, whereas oil injection does not. This was confirmed by the analysis of acoustic emissions activity and post-mortem sample imaging using CT scan. Contrasting evolutions of the P wave velocity during the fluid front propagation were also observed in both experiments.",

            "abstract": "High energy coastal events, such as tsunamis, commonly leave sediment deposits in the landscape that may be preserved in the geological record. A set of anomalous sand and silt layers intercalated between soil units was identified alongside an estuary in Okains Bay, Banks Peninsula, New Zealand. Okains Bay, comprised of a coastal plain of Holocene progradational dune ridges, was flooded by tsunamis in 1868 and 1960. Previous research has assessed the relationship between tsunami flow patterns and sediment deposits for recent events, and we aim to extend this application to older deposits where flow patterns were not recorded and sedimentary structures are not visually apparent. A multi-proxy approach was used to investigate the sediment deposits at twelve sites along a 2 km length of the estuary margin and map inundation patterns. Measurements of Magnetic Fabric (MF: Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) were used to determine the flow direction during deposition, alongside stratigraphy and particle size analyses to assess wave energy. Flow direction results were overlaid on a digital elevation model of the study site to interpret flow patterns. Deposits became thinner and particle size decreased with distance from the coast, indicating waning flow energy with distance inland. MF results indicate that inundation occurred via the estuary channel, with primary flow directions oriented perpendicular or sub-perpendicular to the channel at each site. On a smaller scale, results showed evidence of current reversal at some sites, with flow directed alternately away from and towards the estuary channel. This is consistent with uprush and backwash patterns observed in tsunami wave sequences. Topographic control of flow patterns is also evident from the data. This research demonstrates a method for investigating older, structurally-degraded deposits and has implications for the reconstruction of paleotsunami inundation from their sedimentary deposits.",

Energetic particles are part of this puzzle and help understand the various driving forces and energy release processes in the solar corona. The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) will determine how the Sun energizes particles to very high energies and sometimes fills the heliosphere with particle radiation. It consists of a suite of sensors which will measure protons (electrons) from 3 (2) keV up to 100 (20) MeV and ions from few tens of keV/nuc to 200 MeV/nuc. We will discuss the scientific aims of EPD as well as the current status and calibration of the EPD sensor (STEP, EPT, SIS, HET).",

            "abstract": "In arid and semi-arid areas, plant growth and productivity are obviously affected by soil water and salinity. But it is not easy to acquire the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water and salinity by traditional field methods because of the heterogeneity in their patterns. Electromagnetic induction (EMI), for its rapid character, can provide a useful way to solve this problem. Grassland dominated by Achnatherum splendens is an important ecosystem near the Qinghai-Lake watershed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northwestern China. EMI surveys were conducted for electrical conductivity (ECa) at an intermediate habitat scale (a 60×60 m experimental area) of A. splendens steppe for 18 times (one day only for one time) during the 2013 growing season. And twenty sampling points were established for the collection of soil samples for soil water and salinity, which were used for calibration of ECa. In addition, plant species, biomass and spatial patterns of vegetation were also sampled. The results showed that ECa maps exhibited distinctly spatial differences because of variations in soil moisture. And soil water was the main factor to drive salinity patterns, which in turn affected ECa values. Moreover, soil water and salinity could explain 82.8% of ECa changes due to there was a significant correlation (P<0.01) between ECa, soil water and salinity. Furthermore, with higher ECa values closer to A. splendens patches at the experimental site, patterns of ECa images showed clearly temporal stability, which were extremely corresponding with the spatial pattern of vegetation. A. splendens patches that accumulated infiltrating water and salinity and thus changed long-term soil properties, which were considered as “reservoirs” and were deemed responsible for the temporal stability of ECa images. Hence, EMI could be an indicator to locate areas of decreasing or increasing of water and to reveal soil water and salinity dynamics through repeated ECa surveys.",

            "abstract": "Anticipating farmers’ irrigation decisions can provide the possibility of improving the efficiency of canal operations in on-demand irrigation systems. Although multiple factors are considered during irrigation decision making, for any given farmer there might be one factor playing a major role. Identification of that biophysical factor which led to a farmer deciding to irrigate is difficult because of high variability of those factors during the growing season. Analysis of the irrigation decisions of a group of farmers for a single crop can help to simplify the problem. We developed a hidden Markov model (HMM) to analyze irrigation decisions and explore the factor and level at which the majority of farmers decide to irrigate. The model requires observed variables as inputs and the hidden states. The chosen model inputs were relatively easily measured, or estimated, biophysical data, including such factors (i.e., those variables which are believed to affect irrigation decision-making) as cumulative evapotranspiration, soil moisture depletion, soil stress coefficient, and canal flows. Irrigation decision series were the hidden states for the model. The data for the work comes from the Canal B region of the Lower Sevier River Basin, near Delta, Utah. The main crops of the region are alfalfa, barley, and corn. A portion of the data was used to build and test the model capability to explore that factor and the level at which the farmer takes the decision to irrigate for future irrigation events. Both group and individual level behavior can be studied using HMMs. The study showed that the farmers cannot be classified into certain classes based on their irrigation decisions, but vary in their behavior from irrigation-to-irrigation across all years and crops. HMMs can be used to analyze what factor and, subsequently, what level of that factor on which the farmer most likely based the irrigation decision. The study shows that the HMM is a capable tool to study a process which is not memory-less like irrigation behavior.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have reported relationships between mean annual climatic variables and mean annual leaf area index (LAI), but the seasonal and spatial variability of this relationship for different vegetation cover types in different climate zone have rarely been explored in Australia. We developed simple models using remotely-sensed LAI data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and gridded climatic data from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP). We were able to relate seasonal and annual leaf area index of three different land cover types (tree, pasture and crop) with climatic variables for the period 2000 to 2009 in the Goulbourn-Broken catchment, Australia. Strong relationships were obtained between annual leaf area index of crop, pasture and tree with annual precipitation (R2 =0.70, 0.65 and 0.82), respectively. Monthly LAI of each land cover types also showed strong (R2 = 0.92, 0.95 and 0.95) relationship with the difference between precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration (P-PET) for crop, pasture and tree respectively. Independent model calibration and validation showed good agreement with remotely sensed MODIS LAI. The results from application of the developed model on future impact of climate change suggest that under all climate scenarios crop, pasture and tree showed consistent decreases in mean annual LAI. For the future climate scenarios considered, crop showed a decline of between 7 to 38%, pasture 5 to 24% and tree 2 to 11% from the historical mean annual. These results can be used to assess the impacts of future climatic and land cover changes on water resources by coupling them with hydrological models.",

            "abstract": "Although long debated, the timing of Andean uplift and establishment of a continuous topographic barrier along western South America remains critical to biogeographic assessments of the influence of mountain uplift and erosion on Neotropical biodiversity. Recent methodological advances allow independent geologic estimates of barrier uplift and river drainage shifts that can be compared with molecular-clock calculations of genetic divergence times for various Andean and Amazonian populations. Emerging results from U-Pb geochronology and stable-isotope paleoaltimetry suggest a nearly continuous western barrier since the late Eocene-Oligocene and a complex yet decipherable Miocene–Quaternary history of eastward advancing Andean deformation, upper-crustal erosion, and foreland-directed fluvial transport. In the central Andes, U-Pb ages for detrital zircon minerals from multiple sedimentary basins suggest continuous contributions of Cenozoic-age volcanic detritus from the Western Cordillera since late Eocene-Oligocene time. Hydrogen stable isotopic signatures from volcanic glasses further suggest that the long-lived Western Cordillera magmatic arc attained modern elevations by 19-16 Ma in southern Peru. In the northern Andes, major shifts in detrital age signatures, sandstone compositions, and sediment dispersal for hinterland basins of southern Colombia and Ecuador record punctuated 12-6 Ma uplift of the Eastern Cordillera fold-thrust belt. This eastward advance of deformation helped establish the modern Amazon, Magdalena, and Orinoco river drainage systems, terminating any significant west-directed sediment transport and likely explaining late Miocene vicariance events among taxa of the northern Andes, western forearc slope, and Amazonian foreland basin.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation dynamics and soil surface processes (e.g. runoff, soil erosion, sedimentation) are tightly coupled in drylands, where vegetation cover is patchy and plant production largely depends on favourable redistribution of water and sediments. At the same time, the amount and spatial distribution of vegetation control hillslope runoff and erosion, and strongly influence the redistribution of water and soil resources in these systems. Large shifts in the structure and organization of vegetation are associated with land degradation, frequently involving nonlinear responses to both human and climatic pressures. The study of landform-water-vegetation feedbacks has, therefore, a critical role for the comprehension of ecosystem stability and restoration potential in arid and semiarid environments. We present a synthesis of field-based, remote-sensed and modelling studies on soil-vegetation patterns in semiarid rangelands of Australia and water-restricted reclaimed mining slopes of Spain. Our results indicate that the organization and stability of vegetation patterns strongly depends on feedbacks with coevolving landforms. Exploration of degradation trends in banded Mulga shrublands of central Australia reveals that human disturbances (e.g. grazing) can strongly alter landform-water-vegetation feedbacks and particularly the way water is spatially redistributed and used by vegetation, resulting in threshold-like responses of ecosystem function. Successful experiences on the restoration of these systems highlight that the management of runoff and sediment flows is decisive to recover vegetation patchiness and landscape function. The study of vegetation-water-landform feedbacks in Mediterranean-dry reclaimed mining slopes of Spain offers additional indications on the restoration of drylands, particularly on the effects of rill and gully erosion on the stability of restored vegetation. The development of rill and gully networks provides very efficient drainage networks for the routing of water and sediments, which drastically reduce the availability of resources for plant production and ultimately can cause irreversible ecosystem changes.",

            "abstract": "Dramatic changes are taking place throughout the Arctic. Many glaciers have already melted away completely, and most others are well on their way as rising snowline elevations promise continued glacier retreat. Emerging from beneath retreating glacier margins is a landscape rich in information about past climate and glacier changes. Within newly exposed bedrock is an inventory of cosmogenic nuclides that archive past ice cover timing and duration. Lake basins re-appearing due to retreating ice preserve sediment archives that tell of cooling climate and advancing ice. And ancient surfaces vegetated with tundra communities that have long been entombed beneath frozen-bedded ice caps are now being revealed for the first time in millennia. This presentation will focus on the climate and glacier record derived from radiocarbon dating of in situ moss recently exhumed from retreating local ice cap margins on western Greenland. Dozens of radiocarbon ages from moss group into several distinct modes, which are interpreted as discrete times of persistent summer cooling and resultant glacier expansion. The data reveal a pattern of glacier expansion beginning ~5000 years ago, followed by periods of glacier growth around 3500 and 1500 years ago. Because these times of glacier expansion are recorded at many sites in western Greenland and elsewhere in the Arctic, they are interpreted as times of step-wise summer cooling events during the Holocene. These non-linear climate changes may be a result of feedbacks that amplify linear insolation forcing of Holocene climate. In addition to these insights into the Arctic climate system, the antiquity of many radiocarbon ages of ice-killed moss indicate that many arctic surfaces are being re-exposed for the first time in millennia due to retreating ice, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of current summer warming.",

            "abstract": "Coastal fluvial delta morphodynamics are prominently controlled by external fluvial sediment and water supplies; however, internal sediment-water-vegetation feedbacks are now being proposed as potentially equally significant in organizing and maintaining the progradation and aggradation of such systems. The time scales of fluvial and climate influences on these feedbacks, and of their responses, are also open questions. Historical remote sensing study of the Wax Lake Delta model system (Louisiana, USA) revealed trends in the evolution of the subaerial island surfaces from a non-systematic arrangement of elevations to a discrete set of levees and intra-island platforms with distinct vegetation types, designated as high marsh, low marsh, and mudflat habitat. We propose that this elevation zonation is consistent with multiple stable state theory, e.g. as applied to tidal salt marsh systems but not previously to deltas. According to zonally-distributed sediment core analyses, differentiation of island elevations was not due to organic matter accumulation as in salt marshes, but rather by differential mineral sediment accumulation with some organic contributions. Mineral sediment accumulation rates suggested that elevation growth was accelerating or holding steady over time, at least to date in this young delta, in contrast to theory suggesting rates should slow as elevation increases above mean water level. Hydrological analysis of island flooding suggested a prominent role of stochastic local storm events in raising island water levels and supplying mineral sediment to the subaerial island surfaces at short time scales; over longer time scales, the relative influences of local storms and inland/regional floods on the coupled sediment-water-vegetation system of the subaerial delta island surfaces remain the subject of ongoing study. These results help provide an empirical foundation for the next generation of coupled sediment-water-vegetation modeling and theory.",

            "abstract": "Professional development for teachers involved in the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) will require a multifaceted approach combining curriculum development, understanding the nature of science, applications of engineering and technology, integrating reading and writing, and other pedagogical components. The Earth2Class Workshops (E2C) at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University (LDEO) provides one model for creating effective training to meet the NGSS challenges. E2C has provided more than 135 workshops since 1998 that have brought together LDEO research scientists with classroom teachers and students from the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere. Each session provides teachers with the chance to learn first-hand about the wide range of investigations conducted at LDEO. This approach aligns strongly with the NGSS goals: mastery of the disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, understanding the nature of science, and cross-cutting relationships. During workshops, participating teachers interact with scientists to gain understanding of what stimulated research questions, how scientists put together all the components of investigations, and ways in which results are disseminated. Networking among teachers often leads to developing lesson plans based on the science, as well as support for professional growth not always possible within the school setting. Through the E2C website\nwww.earth2class.org\n, teachers and students not able to attend the live workshops can access archival versions of the sessions. The website also provides a wide variety of educational resources. These have proved to be valuable on a national basis, as evidenced by an average of more than 300,000 hits per month from thousands of site visitors. Participating researchers have found E2C to be an effective approach to provide broader outreach of their results. During the next couple of years, the E2C program will expand to provide more resources useful for educators seeking to introduce NGSS-based programs in their districts. The E2C model can be applied in other settings, with appropriate modifications.",

            "abstract": "Carbon cycling in the rhizosphere is a nexus of biophysical interactions between plant roots, microorganisms, and the soil organo-mineral matrix. Plant roots are the primary inputs of soil organic C; the presence of roots significantly alters rates of organic matter mineralization by soil microbes. Our research on how roots influence decomposition of soil organic matter in both simplified and complex microcosms uses geochemical characterization, molecular microbiology, isotope tracing, ‘omics and novel imaging approaches (‘ChipSIP’ and ‘STXM-SIMS’) to trace the fate of isotopically labelled root exudates and plant tissues. Our work seeks to understand the genomic basis for how organic C transformation and decomposition in soil is altered by interactions between plant roots and the soil microbial community (bacteria, archaea, fungi, microfauna). We hypothesize that root-exudate stimulation of soil microbial populations results in the altered expression of transcripts and proteins involved in decomposition of macromolecular C compounds. Using an isotope array that allows us to follow root C into bacterial, fungal, and microfaunal communities, we have tracked movement of 13C from labeled exudates and 15N from labeled root litter into the soil microbial community, and linked this data to 16S profiles and community gene transcripts. By integrating stable isotopes as tracers of natural resource utilization (i.e. root litter), and analysis of the functional properties of the communities that respond to those resources, we can identify the molecular pathways that are stimulated in the soil microbiome in response to root litter, living roots, and their interfaces.",

We set up five cross-fault short gravity profiles with GPS position, and after 3 types of correction, topographical correction, gravity-height correction and Bouguer plate correction, we get the values of gravity anomalies caused by density heterogeneity of various geological features. We analysised its crust mass distribution of Xiaojiang fault system in northern, middle and southern section by the way of bouguer residual density correlation imaging, normalized full gradient and gravity inversion using selection methods. We got the crustal mass distribution image to the Moho, layered structures and fault structures, and then we analyzed its tectonic movement. The studies show that Xiaojiang fault system has the segmental features. There was more complex crustal structure in northern, and southern crustal structure is relatively simple but moho depth was more shallower. And we also found inhomogeneous density distribution in the transverse direction and layered distribution features in the vertical direction. The model of the fault system cross-fault gravity profile and three-dimensional space tectonic, based on rich geological and geophysical data in the area, provided the physical basis for the research of earthquake evolution in the area and material flow, dynamic environment in the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "Fast-growing trees in secondary forests and plantations in the humid tropics play an important role in the atmospheric CO2 balance owing to their high rates of carbon sequestration. Because plants require nutrients to sustain high CO2 uptake, differences among tree species in traits related to nutrient uptake, retention and recycling could influence ecosystem-scale carbon cycling. A better understanding of the relationships among plant traits, nutrient and carbon cycling will thus improve ecosystem- to global scale modeling of effects of vegetation change on carbon cycling. In an experimental setting in which state factors were similar among four species of tropical trees situated on an Oxisol in replicated, 25-yr-old, mono-dominant plantations, I evaluated various drivers of aboveground storage of phosphorus (P) and cations, measuring nutrient fluxes in litterfall and fine-root growth and storage in biomass and soil to 1-m depth. Because fine roots increase the capacity to scavenge nutrients already on exchange sites within the soil environment, I hypothesized that P and cation uptake would be correlated directly with fine-root growth.\nThe four tree species in this experiment, Hieronyma alchorneoides, Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, and Vochysia guatemalensis differed significantly in net cation uptake over the first 25 years of growth (P = 0.013, Ca; P >0.0001, Mg, Mn, K, Al, Fe, and Sr). For all cations, aboveground tree biomass was highly correlated with fine-root ingrowth length, with P values >0.0001 for all cations except Ca (P = 0.013). In contrast for P, differences among species were only marginally significant (P = 0.062). Similarly, P in aboveground tree biomass was marginally correlated with fine-root ingrowth (P = 0.068). Neither cation nor P uptake was correlated with measures of available P and cations, organic or total P in surface soil. For P, the less significant correlation with fine-root growth suggests that some other mechanism, such as symbioses with AMF, also play a role in P nutrition in this tropical Oxisol. Together, these results indicate that allocation to fine-root growth resulted in increased scavenging capacity and thereby served as the major mechanism whereby cation uptake, and to a lesser extent P uptake, kept pace with carbon cycling in fast-growing trees.",

            "abstract": "The Dynamics of the MJO (DYNAMO) field campaign took place in the Indian Ocean during boreal winter of 2011-2012 to collect observations of the initiation of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events. Hindcast experiments are conducted for the first two MJO events of DYNAMO from 01 October – 15 December 2011 with two atmospheric models, one that uses conventional parameterization (CAM) and another that employs super-parameterization (SP-CAM). Increased convective entrainment in CAM improves the representation of MJO precipitation and zonal wind, with RMM predictive skill up to 20 days, whereas the control hindcasts rapidly diverge from observations with no coherent MJO convective signal after 5 days. SP-CAM exhibits superior hindcast performance, with a much more coherent convective envelope. However, a systematic drift in the large-scale fields is found to have a detrimental effect on the interpretation of RMM skill scores.\nAnalysis of the column moist static energy (MSE) budget reveals that the simulations with superior MJO performance exhibit a positive MSE tendency by vertical advection on average, inconsistent with reanalysis that indicates a weak negative tendency. This discrepancy in CAM hindcasts is compensates for overly weak cloud-radiative feedbacks, suggesting that increased entrainment improves the MJO in CAM for the wrong reason. Cloud-radiative feedbacks in SP-CAM show better agreement with observations.\nThe gross moist stability (GMS) is used to interpret these MSE budget results in a normalized framework relevant to moisture mode theory. Both CAM and SPCAM hindcasts are characterized by negative effective GMS, indicating that convection and associated divergent circulations have a net moistening effect on the column, which is a favorable condition to destabilize a moisture mode. However, this result is not consistent with observations.",

            "abstract": "Accurate rainfall observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions are needed for hydrological applications, agriculture, meteorology, and climate monitoring. However, the majority of the land surface of the earth lacks accurate rainfall information and the number of rain gauges is even severely declining in Europe, South-America, and Africa. This calls for alternative sources of rainfall information. Various studies have shown that microwave links from operational cellular communication networks may be used for rainfall monitoring. Such networks cover 20% of the land surface of the earth and have a high density, especially in urban areas.\nThe basic principle of rainfall estimation using microwave links is as follows. Rainfall attenuates the electromagnetic signals transmitted from one telephone tower to another. By measuring the received power at one end of a microwave link as a function of time, the path-integrated attenuation due to rainfall can be calculated, which can be converted to average rainfall intensities over the length of a link. This is particularly interesting for those countries where few surface rainfall observations are available.\nA data set from a commercial microwave link network over the Netherlands is analyzed. The data set runs from January 2011 – January 2014 and consists of roughly 2000 links covering the land surface of the Netherlands (35,500 square kilometers). From this 3-year data set country-wide rainfall maps are retrieved, which are compared to a gauge-adjusted radar data set. The ability of cellular communication networks to estimate rainfall is studied for different temporal and spatial scales, as well as for several air temperature classes. Case studies are presented to investigate the performance of the algorithm during snow and sleet and to show the influence of dew formation on the antennas on the received signal levels. To summarize, the results further confirm the potential of these networks for rainfall monitoring.",

            "abstract": "As water resources problems typically involve several stakeholders with conflicting objectives, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are now key tools for understanding management tradeoffs. Given the growing complexity of water planning problems, it is important to establish if an algorithm can consistently perform well on a given class of problems. This knowledge allows the decision analyst to focus on eliciting and evaluating appropriate problem formulations. This study proposes a multi-objective adaptation of the classic environmental economics “Lake Problem” as a computationally simple but mathematically challenging MOEA benchmarking problem. The lake problem abstracts a fictional town on a lake which hopes to maximize its economic benefit without degrading the lake’s water quality to a eutrophic (polluted) state through excessive phosphorus loading. The problem poses the challenge of maintaining economic activity while confronting the uncertainty of potentially crossing a nonlinear and potentially irreversible pollution threshold beyond which the lake is eutrophic. Objectives for optimization are maximizing economic benefit from lake pollution, maximizing water quality, maximizing the reliability of remaining below the environmental threshold, and minimizing the probability that the town will have to drastically change pollution policies in any given year. The multi-objective formulation incorporates uncertainty with a stochastic phosphorus inflow abstracting non-point source pollution. We performed comprehensive diagnostics using 6 algorithms: Borg, MOEA\\D, eMOEA, eNSGAII, GDE3, and NSGAII to ascertain their controllability, reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness. The lake problem abstracts elements of many current water resources and climate related management applications where there is the potential for crossing irreversible, nonlinear thresholds. We show that many modern MOEAs can fail on this test problem, indicating its suitability as a useful and nontrivial benchmarking problem.",

            "abstract": "Historically, preservation of the rainforest was justified in terms of conservation of biodiversity, protection of indigenous people habitats and maintenance of carbon stocks. Most of these arguments are based on the direct effect of rainforest removal, and ignore second order effects of the presence of the rainforest, such as modulation of regional climate patterns. The rainforest helps define the regional climate of the region, in particular the regional temperature and precipitation patterns. Of course, any activity that depends on the local climate may be affected by changes in the rainforest. Recent evidence in the literature presented enough arguments to believe that the widespread removal of the rainforest will have economic consequences at least in agriculture output and hydroelectric power generation. Economic impacts may affect not only the agriculture and energy sectors, but also several other economic activities that are related to climate. As a country, we are counting with the climate of Amazonia as fixed, but if the present climate needs the presence of the rainforest, we need to quantify the economic value of the climate regulation service provided by the rainforest. Important questions to be answered: How much of the rainforest is needed to conserve the present climate? Where it should stand for best climate regulation? Answer to these questions may affect Brazil´s large-scale policy on land use.",

Our study shows that the Central Ecuador margin divides in two contrasting segments, the northern “Manta-Puerto López” and southern ”Puerto López-Salinas” segments showing dissimilar long-lived physical properties. The northern segment coincides with a shallow ISC locked zone, and shows a smooth outer-wedge slope scalloped by a gentle, 50 km-wide morphologic re-entrant. No subduction channel is detected across this segment that reveals a large subducted seamount and a 2-4° landward dipping shallow inter-plate contact. In the locked zone, the seamount is in contact with strong (Vp= 5 km/s) oceanic rocks of the margin basement, suggesting that elastic strain can store and trigger a large earthquake. In contrast, the southern margin segment is rather decoupled and shows a highly disrupted outer-wedge seafloor with deep re-entrants and large Mass Transport Deposits. The interplate contact dips landward ~6-7°, and is spotted by isolated seamounts separated by a ~0.5-1 km-thick subduction channel that may act as a lubricant favoring inter-plate creeping. In this segment, subducted seamounts collide against low velocity (Vp=3.5 km/s) margin rocks of a thrust sheet complex deformed by normal faults, so that sufficient elastic strain may not accumulate to trigger a large earthquake. Our study supports that ISC variations along the trench are mainly controlled by the thickness of the SC, the roughness of the subducting plate and stiffness variations of margin basement rocks against which subducted seamounts collide.",

Using four ensemble simulations of the Free Running (FR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) we find the first empirical orthogonal function of interannual detrended ozone variability explains from 40% (at the surface) to over 80% (at 150 hPa) of the simulated ozone variability from 30–90 N. This identified mode of ozone variability shows strong stratosphere–troposphere coupling, demonstrating the importance of the stratosphere in an attribution of tropospheric ozone variability. The simulations, with no change in emissions, capture almost 50% of the measured ozone change during the 1990s at a variety of locations. This suggests that a large portion of the measured ozone change is not due to changes in emissions, but can be traced to changes in large-scale modes of ozone variability. This emphasizes the difficulty in the attribution of ozone changes, and the importance of natural variability in understanding the trends and variability of ozone.",

However despite their increased horizontal resolution, these models will not adequately resolve eddies. Parametrization of sub-grid eddies remain therefore necessary. A representation of the mesoscale eddy forcing as function of the straining and shearing of the resolved flow, wind forcing, stratification and model resolution is developed using probability distribution functions (PDFs) diagnosed from high-resolution eddy-resolving runs. The PDFs represent the eddy-eddy and eddy-mean flow interactions and associated Reynolds stresses necessary to mimic the effects of the eddies. The reconstructed PDFs are used as a parametrization of sub-grid eddy effects, leading to improvements in the mean and variability of the coarse-resolution parametrized simulation over the unparametrized version. Uncertainties in the parametrization and parameters are inherent to the formulation of parametrization, via the PDFs, which allows for a quantification of eddy forcing and model error as function of grid-size and external forcing.",

            "abstract": "K2O contents of rocks and soils were measured or estimated with three instruments on Curiosity in Gale Crater, Mars: ChemCam (laser induced remote sensing), APXS (α-particle X-ray spectroscopy), and CheMin (X-ray diffraction analysis). In some sedimentary rocks the K2O contents are consistent with the rock’s mineralogy, but in others K2O is higher than expected for the mineralogy. We have considered five hypotheses for the high abundance of K2O in Gale Crater sediments.\nHypothesis I; K2O is enriched in plagioclase feldspar due to crystallization at high temperatures and pressures. Hypothesis II, some sedimentary rocks are enriched in K2O-rich feldspars. Hypothesis III; rocks may have been enriched in K2O by secondary mineral formation. Hypothesis IV; dust has been incorporated into the rocks. Hypothesis V, K2O is contained in an amorphous or a nanocrystalline phase. Hypotheses IV and V are easily invalidated because the measured and inferred compositions of dust and amorphous and nanocrystalline material are not sufficiently enriched in K2O to cause the observed K2O in sedimentary rocks.\nHypothesis I is possible because high-K2O plagioclase feldspars are sometimes observed in martian meteorites and sediments may have incorporated feldspars of these compositions. Hypothesis II is supported if potassium-rich feldspars, which have been identified by XRD of Gale Crater sediments and have been found in some martian meteorites, are concentrated in Gale sediments by fluvial processes. Hypothesis III is supported if correlations of K2O with other components of alteration minerals or secondary phases are found such as in a K2O-rich phyllosilicate, jarosite, alkali feldspar, or a potassium and fluorine-bearing phase.\nHypotheses I and II may explain the elevated K2O in Gale Crater sediments, however, potassium enrichments must be compatible with mineralogy. Hypotheses III is supported if a K2O-rich secondary phase or phases can be identified. The cause of K2O enrichment could reveal much about past igneous, geochemical, and physical processes in Gale Crater.",

Branches of the visible positive leaders decayed and produced numerous recoil leaders. In one case, the negative end of the recoil leader transitioned to stepping in virgin air and traveled down to the ground initiating a negative cloud-to-ground return stroke. The return stroke traveled back up and out the path formed by the preceding recoil leader and to the tip of the decayed positive leader branch. Luminosity faded in the channel path formed by the recoil-to-stepped leader/ return stroke sequence and numerous other recoil leaders initiated along the same path and traveled to ground initiating subsequent negative return strokes. This flash was captured at 1,000 ips without spectra and at 11,001 ips with spectra. The spectra of the negative end of the recoil leader as it steps downward in virgin air is well resolved. Some of the subsequent dart leaders as well as resulting return strokes are also well resolved with spectra. The return strokes show typical channel cooling from the first frame of the return stroke sequence.",

The ocean diurnal cycle is strongly modulated by seasonal variability in wind forcing, and during trade wind conditions descending diurnal shear layers are observed regularly in the late afternoon and evening. These descending shear layers are associated with reduced Richardson number, and marginal instability of the equatorial undercurrent below the mixed layer. The significance of these findings for deep-cycle turbulence in the central equatorial Atlantic will be discussed in relation to recent work from the Pacific.",

            "abstract": "The vast effort in hydrology devoted to parameter calibration as a means to improve model performance assumes that the models concerned are not fundamentally wrong. By focussing on finding optimal parameter sets and ascribing poor model performance to parameter or data uncertainty, these efforts may fail to consider the need to improve models with more intelligent descriptions of hydrological processes. To test this hypothesis, a flexible physically based hydrological model including a full suite of snow hydrology processes as well as warm season, hillslope and groundwater hydrology was applied to Marmot Creek Research Basin, Canadian Rocky Mountains where excellent driving meteorology and basin biophysical descriptions exist. Model parameters were set from values found in the basin or from similar environments; no parameters were calibrated. The model was tested against snow surveys and streamflow observations. The model used algorithms that describe snow redistribution, sublimation and forest canopy effects on snowmelt and evaporative processes that are rarely implemented in hydrological models. To investigate the contribution of these processes to model predictive capability, the model was “falsified” by deleting parameterisations for forest canopy snow mass and energy, blowing snow, intercepted rain evaporation, and sublimation. Model falsification by ignoring forest canopy processes contributed to a large increase in SWE errors for forested portions of the research basin with RMSE increasing from 19 to 55 mm and mean bias (MB) increasing from 0.004 to 0.62. In the alpine tundra portion, removing blowing processes resulted in an increase in model SWE MB from 0.04 to 2.55 on north-facing slopes and -0.006 to -0.48 on south-facing slopes. Eliminating these algorithms degraded streamflow prediction with the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency dropping from 0.58 to 0.22 and MB increasing from 0.01 to 0.09. These results show dramatic model improvements by including snow redistribution and melt processes associated with wind transport and forest canopies. As most hydrological models do not currently include these processes, it is suggested that modellers first improve the realism of model structures before trying to optimise what are inherently inadequate simulations of hydrology.",

            "abstract": "While the tropics may influence the pace of Arctic sea ice loss, Arctic sea ice loss can in turn affect tropical climate via oceanic and atmospheric teleconnections. Here we isolate the role of dynamical ocean processes in the global response to projected Arctic sea ice loss by comparing simulations with a hierarchy of models: atmosphere-only, atmosphere coupled to a slab ocean, and atmosphere coupled to a full-depth dynamical ocean. In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to the northern middle and high latitudes. Thermodynamic ocean coupling expands the reach of the response into the tropics, inducing a northward shift of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Including the effects of dynamical ocean coupling results in an equatorward intensification of the Pacific ITCZ, unlike the thermodynamically-coupled response but similar to the greenhouse gas forced response. The results suggest an important role for ocean dynamics in the response of the full climate system to Arctic sea ice loss.",

            "abstract": "Intraseasonal variability (ISV) in the tropics represents a primary source of predictability at time scales in between those typically associated with weather and seasonal climate variations. With our growing awareness of the modulations to weather and extreme events by organized modes of ISV, efforts to develop and improve subseasonal predictions have been a focus of intense research for the past two decades. While the last decade has witnessed marked improvement in dynamical MJO prediction, timely assessment of the practical and potential MJO prediction capabilities from dynamic models is crucial for guiding future research and development priorities. In this presentation, we report on our predictability and prediction skill studies using the Intraseasonal Variability Hindcast experiment (ISVHE). ISVHE is multi-model experiment consisting of set of extended range hindcasts from eight different coupled models. Specifically, we present our studies’ findings regarding boreal winter Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the boreal summer eastern Pacific and south Asian monsoon ISV MJO. Predictability and prediction skill is estimated from both the deterministic and ensemble mean hindcasts, with an emphasis on quantifying the gap between prediction skill and estimates of predictability for these dominant modes of ISV. In addition, we analyze the forecast “spread-error” relationship in the different ensemble prediction systems (EPS) as an illustration of how the fidelity of the combined model, assimilation system and structural fidelity of existing EPSs influence our prediction capabilities of ISV.",

            "abstract": "It is widely identified that aftershock zones often expand along strike and dip-directions with time following a mainshock dynamic rupture. Notable aftershock expansions are especially observed in subduction zone earthquake sequences at time scales of days to years. Here, we examine the aftershock sequence recorded during the first 32 days following the 2007 Mw 6.7 Noto-Hanto earthquake, Japan, which occurred at shallow crustal depths in an active compressional zone along the eastern margin of the Japan Sea. To obtain the precise information about aftershock activity, we used a searching technique for events that have similar waveforms to those of template event from continuous seismograms recorded by a dense seismic network installed near the source region. We detected about 10 times more events than those listed in the routinely constructed earthquake catalog. The aftershock area expanded along the fault strike as a logarithmic function of time, beginning immediately after the mainshock. During the month after the mainshock, the aftershock area expanded along-strike to approximately four times the size of the mainshock rupture area. Aftershock expansion toward the SW was especially extensive, and developed more rapidly than toward the NE. A close-up view of the along-strike evolution of the aftershocks shows that the speeds of the migrating seismicity fronts were not constant, but evolved in several repeated step-like acceleration–deceleration phases, by the activation of a series of spatially clustered seismic bursts. Spatial correlation between the aftershock extension and afterslip distribution suggests that expansion of the aftershock area could be mainly driven by aseismic afterslip. The aftershock area continues to expand, even though 7 years have now passed since the mainshock (Kato and Obara, 2014).",

Although the nature of BrC vertical distributions can significantly influence the radiative forcing impacts, very little data exists on BrC levels throughout the troposphere, in part because aerosol optical instruments can only detect BrC when at significant levels relative to BC. Biomass burning is known to be a substantial source for BrC. Aircraft studies as part of the DC3 and SEAC4RS missions provided a unique opportunity to study wildfire BrC emissions from a variety of sources in different locations and altitudes.

Our assessments were based on the forward modeling method using GRACE release-05 (RL-05) solutions, hydrological models (2003-2013), and in situ groundwater level measurements (2005~2010) from both shallow and deep aquifers. Results show that the GRACE-derived GWS variation in the PP experienced a severe depletion of GWS (-46.5±6.4 mm yr-1) over the past decade, nearly 3 times that of the ECP (-16.9±2.1 mm yr-1). There were apparent renewal episodes of GWS (e.g. since 2010) in PP, which may reveal the high replenishing capability of unconfined aquifers. Despite the lower depletion rate, the deep GWS with poor recoverability may have been overexploited. The depletion rate (-16.9±2.1 mm yr-1) exceeded the maximum allowable depletion rate (~12.4 mm yr-1) based on a 50-year groundwater budget.",

            "abstract": "Many climate change mitigation scenarios include terrestrial atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (BCDR) or carbon neutral bioenergy production through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECS) or afforestation/reforestation. Very high sequestration potentials for these strategies have been reported, and we evaluate the potential ecological limits (e.g., land and resource requirements) to implementation at the 1 Pg C y-1 scale relevant to climate change mitigation for U.S. and global scenarios. We estimate that removing 1 Pg C y-1 via tropical afforestation would require at least 7×106 ha y-1 of land, 0.09 Tg y-1 of nitrogen, and 0.2 Tg y-1 of phosphorous, and would increase evapotranspiration from those lands by almost 50%. Because of improved carbon capture technologies, we are updating (and reducing) our previous estimates for switchgrass BECS (previous estimate was 2×108 ha land and 20 Tg y-1 of nitrogen (20 % of global fertilizer nitrogen production)). Miscanthus could meet the same biomass production with much lower N demand. Moreover, transitioning the U.S land currently under corn- ethanol production to no-till perennial grasses for bioenergy would meet U.S. needs and have additional environmental benefits (such as improved wildlife habitat and soil restoration). Thus, there are both signficant ecological limits to BCDR as well as potential ecological benefits, depending on implementation.",

            "abstract": "Because more than 80% of the world's soil organic carbon (SOC) is found below 20 cm depth, deep SOC has the potential to form large positive feedbacks to climate change. According to climate projections, temperature changes at 1 m depth will largely keep pace with warming air temperatures over the next century. While surface SOC decomposes exponentially faster with warming, little is known about the temperature response of deeper carbon, or the modes of stabilization of deeper SOC. Most biogeochemical studies have been limited to the surface soil. Likewise, soil biogeochemical models in Earth System Models are parameterized for surface soil and lack mechanisms important for stabilization of deep SOC, such as organo-mineral associations. Radiocarbon observations in different soil types show that SOC residence of time of SOC increases with depth, with residences times over 10,000 years in many soils by 1 m deep. That means this SOC has accumulated slowly over time; if stabilization mechanisms are disrupted, leading to large changes in decomposition rates, SOC losses are unlikely to be compensated for by increased in plant inputs. Therefore, we suggest that a critical challenge for ESMs is to achieve process-level understanding and the ability to predict whether, and how, the large stores of old SOC can be made rapidly accessible to microbial transformation.",

While estimates of total water storage are relatively straightforward in large scale basins, disaggregating the groundwater storage component is complicated because of uncertainties in other components of the water budget. In this presentation we will discuss results of GRACE analysis on groundwater storage in different systems, ranging from simple unconfined aquifers with little surface water interactions (e.g. High Plains aquifer) to more complicated unconfined/confined aquifers with combined surface water and groundwater based irrigation (U.S. Central Valley and N India) systems. We will discuss different approaches for estimating changes in groundwater storage, uncertainties in these approaches, and comparisons of storage estimates from GRACE with those based on regional water level monitoring data and regional groundwater models. This analysis should advance applications of GRACE data in assessing changes in groundwater storage and highlight important factors to constrain uncertainties in storage estimates.",

The same geophysical signatures can occur, however, in low porosity sand. We investigate the possible occurrence of natural gas hydrate in a sand interval in Alaminos Canyon Block 21 (AC 21) in the Gulf of Mexico, drilled in 2009 by the US Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project. The sand interval in AC21 has an increase in measured resistivity (~2.2 Ω-m) on geophysical well logs and a strong peak and trough at the top and bottom of the sand on exploration seismic, which has been interpreted as a natural gas hydrate reservoir with saturations up to 20%. We reexamine the geophysical data and construct a new reservoir model that matches the measured resistivity, the high-density sub layers in the sand, and the surface seismic trace. Our modeling shows the sand interval in AC 21 is most likely water-saturated and the slight increase in resistivity, higher measured density, and the seismic amplitudes are caused by a reduction in porosity to ~30% in the sand interval relatively to a porosity of ~42% in the surrounding marine muds. More broadly, we show that the mean depth where the porosity of marine muds becomes lower than sand sediment is ~900 mbsf, meaning that the similar geophysical signatures for water-saturated sand and low saturations of natural gas hydrate probably occur at most gas hydrate sites worldwide.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial water cycle has been largely altered by water projects in China. Since 1950, half of the world’s large dams over 15 m height have been built in China. The installed hydropower capacity in China was 249 GW in 2012, accounting for about one-fifth of the total installed hydropower capacity of the world. China has also pursued an ambitious effort, the South-North Water Diversion Project, to transfer 44.8 billion m3 of freshwater annually from southern China to the drier north. Climate change is expected to result in changes in land surface hydrology, thus pose a huge challenge to water management. The potential impacts of climate change on the performance of the major water projects are yet to be assessed. We used a land surface hydrological model together with a simple treatment of reservoir operation to assess the impact of hydrological change on the functions of the major water projects under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate and socio-economic scenarios. The bias-corrected climate data from global climate models under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used to drive the hydrological model. The operation of 474 major reservoirs was considered with an operating rule to generate maximum possible hydroelectricity and to fulfill water diversion demands. The future socioeconomic conditions, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), were used to estimate the water requirement and leverage the water diversion. The modeling results suggest that climate change would have negative impacts on hydropower production and water supply reliability in China. This research highlights the need to evaluate the performance change of existing water infrastructures and to develop adaptation strategy in sustainable water management in a changing environment.",

            "abstract": "Climate warming in the Arctic may result in release of carbon dioxide and/or methane from thawing permafrost soils, resulting in a positive feedback to warming. Permafrost thaw may also result in release of methane from previously trapped natural gas. The Arctic landscape is approximately 50% covered by shallow permafrost lakes, and these environments may serve as bellwethers for climate change – carbon cycle feedbacks, since permafrost thaw is generally deeper under lakes than tundra soils. Since 2011, the Circum-Arctic Lakes Observation Network (CALON) project has documented landscape-scale variability in physical and biogeochemical processes of Arctic lakes in permafrost terrain, including carbon cycle feedbacks to climate warming. Here we present a dataset of concentrations, isotope ratios (13C and 2H), and atmospheric fluxes of methane from lakes in Arctic Alaska. Concentrations of methane in lake water ranged from 0.3 to 43 micrograms per liter, or between 6 and 750 times supersaturated with respect to air. Isotopic measurements of dissolved methane indicated that most of the lakes had methane derived from anaerobic organic matter decomposition, but that some lakes may have a small source of methane from fossil fuel sources such as natural gas or coal beds. Concurrent measurements of methane fluxes and dissolved methane concentrations in summer of 2014 will aid in translating routine dissolved measurements into fluxes, and will also elucidate the relative importance of diffusive versus ebulliative fluxes. It is essential that measurements of methane emissions from Arctic lakes be continued long-term to determine whether methane emissions are on the rise, and whether warming of the lakes leads to increased venting of fossil fuel methane from enhanced thaw of permafrost beneath the lakes.",

Similarly, Low-latitude western boundary currents of the Pacific - Mindanao Current and South Equatorial Current also show some bimodal behavior (intrusion or choke) east of the Sulawesi Sea. It is still not well known whether these low frequency variabilities arise from external forcing or internal mechanism. In this paper we explore how temporal variability arises through successive bifurcations of the wind-driven circulation as lateral friction is decreased in a 1.5-layer shallow-water equation models with real continental geometry boundary of the western Pacific. Multiple equilibria of the intrusion of the western boundary currents are found. The origin of these equilibria is investigated by determining the structure of steady solutions by using continuation techniques. In both single-gyre model (analog to the Kuroshio at Luzon Strait)and double-gyre model (analog to the Mindanao Current and South equatorial Current at the source region of the Indonesian Throughflow), the western boundary currents become unstable as the lateral friction decreases. These solutions subsequently destabilize to two sets of barotropic oscillatory modes, introducing an annual and monthly time scale.",

            "abstract": "What can ecology tell us about the hydrology of the Amazon? And what can hydrology tell us about the ecology? From a hydrological perspective, plant water storage and use contributes to determining the rate and time scales at which water is recycled from soil to the atmosphere. From an ecological perspective, plant water storage and use contributes to determining the rate and time scales at which water plants can support function. Conceptualized as residence time, the relationship between plant water storage and use can provide fundamental insights into ecohydrology. We explore the spatial variation in the aboveground storage, use, and residence time of water across the Amazon. To do so, we pair estimates of aboveground woody biomass from 413 1-ha old growth forest census plots situated across the Amazon Basin with high resolution estimates of intra- and inter- annual evapotranspiration derived from remote sensing. Aboveground water storage capacity (17.4 ± 6.3 mm) and evapotranspiration (3.7 ± 0.4 mm day-1) result in a residence time of 4.7 ± 1.5 days, equivalent to the use of ca. 24% of stored water day-1. The results indicate that residence time varies due to a predictable relationship between evapotranspiration and biomass at local, regional and landscape scales. The ecohydrology of the Amazon plays a critical role in water and carbon cycling on a global scale. We discuss how our results can help inform our understanding of both the hydrology and ecology of the Amazon Basin in the context of anthropogenic change.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 5 million years, Earth has experienced a transition from warmer climates to cooler climates. It is not clear how these changes affected export productivity in the Equatorial Pacific (EEP) and what are the potential feedbacks between ocean productivity and climate? To address these questions we use barite accumulation rates to reconstruct export productivity in the eastern equatorial Pacific (ODP Site 849) and compare the record to sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations and other productivity proxies over the past 5.3 Ma. We find that export productivity fluctuated considerably on multiple time scales. During the Pliocene between 4.5 and 3 Ma, export productivity was on average higher (~50 g C m-2 yr-1) than during the Pleistocene (~ 35 g C m-2 yr-1). In the Pleistocene a trend of decreasing export production occurred between 3 Ma and 1 Ma (from ~60 to ~20 g C m-2 yr-1) followed by an increase over the last million years. Our record reveal decoupling between export productivity and SST on long (million year) time scales as previously suggested. Throughout this time interval shorter orbital-scale large amplitude fluctuations (between 10 and 100 g C m-2 yr-1) in export productivity are observed and export production was generally higher during cold periods or during transitions. Results from this study suggest that in the EEP mechanisms that affect carbon export on orbital time scales differed from those operating on longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "Convergence between India and Eurasia has produced the Tibetan Plateau, which stands 5 km high over a region of 3 million km2，since collision at ~50 Ma. A key region for understanding the mechanisms and timing of uplift is the SE margin, where major rivers have incised the plateau margin, permitting the use of thermochronometry to time incision. Here we present new (U-Th)/He ages including 17 ages on apatite and 23 on zircon and 12 apatite fission track ages on the southeastern margins of the Plateau to explore rates and timing of incision. All three thermochronometric systems on the Salween suggest a regional change in the last 8 Myr and exhibit progressive younging over ~ 150 km upstream. Apatite (U-Th)/He ages of valley bottom samples from the Mekong become younger upstream whereas apatite fission-track and zircon (U-Th)/He ages show a large scatter from ~ 5 Ma to ~160 Ma, depending on the distance above the thalweg. Similarly, upstream samples north of 290N on the Yangtze yield much younger ages than downstream samples. Inversion of combined thermochronometers reveals a northward propagation of the highest rates of incision along the Salween and Mekong since 8 Ma. These results, together with analysis of river profiles, are best explained by a scenario of plateau incision that occurred in southeastern Tibet before or coeval at 8 Ma. We infer that the southeastern plateau margin was deformed under a complex context with both lateral expansion of the plateau margin and oblique indenting of the India plate localizing shortening and high uplift rates at the corner of the indenter.",

The severe iron depletion in the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the ocean basins that receive much of the Kalahari dust, suggests that even incremental increases in dust export to these basins could have significant impact on ocean productivity. The Kalahari also provides an excellent 'natural laboratory', due to its consistent Kalahari Sands existing along a strong precipitation gradient (from ~850 mm in southern Zambia to ~150 mm in southwestern Botswana) with a range of different land uses and land use intensities.\nA large-scale field campaign to evaluate the potential of the southern Kalahari to produce atmospheric dust was established in August, 2013. The goal of the experiment is to evaluate the potential of climate change and land-use to contribute to dust production. The experiment includes measurement of horizontal flux, vegetation structure, and meteorological variables. Novel estimates were made of dust production efficiency (vertical flux produced per unit of horizontal flux) through the coordinated use of active aerosol samplers and passive horizontal sediment traps. In addition, a new stereophotographic method for the estimation of wind-relevant vegetation parameters has been developed for this project.\nOur field data and modeling results indicate that land use and climate can have a significant impact on the potential for dust emission from the region, but new field estimates of dust emission efficiency and chemistry suggest that the absolute magnitude of dust emitted from the region might, at present, be lower than previously thought.",

This phase has a structure similar to that of phase δ, AlOOH [3]. Here we report the stability field of this high pressure hydrous phase, phase H, and its implications for water transport into the deep lower mantle. We conducted in situ X-ray diffraction studies at high pressure and temperature on the stability field of hydous phase H, MgSiO2(OH)2. The high pressure and temperature were generated by using X-ray synchrotron radiation combined with the double-sided laser heating diamond anvil cell. We observed existence of hydrous phase H in the pressure range around 50 GPa, and it is stable up to 60 GPa and below 1610 K. The present results together with the previous works [1, 2, 3] indicate that the pure phase H MgSiO2(OH)2 has a very narrow stability field in a pressure range from 35 to 60 GPa, in the upper part of the lower mantle. The stability field expands significantly towards higher pressure and temperature by dissolution of hydous AlOOH component [4]. The hydrous phase H-phase δ solid solution (aluminous phase H), (MgSi,Al2)O2(OH)2, is potentially the most important hydrous phase under the deep lower mantle conditions. ",

Predictive models of epidemic cholera need to resolve at suitable aggregation levels spatial data pertaining to local communities, epidemiological records, hydrologic drivers, waterways, patterns of human mobility and proxies of exposure rates. A formal model comparison framework provides a quantitative assessment of the explanatory and predictive abilities of various model settings with different spatial aggregation levels. Intensive computations and objective model comparisons show that parsimonious spatially explicit models accounting for spatial connections have superior explanatory power than spatially disconnected ones for short-to intermediate calibration windows. In general, spatially connected models show better predictive ability than disconnected ones. We suggest limits and validity of the various approaches and discuss the pathway towards the development of case-specific predictive tools in the context of emergency management.\nThe second part deals with approaches suitable to describe patterns of endemic cholera. Cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the 1970s. Here we employ a spatially explicit, inhomogeneous Markov chain model to describe cholera incidence in eight health zones on the shore of lake Kivu. Remotely sensed datasets of chlorophyll a concentration in the lake, precipitation and indices of global climate anomalies are used as environmental drivers in addition to baseline seasonality. The effect of human mobility is also modelled mechanistically. We test several models on a multi-year dataset of reported cholera cases. Fourteen models, accounting for different environmental drivers, are selected in calibration. Among these, the one accounting for seasonality, El Nino Southern Oscillation, precipitation and human mobility outperforms the others in cross-validation.",

            "abstract": "Developing the ability to predict streamflow at various scales is a key step for improving our understanding of the water balance and the skill of hydrologic models (HM). To cope with this grand challenge, we postulate: 1) validating a HM only against an integral basin response such as streamflow is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to warranty the proper partitioning of incoming precipitation and net-radiation into different water storage components and fluxes, 2 proper partitioning can be ensured by using additional multi-scale observations during parameter estimation (PE), and 3) HM should be evaluated at locations and scales different from those used for PE to ensure transferability.\nWater fluxes and states variables are estimated over the Pan-EU with the mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM). Its main features are the treatment of the sub-grid variability of input variables and model parameters and the possibility to estimate fluxes in nested-scales and/or in multiple basins keeping its regionalization coefficients unaltered across scales and basins. These essencial features allow to simulate fluxes and states and to evaluate them with disparate sources of information such as satellite, streamflow, and eddy covariance data at their native resolutions.\nmHM was setup over more than 340 Pan-European river basins. This model was forced with the gridded EOBS data set (1/4º, ECA&D) for the period 1950-2012. Morphological data was derived from the FAO soil map (1:5000000), the SRTM DEM (500 m), CORINE land cover (500 m), and MODIS LAI. The multi-scale evaluation was carried out using latent heat (LH) from FLUXNET stations and LandFlux-EVAL (1/2º), runoff from GRDC gauging stations, soil moisture from ESA-CCI (1/4º), total water storage (TWS) anomalies from GRACE (1º) and groundwater (GW) stage stations. Results lead to the conclusion that mHM water fluxes are robust since less than 25% of river basins exhibit Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.5 or less. Simulated TWS anomalies and LH exhibit a large spatial and temporal correlation with GRACE and point measurements respectively. The first postulate, however, is clearly confirmed in extreme situations. Deficient performance in streamflows is mainly attributed to either heavily regulated river basins or regions with a poor rainfall gauge network.",

Recent investigations have for instance highlighted the impacts of soil moisture-climate interactions for the development of droughts and heat waves (e.g. Seneviratne et al. 2012, Mueller and Seneviratne 2012, Seneviratne et al. 2013, Orlowsky and Seneviratne 2013). In addition, forcing from land use and land cover changes through modified albedo or turbulent fluxes can also affect the temperature variability in summer (Davin et al. 2014). These effects are important for better understanding the relationships between climate forcing and regional climate changes, and appear relevant for a recent discrepancy between trends in global mean temperature vs hot extremes over land (Seneviratne et al. 2014).

            "abstract": "Nearly 50 years have passed since the seminal work of Brace and Byerlee who first suggested that the stick-slip events frequently accompanying frictional sliding in laboratory experiments may be regarded as an experimental analog of shallow earthquakes. Since then numerous studies have investigated physical processes and characteristics of frictional sliding. Extrapolating these laboratory observations to the field scale provide important insights into the physics governing source processes of earthquakes. This can be achieved by a direct near-field in-situ fault observations. In the Earth crust deep mines provide a unique opportunity for this purpose by giving access to the focal depth of earthquakes.\nIn this study we compare the physical and statistical properties of the attoseismicity (MW -8 to -6) recorded in the laboratory experiments on rock samples with nano- and picoseismicity (MW -4 to 0) recorded in-situ after a MW 1.9 earthquake. The microfracturing processes were investigated for the two laboratory stick-slip friction experiments performed on Westerly granite samples with different fault surface roughness (saw-cut fault, fault developed from a fresh fracture). We examined temporal changes of seismic moment tensors, source parameters and b-values of acoustic emission events that occurred during multiple seismic cycles. This study is compared with characteristics of seismicity preceding and following the MW 1.9 earthquake that occurred in Mponeng mine, South Africa. The mainshock was followed by an aftershock sequence composed of more than 25000 nano- and picoearthquakes recorded using high frequency seismic network composed of accelerometers and acoustic emission sensors. Close source-receiver distances (<30m from the hypocenter) allowed to investigate the physical processes occurring in the fault zone before and after the failure in very fine details allowing to form a link between laboratory and in-situ observations.",

            "abstract": "The Ryukyu Trench (RT), where the Philippine Sea plate is subducting, has had no known thrust earthquakes with a Mw>8.0 in the last 300 years. However, the rupture source of the 1771 tsunami has been proposed as an Mw > 8.0 earthquake in the south RT. Based on the dating of tsunami boulders, it has been estimated that large tsunamis occur at intervals of 150–400 years in the south Ryukyu arc (RA) (Araoka et al., 2013), although they have not occurred for several thousand years in the central and northern Ryukyu areas (Goto et al., 2014).\nTo address the discrepancy between recent low moment releases by earthquakes and occurrence of paleo-tsunamis in the RT, we focus on the long-term activity of the very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs), which are good indicators of the stress release in the shallow plate interface. VLFEs have been detected along the RT (Ando et al., 2012), which occur on the plate interface or at the accretionary prism.\nWe used broadband data from the F-net of NIED along the RT and from the IRIS network. We applied two filters to all the raw broadband seismograms: a 0.02–0.05 Hz band-pass filter and a 1 Hz high-pass filter. After identification of the low-frequency events from the band-pass-filtered seismograms, the local and teleseismic events were removed. Then we picked the arrival time of the maximum amplitude of the surface wave of the VLFEs and determined the epicenters.\nVLFEs occurred on the RA side within 100 km from the trench axis along the RT. Distribution of the 6670 VLFEs from 2002 to 2013 could be divided to several clusters. Principal large clusters were located at 27.1°–29.0°N, 25.5°–26.6°N, and 122.1°–122.4°E (YA). \nWe found that the VLFEs of the YA are modulated by repeating slow slip events (SSEs) which occur beneath south RA. The activity of the VLFEs increased to two times of its ordinary rate in 15 days after the onset of the SSEs. Activation of the VLFEs could be generated by low stress change of 0.02–20 kPa increase in Coulomb failure stress. The strain in the plate interface where the VLFEs occur frequently would be released by small change in stress. Cluster of the VLFEs is complementally to the historical tsunami source area and locked area. Continuous activity of VLFEs would release the stress patchily in the plate interface and give the constraint to the maximum size of large thrust earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "A common index of water quality is water clarity, which can be estimated by measuring the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance (Kd). Kd estimates the availability of light to marine organisms at various depths. Marine habitats, including such species as coral and seagrass, can be negatively affected by extreme episodes of sediment suspension, where water clarity is reduced and little light penetrates. Evidence of increased stress on coastal ecosystems exists, partially due to climate change, yet a systematic analysis of extreme events and trends is difficult due to limited data.\nTo address this concern, we have developed as a potential climate indicator a Kd-Index for nine regions along the US coast of the Gulf of Mexico, in which Kd values have been standardized over time and space to allow for a more holistic assessment of climate drivers and their trends. Variability in the Kd-Index is then assessed with regard to occurrences of surface weather types (using the Spatial Synoptic Classification), a synoptic climatology of mean sea-level-pressure patterns across the region, along with heavy precipitation events.\nKd can be estimated from MODIS and SeaWiFS observations from 1997 to date; an earlier period of satellite observations from 1978-86 is also available. A non-linear autoregressive neural network model with external input (NARX) is used to develop the historical relationship between Kd-Index and atmospheric conditions, and then this model is used to simulate a full time series from 1948 to 2013. The modeled data set is strongly correlated with observations, with correlations above 0.8 for many regions. Hit rates of extreme Kd-Index values – those which would most likely be associated with a negative environmental impact – exceed 70% in some regions. Across the full data set, long term trends vary slightly across regions but are generally small. Trends in extreme events appear to be more consistently increasing across the domain.",

Here we evaluate food production in terms of resource availability (water and nutrients) and impacts on resources (groundwater quantity and quality) within the context of climate forcing. Double cropping of corn and wheat in the NCP under intensive irrigation (80 – 90% of cropland) and massive N fertilization (384 kg/ha) resulted in total corn plus wheat yields of 13.4 kg/ha (2002 – 2011). In contrast, single cropping of corn on the USHP under less intensive irrigation (40% of cropland) and N fertilization (90 kg/ha) resulted in only 15% lower yield in the USHP (11.7 kg/ha) than in the NCP. However, irrigation essentially decouples crop production from climate extremes. Average corn and wheat yield in the NCP over the past three decades is not correlated with precipitation. Irrigated corn yield in the north and central USHP was actually higher during the recent 2012 drought by up to ~ 30% relative to the 30 year long-term mean yield whereas rainfed corn yield decreased by ~50% during the drought. The main impact of climate extremes on the aquifers is indirect through increased irrigation pumpage for crop production rather than direct through changes in recharge. Effects of crop production on groundwater quality should be much greater in the NCP because of ~4 times higher fertilizer application relative to that in the USHP. Field research experiments in the NCP indicate that much of this fertilizer application (> 200 kg N/ha) does not impact yield and could potentially leach into underlying aquifers. Projected groundwater depletion in these aquifers should result in a shift from intensive irrigation to more rainfed crop production, increasing vulnerability of crop production to climate extremes.",

The noise records can be used to monitor changes of shallow elastic properties of the crust. We discuss why and how it is possible to perform high precision monitoring, even without a precise description of the noise. The temporal changes of the noise incident to the region of interest results in apparent changes of seismic speeds. A quantitative evaluation of these effects is presented. We emphasize the question of an anisotropic intensity with temporal variations of azimuthal distribution. Our analyses show that high precision monitoring (fractional seismic wave fluctuation of the order of 10-4 can be achieved from noise analysis in presence of a fluctuating noise. We present examples showing how the elastic properties at depth change in response to external forcing such as precipitation, temperature variations, dynamic strain associated with strong long period motions, tides, and hydraulic load. We show that steady ambient noise of anthropic origin can be used efficiently for monitoring of changes related to meteorological processes. In addition, we present an application of noise based monitoring in the context of reservoir stimulation associated with a massive deep water injection in an urban area.",

            "abstract": "This study summarizes nine different cloud retrieval algorithms and discusses their advantages and limitations. Potential uncertainties have also been discussed. These retrievals are mainly based on observations from millimeter radar, lidar, spectral radiation, radiosondes and so on.\nThe cloud retrieval algorithms are classified into three types: physical retrieval algorithm, statistical parameterization algorithm, and optimal iteration method. Analyses indicate that physical retrieval algorithms are theoretically accurate. However, assumptions used in these methods make it challenging to obtain highly reliable results. To improve the physical retrieval algorithm, more reasonable assumptions should be used. Compared to other two types of retrieval algorithms, empirical parameterization methods are simple and can be easily applied. However, these methods are generally based on limited cloud samples for certain types of clouds and locations, and thus they have much larger uncertainties. To improve the accuracy of parameterization algorithm, more reliable in-situ observations are needed for different types of clouds over various locations. In contrast, the optimal iteration method seems to have relatively higher accuracies since the retrieval results make the forward model simulations match observations. However, the accuracy of optimal iteration method is highly dependent on the reliability of the forward models. To improve optimal iteration method, better understanding of the cloud processes and more reliable forward models are needed. In summary, more accurate and comprehensive retrieval algorithms are needed in our current cloud remote sensing studies.",

The impact of the ocean interannual variation of the thermocline depth –represented by the depth of 20C isotherm (D20) - in the SCTR is also assessed. The OGCM main run solution agrees well with the observations.\nThe results show that for the 2001-2011 period, surface shortwave radiation (SWR), turbulent heat fluxes associated with wind speed, and wind stress–driven ocean dynamical processes are all important in causing the MJO-related intraseasonal SST variability in the SCTR region. Overall, forcing by SWR contributes ~31%, and forcing by winds (via both surface turbulent heat flux and ocean dynamics) contributes ~62%. The contribution of turbulent heat flux associated with wind speed is ~39% and that of wind-stress driven ocean dynamics is ~23%. The contribution of ocean dynamics, however, is considerably larger during strong (“prime”) MJO events under “strong” thermocline condition. The overall effect of interannual variability of D20 on intraseasonal SST during 2001-2011 is significant in the eastern part of the SCTR (70E–85E), where the intraseasonal SST amplitudes are strengthened by about 20%. In general, a shallower/deeper SCTR favors larger/smaller SST responses to the MJO forcing.\nIn the eastern SCTR, both the heat flux forcing and entrainment are greatly amplified under the strong SCTR condition, but only slightly suppressed under the weak SCTR condition, leading to an overall strengthening effect on intraseasonal SST variability.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, soil carbon decomposition has been modeled by first-order, donor pool-dominated carbon transfers (i.e., linear model) as modified primarily by temperature and soil moisture. How the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) is regulated by various other biotic and abiotic processes, such as microbial community and activities, OM-mineral interactions, priming by input C, and SOM chemistry, has not been rigorously evaluated. As a consequence, those processes have not been well represented in Earth system models.\nIn this presentation, we use three studies to illustrate how the data assimilation approach is used to examine influences of microbial functional genomics, soil properties, and priming on SOM decomposition. First, we optimally fitted a traditional three-pool (active, slow, and passive) C-cycling model with hundreds of data sets from soil incubation studies. Our results showed that decomposition rates of the active and the slow C pools significantly decrease with clay content, field water holding capacity, and C:N ratio. Multifactor regression and path analyses showed that clay content was the most important variable in regulating decomposition of SOC. Second, we used information from functional genomics study to constrain a soil C dynamic model. With an assumption that a specific community of microbes is associated with each substrate pool (i.e., quality), we linked the relative change in these microbes to the relative change in the substrate pool. Quantification of functional genes, combined with traditional CO2 flux and SOC measurements, substantially improves the transfer coefficient estimation in traditional decomposition models. Third, we estimated priming effects in a two-pool decomposition model from isotope data in soil incubation experiments. Our results showed that around half of the newly added labile carbon was stabilized into recalcitrant carbon in all the forest, grassland and cropland soils. As a result, despite that more old recalcitrant carbon was respired via priming, labile carbon input increased recalcitrant carbon. Thus, stabilization of new labile carbon input may overcompensate the primed carbon loss, leading to recalcitrant carbon increase in terrestrial soils.",

Data from high-latitude research cruises suggest that deposition from the atmosphere to the surface dominates, but the magnitude and drivers of this flux are not well understood. In the polar marine boundary layer, the surface may be composed of not only open ocean, but also first-year or multi-year sea ice which may be covered with meltponds. To characterize the air-sea exchange of ammonia in the polar marine boundary layer, data were collected aboard the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen between July 10 and Aug 14, 2014 in the Eastern Canadian Arctic. The Ambient Ion Monitor Ion Chromatograph was used to make hourly measurements of the mixing ratio of gas phase ammonia, and the water-soluble constituents of fine particle matter (PM2.5). Fluorometry was used to measure dissolved ammonium concentrations in the ocean between 0 and 20 m, and in low-salinity melt ponds encountered in regions of extensive sea ice. Observations indicate that the atmosphere contains higher levels of ammonia than are calculated to be in equilibrium with surface reservoirs, implying net deposition of ammonia from the atmosphere. While ammonium levels tended to be higher in melt ponds, the lower water temperatures still mean that these are unlikely to be sources of NH3 to the atmosphere. The disequilibrium between atmospheric and surface reservoirs of ammonia imply relatively large sources to the atmosphere (possibly nearby bird colonies) or high consumption rates in surface waters.",

They are Kiyosumi (KYS), Uchiura (UCU), Fudago (FDG), Seikoshi (SKS), Mochikoshi (MCK), Kamo (KAM), and Kakioka (KAK). KAK is a standard geomagnetic station operated by JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) and the others are operated by us. We investigated the energy of ULF geomagnetic signals of the frequency around 0.01Hz using wavelet transform analysis. To minimize the influences of artificial noises and global geomagnetic perturbations, we used only the geomagnetic data observed at nighttime (LT 2:30am-4:00 am). In this abstract, we describe the results of KAK as an example. As for KAK data, we utilized observations from a remote station, Kanoya (KNY), as a reference. Statistical results of superposed epoch analysis have indicated that ULF magnetic anomalies are more likely to appear before sizeable earthquake events (Es>108) rather than after them, especially 6-15 days before the events. Further statistical investigations show clearly that the ULF geomagnetic anomalies at KAK are more sensitive to larger and closer events. Finally, we have evaluated the precursory information of ULF geomagnetic signals for local sizeable earthquakes using Molchan’s error diagram. The probability gain is around 1.6 against a Poisson model. The above results have indicated that the ULF seismo-magnetic phenomena at KAK clearly contain precursory information and have a possibility of improving the forecasting of large earthquakes. The statistical results for the other stations also show similar tendency. These facts suggest that ULF magnetic anomalies have a significant correlation and precursory information on a sizable earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Miyashiro (1973, EPSL) put forward the hypothesis that many ophiolites are generated in subduction zone settings. More recently, ophiolitic sequences including MORB-like basalts underlying boninites or other subduction-related rock types have been linked to near-trench spreading during subduction infancy (e.g., Stern and Bloomer, 1992, GSA Bull.; Shervais, 2001, G-cubed; Stern et al., 2012, Lithos.). These contentions were given strong support by the results of Shinkai 6500 diving in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) fore-arc (e.g., Reagan et al., 2010, G-cubed; Ishizuka et al., 2011, EPSL; Reagan et al., 2013, EPSL). Based on widely spaced dives and grab sampling at disbursed dive stops, these studies concluded that the most abundant and most submerged volcanic rocks in the IBM fore-arc are MORB-like basalts (fore-arc basalts or FAB), and that these basalts appear to be part of a crustal sequence of gabbro, dolerite, FAB, boninite, and normal arc lavas overlying depleted peridotite. This ophiolitic sequence was further postulated to make up most or all of the IBM fore-arc from Guam to Japan, with similar magmatic ages (52 Ma FAB to 45 Ma arc) north to south, reflecting a western-Pacific wide subduction initiation event. At the time of this writing, IODP Expedition 352 is about to set sail, with a principal goal of drilling the entire volcanic sequence in the Bonin fore-arc. This drilling will define the compositional gradients through the volcanic sequence associated with subduction initiation and arc infancy, and test the hypothesized oceanic fore-arc – ophiolite genetic relationship. A primary goal of this expedition is to illustrate how mantle compositions and melting processes evolved during decompression melting of asthenosphere during subduction initiation to later flux melting of depleted mantle. These insights will provide important empirical constraints for geodynamic models of subduction initiation and early arc development.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is a crucial control on surface energy fluxes, vegetation properties, and soil carbon cycling. Its interactions with ecosystem processes are highly nonlinear across a large range. Nevertheless, Earth System Models (ESMs) generally only represent an average soil-moisture state in grid cells at scales of 50-200 km, and as a result are not able to adequately represent the effects of subgrid heterogeneity in soil moisture, particularly in regions with large wetland areas.\nSeveral approaches have been attempted to address this limitation. Simple groundwater models are being included as a supplement to the 1-dimensional hydrology in ESMs, for instance by representing a uniform unconfined auqifer with a water-table depth state. This water-table depth can be used to diagnose the saturated fraction in a gridcell using TopModel, and this fraction can be used for some of the biogeochemical processes represented, such as methane fluxes. High-resolution, 3-dimensional groundwater models have also been coupled into climate models, but these require extensive input data and are prohibitive to run at a global scale. Ongoing work is attempting to include a reduced-order version of these models to enhance computational efficiency.\nAnother avenue is to represent subgrid heterogeneity explicitly. With collaborators, I included a representation of hillslope-scale topographic gradients, TiHy (Tiled-hillslope Hydrology), into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) land model (LM3). LM3-TiHy models one or more representative hillslope geometries for each gridcell by discretizing them into land model tiles hydrologically coupled along an upland-to-lowland gradient. Each tile has its own surface fluxes, vegetation, and vertically-resolved state variables for soil physics and biogeochemistry. In marginally wet regions around the globe, LM3-TiHy simulates shallow groundwater in lowlands, leading to higher evapotranspiration, lower surface temperature, and higher leaf area compared to uplands in the same gridcells. Moreover, more than four-fold larger soil carbon concentrations are simulated globally in lowlands as compared with uplands. With further improvements, the model could provide a new approach to investigating the vulnerability of Boreal peatland carbon in ESMs.",

            "abstract": "Mine tailings are typical highly metal contaminated areas with very scarce vegetation. They are affected by intensive rain and wind erosion processes, thus representing a source of environmental and health hazard. Due to their large area and high level of contamination, conventional remediation techniques are not appropriate, and phytostabilization has emerged as an alternative technique during the last decade. The legume plant Anthyllis vulneraria has been identified as a pionner plant to revegetalize mining sites from South of France where an experimental site has been set up for 10 years. Our objective was to clarify the role of Anthyllis vulneraria in the distribution and speciation of Cd and Zn in the soil. For that, we used a combination of micro X-ray fluorescence (µXRF) and micro X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (µXANES) combined to Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (EXAFS).\nResults showed that the vegetation process had homogeneized the metal distribution in the soil compared to unvegetalized soil, and had decreased the Zn and Cd amount in the surface soil. Undisturbed cross-sections of soils showed that the top of the rhizosphere was highly enriched with organic matter after 10 years of vegetalization. Cd and Zn forms, mainly identified as CdCO3 and ZnCO3 in the unvegetalized soil, did not change significantly in the bulk rhizosphere but investigations at the micrometer scale allowed the identification of Cd and Zn organic phases in the upper part, probably related to the shoots decomposition, and thus to the organic matter recycling. At the close vicinity of the roots, some minor organic metallic forms were found whilst CdCO3 and ZnCO3 minerals were still present, thus highlighting the low direct impact of the roots in the soil. Finally, this study indicated that the direct impact of the plant on Cd and Zn speciation in the soil was weak, while an indirect effect resulting from shoots decomposition could be observed.",

They contain information about the integrated history of the ice-dynamics since their deposition, and can be used to infer accumulation rate, melt-rate, ice rheology and ice-thickness history. This paper will examine how this principle meets with practice, with the aim of seeing how well we can answer the following questions.\nHow should data best be presented to modellers? The geometrical information in radar layers is completely encoded in their slope at any point, and these slopes are the raw data from which line picks are made. The implication is that models should be matched against slope data, rather than reconstituted picks, as the picking method has the potential to introduce systematic errors that are difficult to account for in any inversion process. The choice of data style presented to model has implications for the following questions.\nHow accurately can we reconstitute accumulation rate and thickness variations in space and in time? What are the prospects for inverting for ice rheological parameters? Which other techniques can be usefully used with isochrone layes to improve these estimates? The answers to these questions depend both on the dynamics and mechanics of the problem, and also on the data errors in the radar layers.",

In general, trace element depleted mid-ocean ridge basalts, with low Sr and Pb isotope values (but high εNd and εHf), release mantle-derived noble gases characterised by 3He/4He ~8 ± 1RA, (21Ne/22Ne)ex ~0.06 and 40Ar/36Ar ≥ 10,000 with CO2 and N2 having δ13C~-5‰ and δ15N ~-5‰, respectively. In contrast, enriched intraplate lavas possess higher 3He/4He (up to 50RA), lower (21Ne/22Ne)ex ~0.035 and 40Ar/36Ar ≤ 10,000 with generally higher but variable δ13C and δ15N. These isotopic attributes of mantle-derived volatiles can be exploited to map the extent, and mixing characteristics, of enriched (plume) mantle with depleted asthenospheric mantle ± the effects of over-riding lithosphere and/or crust.\nThe East African Rift System (EARS) is superimposed upon two massive plateaux – the Ethiopia and Kenya domes – regarded as geophysical manifestations of a superplume source, a huge thermochemical anomaly originated at the core-mantle boundary and providing dynamic support for the plateaux. We present new volatile isotopic and relative abundance data (on the same samples) for geothermal fluids (He-CO2-N2), lavas (He-Ne-Ar) and xenoliths (He-Ne-Ar-CO2-N2) which provide an unprecedented overview of the distribution of mantle volatiles of the Ethiopia Dome, from the Red Sea via the Afar region and Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) to the Turkana Depression. Notably, peaks in geothermal fluid 3He/4He (16RA) and δ15N (+6.5‰) are coincident within the MER but the maximum δ13C (-0.78‰) lies ~100 km to the south. Highs in 3He/4He (14RA), δ13C (~-1‰) and δ15N (+3.4‰) for mafic crystals occur in the Afar region ~ 500km to the north. We assess the significance of the off-set in these volatile isotope signals, for sampling volatile heterogeneity in the plume source and/or the relative sensitivity of different volatiles to admixture of plume- with asthenospheric and lithospheric mantle. These results are contrasted with volatile data from the Kenya Dome where the plume signal is muted and the lithospheric mantle exerts a stronger control on geothermal/lava volatile characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The accelerated warming Arctic climate may alter the surface energy balance locally and regionally of which a changing land surface temperature (LST) is a key indicator. Modelling current and anticipated changes of the surface energy balance requires an understanding of the spatio-temporal interactions between LST and land cover. This paper investigated the accuracy of MODIS LST V5 1 km level 3 product and its spatio-temporal sensitivity to land cover properties in a Canadian High Arctic permafrost landscape. Land cover ranged from fully vegetated moss/segde grass tundra to sparsely vegetated bare soil and barren areas. Daily mean MODIS LST were compared to in-situ radiometer measurements over wet tundra for three summers and two winters in 2008, 2009, and 2010. MODIS LST showed an accuracy of 1.8°C and a RMSE of 3.8°C in the total observation period including both summer and winter. Agreement was lowest during summer 2009 and freeze-back periods which were associated with prevailing overcast conditions. A multi-year anomaly analysis revealed robust spatio-temporal patterns taking into account the found uncertainty and different atmospheric conditions. Summer periods with regional mean LST larger than 5°C showed highest spatial diversity with four distinct anomaly classes. Dry ridge areas heated up most whereas wetland areas and dry barren surfaces with high albedo were coolest. Mean inter-annual differences of LST anomalies for different land cover classes were less than 1°C. However, spatial pattern showed fewer positive anomalies in 2010 suggesting differences in surface moisture due to inter­annual differences in the amount of end-of-winter snow. Presented summer LST anomalies might serve as a baseline against which to evaluate past and future changes in land surface properties with regard to the surface energy balance. Sub-temporal heterogeneity due to snow or ice on/off as well as the effect of subpixel water bodies has to be taken into account. A multi-sensor approach combining thermal satellite measurements with high-resolution optical and radar imagery therefore promises to be an effective tool for a dynamic, process-based ecosystem monitoring scheme.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial sediment transport is constructed in different ways for differing time scales. For event time, we seek to understand the physics of sediment transport. Most effort has been expended on this problem, which directly leads to understanding of local changes in river channels and the creation of certain river habitat features. For regime time, it is more pertinent to ask for the sediment budget at reach scale, whence we may come to understand the morphodynamics of the reach. This is often the principal river management problem, though it has not often been recognized as such. On time scales of river and landscape evolution, the topographic profile of the river assumes primary importance and sediment supply from the land surface is the primary (and ultimate) driver of change. The relevant time scales, for river systems of intermediate size (104km2), are of order 1a, 10a and 104a. In view of these times, it is unlikely that any major river is in secular equilibrium along its entire course. Events across time scales are, of course, linked. River morphodynamical change is driven by major evolutionary effects on the river system, such as climate change, seismic events, or dam construction, that drive secular changes in sediment supply. On the other hand, computing the sediment budget requires event-scale input of information – derived from observations or physical calculations – at some points in the system. Accordingly, we attempt to make the links across scales by embedding our understanding of transport physics in numerical models in which events at one scale predict outcomes over longer time scales.",

            "abstract": "Many large rivers are undergoing renewed and increasing anthropogenic-induced change as water diversions, new dams and greater water demands place enhanced stresses on these river basins. Examples of rivers undergoing significant change include the Amazon, Madeira, Nile, Yangtze and Mekong, with considerable ongoing debate raging as to the long-term geomorphic and ecological effects of major anthropogenic interventions. Assessing the effects of such change in large rivers is demanding, one reason being that sediment transport is often exceedingly difficult to measure, and thus data needed to inform the debate on the impact of anthropogenic change is frequently lacking.\nHere, we report on one aspect of research being undertaken as part of STELAR-S2S – Sediment Transfer and Erosion on Large Alluvial Rivers – that is seeking to better understand the relationship between climate, anthropogenic impacts and sediment transport in some of the world’s largest rivers. We are using the Lower Mekong River as our study site, with the Mekong delta being one of only three in the world classified by the IPCC as ‘extremely vulnerable’ to future changes in climate. Herein, we describe details of bedload sediment flux estimation using repeated high-resolution multibeam echo sounder (MBES) bathymetric mapping along the Lower Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers in Cambodia. We are using MBES to quantify the spatial variation in sediment transport both along and also across the river at 11 sites in the study area. Predicted increases in the extraction of sediment from the river through sand dredging are thought likely to cause a significant decrease in downstream sediment flux, and future dam construction along the Mekong main channel potentially offers another source of significant change. These field results will be set in the light of these anthropogenic drivers on sediment flux in the Mekong River and their possible future effects on bar formation and channel migration.",

This, in conjunction with the strong winds produced by Tropical Storm Lee created conditions that made possible the Bastrop County Complex Fire in September 2011. These record-breaking wildfires burned over 95% of the 6,565-acre Bastrop State Park (BSP). Since 2003, BSP had been using prescribed burns as a management practice to reduce fuel load and prevent high severity wildfires. Although these prescribed fires did not prevent the 2011 wildfires they may have mitigated their effects. This study considered the effect of prescribed burn history and wildfire burn severity on vegetation recovery in BSP since the 2011 wildfire. The hypotheses of this study are that prescribed burn history and wildfire burn severity separately and jointly have affected post wildfire vegetation. To test these hypotheses, data were collected in 2013 from 46 plots across BSP using the Fire Effects Monitoring and Inventory (FIREMON) protocol to determine herbaceous plant density, shrub density, overstory density, and midstory tree density. Data were analyzed using analyses of variance (ANOVA) to determine the effects of prescribed fire and wildfire severity on these vegetation measurements. It was found that more severely burned plots had more herbaceous plants, fewer midstory trees, and lower shrub densities than less severely burned plots. Contrary to an initial hypotheses, there were few relationships between prescribed burn history and wildfire effects. The only significant effect detected for prescribed burning was the positive effect of prescribed fire on midstory tree density, but only for plots that were not severely burned in the wildfire. In this system, burn severity had a greater effect on post-wildfire vegetation than prescribed burns.",

We have undertaken an integrated watershed and permafrost research program at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (75°N, 109°W) in paired watershed-lake systems to assess the impact of these changes. Research has captured hydrological changes resulting from exceptional warmth, and permafrost degradation and disturbance.\nResults highlight the contrasting effect of thermal (deeper soil thaw) versus physical perturbation (slope failures and permafrost degradation). Thermal perturbation applies to most of the landscape, and results indicate that ground ice melt alters flow and mobilizes solutes for a number of years following a single warm year. These effects are measureable at the slope-catchment scale, especially during baseflow. By contrast, physical disturbance is highly localized and produces high sediment and particulate carbon erosion from slopes, but downstream particulate delivery is dependent on surface connectivity. Recovery from disturbances appears to occur rapidly, and continued geomorphic change and new slope channels result in sustained delivery of particulates to channels. The result is increased long term landscape heterogeneity with respect to erosion compared to the pre-disturbance condition. Downstream channel response to particulate loading further dampens the response to physical disturbance through channel storage of material. Hence, at the larger watershed scale, the effect of physical perturbation is minimal in the initial years of recovery.\nThese results point to a landscape that has been substantially impacted by recent hydrological and permafrost changes. Understanding and distinguishing these impacts provides a basis for systematically evaluating biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem responses in aquatic settings.",

We developed a new SOC model, \"Carbon, Organisms, Rhizosphere and Protection in the Soil Environment\" (CORPSE), to examine the net effect of priming and protection in response to rising atmospheric CO2, and conducted simulations of rhizosphere priming effects at both ecosystem and global scales. At the ecosystem scale, the model successfully captured and explained disparate SOC responses at the Duke and Oak Ridge free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments. We show that stabilization of \"new\" carbon in protected SOC pools may equal or exceed microbial priming of \"old\" SOC in ecosystems with readily decomposable litter (e.g. Oak Ridge). In contrast, carbon losses owing to priming dominate the net SOC response in ecosystems with more resistant litters (e.g. Duke). For global simulations, the model was fully integrated into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) land model LM3. Globally, priming effects driven by enhanced root exudation and expansion of the rhizosphere reduced SOC storage in the majority of terrestrial areas, partially counterbalancing SOC gains from the enhanced ecosystem productivity driven by CO2 fertilization. Collectively, our results suggest that SOC stocks globally depend not only on temperature and moisture, but also on vegetation responses to environmental changes, and that protected C may provide an important constraint on priming effects.",

            "abstract": "The response of tropospheric ozone to changing atmospheric circulation is poorly understood owing to a lack of reliable long-term observations. There is great current interest in quantifying the extent to which observed ozone trends over recent decades at northern mid-latitude sites are driven by changes in precursor emissions versus shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns. In this talk, I present a detailed analysis of the impact of interannual to decadal climate variability on tropospheric ozone, based on observations and a suite of chemistry-climate model hindcast simulations. Decadal shifts in circulation regimes modulate long-range transport of Asian pollution, leading to very different seasonal ozone trends at Mauna Loa Observatory in the subtropical Pacific Ocean. During autumn, the flow of ozone-rich air from Eurasia towards Hawaii strengthened in the mid-1990s onwards, as a result of the positive phase of the Pacific North American pattern, increasing ozone at Mauna Loa. During spring, weakening airflow from Asia in the 2000s, tied to La-Niña-like decadal cooling in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, offsets ozone increases at Mauna Loa that otherwise would have occurred due to rising Asian emissions. The circulation-driven variability in Asian pollution over the subtropical North Pacific regions manifests mainly as changes in the mean as opposed to in transport events. At high-elevation Western U.S. sites, intrusions of stratospheric ozone deep into the troposphere during spring exert a greater influence than Asian pollution, particularly on the high tail of observed surface ozone distribution. We show that year-to-year variability in springtime high-ozone episodes measured in Western U.S. surface air is tied to known modes of climate variability, which modulate meanders in the polar frontal jet conducive to deep stratospheric ozone intrusions. Specifically, the La Niña-related increase in the frequency of deep stratospheric intrusion events plays a greater role on western U.S. surface ozone variability than the El Niño-related increase in lower stratospheric ozone burden. Finally, I will discuss the implications of these findings for detecting and attributing long-term ozone trends in free tropospheric and surface air.",

            "abstract": "Fluid flow through faults must be considered in many applications including geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2), deep storage of hazardous waste, groundwater contamination, and petroleum engineering. In the case of CO2 storage, the presence of faults is of concern, because they can act as leakage pathways. Therefore, modeling tools that can accurately and efficiently quantify fluid leakage through faults in basin-scale models are necessary. In basin-scale models, the flow around and through faults is a local-scale process and this local-scale variation is important when determining leakage rates. We present a multi-scale modeling approach based on embedding local-scale analytical solutions within basin-scale numerical models.\nAt the local scale, steady-state analytical solutions that represent fluid flow in the vicinity of leaky faults, including any vertical flow effects, are derived. Using both numerical simulations and analytical solutions, an empirical model representing fault properties, permeabilities and widths, is also developed. The combination of this empirical fault model and the analytical solutions captures the local-scale effects of leakage through faults.\nThe local-scale model is used within a multi-scale modeling framework to determine the flow in and around faults and the associated local-scale pressure and saturation corrections that are applied to the coarse model. Here, a fault is viewed as a 2-D surface on one side of a coarse-scale grid block. The corrections relate local-scale pressure and saturation at the fault to coarse-scale pressures and saturations in numerical grid blocks. The corrections are used to determine the vertical and lateral flow in the fault and horizontal flows perpendicular and parallel to the fault in the grid block. At every coarse-scale time step, the local-scale fault model is implemented using the coarse-scale information from the previous time step. The resulting leakage rates and pressure and saturation corrections are updated in the coarse-scale model by modifying the coefficients of the coarse model.\nSimulations using this multi-scale model will be shown for (1) a fault that extends through a single grid block, and (2) a fault that extends through multiple grid blocks.",

            "abstract": "Fires are an intrinsic disturbance factor over the boreal regions. Fire impacts ecosystem biophysical properties and carbon stocks, and over long time scales, species composition and fires have strong interactions. The contemporary carbon sink in the Northern Hemisphere is partly related to the forest recovery from the legacy of historical fire disturbances. However very little is known on the relative contributions to the current-day carbon sink from past fires that occurred at different times in the recent history. In the present study we develop a novel conceptual approach to quantify the decadal contributions of fires during the 20th century to the carbon balance of the early 21st century, by modelling the legacy sink created by decadal cohorts of past fires. This quantification is realized by conducting a suite of simulations using the ORCHIDEE global dynamic vegetation model, in which the prognostic SPITFIRE fire module was turned off in each decade sequentially during the 20th century, and turned before and after, to account for carbon storage recovery. The vegetation dynamics interact with fires via the dynamic vegetation module of ORCHIDEE, in which fire impacts vegetation mortality and tree-grass competition. We found that the existence of fires reduces the forest coverage in the transitional forest-grassland zone around 45oN-50oN region over central Asia. In this region, the existence of recurrent fire acts to lower equilibrium biomass and soil carbon stocks. Historical fire disturbances and the resulting forest successional dynamics contribute a legacy to the boreal carbon sink during the period 2010-2011, with the lagged sink effects of fires that happened in the recent three decades accounting for over 70% of the total fire-induced sink during 2010-2011. Most of current sink from past fires is contributed by fires with moderate frequency with fire return intervals of 10-100 years.",

            "abstract": "Forests are globally important contributors to carbon storage and release, and have strong regional leverage on surface energy balance and water fluxes. Highly uncertain feedbacks to climate change from dynamic shifts in forest distributions are increasingly incorporated into Earth system models, but lack data for parameterizations and quantitative benchmarks. We established the Alpine Treeline Warming Experiment at Niwot Ridge, CO, to examine effects of climate warming on tree seedling establishment near the lower limit of subalpine forest, at upper treeline, and in the alpine. We use infrared heaters to increase surface temperatures, and to lengthen the growing season. We also watered some plots to distinguish effects due to higher temperatures from those due to drier soil. We used meta-population models parameterized with data from the experiment and from the literature to assess impacts of warming on tree population sizes over time.\nAveraged over 4 years, heating elevated soil temperatures, slightly reduced soil moisture, and advanced snowmelt. Heated and watered plots were not systematically wetter or drier than controls, as intended. Preliminary analyses show that in the forest, heating reduced germination for two species and, in most years, had no or negative effects on survival to 2 years, while watering increased demographic rates, consistent with expectations of reduced recruitment at lower elevations with warming and drying. At treeline, heating also reduced germination, but had year-dependent effects on survival to 2 years. In the alpine, contrary to expectations, experimental heating did not increase germination or survival, while watering increased survival to two years. Changing the seedling survival consistent with our experiment, and keeping all other parameters constant, we found strong effects of heating and watering on modeled population sizes. These effects vary across the three elevations. Due to timescales involved in tree growth, we find large lags between onset of climate changes and tree population responses. Linking field experiments directly with models of population change across the landscape provides a novel approach to projecting changes in altitudinal distributions of forest with climate change over time.",

            "abstract": "In a few decades, managers of Earth's Critical Zones (biota, humans, land, and water) will be challenged to double food and fiber production and diminish adverse effects of management on the wider environment. To meet these challenges, an array of scientific approaches is being used to increase understanding of Critical Zone functioning and evolution, and one amongst these approaches needs to be long-term soil field studies to move us beyond black boxing the belowground Critical Zone, i.e., to further understanding of processes driving changes in the soil environment. Long-term soil experiments (LTSEs) provide direct observations of soil change and functioning across time scales of decades, data critical for biological, biogeochemical, and environmental assessments of sustainability; for predictions of soil fertility, productivity, and soil–environment interactions; and for developing models at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Unfortunately, LTSEs globally are not in a good state, and they take years to mature, are vulnerable to loss, and even today remain to be fully inventoried. Of the 250 LTSEs in a web-based network, results demonstrate that soils and belowground Critical Zones are highly dynamic and responsive to human management. The objective of this study is to review the contemporary state of LTSEs and consider how they contribute to three open questions: (1) can soils sustain a doubling of food production in the coming decades without further impinging on the wider environment, (2) how do soils interact with the global C cycle, and (3) how can soil management establish greater control over nutrient cycling. While LTSEs produce significant data and perspectives for all three questions, there is on-going need and opportunity for reviews of the long-term soil-research base, for establishment of an efficiently run network of LTSEs aimed at sustainability and improving management control over C and nutrient cycling, and for research teams that provide for generation to generation transfer of new and historic LTSEs.",

Furthermore, the distribution, structure, and heterogeneity of the measurements themselves pose challenges that limit the scalability of data analysis using traditional approaches. Methods for developing science data processing pipelines, distribution of scientific datasets, and performing analysis will require innovative approaches that integrate cyber-infrastructure, algorithms, and data into more systematic approaches that can more efficiently compute and reduce data, particularly distributed data. This requires the integration of computer science, machine learning, statistics and domain expertise to identify scalable architectures for data analysis.\nThe size of data returned from Earth Science observing satellites and the magnitude of data from climate model output, is predicted to grow into the tens of petabytes challenging current data analysis paradigms. This same kind of growth is present in astronomy and planetary science data.\nOne of the major challenges in data science and related disciplines defining new approaches to scaling systems and analysis in order to increase scientific productivity and yield. Specific needs include: 1) identification of optimized system architectures for analyzing massive, distributed data sets; 2) algorithms for systematic analysis of massive data sets in distributed environments; and 3) the development of software infrastructures that are capable of performing massive, distributed data analysis across a comprehensive data science framework.\nNASA/JPL has begun an initiative in data science to address these challenges. Our goal is to evaluate how scientific productivity can be improved through optimized architectural topologies that identify how to deploy and manage the access, distribution, computation, and reduction of massive, distributed data, while managing the uncertainties of scientific conclusions derived from such capabilities.

DOC concentrations ranged from 1.8 to 13.9 mg L-1, with the lowest values in headwater 1st and 2nd order streams, and the highest values associated with flood irrigation and storm events. DOC concentrations and compositions at or near the mouth (3rd and 4th order streams) appear to be primarily influenced by land use (agriculture) in the lower reaches, thereby masking much of the headwater chemistry (1st and 2nd order streams). Temporally, DOC composition and chemistry is distinctly linked to three hydrologic regimes: 1) winter baseflow in which water and organic matter (OM) primarily derives from subsurface flow through aged soil organic matter, 2) spring storms in which fresher OM is released from surface flow/soils, and 3) summer irrigation in which field runoff can leach OM directly from plant tissues and surface soils. Sampling of the latter revealed large pulses of compositionally distinct DOC that drives stream biogeochemistry in the summer. Optical proxies exhibited varying degrees of correlation with chemical measurements, with strongest relationships to DOC and dissolved lignin (r2 = 0.95 and 0.73, respectively) and weaker relationships to carbon-normalized lignin yields and C:V (r2 from 0.31 to 0.42). Demonstrating the importance of matching (time) scale to processes, we found no relationship between dissolved lignin concentrations and total suspended sediments (TSS) synoptically, in contrast to the strong relationship observed temporally at the mouth. In contrast, a strong relationship (r2 = 0.56) between carbon-normalized lignin yields and ratios of cinnamyl to vanillyl phenols evident synoptically was not apparent at the mouth. In both cases, the common element appears to be processing time in the stream, with time to partition generating the lignin:TSS relationship, while time for degradation and source inputs masks the latter relationship.",

Such episodes can also yield disparate responses for individual DOM moieties which may not be apparent otherwise. Here, we highlight key shifts in stream water DOM in response to episodic events. The study site is an intensively-studied forested watershed (12 ha) located in the Piedmont region of Maryland, USA. DOM has been characterized for stream water and 10 distinct watershed DOM sources over a period of seven years (2008-2014). Stream water sampling was performed for storms using automated ISCO samplers and manual grab samples during baseflow. The composition of DOM was characterized using a variety of UV and fluorescence metrics. Data were also available from an in-stream, high-frequency (15-30 minutes) UV-vis based sensor. Hydrologic flow paths for stream runoff were identified using an end-member mixing model. While small to moderate storms yielded sharp increases in stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and aromatic and humic constituents, a pronounced dilution of DOC was observed for peak flows associated with tropical storms. This dilution pattern did not, however, extend to aromatic and humic DOM constituents suggesting that while rainfall input may outpace DOC supply, the composition and/or sources of DOM may not change. Usually, stormflow also resulted in a decrease in the proportion of protein-like DOM, but a different response was observed for storms following dry, hydrologically-disconnected periods that produced a sharp increase in protein-like DOM. The increase was attributed to the “first-flush” of labile DOM that had mineralized and accumulated in streams over the preceding dry period. Similar pulse increases in protein-like DOM for stream runoff were also observed for a few low-intensity, long-duration storms that occurred early in autumn. This DOM response likely resulted from leaching of DOM from freshly-fallen leaves. Understanding these “hot moments” of DOM provides crucial insights into the leaching kinetics and sensitivity of individual DOM chemical species and can help separate out the various mechanisms that regulate the supply and transport of DOM within watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Landscapes and channel networks are dynamic systems, often characterized by immense variability in time and space. Systematic shifts in hydrologic, geomorphic, or ecologic drivers can cause a cascade of changes within the system, which may fundamentally alter the way the system itself functions. Due to variability in resilience and resisting forces throughout the landscape, this cascade of changes may manifest in different ways within any given system. Humans may also exert considerable influence, often amplifying or damping system response. We illustrate the cascading effects of non-stationary hydrology and geomorphology in the Minnesota River Basin (MRB), a 44,000 km2 natural laboratory in which pervasive landscape disturbance has been triggered by several well-documented events. Rapid base-level lowering 13,400 YBP along the mainstem Minnesota River created a wave of incision, which continues to propagate up tributary channel networks. Temperature and precipitation have changed significantly in the MRB over the past century with rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns and an increase in heavy rainfall events. Streamflow has changed drastically and variably throughout the basin with 5% exceedance flows increasing 60-100% in recent decades, as increases in precipitation have been amplified by land management and artificial drainage. Increases in channel width and depth have occurred variably in the mainstem Minnesota River, the actively incising lower (knick zone) reaches of tributaries, and the low gradient, passively meandering reaches above the knick zones. Altered hydrologic regimes and channel morphologies, combined with increased sedimentation and nutrient loading have adversely affected aquatic biota via disruption of life cycles and habitat degradation. Existing landscape, water quality, and flood risk models are poorly equipped to deal with the cascading effects of non-stationarity and therefore may grossly over- or under-predict environmental impacts of climate change or human land and water management decisions. We present a simple model in which systematic changes can be propagated through a landscape in a topographically and ecologically-sensitive manner as an initial step towards a robust, landscape scale morphodynamic routing model.",

            "abstract": "According to the literature biochemical catalyses are limited in their actions because of the complex macroscopic and, above all, microscopic structures of cell wall that limit mass transportation (i.e. 3D structure). Our study on energy crop showed that plant digestibility increased by modifying the 3D cell wall microstructure. Results obtained were ascribed to the enlargement, such as effectively measured, of the pore spaces between cellulose fibrils. Therefore we postulated that 3 D structure of plant residues drives degradability in soil determining its recalcitrance in short time.\nHere we focused on the drivers of short-term decomposition of organic matter (plant residues) in soils evaluating the architecture of plant tissues, captured via measurements of the microporosiy of the cell walls. Decomposition rates of a wide variety of biomass types were studied conducting experiments in both aerobic and anaerobic environments. Different analytical approaches were applied in order to characterize biomass at both chemical and physical level. Combined statistical approaches were used to examine the relationships between carbon mineralization and chemical/physical characteristics. The results revealed that degradation was significantly and negatively correlated with the micro-porosity surface (MiS) (surface of pores of 0.3-1.5 nm of diameter). The multiple regressions performed by using partial least square model enabled describing biomass biodegradability under either aerobic and anaerobic condition by using micro-porosity and aromatic-C content (assumed to be representative of lignin) as independent variables (R2 =0.97, R2cv =0.95 for aerobic condition; R2 =0.99, R2cv =0.98 for anaerobic condition, respectively). These results corroborate the hypothesis that plant tissues are physically protected from enzymatic attack by a microporous “sheath” that limit penetration into cell wall, and demonstrate the key role played by aromatic carbon, because of its chemical protection of the other cell wall polymers and its contribution to the three-dimensional (3D) cell wall structure.",

            "abstract": "Although the aurora to a large degree behave similar in the two hemispheres, recent simultaneous observations of the global aurora from space have revealed that sometimes rather large intensity and location asymmetries are present in the global aurora. From event studies using e.g. conjugate imaging, multiple mechanisms have been proposed to be responsible for the asymmetric aurora. However, we know very little about their general importance. We have investigated the general importance of an asymmetric solar wind dynamo. It has been suggested that the radial component of the IMF can modify the energy conversion between the solar wind and magnetosphere differently in the two hemispheres in a general sense. By looking at the global aurora using IMAGE WIC during carefully selected events minimally contaminated by other mechanisms affecting the two hemispheres differently, we find that the dusk side aurora depend oppositely on the radial IMF direction in the two hemispheres. These results are consistent with an asymmetric solar wind dynamo where the hemispheric preference is controlled by the radial IMF. This is the first study indicating the importance of the asymmetric solar wind dynamo in a general sense. A different mechanism, the asymmetric loading of magnetic flux during IMF By conditions is also expected to account for North-South asymmetries in the nightside global aurora. This will be investigated using a similar approach to establish the general importance of of this IMF By mechanism on the global aurora in the two hemispheres.",

            "abstract": "Although often characterized by an apparent low level of seismicity, areas of low-strain accumulation are subjected to considerable seismic and associated natural hazards. However, we are often unaware of these hazards, because in contrast to active plate boundaries, recurrence intervals of ground-rupturing earthquakes are typically on the order of thousands of years. Geodetic or seismicity records may thus not yet reflect full seismic cycles. Low-strain regions may occur in stable continental interiors or tectonically active intracontinental mountain belts, which often comprise areas of spatially disparate reverse and strike-slip faulting, up to thousands of kilometers away from plate boundaries. These regions may be shortened at rates on the order of centimeters per year, with no clear spatiotemporal pattern of seismicity, and single fault-slip rates may attain less than one to a few millimeters per year.\nThe Kyrgyz and Kazakh Tien Shan, the Mongolian Hangay or the Iranian Alborz mountains are prime examples that share these characteristics. These regions are located along the northern rim of the ongoing Indian-Eurasian or Arabian-Eurasian collision, but are hundreds of kilometers away from the corresponding plate boundaries. Historical earthquakes M > 7 are known from the Alborz mountains and several events with M > 8 are known from the northern Tien Shan and Mongolia – all with poorly constrained recurrence rates.\nWe review our ongoing tectonic studies of these areas, which differ in faulting mechanisms, the preservation potential of primary and secondary rupture evidence, and the level of population density and value concentrations. We use paleoseismic trenching, geomorphic and terrestrial LiDAR data analysis, and geochronology to gain insights into the complex deformation processes that govern these areas to better understand how present-day deformation is accommodated in areally extensive deformation zones in continental interiors.",

            "abstract": "Millennial-scale climate flip-flops called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles punctuated the last ice age. In the Greenland ice cores, they appear as large, rapid warming (interstadial) and cooling (stadial) episodes unlike anything else recorded in the last 120 thousand years. Sea ice has long been thought to play an important role in D-O cycles because of its strong influence on regional temperature and its ability to grow and melt rapidly in response to relatively weak forcings. Although some observational evidence exists to support this idea, it is not sufficient to constrain the characteristics of or mechanisms behind sea ice displacements during D-O cycles. This presentation will provide an overview of modelling experiments and high-resolution marine proxy data from the North Atlantic aimed at resolving some of these open questions. The modelling results point to a role for seasonal sea ice displacements in the Nordic Seas for creating the observed Greenland signals associated with D-O cycles. The high-resolution proxy data support this idea, and further suggest that the sea ice displacements are part of a coupled, transient climate response associated with changes in the thermohaline structure and stratification of the Nordic Seas, the existence of an Arctic-like cold halocline in the region, and the accessibility of the subsurface ocean heat reservoir to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Jupiter’s magnetosphere is a highly dynamic environment. Hundreds of reconnection events have been identified in Jupiter’s magnetotail through analysis of magnetic field and particle measurements collected by the Galileo spacecraft. Quasi-periodic behavior, suggestive of reconnection, has been intermittently observed on a ~2-3 day time scale in several data sets, including magnetic field dipolarizations, flow bursts, auroral polar dawn spots, and the hectometric radio emission. In this paper we review the present state of knowledge of Jovian magnetospheric dynamics. Throughout the discussion, we highlight similarities and differences to Saturn’s magnetosphere. For example, recent analysis of plasmoid signatures at both Jupiter and Saturn has established the role of tail reconnection in the overall mass and flux transport in the outer planet magnetospheres. The results for both Jupiter and Saturn suggest that the observed mass loss rate due to tail reconnection and plasmoid release is insufficient to account for the mass input rate from the moons Io and Enceladus, respectively. We also present new analysis in which we use the Michigan mSWiM propagated solar wind MHD model to estimate the solar wind conditions upstream of Jupiter. This information allows us to determine whether reconnection events occur preferentially during certain solar wind conditions, or whether there is evidence that the solar wind modulates the quasi-periodicity seen in the field dipolarizations and flow bursts.",

            "abstract": "3D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys consisting of 6 grids were conducted from October 2013 until April 2014 to delineate burials at the historic Mueschke Cemetery in Houston, Texas. The surveys were primarily to assist historians and archeologists from the Mueschke Cemetery Association and Lone Star College in locating some 13 postulated unmarked burials. Antenna with three frequencies were used: 100 MHz, 250 MHz and 1000 MHz. Most surveys were conducted with the 250 MHz Sensors and Software NOGGIN System which has a maximum penetration of about 3 m. Three methods were used to estimate the soil velocity for time-to-depth conversion: Common mid-point (CMP) surveys, time-to-known depth matching, and hyperbola fitting. All three methods gave an average velocity of 0.06 m/ns in the upper 2 m of the soil. The time-to-known depth method was accomplished by digging a trench (1.5 m deep by 1.5 m wide by 3 m long) about 10 m from the cemetery entrance using a back-hoe. Rebar was hammered horizontally into the trench wall at 0.25 m increments from depths of 1.5 m to 0.25 m. The excavation also allowed us to observe soil strata which transitions from loam, to silty clay to mostly clay with increasing depth. We used finite-difference, time-domain computer modeling to synthesize the response of two types of burials: vaulted or concrete enclosed (post-1940) and non-vaulted or casket only (pre-1940). Modeling results indicate that vaulted burials have a flattened apex signature while non–vaulted burials have signatures that are more hyperbolic. The data were processed using gain, dewow, background removal, filtering, and migration. Survey data over known burials show distinct diffractions and a rectangular shape–correspondent to the computer modeling results. Burials before 1940 have weaker diffractions which complicates their detection. Tree roots, clay patches, and rocks can also present anomalies that must be carefully investigated. Nonetheless, several strong burial-type anomalies have been identified. High amplitude areas are especially evident in depth slices from the 3D data volumes and indicate the locations of these suspected burials. GPR surveys and images have been successfully used at the historic Mueschke Cemetery to template known burials and provide leads on the locations of a number of unmarked burials.",

            "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis has evolved in more than 23 independent lineages of grasses as an adaptation to hot, sunny conditions. Geological records demonstrate that C4 grasses abruptly became ecologically dominant during the late Cenozoic across the tropical and temperate regions, transforming the Earth System and facilitating major faunal and floral radiations. However, although each C4 grass lineage originated and specialised in different environments, the importance of these divergent evolutionary histories for global ecology remains largely unknown. Here, we address this problem by compiling the first global map of grassy biomes based entirely upon ground-based vegetation surveys of dominant species. Our analysis shows that grasses dominate the ground layer across 40% of the vegetated land surface, with C4 grasses accounting for 60% of this area, and grassy biomes occurring under almost all climatic conditions. More than 98% of C3 grassy vegetation is dominated by the cold tolerant Pooideae lineage, which is replaced by C4 lineages at mean annual temperatures exceeding 15oC. The world’s C4 grassy vegetation is largely dominated by only four of the 23 independent C4 grass lineages, and these segregate strongly along global environmental gradients and across continents. The Chloridoideae lineage is globally important in dominating semi-arid environments with a long fire return interval. In contrast, although the Andropogoneae lineage dominates extremely wet regions with frequent fire in the Paleotropics and North America, the same niche space is dominated by Paspaleae in South America. Sorting of lineages along precipitation and fire gradients is strongly predicted by plant height. Our results demonstrate that the divergent histories of independent C4 grass lineages have constrained the assembly and functional traits of grassy biomes, with important implications for understanding how biome boundaries may shift in past and future environments.",

            "abstract": "Did humans affect global climate over the before the Industrial Era? While this question is hotly debated, the co-evolution of humans and the natural environment over the last 11,700 years had an undisputed role in influencing the development and present state of terrestrial ecosystems, many of which are highly valued today as economic, cultural, and ecological resources. Yet we still have a very incomplete picture of human-environment interactions over the Holocene. In order to address this, we combined a global dynamic vegetation model with a new model of preindustrial anthropogenic land cover change. We drive this integrated model a new synthesis of demographic, technological, and economic development over preindustrial time, and a database of historical urbanization covering the last 8000 years. We simulate natural vegetation and anthropogenic land use from 11,700 years before present to AD 1850 and compare these results with regional syntheses of pollen-based reconstructions of land cover.\nOur model results show that climate and tectonics controlled global land cover in the early Holocene. Shifts in forest biomes on the northern continents show an expansion of temperate tree types far to the north of their present day limits. By the early Iron Age (1000 BC), however, humans in Europe, East Asia, and Mesoamerica had a larger influence than natural processes on the landscape. Anthropogenic deforestation was widespread with most areas of temperate Europe and southwest Asia, east-central China, northern India, and Mesoamerica occupied by a matrix of natural vegetation, cropland and pastures. While we simulate fluctuations in human impact on the landscape, including periods of widespread land abandonment, e.g., during the Migration Period in Europe that following the end of the Western Roman Empire, approaching the Industrial Revolution nearly all of the landmasses of Europe and south and East Asia are dominated by anthropogenic activities. In contrast, the collapse of the aboriginal populations of the Americas following 15th century European contact leads to a period of ecosystem recovery. Initial comparisons with pollen-based land cover reconstructions in Europe suggest that the model is too late in simulating the first period of widespread deforestation, which occurs already during the Bronze Age (~2500 BC).",

            "abstract": "Sensors and imaging are changing the way we are measuring ecosystem behavior. Within short time frames, we are able to capture how organisms behave in response to rapid change, and detect events that alter composition and shift states. To transform these observations into process-level understanding, we need to efficiently interpret signals. One way to do this is to automatically integrate the data into ecosystem models. In our soil carbon cycling studies, we collect continuous time series for meteorological conditions, soil processes, and automated imagery.\nTo characterize the timing and clarity of change behavior in our data, we adopted signal-processing approaches like coupled wavelet/coherency analyses. In situ CO2 measurements allow us to visualize when root/microbial activity results in CO2 being respired from the soil surface, versus when other chemical/physical phenomena may alter gas pathways. While these approaches are interesting in understanding individual phenomena, they fail to get us beyond the study of individual processes.\nSensor data are compared with the outputs from ecosystem models to detect the patterns in specific phenomena or to revise model parameters or traits. For instance, we measured unexpected levels of soil CO2 in a tropical ecosystem. By examining small-scale ecosystem model parameters, we were able to pinpoint those parameters that needed to be altered to resemble the data outputs. However, we do not capture the essence of large-scale ecosystem shifts.\nThe time is right to utilize real-time data assimilation as an additional forcing of ecosystem models. Continuous, diurnal soil temperature and moisture, along with hourly hyphal or root growth could feed into well-established ecosystem models such as HYDRUS or DayCENT. This approach would provide instantaneous “measurements” of shifting ecosystem processes as they occur, allowing us to identify critical process connections more efficiently.",

Interpretation of the observed complex phenomena and understanding of their origins is impossible without advanced numerical models.

Such simulations allow us to determine physical processes hidden from direct observations. They also provide synthetic data for calibration of observational data and for developing and testing ideas for improved diagnostics.

            "abstract": "Sedimentary organic matter from Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Events is characterized by universally low δ15N values. This observation has generated significant curiosity in the paleoceanographic community and has resulted in several conceptual models that aim to explain the 15N-depletion. The unifying element in these hypotheses is widespread anoxia and a series of nitrogen and/or metal cycling feedbacks. To address these hypotheses I will examine an interval in the middle Turonian (92.0 to 90.8 Ma) that demonstrates the impacts of redox and climate variability on nitrogen cycle dynamics. New N-isotope measurements from ODP Site 1259, Demerara Rise (DR) reveal δ15N values that range from +0.2‰ to -3.5‰ and oscillate by 1.5‰ to 3‰ over 1.6 Ma. A new astronomical time scale reveals a strong ~100 ka cyclicity in δ15N with little variance at ~400 ka through the mid-Turonian. The highest δ15N values and the largest amplitude ~100 ka cycles are found within the proposed glacial interval and cooler sea surface temperatures. The persistence of the ~100 ka δ15N cycle and δ15N maxima suggests a strong link between oceanic ventilation/circulation, climate, and the oscillations in δ15N are readily explained by variations in oxidation and expansion in the extent of denitrification within anoxic intermediate waters. These data confirm the strong link between water column redox variability and low δ15N values, but the exact mechanism of the 15N-depletion remains elusive.",

Here I will review the work we have done to reconstruct seawater density gradients, which are related to flow via the thermal wind relation. We find support for the idea that the Last Glacial Maximum, and the Younger Dryas deglacial cold interval are associated with a weaker AMOC. However, the case seems more complicated for Heinrich events, the surges of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean that punctuated the last glacial period. While freshwater from the melting icebergs is thought to have interrupted the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, we infer a substantial reduction of flow during Heinrich Event 1, but little change during Heinrich Events 2 and 3, which occurred during an especially cold phase of the last glacial period. It may be that the freshwater forcing had little additional effect because glacial circulation was already weakened before the onset of Heinrich Events 2 and 3.",

(2014; IMA conference abstract). Previous work on the devolatilization history of these rocks (Bebout et al., 2013; Cook-Kollars et al., 2014; both in Chemical Geology) provides a petrologic and geochemical context for this study. Lithium is of interest as a tracer of fluid-rock interactions and because of its potential to isotopically fractionate during diffusional processes.\nAll garnets are almandine-rich with strongly decreasing MnO and increasing MgO toward rims. HREEs, Y, and Li also show strong zoning, with elevated concentrations in cores (15-50 ppm Li) and marked high-concentration anomalies (up to 117 ppm Li, 5500 ppm Y), with little or no major element shift, as growth annuli at which some garnets have elevated δ7Li. In all garnets, rutile inclusions appear abruptly at annuli and outward toward rims, accompanied by inclusions of a Ca- and LREE-rich phase and decreased Nb concentrations in garnet.\nThese relationships appear to reflect prograde garnet-forming reaction(s) that in part involved titanite breakdown to stabilize rutile, which resulted in delivery of more abundant Y and HREEs at surfaces of growing garnets to produce growth annuli. The co-enrichment of Li and Y+REEs is attributed to their mutual incorporation via a charge-coupled substitution (Carlson et al., 2014; American Mineralogist); thus the increased Li uptake is a passive consequence of the elevated concentrations of Y+REEs. Distributions of δ7Li are complex, with most garnets showing only subtle core-to-rim variation other than at Y+REE annuli. At annuli, some garnets display elevated δ7Li (by up to 8‰), while others in the same rock do not. Small-scale fluctuations in δ7Li may correlate with abrupt shifts in major and trace element concentrations, suggesting that changes in the minerals involved as reactants exert some control on the evolution of δ7Li.",

The plasma oscillations associated with those transients revealed that for the last two years the plasma density has been consistent with Voyager 1 having durably entered interstellar space.

Satellite instruments that perform multi-angle photopolarimetric measurements have the capability to provide these aerosol properties with sufficient accuracy. The only satellite instrument that provided a multi-year data set of multi-angle photopolarimetric measurements is the POLDER-3 instrument onboard the PARASOL microsatellite that operated between 2005-2013. PARASOL provides measurements of a ground scene under (up to) 16 viewing geometries in 9 spectral bands (3 for polarization). In order to make full use of the capability of PARASOL measurements of intensity and polarization properties of reflected light at multiple viewing angles and multiple wavelengths, we developed a retrieval algorithm that considers a continuous parameter space for aerosol microphysical properties (size distribution and refractive index) and properly accounts for land or ocean reflection by retrieving land and ocean parameters simultaneously with aerosol properties. Here, we present the key aspects of our PARASOL retrievals (inverse method, forward model, information content, cloud screening, computational aspects) as well as a validation of retrieved aerosol properties with ground-based measurements of the AERONET network. Also, we discuss required improvements for the next generation of polarimetric instruments dedicated to aerosol remote sensing and introduce a new spectropolarimetric instrument named SPEX. We will demonstrate the capabilities of SPEX based on ground based field measurements and characterization measurements in the labatory.",

            "abstract": "We live in a unique period in the history of the earth. A variety of indicators that describe characteristics of the global environment are following exponential trajectories, all rising together and all close to a point of rapid steepening. Furthermore, these curves are entangled and correlated; nearly all are tied in some manner to the human population curve. The challenge of finding solutions to the associated environmental and social problems seems almost insurmountable. The many human factors that have led to our domination on earth, and to this situation, must in turn be the same qualities that need to be better understood and then employed to work beyond those situations. Among these are our ability to form scenarios and act on them, and to predict, an ability that shows continued advances. Humans and other animals are quite adept at linearizing around the current moment and acting on limited short-term projections derived therefrom. For several reasons we are much less skillful at reacting to acceleration in the world around us, a feature we increasingly encounter. The prediction problem is so complex that for the foreseeable future we must rely strongly on observations and their analysis. To cope, new modes of understanding are required. The pace of cultural evolution now swamps that of genetic evolution (though the legacy of the latter still thoroughly pervades our lives). Networking is a crucial component of future progress. Knowledge is essential, and its continued acquisition must be vigorously advocated, across the entire spectrum of natural (physical) and social science and the humanities. Especially important in the sciences is continued improvement in the ability to bridge across disciplines to better integrate knowledge. In the face of so many simultaneous great challenges, there are well-grounded reasons for optimism, to be elaborated. This talk will draw from a variety of viewpoints and authors, and hopefully invoke the spirit of its gifted namesake, John Tyndall (1820-1893), and his passions for understanding the nature of the physical world, for mountaineering, and for tireless devotion to the communication of science and its findings to wide public audiences and to students.",

It will be discussed how the coarse-scale SMOS brightness temperatures are assimilated into the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-5) Catchment land surface model with a spatial ensemble Kalman filter to estimate surface and root-zone soil moisture, as well as other land surface variables. It will be shown that assimilating multi-angular SMOS brightness temperatures yields similar results as assimilating the derived (fitted) 40o-angle brightness temperatures, which mimic the future measurements from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. An evaluation of the SMOS data assimilation is performed using global assimilation statistics and in situ observations at SMAP core validation sites and sparse networks across the US.",

            "abstract": "Mineral interaction may affect the stabilisation of plant litter directly or indirectly after microbial decomposition and transformation. The importance of both organic matter sources may vary within the soil profile. This talk will synthesize recent work on the composition of mineral associated material in top- as well as subsoil horizons. We used density fractionation to isolate the mineral-associated fraction and characterised their composition by elemental analyses, NMR spectroscopy, analytical pyrolysis as well as nanoSIMS.\nOur results showed enrichment of mineral associated organic matter in subsoil horizons. However, material derived from new plant litter may be stabilised at similar rates in top- and subsoil horizons. N-containing compounds are enriched in the mineral associated fraction of subsoil horizons, indicating enrichment of microbial derived material with depth. Nano scale analyses showed that indeed plant-derived material may be associated with metal oxides in topsoil horizons, whereas the mineral associated organic matter in subsoil horizons may consist of microbial cells.\nOur results indicate that the nature of OM stabilised by mineral interactions is depth specific. Therefore, we suggest, that plant derived lignocellulosic material may be preserved by mineral interactions in topsoil given its incomplete degradation, thereby leading to the formation of functional groups and favouring adsorption to soil minerals. This is consistent with the higher state of lignin-degradation observed in topsoil horizons as compared to subsoil. At depth, where microorganisms are most likely energy limited, degradation of fresh plant litter may be complete, thereby diminishing the formation of lignocellulosic compounds capable of sorption onto metal oxides. As a result stabilised OM may consist primarily of microbial cells. Thus our study is consistent with the microbial efficiency-matrix stabilisation (MEMS) hypothesis, which says that microbial use efficiency determines stabilisation through interaction with the mineral phase.",

Here, we provide an overview of the SAR Earth System Data Records (ESDR) for Antarctica part of MEaSUREs that includes: the first complete map of surface ice vector velocity in Antarctica, a map of grounding line positions around Antarctica, ice velocity time series for selected regions: Ross and Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelves and associated drainage basins, the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica which is the largest contributor to sea level rise from Antarctica and the focus of rapid ice sheet retreat, and Larsen-B and -C ice shelves which is the second largest contribution to sea level rise from Antarctica. Other products include a database of ice shelf boundaries and drainage basins based on ice motion mapping and digital elevation models generated independently. Data continuity is a crucial aspect of this work and a fundamental challenge for the continuation of these products due to the lack of a dedicated interferometric mission on the cryosphere until the SAR mission under consideration between NASA and ISRO is approved.\nFour SAR missions ceased operations since IPY. CSA's RADARSAT-2 has provided important bridging data between these missions in Greenland and Antarctica. In 2014, ESA launched Sentinel-1a and JAXA launched ALOS-2 PALSAR, for which we will have limited data access. The Polar Space Task Group (PSTG) created by WMO has established a mandate to support cryospheric products from scientific research using international SARs which continues to play an active role in securing key data acquisitions over ice sheets.

            "abstract": "Systematic surveys of SW Pacific intraoceanic arcs have shown hydrothermal activity related to arc volcanoes is commonplace, e.g., the 1220 km long Kermadec arc (KA) is host to 33 volcanic centres where 25 are hydrothermally active, or an incidence of venting of 76%. Similarly, the 1310 km long Tofua arc has ~30% of all its volcanoes hydrothermally active and the 1360 km long Mariana arc 44%; a worldwide estimate has 43% of submarine arc volcanoes venting. The minimum density inferred for active submarine volcanic centers along intraoceanic arcs is 1.1/100 km. Venting related to the ~6900 km of submarine arcs is thus considered to be equivalent of ~9% of that associated with the ~60,000 km of MORs. The hydrothermal systems can be divided between volcanic (5%), magmatic-hydrothermal (70%) and water-rock dominated (~25%) systems. The chemical composition of discharing hydrothermal fluids from arc vent fields is much more heterogenous than those of MORs, with much higher magmatic gas contents (i.e., CO2 and SO2/H2S). Some vent fluids show evidence for subseafloor phase separation while others have higher than seawater values of Mg and SO4. The latter fluids commonly have pH values <2 with the deposition of native sulfur commonplace, a direct result of the disproportionation of S gases. Initial 226Ra/Ba values for recent mineralization are comparable for samples collected from volcanoes along the same arc, but differ between arcs. For example, Brothers and Clark volcanoes of the KA have 226Ra/Ba values of 22.7 ± 2.0 and 19.1 ± 0.4 Bq.g-1, respectively, compared to 47.4 ± 2.6 and 41.1 ± 0.5 Bq.g-1 for East Diamante and Nikko volcanoes, respectively, of the Mariana arc. Average spacing between KA volcanic centers increases from 30 km in the volcanic front of the southern KA, to 45 km in the mid-KA, to 58 km for those situated on the Kermadec Ridge in the northern KA. The centers are dominated by mafic cones in the south and by calderas on the Kermadec Ridge. The 15-23 km thick, southward moving Hikurangi Plateau is today subducting beneath the southern KA and may be responsible for the formation of large, volatile-rich magma chambers beneath the region, leading to prolonged volatile/fluid (and hence metal) transfer to hydrothermal systems, as exemplified by ≤20 ka old mineralization at Clark and ≤1.2 ka mineralization at Brothers.",

            "abstract": "Fifty years ago, Ross Taylor observed that the chemical composition of average continental crust and orogenic andesites were similar for many major and trace elements. However, almost immediately it was recognized that this generalization does not apply to many oceanic island arcs because they are too mafic and too depleted in the most incompatible elements, including K, Th, and U. Although intra-crustal differentiation and delamination might produce sufficiently evolved middle and lower crust, it is an inefficient way to increase incompatible element concentrations in intermediate magma. There are alternative processes. First, because the vast majority of arc rocks are volcaniclastic sediments rather than igneous rocks, mechanical mixing is a dominant process during arc evolution. Although its effects are similar to those of magma mixing and assimilation, it has fewer physical constraints and is more likely. The finer-grained the sediment, the more mixing is likely. Drilling in the Izu arc shows that the majority of the sediment is andesitic mud even though the majority of lavas are basalt and rhyolite. Volcaniclastic sediments may be a better match to continental crust than the lavas that were the original basis of the andesite model. Second, some reararc lavas and sediments are more like continental crust than those from volcanic fronts, and reararc crust is at least as thick. Third, aeolian dust in arc muds may be a larger mass fraction of recycled continental crust in oceanic arcs than the subducted pelagic sediment component in arc magmas. The net effect of these features adds nuance to the andesite model but is not enough to overcome the deficit of incompatible elements in Cenozoic oceanic arcs. Accreting them still makes the continents less continental in composition.",

Historically however, ice-flow models have been focused on assimilating surface velocities from satellite-based radar observations, to infer properties such as basal friction or the position of the bedrock. Here, we leverage a new methodology based on automatic differentation of the Ice Sheet System Model to assimilate surface altimetry data into a reconstruction of the past decade of ice flow on the North Greenland area. We infer corrections to boundary conditions such as basal friction and surface mass balance, as well as corrections to the ice hardness, to best-match the observed altimetry record. We compare these corrections between glaciers such as Petermann Glacier, 79 North and Zacchariae Isstrom. The altimetry signals exhibit very different patterns between East and West, which translate into very different signatures for the inverted boundary conditions. This study gives us greater insights into what differentiates different basins, both in terms of mass transport and ice-flow dynamics, and what could be\nthe controlling mechanisms behind the very different evolutions of these basins.",

            "abstract": "Mantle xenoliths bear the nominally anhydrous minerals olivine and pyroxene which may contain significant quantities of water and potentially provide information on the water contents (and therefore solidus and strength) of the mantle. Very high diffusivities of water (as H) in olivine and pyroxenes, however, will promote rapid equilibration of water between xenoliths and their host magma. If magma ascends from the mantle (> 40 km) on the order of 10 m/s (an upper bound), minimum timescales available for interaction between melt and xenoliths are on the order of hours. Assuming the fastest diffusivities measured in olivine and clinopyroxene [1,2], water could exchange on the mm to cm lengthscales that are relevant to xenoliths during ascent. In this case, xenoliths would no longer convey reliable information about the water concentration of the upper mantle. However, multiple diffusive mechanisms may operate in olivine [3] and clinopyroxene [4]; some of these mechanisms are orders of magnitude slower than others, and may prevent widespread diffusive exchange [3].\nTo explore the potential for water exchange between mantle xenoliths and their host magma, we report here data on xenolith-host magma pairs from two cinder cones in the Western US: MO1016 from the Mojave Desert, CA and GCB from the north rim of the Grand Canyon, AZ). The host magma at MO1016 is relatively dry, while the magma at GCB is relatively wet, with 1.3 vs. 3.2 wt% H2O as measured by SIMS in olivine-hosted melt inclusions. The water concentration of mantle xenolith clinopyroxenes (cpx) in MO1016 also contain lower H2O (< 225 ppm, by SIMS) than those in GCB (< 560 ppm, from [5]). If we apply an Al-dependent partition coefficient [6] to the cpx water concentrations, the predicted melt concentrations are nearly identical to those recorded in the host magma melt inclusions. This relationship is suggestive of complete diffusive exchange of xenolith cpx with the host magma. Future work will explore grain size, lengthscale and FTIR spectra variations to test for diffusive relationships and mechanisms.\n[1] Kohlstedt & Mackwell, 1998; [2] Woods, et al., 2000; [3] Padron-Navarta et al., 2014; [4] Ferriss et al., 2014; [5] Li et al., 2008.; [6] Tenner et al., 2009.",

            "abstract": "Increases in nitrogen (N) availability are often found to reduce decomposition rates of lignin-rich plant litter. However, the biological and chemical mechanisms that cause this inhibitory effect are still unclear. Our goal was to determine why increased N availability inhibits lignin decomposition. We tested two competing hypotheses: 1) decomposers degrade lignin to obtain protected N compounds and stop producing lignin-degrading enzymes if mineral N is available; or 2) chemical reactions between lignin and mineral N make lignin more recalcitrant, thereby limiting the ability of decomposers to break it down. To test these hypotheses, we followed changes in carbon (C) mineralization, microbial biomass and enzyme activities, litter chemistry, and lignin monomer concentrations over a 478-day laboratory incubation of three genotypes of maize stem internodes varying in litter quality. They were factorially combined with either an acidic or neutral pH sandy soil, with and without added N. Adding N reduced C mineralization, microbial biomass, and lignin-degrading enzyme activities in all treatments. Furthermore, our data on litter chemistry and lignin monomers indicate that N addition did not significantly alter the quantity or quality of lignin in any treatment. These results suggest that abiotic interactions between N and lignin compounds did not alter the ability of decomposers to breakdown lignin. Thus, we conclude that mineral N alters microbial enzyme and biomass dynamics, but not lignin chemistry during maize decomposition.",

This presentation covers a broad spectrum of the geotechnical and geohazard ways of mitigating disaster and conserving the natural environment using geophysical methods and emphasizes the contribution of geophysics to such issues. The presentation focusses on the usefulness of geophysical surveys in providing information to mitigate disasters, rather than the theoretical details of a particular technique. Several techniques are introduced at the level of concept and application. Topics include various geohazard and geoenvironmental applications, such as for earthquake disaster mitigation, preventing floods triggered by tremendous rain, for environmental conservation and studying the effect of global warming. Among the geophysical techniques, the active and passive surface wave, refraction and resistivity methods are mainly highlighted. Together with the geophysical techniques, several related issues, such as performance-based design, standardization or regularization, internet access and databases are also discussed. The presentation discusses the application of geophysical methods to engineering investigations from non-uniqueness point of view and introduces the concepts of integrated and quantitative. Most geophysical analyses are essentially non-unique and it is very difficult to obtain unique and reliable engineering solutions from only one geophysical method (Fig. 1). The only practical way to improve the reliability of investigation is the joint use of several geophysical and geotechnical investigation methods, an integrated approach to geophysics. The result of a geophysical method is generally vague, here is a high-velocity layer, it may be bed rock, this low resistivity section may contain clayey soils. Such vague, qualitative and subjective interpretation is not worthwhile on general engineering design works. Engineers need more quantitative information. In order to apply geophysical methods to engineering design works, quantitative interpretation is very important. The presentation introduces several case studies from different countries around the world (Fig. 2) from the integrated and quantitative points of view.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes, formed in permafrost-thaw depressions, are known sources of atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The organic carbon (OC) utilized in the production of these greenhouse gases originates from microbial decomposition of aquatic and terrestrial organic matter (OM) sources, including soils of the lakes' watersheds and permafrost thaw beneath the lakes. OM derived from permafrost thaw is particularly important given the thickness of permafrost soils underlying some lakes (typically 10-30 m in yedoma permafrost); however, OM heterogeneity remains a significant uncertainty in estimating how microbial decomposition responds to permafrost thaw. This study correlates OM and water-extractable OC (WEOC) composition with CH4 production potentials determined from anaerobic laboratory incubations. Samples were collected from 21 depths along a 5.9-m deep thermokarst-lake sediment core and 17 depths along an adjacent 40-m deep undisturbed yedoma permafrost profile near Vault Creek, Alaska. The Vault Lake core, collected in the center of a 3230 m2 first generation thermokarst lake, includes surface lake sediments, the talik (thaw bulb), and permafrost actively thawing beneath the lake. Soil OM composition was characterized using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) and the most prevalent compounds were grouped into six indices based on their likely origin. WEOC was characterized using fluorescence spectrometry. Using stepwise multiple linear regression analyses, we found that CH4 production was negatively correlated with WEOC aromaticity (p = 0.018) and fulvic acids (p = 0.027). CH4 production was positively correlated with lipids and carboxylic acids (p < 0.001), polysaccharides (p = 0.036) and the degree of WEOC humification (p = 0.013). Results suggest OM and WEOC composition can be correlated with CH4 production, indicating potential for model building to better predict greenhouse gas release from permafrost thaw.",

In this study the temporal variability in organic matter concentration and composition in a flashy local stream (Amity Creek, Duluth, MN) was analyzed over the course of 2.5 years in an attempt to better understand the delivery of organic matter from this stream into its receiving body (Lake Superior). Amity Creek is a relatively pristine (2% urban), primarily forested (71%) stream system with a watershed area of 42.6 km2 and an average slope of 9.6°. Sixty-five grab samples of whole water were taken from a sample site 0.3 km from the confluence of this stream with Lake Superior. The samples were analyzed for total, particulate, and dissolved organic carbon (TOC, POC, and DOC) concentrations and characterized by UV-Visible spectrophotometry. Selected samples were also analyzed for isotopic (stable and radiocarbon) signatures. UV-visible proxies (spectral slope, E2/E3 values) show variations with both season and flow. Spectral slopes are lower in spring, higher in the summer and early fall, and more variable in late fall. Higher S values are also seen in low flow periods (which often correspond to mid-to-late summer). E2/E3 values, inversely related to molecular weight, are lower in spring and fall relative to summer and also increase as flow decreases. TOC and DOC concentrations do not appear to vary systematically with season. They are correlated with stream flow in low to mid flow conditions but not at high flow. POC and DOC during high flow (in June 2008) have modern (post-1950s) radiocarbon signatures while DOC sampled during low flow (September 2008) has a pre-bomb radiocarbon signature (Δ14C of -13‰). DIC from the same September sample has a modern signature (Δ14C of 21‰), indicating that the DOC is not from concurrent primary production affected by a reservoir effect but from an older allochthonous source.",

            "abstract": "Saturn objectives for the remainder of the Cassini mission fall into four broad themes: (1) aftermath of a giant storm, (2) seasonal and temporal atmospheric change, (3) polar latitudes, and (4) Saturn’s interior. We list of the questions that Cassini will address in order below.\n(1) Aftermath of a giant storm. Planet-encircling storms occur every 20-30 years. The latest was in 2010-2011. Smaller storms occur every few months. The questions are: How deep are the roots of the storms? What chemicals do they dredge up from below? Do they change the winds in their vicinity? How do storms lead to ammonia depletion and holes in the clouds? What is the depth of the lightning flashes, and is it related to the freezing level of the water cloud? How do storms in the troposphere heat the stratosphere?\n(2) Seasonal and temporal atmospheric change. The 30-year seasonal cycle and the 11-year solar activity cycle are externally driven. In addition, Saturn generates its own 15-year cycle of equatorial winds and temperatures. The questions are: What are the sources and sinks of trace species (water, CO2, acetylene, ethane, diacetylene)? Will the equatorial atmosphere continue to oscillate with a 15-year period? How does Saturn's atmosphere respond to the solar cycle and the solar maximum?\n(3) Polar latitudes are the sites of energetic auroral activity, and they have a giant hexagon-shaped cloud feature and hurricane “eyes” that are centered on the poles. The questions are: What maintains the northern hexagon for more than 30 years? Are hurricane-like features unique to the polar regions? Is the atmosphere \"slipping\" relative to the magnetosphere? What does the aurora tell us about coupling between the magnetic field and atmosphere?\n(4) Saturn’s interior. The interior structure provides information about how the planet formed and evolved. The questions are: What does the gravity field reveal about the winds, composition, and equation of state of the interior? What does the internal magnetic field reveal about planetary dynamos and the internal rate of rotation? Has helium settled toward the center, and how has that affected the planet's thermal evolution? What do we learn from Saturn’s internal oscillations, which have been detected using the rings as a giant seismometer?",

            "abstract": "Weathering is one of the fundamental processes that sustain life on our planet. Physical weathering breaks down rock for soil production and chemical weathering is thought to operate as the ultimate long-term negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. There remains, however, uncertainty as to the relationship between chemical and physical weathering at very fast rates. If chemical weathering becomes kinetically limited at rapid erosion rates, as has been shown in a number of locations around the globe, then the fastest erosion rates will be associated with reduced chemical weathering. This has led to a debate as to whether tectonically active mountain ranges or rolling plains are the main source of CO2 drawdown through silicate weathering.\nAt the heart of this debate is the dearth of chemical weathering data at fast erosion rates. New cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rates from the West Coast of the New Zealand Southern Alps are among the fastest in the world and are linearly correlated with chemical weathering rates. The associated soil production rates reach an order of magnitude faster than previous estimates and far exceed the suggested maximum soil production rate. This suggests that very fast weathering and soil production is possible in such active landscapes and extreme climates. We investigate the controls on these rapid rates with a climate-driven soil production model. At the most basic level, soil production requires chemical weathering of primary minerals to secondary minerals. We apply soil production models with both exponential and hump-shaped dependencies on soil thickness. Mean annual temperature and precipitation are incorporated in the form of a modified Arrhenius equation that controls the maximum soil production rate.\nWhen applied to the Southern Alps, the model predicts very rapid soil production that matches the magnitude of the cosmogenic nuclide-derived rates. High annual precipitation in the Southern Alps supports rapid soil generation through increased chemical weathering rates and extensive vegetation cover. When applied more broadly, the climate-dependent soil production model suggests that actively eroding mountain belts may display a linear relationship between weathering and erosion in strongly orographic settings, such as in New Zealand’s Southern Alps.",

            "abstract": "The rings are changing before our eyes; structure varies on all timescales and unexpected things have been discovered. Many questions have been answered, but some answers remain elusive (see Cuzzi et al 2010 for a review). Here we highlight the major ring science progress over the mission to date, and describe new observations planned for Cassini’s final three years.\nRing Composition and particle sizes: The rings are nearly all water ice with no other ices – so why are they reddish? The C Ring and Cassini Division are “dirtier” than the more massive B and A Rings, as shown by near-IR and, recently, microwave observations. Particle sizes, from stellar and radio occultations, vary from place to place.\nRing structure, micro and macro: numerous spiral density waves and ubiquitous “self-gravity wakes” reveal processes which fostered planet formation in the solar system and elsewhere. However, big puzzles remain regarding the main ring divisions, the C Ring plateau structures, and the B Ring irregular structure.\nMoonlets, inside and out, seen and unseen: Two gaps contain sizeable moonlets, but more gaps seem to contain none; even smaller embedded “propeller” objects wander, systematically or randomly, through the A ring. Rubble pile ringmoons just outside the rings may escaped from the rings, and the recently discovered “Peggy” may be trying this as we watch.\nImpact bombardment of the rings: Comet fragments set the rings to rippling on century-timescales, and boulders crash through hourly; meanwhile, the constant hail of infalling Kuiper belt material has a lower mass flux than previously thought.\nOrigin and Age of the Rings: The ring mass and bombardment play key roles. The ring mass is well known everywhere but in the B Ring (where most of it is). New models suggest how tidal breakup of evolving moons may have formed massive ancient rings, of which the current ring is just a shadow.\nDuring its last three years, the Cassini tour profile will allow entirely new observations: direct measurement of the still-unknown ring mass; direct in-situ sampling of ring particle composition (targeting the iron- or carbon-based red nonicy component); and radar backscattering observations.\n Cuzzi, J.

            "abstract": "Most intra-oceanic arc volcanoes are composite edifices constructed primarily in the submarine environment, built up by volcaniclastic sediments derived from hydroclastic and pyroclastic processes at/near the summits, punctuated by occasional lava flows and intrusions. Of particular interest in the mode of construction are extensive fields of large sediment waveforms (SWFs), up to >2 km wavelength and >100 m amplitude, on the submarine flanks of many islands and seamounts within the Mariana and other intra-oceanic subduction zones. These SWFs are composed of coarse-grained volcaniclastic sediments derived from the (approximate) point source summits of the island and submarine volcanoes. SWFs around some seamounts and islands, particularly those with large calderas, define quasi-concentric ring-like ridges, suggesting formation by density currents generated during submarine and island eruptions, and preserved for 10s of thousands of years. Some types of SWFs appear to have formed by progressive slumping of oversteepened slopes without fluidization. General conclusions about the origin of SWFs are hampered by the dearth of samples and high resolution seismic reflection profiles. However, large coherent slumps and debris avalanches documented for some ocean islands (e.g., Hawaiian Islands) are (mostly) are not as evident on the composite arc volcanoes. Submarine Mariana arc (and other intra-oceanic arc) volcanism probably spread volcaniclastic material primarily during submarine “Neptunian” eruptions and by progressive slides and other sediment flow rather than by catastrophic flank collapse. These processes could mitigate the Hawaiian-style of tsumami hazard, but Krakatoa-type tsunami hazards exist.",

The dominantly dipolar nature of geomagnetic paleointensity variations provides a global geophysical signal that has come to be used successfully to date Quaternary sediments. Despite many fruitful applications of paleointensity-assisted chronology, the mechanisms by which sediments become magnetized remain poorly understood and there is no satisfactory theoretical foundation for paleointensity estimation. Additionally, recent discoveries, such as the common occurrence of magnetofossils in marine sediments, have important implications for paleointensity reconstruction and present an exciting new challenge to our existing understanding of paleomagnetic signal acquisition. In this contribution we discuss challenges that need to be addressed to place paleointensity stratigraphy on a more secure foundation. These outstanding problems require concerted efforts to solve.

            "abstract": "Tropospheric NO2 columns retrieved from satellite instruments are useful to infer NOx pollution, NOx emissions and atmospheric chemistry. Current satellite products are subject to limitations in assumptions of aerosol optical effects, surface reflectance anisotropy, vertical profiles of NO2, and/or cloud optical properties. Here we develop an improved Peking University Ozone Monitoring Instrument NO2 product (POMINO) for China, complementing the popular DONIMO v2 product.\nPOMINO explicitly accounts for aerosol optical effects, angular dependence of surface reflectance, and dynamically varying atmospheric profiles of air pressure, air temperature and NO2 at a high horizontal resolution (50 km). Prior to the NO2 retrieval, we retrieve cloud top pressure and cloud fraction using consistent assumptions about the states of the atmosphere and surface.\nFor our NO2 and cloud retrievals, we adopt from KNMI (via www.temis.nl) the SCDs of tropospheric NO2 (DOMINO v2) and O2-O2 dimer (OMCLDO2 v1.1.1.3), the TOA reflectance, and some other ancillary information.\nWe develop the AMFv6 code for radiative transfer calculation, based on LIDORT v3.6. Radiative transfer is calculated explicitly for each satellite pixel with no need to use a look-up table. The calculation of AMFv6 is parallelized and is sufficiently fast so that one day of retrieval with global coverage would only take about three hours using 16 CPU cores.\nPOMINO is consistent with MAX-DOAS NO2 data in China, with a R2of 0.96 as compared to the value at 0.72 for DOMINO v2. The improved consistency is related to explicit pixel-by-pixel radiative transfer calculation (instead of using a look-up table), consistent treatments of all parameters in retrieving clouds and NO2, explicit consideration of aerosol optical effects (rather than adjusting ‘effective’ clouds to implicitly account for aerosols), and consideration of surface reflectance anisotropy. Additional analyses are being conducted on the daily, seasonal and interannual variability of NO2 revealed by the POMINO data, as well as impacts on the study of NOx chemistry and emissions.\nOur AMFv6 code is available for public use.

            "abstract": "Urban and suburban streams typically receive anthropogenic nitrogen (N) from multiple sources, and their identification and partitioning is a prerequisite for effective water quality management. However, stream N fluxes and sources are often highly variable, limiting the utility of water samples for source identification. Nitrate in perennial streams can provide an important N source for riparian vegetation in semi-arid environments. Thus, riparian plant tissue may integrate the stable isotope composition (δ15N) of stream nitrate over longer timescales and assist in source identification. Here, we tested whether δ15N of riparian plant leaves could provide an effective indicator of spatial variation in N sources across land use gradients spanning wildland to urban ecosystems in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the surrounding Wasatch Range Megapolitan Area. We found that leaf δ15N varied systematically within and among eight streams and rivers (n = 378 leaf samples) consistent with spatial land use variations. Plants from a suburban stream adjacent to homes with septic systems (δ15N = 5.1‰) were highly enriched relative to similar species from an adjacent undeveloped stream (δ15N = -0.7 ‰), suggesting an important contribution of enriched human fecal N to the suburban stream. Plants from a montane stream in a largely undeveloped recreational canyon that permitted off-leash dogs (δ15N = 1.8 ‰) were enriched relative to an adjacent canyon with similar land use that strictly prohibited dogs but had comparable vehicle traffic (δ15N = -0.7 ‰), suggesting the contribution of dog waste to stream N. Plants from urban stream reaches were enriched by 1.3 – 2.8 ‰ relative to upstream wildland reaches, and δ15N increased by 0.2 ‰ per km in the urban streams. Mechanisms leading to this urban enrichment could include leaky municipal sewers, atmospheric N deposition, and/or increased rates of N cycling and gaseous losses. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential utility of riparian plant N isotopes as a simple diagnostic of N source inputs to inform watershed management.",

Despite the importance of greigite in paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic studies, knowledge of its magnetic properties is at a much lower level than for more common rock-forming magnetic minerals. Much recent progress has been made to develop a more complete understanding of the magnetic properties of greigite and the range of grain sizes in which greigite occurs in nature. We present results of new determinations of a range of fundamental magnetic properties of greigite, including the saturation magnetization, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and calculated rock magnetic properties. In addition, we provide evidence for the preservation of greigite magnetofossils in ancient sediments, which has important implications for assessing the reliability of paleomagnetic records carried by greigite. Finally, we present an integrated study from a Messinian former Black Sea sedimentary sequence to unravel environmental controls on diagenetic greigite formation, and demonstrates the usefulness of greigite for studying long-term climate variability in anoxic environments.",

            "abstract": "The response of Earth’s major climate systems to natural forcings during the last 2000 years can provide valuable insight into the affect that ongoing climate change may have on these systems. Understanding the relationship between temperature, monsoonal hydroclimate and radiative forcing is of particular interest because hydrologic responses in these systems have the ability to impact over half of the global population. Here, late Holocene variability in the South American and Indian summer monsoon regions is examined using sedimentological, geochemical and isotopic proxies from high altitude lake sediment archives from the Colombian Andes and the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. New results from Laguna de Ubaque, a small moraine dammed lake at 2060 m ASL in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, suggest a reduction in Andean South American summer monsoon (SASM) rainfall during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 900 to 1200 CE) that is consistent with other records from the Andes. During the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450 to 1900 CE), Ubaque shows wet conditions between 1450 and 1600 CE and drier conditions from1600 to 1900 CE. This pattern is similar to accumulation at the Quelccaya Ice Cap, but differs from ice core, speleothem and lake sediment oxygen isotope records of synoptic-scale monsoonal precipitation, suggesting that Andean rainfall anomalies may have differed from upstream monsoonal trends over the Amazon. In contrast, results from Badi Namco and Paru Co on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau suggest that the MCA and LIA were relatively minor hydroclimate events superimposed on a larger millennial scale variation in Indian summer monsoon precipitation (1200 to 200 cal yr B.P.) that was associated with changes in the position of the ITCZ, surface air temperature over the Tibetan Plateau and sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific. The unique hydroclimate variations in the ISM and SASM regions supports the idea that while spatially extensive, the MCA and LIA had heterogeneous global expressions and that local factors played an important role in the regional expressions of these events. Analysis of Last Millennium simulations from the CMIP5 ensemble support inferences derived from proxy records and provide further insight into variability in global monsoonal systems.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate records from the Third Pole provide a mixed view of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 800-1000 cal yr B.P.) and Little Ice Age (LIA; 150-550 cal yr B.P.). While some records suggest precipitation increased during the MCA and declined during the LIA, others show little evidence for a coherent hydroclimate response during these events. A better understanding of monsoonal dynamics during events like the MCA and LIA is needed in order to improve constraints on the relationship between temperature and hydroclimate variability, as well as to refine the global expression of the MCA and LIA. Here, decadally resolved physical, geochemical and isotopic lake sediment data from Badi Namco are used to investigate local and synoptic-scale ISM variability on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau during the last 3000 years. Physical and geochemical sediment data, including grain size, lithic flux, bulk density and XRF derived titanium (Ti) are used to characterize local variations in catchment erosion related to ISM rainfall. Synoptic ISM trends are characterized with leaf wax hydrogen isotopes (δDwax) that reflect the isotopic composition of summer precipitation. The Badi Namco results suggest that local ISM rainfall increased above the late Holocene average by 1200 cal yr B.P. and maintained elevated levels to the present, but with a slight decline after 200 cal yr B.P. Leaf wax hydrogen isotopes show a similar trend, but with a later ISM intensification (by 1000 cal yr B.P.) and a shorter event duration; δDwax increased sharply after minimum values at 600 cal yr B.P. These ISM variations inferred from the Badi Namco record share similarities with other local and regional paleoclimate records, including Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions and foraminifera-derived upwelling in Arabian Sea. Together, these relationships suggest that the ISM intensified during the late Holocene after 1200 cal yr B.P. when Indo-Pacific SSTs were elevated. The Badi Namco results also support the idea that the MCA and LIA were relatively minor hydroclimate events on at least the southeastern Tibetan Plateau and that they occurred within the context of a more significant lower frequency climate event.",

            "abstract": "The Ross Sea forms the north western end of the West Antarctic Rift system, a major continental rift that lies across the western part of Antarctica, and results from rifting during the break-up of Gondwana starting some 180 m.y. ago. In the Ross Sea region, extension comprised a regional thinning associated with the break-up of New Zealand and Australia from Antarctica, and a more focussed extension during the Cenozoic. The last episode of extension, largely from 46 Ma – 25 Ma, formed the Victoria Land Basin (VLB) in the southwest, the Northern Basin (offset from the VLB) in north western Ross Sea and the Adare Basin in the deep ocean to the north. Marine magnetic anomalies associated with the seafloor spreading that formed the Adare Basin, extend continuously onto the continental shelf of the Northern Basin, suggesting that the basin is underlain by oceanic crust, consistent with high gravity anomalies across the continental shelf edge. No seismic data exist for the deeper crust of Northern Basin. The amplitude and gradient of gravity anomalies across the basin limit the depth, density contrast and thickness of the dense body underlying it and are consistent with oceanic crust with steep margins at a depth of about 8 – 10 km. The VLB in contrast shows an extensional thinning of the continental crust. The three basins thus show seafloor spreading in the north, continental rifting at the continental margin, and continental thinning in the south. The pole of rotation for the extension lies to the south of the VLB so the rate of extension increases to the north. In addition, the azimuth of the axis of spreading changes relative to the extension direction, presumably as it followed pre-existing zones of weakness in the Antarctic lithosphere. This leads to a much larger degree of strike slip motion in the Northern Basin rifting that may be a significant factor in the development there of narrow rifting of the continental lithosphere. ",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols play a crucial role in the Earth’s climate system and hydrological cycle by scattering and absorbing sunlight and affecting the formation and development of clouds and precipitation. Our research focuses on aerosols in remote regions, in order to characterize the properties and sources of natural aerosol particles and the extent of human perturbations of the aerosol burden.\nThe phase and mixing state of atmospheric aerosols, and particularly their hygroscopic response to relative humidity (RH) variations, is a central determinant of their atmospheric life cycle and impacts. We present an investigation using X-ray microspectroscopy on submicrometer aerosols under variable RH conditions, showing in situ changes in morphology, microstructure, and phase state upon humidity cycling. We applied Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy with Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) under variable RH conditions to standard aerosols for a validation of the experimental approach and to internally mixed aerosol particles from the Amazonian rain forest collected during periods with anthropogenic pollution. The measurements were conducted at X-ray microscopes at the synchrotron facilities Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley, USA, and BESSY II in Berlin, Germany.\nUpon hydration, we observed substantial and reproducible changes in microstructure of the Amazonian particles (internal mixture of secondary organic material, ammoniated sulfate, and soot), which appear as mainly driven by efflorescence and recrystallization of sulfate salts. Multiple solid and liquid phases were found to coexist, especially in intermediate humidity regimes (60-80% RH). This shows that X-ray microspectroscopy under variable RH is a valuable technique to analyze the hygroscopic response of individual ambient aerosol particles. Our initial results underline that RH changes can trigger strong particle restructuring, in agreement with previous studies on artificial aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Available paleomagnetic data show that after the collision, additional convergence of ~3000 km took place between the Indian Craton and Eurasian plate, of which ~1800 km was between the Indian Craton and the Lhasa terrane. According to the “fill-the-gap” solution, this shortening is interpreted as the evidence for the existence of the “Greater India”. Intraplate shortening takes place often in the forms of folding and thrusting, and the major thrusts in the Himalayan orogen remained active after the Oligocene. Estimating the amount of the shortening quantitatively is of great importance for understanding the tectonic modeling for the evolution of this magnificent collision zone. To better understand the continental shortening after the India-Eurasia collision, a paleomagnetic study on the red beds of the Oligocene Kangtuo Formation (Fm) was carried out in the Gerze Basin of the Lhasa terrane.\nA total of 700 samples were collected from 37 sites. Stepwise thermal demagnetization revealed that the main magnetic carrier is hematite. The natural remnant magnetization (NRM) consists of two components. A low-temperature component (LTC) is identified below 300°C, whereas a high temperature component (HTC) unblocks at ~665-690°C. The HTC distributions show a clear east-west elongated distribution, which is considered as reflecting inclination flattening. After inclination calibration using the E/I method, the HTC could pass both a reversal test and a fold test at 95% confidentce level, showing the mean direction at Ds=340.3°, Is=44.2°, with k=54.9, and α95=3.3°, corresponding to a paleopole at 71.7°N, 340.7°E (A95=3.3°), and the paleolatitude of the sampling site at 25.9±3.3°N.\nComparing our new data with the apparent polar wander paths of East Asian blocks, Europe, and India, we have reached the following conclusions. (1) There is no significant paleolatitudinal difference between the Lhasa terrane and other central and northern Asian terranes at ~30 Ma. (2) The observed paleolatitude of the Kangtuo Fm is 8.0±5.0° lower than the expected paleolatitude deduced from the data of stable Europe, but is 4.6±5.2° higher than that deduced from the data of the India Plate, likely presenting a ~506±572 km shortening between the India and Lhasa terrane since the Oligocene.",

In this method, a semi-discretization processing (SDP) technique is first used to inhibit the impact of increasing noise with distance, then a value distribution equalization (VDE) method is introduced to reduce the magnitude of signal variations with distance. Combined with empirical threshold values, clouds and aerosols are detected and separated. This method can detect clouds and aerosols with high accuracy, although classification of aerosols and clouds is sensitive to the thresholds selected. Compared with the existing Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program lidar-based cloud product, the new method detects more high clouds. The algorithm was applied to a year of observations at both the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) and China Taihu site. At SGP, the cloud frequency shows a clear seasonal variation with maximum values in winter and spring, and shows bi-modal vertical distributions with maximum frequency at around 3-6 km and 8-12 km. The annual averaged cloud frequency is about 50%. By contrast, the cloud frequency at Taihu shows no clear seasonal variation and the maximum frequency is at around 1 km. The annual averaged cloud frequency is about 15% higher than that at SGP.",

However to develop understanding of energy and particle transport that controls the Geospace plasma and radiation envirionment, it is necessary to maintain an accurate monitoring of the plasma and electromagnetic properties of the solar wind near 1 AU. To complete understanding of the Heliosphere we must also extend understanding of energy and plasma transport to regions beyond 1 AU and throughout the Heliosphere. This understanding will complete the connection between the the corona, the 1AU environment and the outer boundaries recently explored by the Voyagers and IBEX.

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS), surrounded by the Eurasia, Pacific and India-Australia plates, is one of the largest marginal seas in the Western Pacific. It was formed by the interaction of the three plates and the seafloor spreading during Late Oligocene time to Early Miocene time. The boundary between Eastern Subbaisin and South-west Subbasin of the SCS has long been debated in the literature. Refining the boundary is one of the crucial tasks for correctly understanding the seafloor spreading model of the SCS. Due to few drills on the deep ocean basin of the SCS, magnetic data become important information for refining the boundary. However, the interpretation of magnetic data in the SCS suffers from the remanent magnetization of ocean crust as well as igneous rock and seamounts. The conventional reduction-to-pole anomalies at low latitudes usually neglect the remanent magnetization, making the interpretation incorrect. Here, we assembled high-resolution total magnetic intensity (TMI) data around the ocean basin of the SCS, and then did a special transformation of the TMI anomalies with a varying magnetic inclinations algorithm to obtain the normalized source strength (NSS). The NSS has advantage of insensitivity to remanent magnetization, benefitting correct interpretation. The NSS presents discriminative features from east to west in the ocean basin. The boundary of the discriminative features is clear and just ranges from the northeastern edge of the Zhongsha Islands running in the southeast direction to the northeastern edge of the Reed Bank. These imply that magnetic structure and tectonic features in the crust are discriminative between both sides of this boundary. It can be deduced that this boundary is the tectonic boundary between Eastern Subbaisin and South-west Subbasin.

Here, we show the results of high-resolution magnetic surveys by the ABE and Sentry AUVs for selected submarine volcanoes of the Kermadec arc. 3-D magnetization models derived from the inversion of magnetic data, when combined with high resolution seafloor bathymetry derived from multibeam surveys, provide important constraints on the subseafloor geometry of hydrothermal upflow zones and the structural control on the development of seafloor hydrothermal vent sites as well as being a tool for the discovery of previously unknown hydrothermal sites. Significant differences exist between the magnetic expressions of hydrothermal sites at caldera volcanoes (“donut” pattern) and cones (“Swiss cheese” pattern), respectively. Subseafloor 3-D magnetization models also highlight structural differences between focused and diffuse vent sites.",

The latter will further feed back to climate change. Here, we synthesized results from more than 50 experimental studies that either increased or decreased precipitation in grasslands to assess productivity responses of different species and plant functional types (PFT) as well as changes in community structure. Our results showed that increased precipitation enhanced aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of the dominant PFT but had no effect on ANPP of the subordinate species. Similarly, decreased precipitation reduced ANPP of the dominant species but not that of subordinate species. Individual C3 species were highly responsive to alterations in precipitation, but C4 species were not. Altered precipitation had no effect on species richness, evenness or diversity. Overall, ANPP and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) responded to both increased and reduced precipitation, but relative responses of ANPP to increased precipitation diminished with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) whereas the relative responses to reduced precipitation did not change with MAP. BNPP responses to altered precipitation did not vary with MAP. Our findings suggest that the dominant PFT in grasslands can be used as a proxy for community responses in ecosystem biogeochemical models. Further, grassland community composition and structure appear to be relatively stable in response to alterations in precipitation of the duration and magnitude encompassed by these experiments.",

            "abstract": "Hurricanes and tropical storms are major geophysical disaster-causing agents, which are responsible for tremendous economic and property losses in the U.S. A large percentage of these losses have been due to flooding from intense storms. In order to minimize flood damages associated with large hurricane-season storms, it is important to be able to predict streamflow amount in response to storms for a range of hydroclimatological conditions. However, this is challenging considering that streamflow response exhibits appreciable variability even for storms that deliver similar precipitation amounts. In order to better understand the sources of this expressed streamflow variability, we use a physics-based, distributed hydrologic model and supporting hydrologic data sets to identify and evaluate dominant hydrologic controls on streamflow amount variability in a southeastern US watershed. Our analyses suggest that the dominant controls on the variability of streamflow amount are antecedent soil moisture condition near the ground surface, and evapotranspirative losses during post-event streamflow recession periods, which are in turn influenced by precipitation history and prevailing vegetation and meteorological conditions. Information regarding dominant controls could help prioritize measurements during observation campaigns and could aid in risk management to quickly evaluate flood responses given prior information about hurricane storm size.",

            "abstract": "Large earthquakes in mid-continents often occur in unexpected places. In North China, large earthquakes roamed between distant fault systems in the past 2000 years such that no large events ruptured the same fault segment twice during this period. In the central-eastern US, although historic earthquake records only go back a few hundred years, increasing paleoseismic evidence reveals large events in places of little seismicity today. Such spatiotemporal patterns of mid-continental earthquakes differ significantly from those at plate boundary zones, where relative plate motion loads the plate boundary faults steadily at relatively high rates, leading to localized seismicity with some arguable quasi-periodicity. In mid-continents, tectonic loading is slow and accommodated collectively by a complex system of interacting faults, each of which can be active for a short period after long dormancy. The mechanics of fault interaction in mid-continents remain to be fully understood. Besides the well studied Coulomb stress perturbations due to dislocation on the fault planes, property changes of fault zones by a large rupture may cause redistribution of regional stress and strain fields in mid-continents. Further studies of fault interaction and the resulting spatiotemporal occurrence of large earthquakes in mid-continents are imperative for improving earthquake hazard assessment in North China, central-eastern US, and other highly populated and earthquake-prone mid-continents.",

            "abstract": "The high-resolution back-processing and re-analysis of long-term seismic archives has generated new data that provide insight into the fine-scale structures of active faults and seismogenic processes that control them. Such high-precision studies are typically carried out retro-actively, for a specific time period and/or fault of interest. For the last 5 years we have been operating a real-time system, DD-RT, that uses waveform cross-correlation and double-difference algorithms to automatically compute high-precision (10s to 100s of meters) locations of new earthquakes recorded by the Northern California Seismic System. These locations are computed relative to a high-resolution, 30 year long background archive that includes over half a million earthquakes, 20 million seismograms, and 1.7 billion correlation measurements. In this paper we present results from using the DD-RT system and its relational database to monitor changes in earthquake and fault properties at the scale of individual events. We developed baseline characteristics for repeating earthquakes, fore- and aftershock sequences, and fault zone properties, against which we evaluate new events in near real-time. We developed these baseline characteristics from a comprehensive analysis of the double-difference archive, and developed real-time modules that plug into the DD-RT system for monitoring deviations from these baselines. For example, we defined baseline characteristics for 8,500 repeating earthquake sequences, including more than 25,000 events, that were found in an extensive search across Northern California. Precise measurements of relative hypocenter positions, differential magnitudes, and waveform similarity are used to automatically associate new member events to existing sequences. This allows us to monitor changes relative to baseline parameters such as recurrence intervals and their coefficient of variation (CV). Alerting of such changes are especially important for large sequences of repeating events with CV~0 - such as are exclusively found on creeping segments of the San Andreas fault system - as they may indicate changes in local fault properties and/or loading rates.",

RASM is a fully coupled pan-Arctic climate model that uses the same ocean, sea ice and coupling infrastructure as CESM, and is configured at a resolution of 1/12° for the ice-ocean models and 50 km for the atmosphere-land model components. However, we have changed the standard coupling configuration in RASM from the CESM standard daily oceanic coupling, so that each component model is coupled at the same sub-hourly interval, and satisfies important ice-ocean inertial stability criteria. These criteria result from representing combined ice-ocean Ekman transport as a system of two coupled oscillators within the sea ice and ocean models, respectively. If the coupling criteria are not satisfied, chaotic and potentially unstable ice-ocean motion may ensue. In RASM, this new coupling configuration produces sea ice inertial oscillations that closely match observed Arctic high-frequency drift. Applied to 1º CESM, this coupling configuration causes a significant reduction in pre-industrial Antarctic sea ice extent, and increases the seasonally averaged ice-ocean inertial speed up to an order of magnitude greater than for the standard CESM case. This work suggests that significant sea ice extent and thickness biases may exist in Earth System Model simulations where the sea ice response to storms is not fully resolved.",

RASM is a pan-Arctic model composed of the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) and Los Alamos Sea ice Model (CICE5) at ~9km resolution, coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model at 50km resolution using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) coupling framework. Using RASM, we have analyzed coupled feedbacks resulting from different sea ice mechanics formulations. Strong spatial and temporal scaling of sea ice deformation has been observed in the Arctic using the Radarsat Geophysical Processing System and Global Positioning System equipped buoys. Whereas previous results from stand-alone ice-ocean simulations suggest that the established Elastic Viscous Plastic (EVP) rheology is unable to replicate these features, RASM simulates the observed scaling using EVP, with a spatial scaling fractal dimension of around -0.23, as compared to the observed range of -0.18 to -0.20. Using this metric, we extend our analysis to test for spatial scaling in sea ice deformation using a recently revised EVP formulation, as well as the new Elastic Plastic Anistropic rheology in CICE5. Our results suggest that a fundamental source of scaling stems from feedbacks associated with frequent coupling between high resolution ocean and atmospheric models, and this result serves as an example of the broader utility of limited-area, fully coupled models in isolating coupled feedbacks and evaluating them using daily in-situ and satellite measurements.",

The African and Pacific large low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) have been stable for the entire Phanerozoic and possibly much longer. Their edges are the dominant source of deep plumes which travel from the base of the mantle to the surface where episodic large igneous province (LIP) activity has punctuated plate tectonics by creating and modifying plate boundaries. Pangea, the best-documented supercontinent, formed at the end of the Carboniferous (320 Ma) by fusing Gondwana and Laurussia. The Panjal Traps (289 Ma) probably assisted in an early Pangea breakup phase (opening of the Neotethys) but the most important phase of breakup started when the Central Atlantic Ocean opened at around 195 Ma. Perhaps not coincidentally, the region where the Atlantic spreading started was preceded by the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (201 Ma), one of the largest LIPs. The Karoo LIP (183 Ma) heralded the Jurassic breakup of Pangea (separation of East and West Gondwana) whereas Paraná-Etendeka LIP activity (134 Ma) preceded South Atlantic break-up by a few million years. The North Atlantic realm experienced prolonged Late Palaeozoic to Cenozoic extension and sedimentary basin formation but the final Early Eocene break-up occurred shortly after a massive episode of volcanism and LIP formation (North Atlantic Igneous Province, 62 Ma) as in most Pangea breakup examples. All LIPs assisting Pangea breakup were sourced by plumes from the margin of the African LLSVP.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic climate change impact assessments primarily rely upon the set of General Circulation Model (GCM) projections of past and future climate available within the CMIP3 and CMIP5 datasets. These projections provide insight into likely future climates under the enhanced greenhouse effect from a range of GCMs. However, the number of runs from each GCM for a given scenario is small, usually <10 runs per GCM, which limits any assessment of the impact of within-GCM uncertainty on projected hydrologic climate change. Within GCM uncertainty is the variability in GCM output that occurs when running a scenario multiple times but each run has slightly different, but equally plausible, initial conditions or parameter settings. Precise quantification of within-GCM uncertainty requires numerous, for example 1000, runs of each scenario for each GCM, which are currently unavailable. Here we demonstrate a method to approximate within-GCM uncertainty using non-stationary stochastic data generation. At 17 catchments around the world we generate 100 stochastic replicates of catchment average monthly GCM precipitation and temperature from 5 GCMs from CMIP3 (20C3M and A1B scenarios), apply a bias-correction and input them into a calibrated hydrologic model to obtain 100 projections of runoff at each catchment. We investigate the contribution of within-GCM uncertainty to uncertainty in projected precipitation, temperature, runoff and reservoir yield for two 30-year windows centred around 1980 and 2030. We show the impact of within-GCM uncertainty is amplified from precipitation into runoff and that within-GCM uncertainty is an important component of the uncertainty in hydrologic climate change impact assessments.",

            "abstract": "The coastal cities of Christchurch and Wellington, New Zealand, lie in different tectonic settings within the obliquely convergent Pacific-Australian plate boundary zone. Both cities have experienced damaging earthquakes in the last three years, which highlight the importance of locating and characterising hidden active faults close to urban areas.\nThe devastating and geologically complex Canterbury earthquake sequence of 2010-2012 developed on the periphery of the plate boundary, and reactivated several previously unidentified strike-slip and reverse faults. Major aftershocks initially beneath land, generally migrated eastward over time, and finally advanced offshore into Pegasus Bay. A study of active submarine faulting beneath the bay highlights the role of inherited crustal structure and inversion tectonics. Marine seismic reflection data reveals that faults have very low slip rate and negligible post-glacial (<15 ka) deformation, which is consistent with inferred long recurrence intervals between large magnitude (Mw>6) earthquakes.\nWellington City is surrounded by numerous high-slip rate strike-slip faults overlying the Hikurangi subduction zone. A dense network of secondary basement structures previously recognised throughout the region, mainly from tectonic geomorphology, have, until recently, been considered mostly inactive and excluded from seismic hazard models. We used high-resolution geophysical, bathymetric and sediment-core data to determine the structure, earthquake history and earthquake potential of a newly discovered active reverse fault beneath the inner reaches of Wellington Harbour. The fault has a slip rate of ~0.6 ± 0.3 mm/y, and a vertical displacement history indicating at least two large magnitude (Mw 6.3-7.1), surface-rupturing earthquakes in the last 10 ka. We infer that the fault extends southwards onshore beneath the city and potentially into Cook Strait, and represents a significant previously unrecognised seismic hazard.",

            "abstract": "Complex nonlinear systems are typically characterized by many degrees of freedom, as well as interactions between the elements. Interesting examples can be found in the areas of earthquakes and finance. In these two systems, fat tails play an important role in the statistical dynamics. For earthquake systems, the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency is applicable, whereas for daily returns for the securities in the financial markets are known to be characterized by leptokurtotic statistics in which the tails are power law. Very large fluctuations are present in both systems. In earthquake systems, one has the example of great earthquakes such as the M9.1, March 11, 2011 Tohoku event. In financial systems, one has the example of the market crash of October 19, 1987. Both were largely unexpected events that severely impacted the earth and financial systems systemically. Other examples include the M9.3 Andaman earthquake of December 26, 2004, and the Great Recession which began with the fall of Lehman Brothers investment bank on September 12, 2013. Forecasting the occurrence of these damaging events has great societal importance. In recent years, national funding agencies in a variety of countries have emphasized the importance of societal relevance in research, and in particular, the goal of improved forecasting technology. Previous work has shown that both earthquakes and financial crashes can be described by a common Landau-Ginzburg-type free energy model. These metastable systems are characterized by fat tail statistics near the classical spinodal. Correlations in these systems can grow and recede, but do not imply causation, a common source of misunderstanding. In both systems, a common set of techniques can be used to compute the probabilities of future earthquakes or crashes. In this talk, we describe the basic phenomenology of these systems and emphasize their similarities and differences. We also consider the problem of forecast validation and verification. In both of these systems, we show that small event counts (the natural time domain) is an important component of a forecast system.",

            "abstract": "Achieving predictive success is a major challenge in hydrological modelling. Predictive metrics indicate whether models and parameters are appropriate for impact assessment, design, planning and management, forecasting and underpinning policy. It is often found that very different parameter sets and model structures are equally acceptable system representations (commonly described as equifinality). Furthermore, parameters that produce the best goodness of fit during a calibration period may often yield poor results outside of that period. A calibration method is presented that uses a recursive Bayesian filter to estimate the probability of consistent performance of parameter sets in different sub-periods. The result is a probability distribution for each specified performance interval. This generic method utilises more information within time-series data than what is typically used for calibrations, and could be adopted for different types of time-series modelling applications. Where conventional calibration methods implicitly identify the best performing parameterisations on average, the new method looks at the consistency of performance during sub-periods. The proposed calibration method, therefore, can be used to avoid heavy weighting toward rare periods of good agreement. The method is trialled in a conceptual river system model called the Australian Water Resources Assessments River (AWRA-R) model in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The new method is tested via cross-validation and results are compared to a traditional split-sample calibration/validation to evaluate the new technique’s ability to predict daily streamflow. The results showed that the new calibration method could produce parameterisations that performed better in validation periods than optimum calibration parameter sets. The method shows ability to improve on predictive performance and provide more realistic flux terms compared to traditional split-sample calibration methods.",

            "abstract": "The use of isotopic tracers is an effective approach for characterizing the moisture sources of precipitation in cold and arid regions, especially in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an area of sparse human habitation with few weather and hydrological stations. This study investigated stable isotope characteristics of precipitation in the Qinghai Lake Basin, analyzed moisture sources using data sets from NCEP-NCAR, and calculated vapor contributions from lake evaporation to the precipitation in the basin using a two-component mixing model. Results showed that the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) was defined as δ2H = 7.86 δ18O + 15.01, with a slope of less than 8, indicating that some non-equilibrium evaporation processes occurred when the drops fell below the cloud base. Temperature effects controlled δ18O and δ2H in precipitation in the basin, with high values in summer season and low values in winter season. Moisture in the basin was derived predominantly from the Southeast Asian Monsoon (SEAM) from June to August and the Westerly Circulation (WC) from September through May. Meanwhile, the transition in atmospheric circulation took place in June and September. The SEAM strengthened gradually, while the WC weakened gradually in June, and inversely in September. However, the Southwest Asian Monsoon (SWAM) did not reach the Qinghai Lake Basin due to the barrier posed by Tanggula Mountain. High d-excess (＞10‰) and significant altitude and lake effects of δ18O in precipitation suggested that the vapor evaporated from Qinghai Lake, strongly influenced annual precipitation, and affected the regional water cycle in the basin distinctly. The monthly contribution of lake evaporation to basin precipitation ranged from 3.03% to 37.93%, with an annual contribution of 23.42% or 90.54 mm, the majority of which occurred in the summer season. Our findings demonstrate that the contribution of evaporation from lakes to atmospheric vapor is fundamental to water cycling on the TP.",

Corals have received considerable attention in this regard; laboratory culture experiments show there to be a wide array of calcification responses to acidification. Here we will show how relationships for the incorporation of various trace elements and boron isotopes into synthetic aragonite can be used to reconstruct carbonate chemistry at the site of calcification. In turn the chemistry at the site of calcification can be determined under different ocean acidification scenarios and differences in the chemistry at the site of calcification linked to different calcification responses to acidification. Importantly we will show that the pH of the calcifying fluid alone is insufficient to estimate calcification responses, thus a multi-proxy approach using multiple trace elements and isotopes is required to understand how the site of calcification is affected by ocean acidification.",

            "abstract": "Portable passive seismic surveys are generally used to sample scales and locations that are not practical with long-term observatories, but are fundamental to studying Earth systems. The breadth of uses and designs of portable passive surveys is expanding rapidly as result of advances in instrumentation and analysis. Examples from recent passive surveys will be used illustrate how they are bringing new constraint to systems spanning continental to local scales. At continental scale EarthScope’s USArray is providing a view of the transition zone between the upper and lower mantle that facilitates integration of seismology, geodynamics, and mineral physics. Recently recognized correlations between mantle flow and abrupt velocity decreases in the top of the lower mantle are consistent with laboratory constraints on the consequences of volatile cycling in the deep Earth. Arrays with similar numbers of seismometers (~103) are also being used in a passive mode on much smaller scales. The Long Beach 3D survey conducted by NodalSeismic in 2011 covered only 7x10 km in southern California with about 5,000 seismometers. The instruments were optimized for recording high frequencies (>10 Hz), but they also successfully recorded local and teleseismic earthquakes. Delay time and amplitude maps for earthquake body-waves revealed coherent structural variations at scales as small as about 400 m. Such dense sampling of teleseismic earthquake wave fields yielded new constraint on localized deep crustal deformation underlying the tectonic boundary between mainland California and the rifted Inner Continental Borderland. The utility of passive data from the Long Beach 3D survey partly motivated a recent deployment of more than 900 exploration industry seismometers to record continuously for 2 weeks at Mt. St. Helens volcano in Washington in 2014. New observations of the >50 local earthquakes recorded within the Mt. St. Helens array will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "The high water storage capacity of minerals in Earth’s mantle transition zone (410-660 km) implies the possibility of a deep H2O reservoir, which could cause dehydration melting of mantle that flows vertically across the boundaries of the transition zone. We examined the effects of downwelling from the transition zone into the lower mantle with high-pressure laboratory experiments, numerical modeling, and seismic P-to-S conversions recorded by EarthScope’s USArray. In experiments, the transition of hydrous ringwoodite to perovskite and (Mg,Fe)O produces intergranular melt as a result of the large decrease in water storage capacity. Beneath USArray we detect abrupt decreases in seismic velocity near the top of the lower mantle. Detections are widespread beneath the Great Plains and northern Cordillera, and detections are absent beneath the southwestern U.S. Mantle circulation models show that most of the areas (>95%) with abrupt velocity decreases in the top of the lower mantle are collocated with downward flow across the 660 km discontinuity (660). Mantle circulation models predict upwelling across the 660 beneath the southwestern U.S where abrupt velocity decreases are not detected. The strong correlation between downwelling across the 660 and velocity decreases in the top of the lower mantle is consistent with a small amount (~0.5-1%) of dehydration melting, similar to that observed in laboratory experiments on hydrous ringwoodite. Our results suggest hydration of a large region of the transition zone, and that dehydration melting may act to trap H2O in the transition zone.",

            "abstract": "Arguably the most important and challenging goal in geodynamics is to understand the two-way dynamics between tectonic plates and mantle convection. While it has long been recognized that the present-day degree-2 mantle structure as imaged seismically is closely related to the plate motions (Hager and O’Connell, 1981) and their history (<119 Ma) (Ricard et al., 1993; McNamara and Zhong, 2005), recent studies have expanded this concept, from two different perspectives, by seeking connections between Pangea assembly and breakup and mantle structure and dynamics. First, it has been proposed that the large igneous provinces (LIPs) and kimberlite volcanism erupted mainly along the edges of the two major seismically slow anomalies above the core-mantle boundary (often referred to as the Africa and Pacific LLSVPs) (Torsvik et al, 2010). This has led to the proposal that the present-day degree-2 mantle structure has existed for >500 Ma (Torsvik et al., 2014), although its statistical significance has been challenged (Austermann et al., 2013). The proposals of the spatially stable Africa and Pacific LLSVPs and of the LIP eruptions along their edges have also been exploited in attempts to build global plate motion models since the Pangea assembly by providing a plate motion reference frame or inferring true polar wander (TPW) corrections to the plate motions (Torsvik et al., 2014). Second, mantle dynamics studies indicate that degree-1 mantle convection, which is expected with realistic lithospheric and mantle viscosity, may be needed for assembly of a supercontinent (e.g., Pangea) (Zhong et al., 2007). This suggests that the present degree-2 mantle structure may have been formed only after the Pangea assembly from an initially degree-1 structure – a scenario that is consistent with convection calculations with a proxy plate motion model that considers Pangea process (Zhang et al., 2010). In this presentation, in addition to critically reviewing these arguments, we will discuss calculations of long-wavelength geoid for the mantle with thermochemical piles and LLSVPs and their potential effects on TPW determinations and hence reconstruction of plate motion (i.e., net lithospheric rotation). We will also present additional calculations of mantle structure evolution using different plate motion history models.",

            "abstract": "Lithospheric rheology and strength are important for understanding crust and lithosphere dynamics, and the conditions for plate tectonics. Laboratory studies suggest that lithospheric rheology is controlled by frictional sliding, semi-brittle, low-temperature plasticity, and high-temperature creep deformation mechanisms as pressure and temperature increase from shallow to large depths. Although rheological equations for these deformation mechanisms have been determined in laboratory settings, it is necessary to validate them using field observations. Here we present an overview of lithospheric rheology constrained by observations of seismic structure and load-induced flexure. Together with mantle dynamic modeling, rheological equations for high-temperature creep derived from laboratory studies (Hirth and Kohlstedt, 2003; Karato and Jung, 2003) satisfactorily explain the seismic structure of the Pacific upper mantle (Hunen et al., 2005) and Hawaiian swell topography (Asaadi et al., 2011). In a recent study that compared modeled surface flexure and stress induced by volcano loads in the Hawaiian Islands region with the observed flexure and seismicity, Zhong and Watts (2013) showed that the coefficient of friction is between 0.25 and 0.7, and is consistent with laboratory studies and also in-situ borehole measurements. However, this study indicated that the rheological equation for the low-temperature plasticity from laboratory studies (e.g., Mei et al., 2010) significantly over-predicts lithospheric strength and viscosity. Zhong and Watts (2013) also showed that the maximum lithospheric stress beneath Hawaiian volcano loads is about 100-200 MPa, which may be viewed as the largest lithospheric stress in the Earth’s lithosphere. We show that the relatively weak lithospheric strength in the low-temperature plasticity regime is consistent with seismic observation of reactivated mantle lithosphere in the western US and the eastern North China. We discuss here the causes of this weakening in the context of the potential effects on laboratory studies of reduced grain size and Peierls stress on the low-temperature deformation regime.",

This process is accompanied by the reduction of inorganic carbon, as observed in experiments and natural systems. To test the extent to which stable and metastable equilibria are reached among aqueous organic compounds during serpentinization, we sampled water and dissolved gases from circumneutral surface pools and hyperalkaline seeps in the Samail ophiolite in the Sultanate of Oman and analyzed for various carbon constituents, including dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, methane, carbon monoxide, formate, acetate, and other small organic acid anions. Measurements of temperature, pH, dissolved H2, O2, major cations, major anions, and major and trace elements were also made.\nThe aqueous composition of the analyzed samples was speciated based on ionic equilibrium interactions in order to obtain activities for inorganic carbon species, reduced carbon species, H2, and O2. The redox disequilibria among carbon species was then assessed using data and parameters for the revised HKF equations of state. This analysis demonstrates that the carbon species in this system are out of equilibrium with respect to one another in ways that cannot be compensated by altering the abundance of the other constituents within analytical uncertainties. Specifically, there is too much formate and too little methane relative to stable and metastable equilibria. This result implies the following: 1) Methane and formate equilibrated in separate parts of the system, given that no reasonable temperature, pressure, or composition changes satisfy equilibrium with their measured abundances. 2) Methane production is kinetically inhibited, as seen in experiments. 3) Microbial methane oxidation altered the abundance of methane and formate; methane oxidation to formate or carbonate is calculated to be extremely thermodynamically favorable in these fluids.",

            "abstract": "Microbial light-driven reduction of carbon in continental hydrothermal ecosystems is restricted to environments at temperatures less than 73 °C. In circumneutral and alkaline systems bacterial phototrophs (cyanobacteria and anoxygenic phototrophs) are suggested to be principally responsible for this activity whereas algal (i.e., eukaryotic) phototrophs are thought to be responsible for this activity in acidic systems. In Yellowstone National Park numerous examples of phototrophic microbial communities exist at high and low pH, while hot springs with intermediate pH (values 3-5) are rare and commonly dilute. It is thought that the transition from algal photosynthesis to bacterial photosynthesis occurs within this pH range. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced bacterial and eukaryal small subunit ribosomal RNA genes, analyzed pigments, and performed comprehensive geochemical measurements from 12 hot springs within this pH realm. At all sites, the largest phototrophic population was either comprised of Cyanobacteria or affiliated with the algal order Cyanidiales, which are ubiquitous in acidic springs, yet abundant sequences of both lineages were present in 8 of the 12 sites. Nevertheless, some of these samples exceeded the known temperature limit of the algae (56 °C), suggesting that these populations are dead or inactive. Indeed, one site yielded evidence for a large Cyanidiales population as the only phototrophs present, yet an experiment at the time of sampling failed to demonstrate light-driven carbon fixation, and analysis of extracted pigments showed a large amount of the chlorophyll degradation product pheophorbide a and very little intact chlorophyll, indicating photosynthesis occurred at this site when conditions were different. Our observations illustrate the dynamic nature of these systems that may be transiently conducive to photosynthesis, which may open niches for phototrophs of both domains and likely played a role in the evolution of photosynthesis.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers and estuaries display complex system properties in response to anthropogenic forcing. Whilst our ability to characterize these dynamics and model them has advanced considerably for ideal systems, it remains difficult to investigate them across more complex aquatic landscapes. New model approaches are required that are able to accommodate spatial heterogeneity, connectivity between both terrestrial and aquatic sub-systems, and that are suited to capture the complex feedback and co-evolution processes that shape the signatures we observe in biogeochemical cycles. A way forward lies in the integration of the diversity of models of ecohydrology and aquatic system dynamics, with environmental sensing data in a way that balances process-driven and data-driven approaches for exploring landscape function, however many challenges remain. Here we report on a strategy being applied for the lower Murray River, Australia, that integrates models of terrestrial landscapes, riparian ecohydrology and surface water hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models in conjunction with sensor network data. The model system is used to quantify biogeochemical budgets and signatures that characterize individual sub-systems within the landscape, but also to quantify how the landscape as a whole responds to environmental change. Whilst such a coupled system is complex and many uncertainties exist, several theoretically relevant metrics of ecosystem function are being used to guide model validation. Further efforts to improve model predictions through assimilation of observed data using Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling are being explored.",

The result revealed how scavenging via “flocculation” of organic material such as humic acids affect primary nutrients and trace elements, many of pollutant interest. Defined in the Delaware are estuarine reaction zones, including one more “geochemical” in upper turbid areas and another more“ biochemical” in more productive photic zones of lower areas.\nSince then, the natural U-Th radionuclide series have been employed to quantify estuarine transport and scavenging processes. Parent U appears negatively non-conserved during summer in estuarine and coastal waters, while that of Ra isotopes positively non-conservative dominated by a ground water end member. For both U and Ra, the biogeochemical influence of marginal salt marshes is significant. Indeed in the marsh atmospheric 210-Pb has become the metric of choice for the chronology of estuarine pollutant records. Using the more particle reactive isotopes in quantifying estuarine mixing processes (e.g. Th or Pb) proves to be fruitful in the Delaware and upper Chesapeake. While Th simply tracks that of particle abundance, both 210-Pb and 210-Po show differential scavenging with residence times of weeks to a month according to lithogenic and biogenic cycling processes, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting of drought is vital for resource management and planning. Both societal and agricultural requirements for water weigh heavily on the natural environment, which may become scarce in the event of drought. Although drought forecasts are an important tool for managing water in hydrologic systems, these forecasts are plagued by uncertainties, owing to the complexities of water dynamics and the spatial heterogeneities of pertinent variables. Due to these uncertainties, it is necessary to frame forecasts in a probabilistic manner. While it is common to focus on the meteorological aspects of uncertainty (e.g. precipitation, temperature), this presentation will discuss the impacts of initial condition and model uncertainty on drought, and particularly ways in which these uncertainties may be reduced. In order to reduce these uncertainties, the recently developed Particle Filter with Sequential Bayesian Combination (PF-SBC) algorithm is applied to drought forecasting within the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). It will be shown that this methodology has the potential to increase the reliability of seasonal hydrologic drought forecasts. In addition, the recovery of drought will be examined with initialization of forecasts through the Particle Filter. From these forecasts, it is found that drought recovery is a longer process than suggested in recent literature. Drought in land surface variables (snow, soil moisture) is shown to be persistent up to a year in certain locations, depending on the intensity of the drought. Location within the UCRB appears to be a driving factor in the ability of the land surface to recover from drought, allowing for differentiation between drought prone and drought resistant regions.",

            "abstract": "Solar-wind heating through turbulent dissipation at kinetic wavelengths represents one of the most studied and challenging problems in the field of space plasma physics. In this work, kinetic effects in the turbulent solar-wind plasma are investigated by means of multi-dimensional simulations of the hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM) model [1]. Using 5D (2D in space and 3D in velocity space) and full 6D simulations of plasma turbulence, it is found that kinetic effects manifest through the deformation of the proton distribution function (DF), with patterns of non-Maxwellian features being concentrated near regions of strong magnetic gradients.\nRecent analyses [2] of solar-wind data from spacecraft aimed to quantify kinetic effects through the temperature anisotropy (T⊥/T//) on the proton velocity DF, with respect to the local magnetic field. Values of the anisotropy range broadly, with most values between 10-1and 10. Moreover, the distribution of temperature anisotropy depends systematically on the ambient proton parallel beta (β//), the ratio of parallel kinetic pressure to magnetic pressure, manifesting a characteristic rhomboidal shape.\nIn order to make contact with solar-wind observations, temperature anisotropy has been evaluated from an ensemble of HVM simulations [3], obtained by varying the global plasma beta and fluctuation level, in such a way to cover distinct regions of the parameter space defined by T⊥/T// and β//. The HVM simulations presented here demonstrate that, when the DF is free to explore the entire velocity subspace, new features appear as complex interactions between the particles and the turbulent background.\nIn particular, our numerical results indicate that the main direction of the proper temperature anisotropy, calculated in the main reference frame of the DF [4], has a finite probability of being along or across the ambient magnetic field, and is associated with magnetic intermittent events and with gradient-type structures in the flow and in the density. Comparison of numerical results with solar-wind data shows remarkable quantitative agreement.\n[1] B. A. Maruca et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 201101 (2011).\n[2] F. Valentini et al., J. Comput.

Starting from the algorithm of Broutman (2013) and the atmospheric profile of the 2004 Sumatra Tsunami, we add compressibility to the atmosphere and extend the calculation to three dimensions. Compressibility is an important feature of the real atmosphere, and we investigate its effect on wave propagation. We obtain the vertical wavenumber as a function of buoyancy frequency, density scale height, sound speed, and background wind velocity. Results show that wind shear and compressibility have a significant impact on wave transmission and reflection. We also investigate the 3D problem to allow variations in the bottom boundary condition and in the background wind profiles. Results are quite similar to the 2D case. ",

            "abstract": "Ancient lakes, with sediment records spanning >1 million years, are very rare. The UNESCO World Heritage site of Lake Ohrid on the Balkans is thought to be the oldest lake in Europe. With 212 endemic species described to date, it is also a hotspot of evolution. In order to unravel the geological and evolutionary history of the lake, an international group of scientists, conducted a deep drilling campaign in spring 2013 under the umbrella of the ICDP SCOPSCO project (Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid).\nOverall, about 2,100 m of sediments were recovered from four drill sites. At the main drill site (DEEP-site) in central parts of the lake where seismic data indicated a maximum sediment fill of ca. 700 m, a total of more than 1,500 m of sediments were recovered until a penetration depth of 569 m. Currently, core opening, core description, XRF and MSCL scanning, sub-sampling (16 cm resolution), and inorganic and organic geochemical as well as sedimentological analyses of the sediment cores from the DEEP site are in progress at the University of Cologne. Previous studies at Lake Ohrid have shown that interglacial periods are characterized by high TIC and TOC contents, likely associated with high contents of calcite and organic matter in the sediments. In contrast, during glacial periods negligible TIC and low TOC contents correspond to high K counts indicating enhanced supply of clastic material. Similar patterns can be observed in the biogeochemical analyses of the subsamples and in the XRF data of the DEEP site record. Following these variations on a glacial-interglacial time scale, TIC and TOC data obtained from the subsamples and from core catcher samples indicate that the DEEP site sequence provides a 1.2 million year old continuous record of environmental and climatological variability in the Balkan Region. The age control can be further improved by first findings of macroscopic tephra horizons. Peaks in K, Sr, Zr, and magnetic susceptibility might indicate the occurrence of additional cryptotephra layers in the sediment sequence.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics have been well established for tens of years, but how subduction initiates over tectonic history remains obscure. It has been proposed that passive margins may be a possible place for subduction initiation, but there is no obvious Cenozoic example of such a scenario, including along the passive margins of the Atlantic Ocean. With a computational method that follows the deformation of a visco-elasto-plastic medium, here we show that a favourable locale for subduction initiation is the juxtaposition of an old oceanic plate adjacent to a young, but relic arc. The probable enrichment of quartz in the middle to lower arc crust leads to two major factors which may have induced subduction initiation. One is the compositional density difference between the relic arc crust and the oceanic lithospheric mantle; the other is the significantly weakened lithosphere strength due to the rheology of wet quartz. With such a setup, we observe spontaneous subduction initiation within a few million years. The evidence that Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Tonga-Kermedec subduction zones both initiate adjacent to relic island arcs supports our conclusions. Our results provide an explanation for the rarity of subduction initiation at the passive margins. The continental lithosphere is typically old and cold. Consequently, the thermal effects cancel the compositional buoyancy contrast between the continental crust and the oceanic lithospheric mantle, making subduction initiation difficult at passive margins.",

            "abstract": "The injection of HCl into the stratosphere by large volcanic eruptions is considered to be little importance, due to the efficient incorporation of the former into hydrometeors within the cooling plume. However, HCl is also adsorbed onto ash surfaces to form soluble –Cl salts within the high temperature core of the eruption plume, and the atmospheric and environmental significance of this process is uncertain. We investigate the capacity of volcanic glasses with tephrite, phonolite, dacite, and rhyolite compositions to adsorb HCl at temperatures of 200-800°C in the presence of SO2, CO2 and He. Experiments show that only tephrite and phonolite glasses are significantly reactive to HCl, exhibiting optimal uptake at 400-600°C. The primary reaction product formed during adsorption is NaCl, but Ca-, K-, Al- and Fe- chlorides are also identified. Uptake of HCl by glass surfaces is sustained by interdiffusion of Na+ and other Cl-reactive cations with H+. Diffusion coefficient calculations yield Na diffusion coefficients for the four glasses, suggesting that the structural role for Na within the glass network governs the capacity for HCl retention. The uptake of HCl under experimental conditions is limited above 500°C by a Cl-induced dehydroxylation process, but the presence of H2O in the hydrous eruption plume may sustain or enhance adsorption. The experimental data, combined with simulated plume cooling profiles, suggest that HCl adsorption can be a significant scavenging mechanism in large explosive eruptions, particularly in peralkaline systems. The fate of adsorbed HCl is variable; some may be retained on ash surfaces within pyroclastic flows, while chloride-coated ash in the stratosphere could promote the formation of reactive Cl species associated with O3 destruction. Additionally, Fe- and Cl-bearing salts emplaced on ash surfaces by HCl adsorption within the plume cores of large explosive eruptions may increase the ocean fertilising potential of such events.",

            "abstract": "The large-scale topography of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Iranian Plateau (IP) can affect the formation of the Asian climate pattern and its variability mainly through thermal forcing in spring and summer, and mechanical forcing in winter. The TP forcing in spring has significant impacts on the onset of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) over the Bay of Bengal (BOB) by enhancing the BOB warm pool at the surface and by modulating the South Asian High (SAH) in the upper troposphere. Numerical simulations also demonstrate that the thermal effects of the Tibetan and Iranian Plateaus (TIP) are crucial for the formation of the East Asian and South Asian summer monsoons (SASM) because the surface sensible heating (SH) of the TIP is the major driver of the water vapor transport required for the genesis of the north branch of the SASM.\nOn intra-seasonal timescales, the TP thermal forcing significantly modulates spring rainfall in southern China and generates the bi-weekly oscillation of the SAH in summer. Despite the global climate warming, the atmospheric heat source over the TP, particularly the surface SH, exhibits a clear weakening trend from the 1980s to 2000s. This weakening of the surface SH contributes to the anomalous ‘dry in the north’ and ‘wet in the south’ rainfall pattern observed over East China. Activities for further understanding the mechanism of TP forcing on the multi-scale variability of the Asian climate are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Natural diamonds are fabulous probes of the deep Earth Interior. They are the evidence of the deep storage of volatile elements, carbon at first, but also hydrogen and chlorine trapped as hydrous fluids in inclusions. The study of diamond growth processes in the lithosphere and mantle helps for our understanding of volatile elements cycling between deep reservoirs. We know now that inclusion-bearing diamonds similar to diamonds found in nature (i.e. polycrystalline, fibrous and coated diamonds) can grow in hydrous fluids or melts (Bureau et al., GCA 77, 202-214, 2012). Therefore, we propose that the best environment to promote such diamonds is the subduction factory, where highly hydrous fluids or melts are present. When oceanic plates are subducted in the lithosphere, they carry an oceanic crust soaked with seawater. While the slabs are traveling en route to the mantle, dehydration processes generate saline fluids highly concentrated in NaCl. In the present study we have experimentally shown that diamonds can grow from the saline fluids (up to 30 g/l NaCl in water) generated in subducted slabs. We have performed multi-anvil press experiments at 6-7 GPa and from 1300 to 1400°C during 6:00 hours to 30:00 hours. We observed large areas of new diamond grown in epitaxy on pure diamond seeds in salty hydrous carbonated melts, forming coated gems. The new rims are containing multi-component primary inclusions. Detailed characterizations of the diamonds and their inclusions have been performed and will be presented.\nThese experimental results suggest that multi-component salty fluids of supercritical nature migrate with the slabs, down to the deep mantle. Such fluids may insure the first stage of the deep Earth’s volatiles cycling (C, H, halogen elements) en route to the transition zone and the lower mantle. We suggest that the subduction factory may also be a diamond factory.",

            "abstract": "Early infrared observations of the Martian surface have revealed the presence of a deep absorption between 2.6 and 3.5 µm usually referred to as the 3-µm band. Two non-exclusive explanations have been formulated to account for this 3-µm band. The first possibility is that it relates to the presence of some amount of adsorbed atmospheric water, water that would be exchangeable and could play a role in present day Mars water cycle. The alternative is that this absorption is due to an –OH or H2O bearing mineral component within the Martian dust, which would imply that water is involved at some stage of the dust production mechanism. Several lines of evidences seem to converge toward the second hypothesis.\nFirst, after 10 years of mapping of the martian surface with OMEGA (MEX), the lack of variation of the 3-µm feature with surface relative humidity suggests that the surface hydration does not exchange with the atmosphere. This is in agreement with laboratory adsorption experiments under Mars conditions.\nMore recently the Mars Science Laboratory with unprecedented payload has provided some crucial constraints on the nature of surface hydration. The ChemCam instrument onboard MSL has detected hydrogen in dust and soil, and revealed the lack of variation of H concentration with surface humidity, including nighttime measurements. Also, evolved gas analysis by SAM of Gale crater soils shows that water is released at relatively high-temperature and suggest that –OH or H2O bearing phases are trapped in the amorphous component of soils.\nFinally, the exceptional “black beauty” meteorite might also provide clues to the nature of Mars’s surface hydration. This Martian breccia shows elevated amount of water with respect to any other Martian meteorite. By studying the spectral properties of NWA 7533, we were able to show the presence of a 3-µm band and a small red-slope; this Martian breccia seems to contain a fine-oxidized-H-bearing component, possibly similar to that present in the Martian dust.",

Since iron is the primary component of the Earth’s core, the electrical and thermal conductivity of iron in both solid and liquid states are key pieces of information for estimating the transport properties of the core. We performed electrical and thermal conductivity measurements on iron under core conditions in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Our electrical conductivity measurements on iron clearly show resistivity saturation phenomena in iron under high pressure and high temperature conditions as predicted in a recent laboratory-based model for the core conductivity (Gomi et al., 2013). Direct measurements of thermal diffusivity of iron have been also preformed at high pressures by using the pulsed light heating thermoreflectance technique, which enable us to confirm the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law toward transition metal under high pressure.",

            "abstract": "The very contrasting steric and electronic properties of divalent metals dramatically affect the reactivity and composition of their aqueous species and their partitioning between fluids and minerals. These contrasting properties result also in very distinct kinetic and thermodynamic trends of their isotopic composition in aqueous fluids and carbonate minerals. For example, if alkaline earths in calcite are all enriched in light isotopes, only Mg exhibits a decrease of its isotope fractionation with increasing calcite growth rate. Moreover, the Mg2+ aquo ion is the only alkaline earth ion whose isotopic composition is markedly affected by the presence in solution of inorganic ligands like bicarbonate, carbonate or sulfate. The distinct behavior of Mg stems from the reduced lability of water molecules in its coordination sphere and from the reduction of its aquo ion coordination sphere when it coordinates to HCO3- and CO32-. Ab initio calculations show that the preferred four hydration number of Mg in stable Mg bicarbonate and Mg carbonate monomers results in a strong enrichment in 26Mg of these species compared to Mg(H2O)62+ (i.e. 1000lnβ26/24MgCO3°-1000lnβ26/24Mg2+ = 5.16 ‰; Fujii, personal communication). The analysis of recent experiments on Mg isotope fractionation between carbonate crystals and solution using density functionnal theory estimation of lnβ values from Fujii i) confirm the marked impact of carbonate and bicarbonate ligands on the isotope composition of Mg in calcite and magnesite and ii) allow to reconcile First-principles and experimental estimates of equilibrium Mg isotope fractionation in carbonate crystals. Recent experiments also confirm that the strong affinity of Zn2+ or Cu2+ for RO- ligands results in a marked impact of fluid pH, ΣCO2(aq) and/or carboxylic ligands concentrations on the isotope composition of these metals in carbonate minerals. These observations provide new insights into the parameters controlling the isotope composition of Me2+(aq) as well as new tools to reconstruct paleo-environmental conditions from the isotope composition of Me2+ recorded in carbonate sediments.",

Here we report a microstructural study of strain localization in a mylonitic peridotite shear zone that have been formed during the latest ductile history of the massif. Strain localization is associated with a sudden decrease of grain size and the redistribution of orthopyroxene in the finest grained microstructural domains (ultramylonites). Olivine crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) shows [100]-axes subparallel to the lineation and [001] at the pole of the foliation, whereas orthopyroxene mimics the CPO of that of olivine. Although low-angle misorientations in neighboring pixels are frequent in both phases, olivine and orthopyroxene CPO cannot be explained by coeval deformation via dislocation creep mechanisms. Based on microstructural and major element geochemical data, we propose strain localization at low temperature assisted by interstitial fluids that has led to the dissolution of orthopyroxene porphyroclasts and reprecipitation along the ultramylonite bands.",

            "abstract": "The expansion and proliferation of new data, at regional and global scales, over the past 30 years has allowed us to measure different geophysical signals (displacement, gravity, seismicity, etc.) with unprecedented spatial resolution and precision. Here we consider observations with both terrestrial and space origin, as well as new data obtained from the fusion of both types of observations. Advances in statistical geodynamics requires improved tools for data processing, fusion, modelling and interpretation in order to obtain the maximum value from these new, large data sets, in conjunction with the development of new applications. A clear example is the space gravimetry carried out using different satellites (e.g., GRACE and GOCE) which has allowed, using the available data, the development of combined gravity models such as GGMPlus (http://geodesy.curtin.edu.au/research/models/GGMplus/), with a spatial resolution of 200 m within ±60º geographic latitude. An additional example is the use of the gravity gradients determined by the GOCE satellite to estimate the stress field and its temporal variations at global scales. Here we will present a new research project aimed at providing estimates of gravity, strain and stress at varying spatial scales, integrated using advanced techniques for statistical data assimilation.",

We are analyzing existing and new geochronologic and petrologic data from volcanic breccias, ignimbrites and intrusive suites in the Sierra Nevada and Mojave Desert sectors of the Mesozoic California arc, in an effort to construct an integrated volcano-plutonic model for silicic magmatism in arc upper crust. SIMS and TIMS U-Pb zircon ages, immobile element abundances in whole rocks, and trace element abundances in zircons allow us to interpret the magmatic heritage of ignimbrites and components of underlying granodioritic to granitic intrusive suites. Preliminary results suggest several conclusions: (1) first-order magma production was episodic, with plutonic, forearc and retro-arc detrital zircons defining three magmatic pulses of ~40-60 m.y. duration that are largely mimicked by the more limited record of zircons in ignimbrites; (2) in the Triassic and Jurassic, second-order pulses on 2-10 m.y. time scales are recorded in both the intrusive and ignimbrite records, suggesting that eruption of ignimbrites was synchronous at the shortest resolvable time scales with assembly of underlying incrementally emplaced intrusive suites; (3) ignimbrites range from dacite to rhyolite in bulk composition, and are petrographically similar to modern “monotonous intermediate” dacite or phenocryst-poor low-silica rhyolite; (4) these tuffs are as fractionated as intrusive rocks, and commonly, though not always, contain zircons with similarly complex, multi-stage growth histories. Thus ignimbrites and felsic granodiorites in this arc are complementary elements recording lengthy and episodic evolutionary histories in cool and hydrous upper-crustal arc magma systems.",

            "abstract": "The ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) system offers an alternative approach to provide global UV data products which can support environmental assessments of UV radiation, biological and photochemical impact studies, and to contribute to the global climatology of UV radiation. The ECMWF model includes the effect of aerosols as a part of its radiation transfer calculations. During the first steps of the development of the UV processor, an aerosol climatology was used. In the latest version, however, prognostic aerosols have been coupled with the UV processor which, as a result, provides information about the global UV radiation and can be an alternative to satellite observations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ECMWF UV/aerosol optical depth (AOD) model against ground-based measurements and further develop the UV Processor. The ECMWF shortwave radiative transfer scheme provides the UV radiation at the surface for wavelengths between 280 and 400nm. However, for this analysis, the wavelength ranges 290-320 (UVB) and 320-340 (UVA) were used. This is the first time when a global model such as the ECMWF is evaluated for the performance of AOD at a UV wavelength. The results show that the MACC system generally provides a good representation of the AOD on a monthly basis, showing a realistic seasonal cycle. The model is mostly able to capture major dust load events and also the peak months of biomass burning correctly. When comparing hourly AOD values, the model-measurement agreement is better for biomass burning (CC = 0.90) and dust sites (CC = 0.77) than for urban sites (CC = 0.70). All sites included in the study show a relative mean bias at 340 nm smaller than that at 500 nm, indicating a strong wavelength-dependence in the performance of the AOD in the MACC system. Validating the UV Processor, in all the UV validation sites, the model-measurement ratio decreased with increasing solar zenith angle (SZA). This effect is larger for UVB than for UVA wavelengths, which could also be seen in most of the sites. In spite of this systematic difference under conditions of low Sun, the UV validation results overall show a fairly good agreement between UV processor and ground-based UV intensities, with CC > 0.9 for the summer period and CC > 0.85 for the winter.",

            "abstract": "One of the most striking discoveries of the Cassini mission was the large plume of water vapor and dust, emanating from the south-polar regions of the small icy moon Enceladus. The interaction between this plume and Saturn’s magnetospheric plasma generates large-scale perturbations of the ambient magnetospheric field (called the Alfven wing) which have been detected by Cassini during all 20 targeted Enceladus flybys carried out so far. In recent years, it was found that absorption of magnetospheric electrons by negatively charged dust grains within the plume has a tremendous impact on the magnetic draping pattern: due to the lack of “free” magnetospheric electrons, the Hall current is carried almost exclusively by the positive ions, corresponding to a negative sign of the Hall conductance. This effect breaks the symmetry of the magnetic draping pattern between Enceladus’ Saturn-facing and Saturn-averted hemispheres and has been identified in all available magnetic field datasets from Cassini. In this presentation, we will review the physical mechanisms that lead to the “magnetic visibility” of the electron-absorbing dust population in the Enceladus plume. We will also discuss how magnetic field data can be applied to constrain e.g., the charging times of the dust grains and the pick-up of negatively charged nanograins from the plume.",

            "abstract": "It is widely accepted that large amounts of water are delivered to the mantle through subduction. Some water is carried in the hydrated minerals in the oceanic crust, and is released to the mantle through dehydration reactions as the slab becomes warmer. It is also thought that the subducting lithospheric mantle is highly hydrated, and carries large amounts of water to the crust. There are however few observational constraints on the depth to which this water is delivered by the hydrated subducting slab, and the amount of water delivered to the mantle.\nSubduction zone guided waves spend longer interacting with the low velocity hydrous mineral assemblages than any other seismic phase, as so give us a unique opportunity to put new constraints on these features of the subduction zone. We use full waveform seismic modelling techniques to constrain these dispersed arrivals, and so image the velocity structure of the slab. This technique gives an observational constraint on both the hydration of the slab, and the onset of dehydration reactions.\nWe have shown that both low velocity subducted oceanic crust, and low velocity outer rise normal faults that penetrate the lithospheric mantle can act as effective waveguides producing characteristic body wave dispersion. Analysis of the spatial coda decay associated with intermediate depth earthquakes recorded in Northern Japan suggest that these hydrated normal faults may in fact carry the majority of the water transported by the subducting slab to the mantle. Seismic constraints on the dehydration reactions occurring in the subducted oceanic crust also show that full dehydration may occur at much greater depth than predicted by current thermo petrological models, meaning that water may be carried to greater depths than previously thought.\nTogether these methods suggest that much more water is delivered to the mantle by subduction than has previously been suggested, and that water may be carried to greater depths in the mantle by the hydrated oceanic crust than previously thought. Extending these studies to a range of global subduction zones may allow an estimate of global subduction zone fluid flux from seismic observations to compliment the estimates that have been made from geodynamic and petrological modelling of subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS) is the largest low-latitude marginal sea in the world. Its formation and evolution are linked to the complex continental-oceanic tectonic interaction of the Eurasian, Pacific, and Indo-Australian plates. Despite its relatively small size and short history, the SCS has undergone nearly a complete Wilson cycle from continental break-up to seafloor spreading to subduction. In January-March 2014, Expedition 349 of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) drilled five sites in the deep basin of the SCS. Three sites (U1431, U1433, and U1434) cored into oceanic basement near the fossil spreading center on the East and Southwest Subbasins, whereas Sites U1432 and U1435 are located near the northern continent/ocean boundary of the East Subbasin. Shipboard biostratigraphy based on microfossils preserved in sediment directly above or within basement suggests that the preliminary cessation age of spreading in both the East and Southwest Subbasins is around early Miocene (16–20 Ma); however, post-cruise radiometric dating is being conducted to directly date the basement basalt in these subbasins. Prior to the IODP drilling, high-resolution near-seafloor magnetic surveys were conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the SCS with survey lines passing near the five IODP drilling sites. The deep-tow surveys revealed detailed patterns of the SCS magnetic anomalies with amplitude and spatial resolutions several times better than that of traditional sea surface measurements. Preliminary results reveal several episodes of magnetic reversal events that were not recognized by sea surface measurements. Together the IODP drilling and deep-tow magnetic surveys provide critical constraints for investigating the processes of seafloor spreading in the SCS and evolution of a mid-ocean ridge from active spreading to termination.",

Nannofossil ooze, deposited in Atlantic and Tethys Oceans during earliest Cretaceous mirrors a stable equatorial circulation pattern with oligotrophic surface water conditions. Tethyan limestone-marlstone deposits and dark clays in the western North Atlantic mark reorganization of circulation pattern dominating Valanginian-Albian oceanography and favoring episodic black shale formation in Atlantic and Tethys Ocean. An east-west directed trans-equatorial current (TEC), coupled with equatorial upwelling and with varying erosive capacity was established (Hotinski and Toggweiler, Paleoceanography, 2003). Aptian sedimentary records from Tethys and Atlantic Oceans provide information on the sensitivity of the TEC to changing climate at times of perturbed carbon cycling as registered in the carbon isotope record. A greenhouse pulse defines the base of Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a, while available temperature and pCO2 records point at post-OAE1a cooling of climate. In the eastern Tethys (Oman Mts), the Aptian greenhouse pulse coincides with onset of chert deposits at a time of a shallowing CCD and of increased upwelling. Well-ventilated Pacific-type deep-water conditions prevented the formation of black shales in the deep Hawasina Basin (Oman Mts). Low oxygen or anoxic conditions, however, favored black shale formation in basinal settings of the Western Tethys and Atlantic Ocean. Frequent sedimentary gaps in basinal successions and erosive surfaces, sometimes phosphatized, on alpine Tethyan submarine highs and along the Northern Tethyan shelf provide evidence for increased erosive power of the TEC, reaching depths of up to 1000m or more. If increased erosive power of TEC was triggered by the greenhouse pulse or by post-OAE1a cooling remains to be tested.",

            "abstract": "Major ionic compositions of water are of importance in a catchment, because they reflect sources of materials deposited in a lake and the controlling mechanisms. Especially Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- are of interest, because they influence the process of carbonate precipitation in a lake. In this study, we present the seasonal variations of chemical compositions of lake and inflowing river water from Nam Co area.\nTwo sites (T1 and T2) were selected for regular water sampling in Nam Co, they were located in eastern small basin (T1, water depth ~57m) and center area of the main basin (T2, water depth ~93m), respectively. Totally twenty one rivers were selected for water sampling around the lake. Water samplings were conducted in T1 and T2 stations with 10m depth interval from the top to the bottom of water column. The samples were taken almost in every month from May to December of 2011-2013.\nThe results showed significant increase of major ions during post-mosoon period (late October) than pre-monsoon period (mid-May). In lake water, Mg2+ increased by 46.84% and 46.95% on average in two sites, while Ca2+ increased by 67.02% and 75.11% on average, respectively. HCO3- increased 27.61% and 25.02% in two sites, respectively. In river water, most ions also showed the similar trends, Mg2+ and Ca2+ increased by 40.55% and 33.20% averagely. HCO3- and SO42- increased 36.81% and 28.48%.\nTotal dissolved solid (TDS) was used to evaluate seasonal variations of water chemistry. It is indicated both lake and river water show similar patterns. The lowest concentration of lake and river water (T2, ~1220mg/l; river average, ~95mg/l) was appeared in spring (mid-May) after the lake ice was melted. Then the TDS increased very quickly by ~10.7% and remained at a relatively stable level until mid-September, another increase of TDS occurred afterwards with the highest concentration (T2, ~1460mg/l; river average, ~145mg/l) in mid-November. During the stagnation period, the TDS of lake water decreased by 11.0%, This decrease was mainly driven by the decrease of Mg2+, Ca2+ and HCO3-, suggesting precipitation of carbonates within the lake.\nTemperature, monsoonal precipitation, chemical weathering, evaporation, carbonate precipitation within the lake might be the main factors controlling the seasonal variations of water chemistry in Nam Co catchment.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of fossil fuel CO2 emission from urban areas rely on inventories that are based upon energy-use consumption for different fuel types, various socio-economic activity data and emission factors. There is growing interest in improving those estimates by using an atmospheric inversion approach based on transport modeling and CO2 measurements.\nBréon et al. (ACPD, 2014) have recently developed a Bayesian inversion framework to control the daily CO2 fluxes of the Paris urban area during a 2 months period. The inversion framework relies on the transport model CHIMERE with a 2 km spatial resolution and uses atmospheric CO2 concentrations measurements obtained from three monitoring stations at the edge of the Paris urban area, installed as part of the CO2-MEGAPARIS and ICOS-France projects. The method relies on the measured daytime CO2 gradients between up- and downwind stations to correct the prior 6-hour mean emissions of the Paris area, given by the AIRPARIF regional air quality monitoring agency. The system, however, relies on the spatial distribution of the AIRPARIF inventory and does not attempt at correcting it.\nHere, we apply the inversion framework to one year of atmospheric CO2 observations (August 2010 - July 2011). We show that the results for the monthly budgets exhibit a reasonable seasonal cycle. We check that the sensitivity to the prior estimates of the monthly budgets and to the meteorological forcing to CHIMERE is low, which demonstrates that the system is strongly controlled by observations.",

Specifically, we will present measurements on (Mg,Fe)O and bridgmanite-structured (Mg,Fe)SiO3 with their relevance to ultra-low velocity zones and large piles in the core-mantle boundary region. The nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering method provides specific vibrational information and in combination with x-ray diffraction data permits the determination of sound velocities and thermodynamic parameters. The nuclear resonant forward scattering method, also called synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy, provides hyperfine interactions between the resonant nucleus and electronic environment like isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings, which provide information on valence and spin states. These methods are complementary in terms of providing important information necessary to understand Earth’s interior. For example, accurate determination of the sound velocities and equations of state of deep Earth materials combined with seismic observations and dynamic modeling is essential for understanding the radial and lateral distributions of minerals. Also, knowledge of iron valences and spin states of minerals are relevant to our understanding of transport properties, mechanical behavior, and element partitioning, all of which control Earth’s internal dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Electron microprobe trace element analysis is a significant challenge, but can provide critical data when high spatial resolution is required. Due to the low peak intensity, the accuracy and precision of such analyses relies critically on background measurements, and on the accuracy of any pertinent peak interference corrections. A linear regression between two points selected at appropriate off-peak positions is a classical approach for background characterization in microprobe analysis. However, this approach disallows an accurate assessment of background curvature (usually exponential). Moreover, if present, background interferences can dramatically affect the results if underestimated or ignored. The acquisition of a quantitative WDS scan over the spectral region of interest is still a valuable option to determine the background intensity and curvature from a fitted regression of background portions of the scan, but this technique retains an element of subjectivity as the analyst has to select areas in the scan, which appear to represent background.\nWe present here a new method, \"Multi-Point Background\" (MPB), that allows acquiring up to 24 off-peak background measurements from wavelength positions around the peaks. This method aims to improve the accuracy, precision, and objectivity of trace element analysis. The overall efficiency is amended because no systematic WDS scan needs to be acquired in order to check for the presence of possible background interferences. Moreover, the method is less subjective because \"true\" backgrounds are selected by the statistical exclusion of erroneous background measurements, reducing the need for analyst intervention. This idea originated from efforts to refine EPMA monazite U-Th-Pb dating, where it was recognised that background errors (peak interference or background curvature) could result in errors of several tens of million years on the calculated age. Results obtained on a CAMECA SX-100 \"UltraChron\" using monazite standards and well-characterized unknowns yield excellent agreement with ages obtained by isotopic method. The MPB method aims thus to improve and facilitate trace element analysis in general, as we further demonstrate with blank tests and Ti-in-quartz measurements in reference materials and well-characterized quartz samples.",

The drill site was located where geological, seismological and geophysical surveys indicated a continuous record with a maximum thickness of fine-grained sediments. The aim was to investigate stratigraphic and geometrical architecture of the middle Aterno basin, in order to define its relationship with the local active fault system. The core consists of continental Holocene and Pleistocene sediments subdivided into two main sequences separated by an erosional discontinuity. The upper sequence consists of 41 m thick fluvial-alluvial deposits of silt and sand interbedded with metric intervals of rounded gravel. The lower sequence consists of palustrine sediments of clays and sands interrupted in the middle by a 30 m thick coarse gravel deposit. Biostratigraphic and radiometric measurements on the core are still in progress, while high-resolution paleomagnetic and rock magnetic measurements were performed on u-channel samples. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM), anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), magnetic susceptibility (k) were measured at 1-cm spacing using a 2G Cryogenic magnetometer. The sediments carry a well-defined characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM), isolated between 15 and 40 mT AF steps. The ChRM is of normal polarity down to ca. 83 m depth, with paleomagnetic inclination values oscillating around 57°. The main magnetic carrier in this interval is magnetite, below ca. 115 m depth the data show frequent apparent polarity changes due to the additional widespread occurrence of greigite. This interval has to be anyway older than the Brunhes-Matuyama transition. Relative paleointensity (RPI) curves were obtained by normalising the NRM20mT with k and ARM20mT and may be useful to improve the dating of the core.",

In these simulations the anelastic ideal MHD equations are solved in a thick, rotating shell of electrically conducting fluid, under solar-like stratification and thermal forcing. Since these simulations are fully dynamical in all time and spatial resolved scales, they achieve highly turbulent regimes and naturally produce variable amplitude solutions.\nWe have recently been able to produce a simulation that spans for 1650 years and that produced 40 complete sunspot like cycles, the longest of its kind so far.\nThis allows to perform statistical studies and establish direct comparisons with the observed solar cycle. Some of the main similarities and differences between the statistical properties of simulated and observed cycles are presented here (e.g. evidence for Gnevyshev-Ohl patterns, Gleissberg modulation or hemispheric coupling). Additionally, by studying the behaviour of the large scale flows in the simulation (differential rotation and meridional circulation) we also find evidence for solar cycle modulation of the deep equatorward flow in the meridional circulation. This result is briefly discussed as well as its implications for current helioseismic measurement methodologies and for classical kinematic mean-field flux transport dynamo simulations.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric CO2 fluctuations over glacial-interglacial cycles remain a major challenge to our understanding of the carbon cycle and the climate system. Leading hypotheses invoke changes in deep ocean carbon storage, likely modulated by processes in the Southern Ocean where much of the deep ocean is ventilated. A central aspect of these Southern Ocean-centric models is that, during deglaciations, an isolated glacial deep ocean carbon reservoir is re-connected with the atmosphere, driving the atmospheric CO2 rise observed in ice core records. However, direct documentation of changes in oceanic carbon content and CO2 outgassing has so far been impossible because of the lack of proxies that unambiguously record the ocean carbonate system. 14C tracks changes in ocean ventilation, but not in its carbon content, whereas proxies that record increased deglacial upwelling do not constrain the proportion of upwelled carbon that is degassed versus that consumed by the biological pump. Here we use the boron isotope-pH proxy in planktic foraminifera to show that surface waters in the Subantarctic Atlantic and the Eastern Equatorial Pacific were acidified during the last deglaciation, contemporaneous with atmospheric CO2 rise. This indicates that each location became a significant source of CO2 to the atmosphere, providing the first direct evidence for the role of the ocean as a CO2 source and supporting the view that a deep ocean carbon reservoir was upwelled via the Southern Ocean during the last deglaciation. Our study therefore highlights the vital role of the Southern Ocean and the low latitude upwelling regions in glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations.",

Research shows that these visitors are receptive to learning about climate change, and expect these institutions to provide reliable information about environmental issues and solutions. These informal science venues play a critical role in shaping public understanding. Since 2007, the New England Aquarium has led a national effort to increase the capacity of informal science venues to effectively communicate about climate change. We are now leading the NSF-funded National Network for Ocean and Climate Change Interpretation (NNOCCI), partnering with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, FrameWorks Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and National Aquarium, with evaluation conducted by the New Knowledge Organization, Pennsylvania State University, and Ohio State University. After two years of project implementation, key findings include:\n 1. Importance of adaptive management – We continue to make ongoing changes in training format, content, and roles of facilitators and participants.\n 2. Impacts on interpreters – We have multiple lines of evidence for changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors.\n 3. Social radiation – Trained interpreters have a significant influence on their friends, family and colleagues.\n 4. Visitor impacts – “Exposure to “strategically framed” interpretation does change visitors’ perceptions about climate change.\n 5. Community of practice – We are seeing evidence of growing participation, leadership, and sustainability.\n 6. Diffusion of innovation – Peer networks are facilitating dissemination throughout the informal science education community.\nOver the next five years, NNOCCI will achieve a systemic national impact across the ISE community, embed its work within multiple ongoing regional and national climate change education networks, and leave an enduring legacy of impact. We believe that the NNOCCI project can serve as a model for how ISEIs can address other complex environmental, scientific, and policy topics as well.",

We are now leading the NSF-funded National Network for Ocean and Climate Change Interpretation (NNOCCI), partnering with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, FrameWorks Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and National Aquarium, with evaluation conducted by the New Knowledge Organization, Pennsylvania State University, and Ohio State University.\nMore than 1,500 informal science venues (science centers, museums, aquariums, zoos, nature centers, national parks) are visited annually by 61% of the U.S. population. These visitors expect reliable information about environmental issues and solutions. NNOCCI enables teams of informal science interpreters across the country to serve as “communication strategists” – beyond merely conveying information they can influence public perceptions, given their high level of commitment, knowledge, public trust, social networks, and visitor contact.\nBeyond providing in-depth training, we have found that our “alumni network” is assuming an increasingly important role in achieving our goals:\n1. Ongoing learning - Training must be ongoing given continuous advances in climate and social science research.\n2. Implementation support – Social support is critical as interpreters move from learning to practice, given complex and potentially contentious subject matter.\n3. Leadership development – We rely on a national cadre of interpretive leaders to conduct workshops, facilitate study circle trainings, and support alumni.\n4. Coalition building – A peer network helps to build and maintain connections with colleagues, and supports further dissemination through the informal science community.\nWe are experimenting with a variety of online and face to face strategies to support the growing alumni network. Our goals are to achieve a systemic national impact, embed our work within multiple ongoing regional and national climate change education networks, and leave an enduring legacy.",

            "abstract": "The Pro-Am Collaborative Astronomy (PACA) project evolved from the observational campaign of C/2012 S1 or C/ISON in 2013. Following the success of the professional-amateur astronomer collaboration in scientific research via social media, it is now implemented in other comet observing campaigns. While PACA identifies a consistent collaborative approach to pro-am collaborations, given the volume of data generated for each campaign, new ways of rapid data analysis, mining access and storage are needed. Several interesting results emerged from the synergistic inclusion of both social media and amateur astronomers:\n(1) the establishment of a network of astronomers and related professionals, that can be galvanized into action on short notice to support observing campaigns;\n(2) assist in various science investigations pertinent to the campaign;\n(3) provide an alert-sounding mechanism should the need arise;\n(4) immediate outreach and dissemination of results via our media/blogger members;\n(5) provide a forum for discussions between the imagers and modelers to help strategize the observing campaign for maximum benefit.\nIn 2014, two new comet observing campaigns involving pro-am collaborations have been initiated: (1) C/2013 A1 (C/SidingSpring) and (2) 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG), target for ESA/Rosetta mission. The evolving need for individual customized observing campaigns has been incorporated into the evolution of PACA portal that currently is focused on comets: from supporting observing campaigns of current comets, legacy data, historical comets; interconnected with social media and a set of shareable documents addressing observational strategies; consistent standards for data; data access, use, and storage, to align with the needs of professional observers. The integration of science, observations by professional and amateur astronomers, and various social media provides a dynamic and evolving collaborative partnership between professional and amateur astronomers. The empowerment of amateur astronomers vis-à-vis their partnerships with the professional scientists creates a new demographic of data scientists, enabling citizen science of the integrated data from both the professional and amateur communities.",

            "abstract": "In many coastal cities land subsidence now exceeds absolute sea level rise up to a factor of ten. Without action, parts of Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok and numerous other coastal cities will continue to sink, even below sea level. The ever increasing industrial and domestic demand for water in these cities results in excessive groundwater extraction, causing severe subsidence. In addition, coastal cities are often faced with larger natural subsidence, as they are built on thick sequences of soft soil. The impacts of subsidence are further exacerbated by climate-induced sea level rise.\nLand subsidence results in two types damage: foremost it increases flood vulnerability (frequency, inundation depth and duration of floods), with floods causing major economic damage and loss of lives. Secondly, differential land movement causes significant economic losses in the form of structural damage and high maintenance costs of roads and transportation networks, sewage systems, buildings and foundations. The total damage worldwide is estimated at billions of dollars annually.\nTo survey the extent of groundwater associated subsidence, we conducted a quick-assessment of subsidence in a series of mega-cities (Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Dhaka, New Orleans and Bangkok). For each city research questions included: what are the main causes, how much is the current subsidence rate and what are predictions, where are the vulnerable areas, what are the impacts and risks, how can adverse impacts can be mitigated or compensated for, and what governmental bodies are involved and responsible to act?\nUsing the assessment, this paper discusses subsidence modelling and measurement results from the selected cities. The focus is on the importance of delayed settlement after increases in hydraulic heads, the role of the subsurface composition for subsidence rates and best practice solutions for subsiding cities. For the latter, urban (ground)water management, adaptive flood risk management and related spatial planning strategies are just examples of the options available. The discussions in this paper form the building blocks for a much-needed research agenda that aims to deliver a strategy to deal with subsidence in current and future subsidence-prone areas.",

            "abstract": "Hazard mapping and building codes worldwide use the vertically time-averaged shear-wave velocity between the surface and 30 meters depth, Vs30, as one predictor of earthquake ground shaking. Intensive field campaigns a decade ago in Reno, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas measured urban Vs30 transects with 0.3-km spacing. The Clark County, Nevada, Parcel Map includes urban Las Vegas and comprises over 10,000 site measurements over 1500 km2, completed in 2010. All of these data demonstrate fractal spatial statistics, with a fractal dimension of 1.5-1.8 at scale lengths from 0.5 km to 50 km. Vs measurements in boreholes up to 400 m deep show very similar statistics at 1 m to 200 m lengths. When included in physics-based earthquake-scenario ground-shaking computations, the highly heterogeneous Vs30 maps exhibit unexpectedly strong influence. In sensitivity tests (image below), low-frequency computations at 0.1 Hz display amplifications (as well as de-amplifications) of 20% due solely to Vs30. In 0.5-1.0 Hz computations, the amplifications are a factor of two or more. At 0.5 Hz and higher frequencies the amplifications can be larger than what the 1-d Building Code equations would predict from the Vs30 variations. Vs30 heterogeneities at one location have strong influence on amplifications at other locations, stretching out in the predominant direction of wave propagation for that scenario. The sensitivity tests show that shaking and amplifications are highly scenario-dependent. Animations of computed ground motions and how they evolve with time suggest that the fractal Vs30 variance acts to trap wave energy and increases the duration of shaking. Validations of the computations against recorded ground motions, possible in Las Vegas Valley due to the measurements of the Clark County Parcel Map, show that ground motion levels and amplifications match, while recorded shaking has longer duration than computed shaking. Several mechanisms may explain the amplification and increased duration of shaking in the presence of heterogeneous spatial distributions of Vs: conservation of wave energy across velocity changes; geometric focusing of waves by low-velocity lenses; vertical resonance and trapping; horizontal resonance and trapping; and multiple conversion of P- to S-wave energy.",

            "abstract": "Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) provided a great opportunity to study a dynamically new Oort-cloud comet on its initial and only passage through the inner solar system. Contrary to expectations, the comet’s activity fluctuated from high through a quiescent phase, and a major outburst days before its perihelion passage, ending in a dramatic race to complete disintegration on perihelion day, 28 November 2013. Amateur observations to professional ground-based, sub-orbital telescopes indicate the various changes of visible factors such as Afrho, a proxy for dust activity, and the measured production rates for water, consistent with the disintegration of the nucleus. Hines et al. (2013; ApJ Lett. 780) detected positive polarization in the inner coma and negative polarization in the outer coma, indicative of a jet, independently confirmed by Li et al. (2013, ApJ Lett., 779). Thermal emission observations of the comet pre-perihelion from NAOJ/Subaru/COMICS, a mid-infrared spectrometer, indicated a body with an equivalent brightness temperature of 265K (Ootsubo et al., 2013, ACM, Helsinki,FI); thermal observations acquired at the NASA/Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) with The Aerospace Corporation spectrometer (BASS, PI. R. Russell), before and after the November 12, 2013 outburst observed by the CIOC_ISON amateur network, indicates a brightness temperature of 330K and the presence, albeit weak, of the 11.3-micron crystalline silicate feature (Sitko et al., 2014, LPI abstract 1537). A Monte Carlo comet dust tail model, applied to extract the dust environment parameters of comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) from both Earth-based and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) calibrated observations, performed from about 6 AU (inbound), to right after perihelion passage, when just a small portion of the original comet nucleus survived in the form of a cloud of tiny particles, indicates that particles underwent disintegration and fragmentation (Moreno et al., 2014, ApJ Lett., 791). Ongoing work on possible dust models that incorporate both the observed polarization and thermal emission will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Xenoliths and xenocrysts present in petit spot lavas can provide information on the nature and processes occurring in the oceanic lithosphere. Petit spot volcanoes represent small-scale seamounts formed by the extraction of low-degree melts from the base of the lithosphere in response to plate flexure and/or crack propagation. Here, we report the discovery of a garnet xenocryst present in a petit spot sample from east of Japan. The xenocryst is pyrope-rich (Py60, Gr20, Al16), has low Cr and Ti contents, depleted LREE, a slight positive Eu anomaly and flat HREE with primitive mantle normalized values of around one.\nThe presence of garnet in the oceanic lithosphere could originate from gt-peridotite but such garnet should have higher Mg# and Cr content than observed in our sample. Garnet in oceanic lithosphere could also be linked to the presence of gt-pyroxenite. Mantle pyroxenite xenoliths are frequently interpreted as subducted oceanic crust (eclogite). Although we cannot exclude this hypothesis, the presence of eclogite in the Pacific oceanic lithosphere would require long tramsport time without melting at the mid-oceanic ridge. In addition, the pyrope content of the xenocryst is relatively high and the HREE are low compared to garnet from typical eclogites.\nGt-pyroxenite could also form by direct crystallization from a melt percolating through the lithosphere. However, the REE pattern of the garnet xenocryst excludes direct crystallization from a basaltic melt. We hypothesize, in order to explain the major and trace element composition of this garnet, that it is formed by subsolidus reaction of ol-pl-cpx cumulates during the cooling of the lithosphere at constant pressure (~1-1.5 GPa). This cumulate is interpreted to have formed during the percolation and differentiation of basaltic melts in the periphery of a mid-oceanic ridge. The presence of this garnet xenocryst supports the hypothesis that oceanic lithosphere is re-enriched by metasomatic processes.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the speciation of heavy metals and the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soil solution is a key to understand metal mobility and ecotoxicity. In this study, soil column-Donnan membrane technique (SC-DMT) was used to measure metal speciation of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in eighteen soil solutions, covering a wide range of metal sources and concentrations. DOM composition in these soil solutions was also determined. Our results show that in soil solution Pb and Cu are dominant in complex form, whereas Cd, Ni and Zn mainly exist as free ions; for the whole range of soil solutions, only 26.2% of DOM is reactive and consists mainly of fulvic acid (FA). The metal speciation measured by SC-DMT was compared to the predicted ones obtained via the NICA-Donnan model using the measured FA concentrations. The free ion concentrations predicted by speciation modelling were in good agreement with the measurements. Diffusive gradients in thin-films gels (DGT) were also performed to quantify the labile metal species in the fluxes from solid phase to solution in fourteen soils. The concentrations of metal species detected by DGT were compared with the free ion concentrations measured by DMT and the maximum concentrations calculated based on the predicted metal speciation in SC-DMT soil solutions. It is concluded that both inorganic species and a fraction of FA bound species account for the amount of labile metals measured by DGT, consistent with the dynamic features of this technique. The comparisons between measurements using analytical techniques and mechanistic model predictions provided mutual validation in their performance. Moreover, we show that to make accurate modelling of metal speciation in soil solutions, the knowledge of DOM composition is the crucial information, especially for Cu; like in previous studies the modelling of Pb speciation is not optimal and an updated of Pb generic binding parameters is required to reduce model prediction uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "Subway plays a significant role in public transport in Beijing, China. The safe operation of such underground rail transports are serious threatened by ground subsidence that mainly caused by groundwater over-exploitation. It is necessary to carry out a continuous observation and analysis of the surface deformation along the newly built rails.\nThe paper mainly studied four subways which were built in different periods(see attachment). Envisat-ASAR and Terrasar-X images of the study area were selected to measure the ground deformation. Interferometric Point Target Analysis method was gathered to process the SAR data. The method is developed based on the idea of the Permanent Scatterers SAR Interferometry method which can overcome the decorrelation and atmospheric effect to gain more precise estimation of the ground deformation. The master image can be selected according to the perpendicular, Doppler and temporal baselines to minimize the potential decorrelation. After the registration of all slave images to the master image, the PS candidates would be detected on the basis of the scattering properties of the images. A complex operation of the PSs was conducted to obtain the interferometric phase which was composed of terrain phase, atmospheric phase, deformation phase and noise. A model used for the evaluation of the contribution of each component was built by means of the least squares method. The deformation phase would be the remaining of the interferometric phase minus disturbance terms.\nDeformation information that came from two different kinds of data was jointly analyzed to reveal the temporal character of the rails before, during and after they were built. The regional LOS(line-of-sight) velocity around a special subway station shows that the rail has suffered from a serious uneven settlement along the rail during the observation period. In addition, time series data revealed the characteristic stages of each PS point. There is a clear accelerating trend of settlement in the construction period of the subway, and the sedimentation velocity would remain very high after a period of the opening of the line. Overall, ground subsidence had a certain delay when compared to the construction and operation of the subway.",

            "abstract": "Hillslope length is a fundamental parameter of landscapes, intrinsically linked to drainage density, landslide hazard, biogeomorphic cycling and hillslope sediment transport rates. Existing methods to estimate catchment average hillslope lengths include inversion of drainage density and by identifying the kinks in slope area plots, where the hillslope domain transitions into the fluvial domain, but the reliability of these measures has never been evaluated. Here, a direct method of measuring flow paths from hilltop to channel is presented and used as the basis to evaluate the previous two methods. This technique models flow as a point source across each pixel in the DEM, based on the D-infinity flow direction and as such better models overland flow than a steepest descent algorithm.\nUsing this direct measurement technique estimating hillslope length from slope area plots and drainage data is shown to systematically underestimate hillslope length values, with slope area derived data showing extensive variations across similar catchments. An analysis of the influence of DEM resolution on the three methods shows that as pixel size increases both slope area and drainage density data increases approximately linearly, whereas the direct technique shows very little variation with pixel size producing consistent results on 1 to 100 metre datasets. A method is also presented to allow the direct measurement technique to be used in landscapes where the channel network cannot be constrained, highlighting the effectiveness of the technique across a range of input data types, landscapes and data resolutions. We also show how our flow path method can be further used to differentiate between linear and nonlinear sediment transport laws in soil mantled landscapes.",

In this study, we quantify the various contributions to the UHI intensity for cities in the US and in Canada using the NCAR’s climate model. In the modeling system, the UHI intensity is defined as the difference in the surface temperature between the urban and rural land unit within the same model grid. A surface temperature solution, first derived for temperature perturbation caused by local-scale deforestation, is used to partition the UHI intensity to various contributing factors, including reduction in evaporation, anthropogenic heat release, and changes in surface albedo, heat storage and convection efficiency. Results show that in the daytime, the UHI intensity variations among the cities are explained primarily by changes in convection efficiency between urban and non-urban land. Here the convection efficiency is determined by the aerodynamic resistance to heat diffusion from the earth’s surface to the atmospheric boundary layer. This convection effect depends on the local background climate, increasing the daytime UHI by an average of 3 K in humid climates but decreasing it by 1.5 K in dry climates. The model simulations also reveal evidence of higher UHI in drier years for cities in the humid southern United States. These results offer useful guidance for the development of UHI mitigation strategies.",

            "abstract": "It is believed that MHD turbulence cascading is mainly caused by the collisions between Alfven waves, which propagate oppositely and are polarized perpendicularly to each other. Nonlinear interaction will vanish if the counter-propagating Alfven waves have their polarization aligned with each other. However, the Alfven waves satisfying these collision criteria have not yet been found in the solar wind observations. Here we report the existence of Alfven waves with opposite propagation and non-aligned polarization in the solar wind. In one case of anti-sunward magnetic sector, with RTN as the coordinates, the magnetic fluctuations in T-component (BT) are anti-correlated with the velocity fluctuations in T-component (VT), while BR and BN fluctuations are in positive correlation with VR and VN fluctuations, respectively. These features suggest a possible nonlinear interaction between outward propagating Alfven wave with polarization in T-direction and inward propagating Alfven wave with polarization in R&N-directions. Moreover, the associated proton kinetics shows the existence of field-aligned sunward beam rather than anti-sunward beam, which may indicate a parallel Landau heating by sunward kinetic Alfven waves. A statistical study including more cases is also conducted.",

            "abstract": "Prominent conceptual models for the formation of the deep, fast-spread crust are the \"gabbro-glacier\" model, where the lower crust is formed in the axial melt lens, and the \"sheeted sill\" model, where the lower gabbros are generated by the intrusion of sills of gabbroic mushes. A requirement for the latter model is a substantial hydrothermal cooling of the oceanic crust in the depth, and as long as the \"Rosetta stone\" for the mechanism of this deep cooling is not found, the \"sheeted sill\" model and derivatives cannot be accepted as reliable option how the deep oceanic fast-spread crust is formed.\nIn recent field campaigns for establishing a geochemical and petrological profile through typical fast-spreading oceanic crust in the Wadi Gideah (Wadi Tayin massif, Oman ophiolite), we discovered several, often more than 100 m wide fault zones, cutting a coherent series of layered gabbro at many places. These zones are characterized by pervasive alteration, mainly in greenschist and sub-greenschist facies. Isotope geochemical studies of these zones imply that these zones can be interpreted as pathways for channeled hydrothermal flux, in accord with observations of Coogan et al. (2006). In most of the fault zones, we observed the occurrence of varitextured hornblende gabbro, alternating with zones of former layered gabbros showing intense overgrowth of high- temperature amphibole, and sometimes with flasered amphibolites. The petrologic record implies fluid flux in the center of this zones at very high temperatures (≤ 1000°C), enabling even the production of hornblende gabbros by hydrous partial melting of layered gabbro, shielded by zones formed at high-temperature conditions (formation of high-T amphiboles) and at low-temperature conditions (greenschist facies rocks). First thermal modeling based on the petrological record of these zones are in progress.\nCoogan LA, Howard KA, Gillis KM, Bickle MJ, Chapman H, Boyce AJ, Jenkin GRT, Wilson RN (2006) Am. J.

            "abstract": "Recent numerical modeling studies of the time-dependent development of texture and seismic anisotropy during subduction have shed light on how the mantle deforms as a slab subducts. It is thus becoming more and more clear that the term “mantle flow” may be too ambiguous in the context of subduction. For instance, it has been suggested that trench-parallel shear wave splitting fast directions (from SKS and source-side S splitting) on the seaward side need not necessarily be the result of trench-parallel movement (i.e., “flow”) of mantle material, but are rather due to pure shear deformation in the sub-slab mantle. Here we present results of a numerical modeling study where we have systematically investigated how mantle propagation, finite strain, olivine lattice-preferred orientation (LPO), and SKS splitting vary with slab width in a fully dynamic 3-D subduction model. We find that even in the complex circum-slab flow field, the finite strain ellipsoid (FSE) is a good proxy for LPO. However, it does not necessarily align with the instantaneous mantle flow velocity vector. We identify two distinct domains with different deformation types in the central sub-slab upper mantle: simple shear induced by plate advance dominates at shallow depths and results in trench-normal fast splitting, while pure shear due to slab rollback dominates in the deeper mantle (above 410 km) and produces trench-parallel fast orientations. In our models, the SKS splitting pattern strongly depends on these two competing effects as well as the subduction partition ratio, γ = Xp/Xt, where Xp and Xt are the lengths of plate advance and trench retreat, respectively. If γ < 1 (narrow slabs, < 1000 km), trench-parallel fast directions are produced. In contrast, γ > 1 (wide slabs, > 1000 km), results in trench-normal fast splitting. This may explain the observed dichotomy in natural subduction zones of sub-slab fast splitting patterns (away from slab edges) usually being either trench-parallel or –perpendicular.",

            "abstract": "Long-term measurements of atmospheric CO2 have revealed increasing amplitude in seasonal variations at Northern Hemisphere sites. In a recent paper1, we extended the analysis of seasonal CO2 amplitude using aircraft data from 1958-61 and 2009-11 and found large increases of 50% in the mid-troposphere north of 45°N. Changes in amplitude south of 45°N were less than 25%. The observations indicate that seasonal CO2 exchanges with northern terrestrial ecosystems must have increased by 30-60% over the past 50 years. The increased exchange is likely widespread over northern ecosystems but it must be focused in boreal forests to match the observed spatial pattern in the aircraft data. Small decreases in seasonal CO2 exchange of subtropical and tropical regions may also contribute to CO2 amplitude changes. The required increases in seasonal CO2 exchange in northern ecosystems are larger than simulated by terrestrial models, indicating the models do not capture substantial ecological changes occurring since 1960.\nThis presentation will give an overview of the recent paper1, highlighting the atmospheric evidence for a dominant influence from boreal forests and from the main growing season months. It will also expand on the investigation of modeled changes in seasonal CO2 flux using CMIP5 and other model intercomparisons, including the modeled influences of carbon vs climate drivers.\n1.

            "abstract": "Trends in alkalinity and other solutes are evident in large rivers of the United States (U.S.) due to a variety of factors. Nutrient inputs, agricultural lime, decreasing acidic inputs, and changing flow conditions all contribute to trends in major solutes. In small, minimally disturbed headwater watersheds with limited acid neutralizing capacity, solute trends resulting from changes in acidic deposition are well documented. Larger rivers tend to have greater acid neutralizing capacity and are subject to a greater number of anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, the effects of acid deposition on larger rivers is expected to be minimal. In this study, trends in alkalinity and other solutes were determined in large rivers spanning a range of climate and land use characteristics in the U.S. Multi-decadal trend analyses were performed (1945-2010) using a robust flow-weighting scheme. Alkalinity increased in most rivers although the factors leading to the increases were highly diverse. In several rivers in the Northeastern U.S., the timing and magnitude of alkalinity trends indicated that changes in atmospheric deposition played a role in solute trends. Despite the recent increases in alkalinity, modern alkalinity concentrations in U.S. rivers are remarkably similar to those observed in the early 20th century (1906-1910). On the other hand, sulfate and calcium concentrations remain elevated with respect to data from the early 20th century suggesting that acidification processes are ongoing, although improvements occurred in many areas in recent decades.",

            "abstract": "Both satellite and ground-based observations have indicated that there are systematic differences between the polar regions of the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH) thermosphere and ionosphere. At an altitude of ~400 km, cross-polar neutral wind and ion drift speeds are generally larger in the NH than in the SH, while the spatial variance of the neutral wind is larger in the SH. The magnitude of these North-South differences depends on the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), and probably also on the season and solar activity level. We use simulations with the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere model to explore the causes of the observed North-South differences. At least part of the differences can be explained by the asymmetry of the Earth’s magnetic field. First, the magnetic flux density in the NH polar region is lower than in the SH. Since ion drift speeds scale as E/B, this result in stronger ion drifts in the NH, and also stronger neutral winds due to ion drag. Second, the offset between the invariant magnetic pole and the geographic pole is smaller in the NH than the SH. Model simulations indicate that a smaller offset should also contribute to stronger ion drifts and neutral winds. In addition, it could explain the greater spatial variance in the neutral wind in the SH. The dependencies of inter-hemispheric differences on season and solar activity level are only in part reproduced by the model. Further work is still needed to understand these dependencies fully.",

This is demonstrated in a set of idealized experiments with the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere model using a dipolar magnetic field. A decrease of the dipole moment (M) causes an increase in ionospheric conductance. This increase in conductance results in enhanced field-aligned currents (FACs), which change the shape of the magnetosphere, and causes a deviation from theoretical scaling relations of the stand-off distance, the size of the polar cap, and the cross-polar cap potential with M. The orientation of the Earth’s magnetic field determines how the angle μ between the geomagnetic dipole axis and the geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) z-axis varies with season and universal time (UT). The angle μ can affect solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling in two distinct ways: via variations in ionospheric conductivity over the polar caps or via a change in the coupling efficiency between the solar wind and magnetosphere as a result of changes in geometry. Simulations in which the ionospheric conductivity was either kept fixed or allowed to vary realistically demonstrated that variations in ionospheric conductance are responsible for ~10-30% of the variations in the cross-polar cap potential associated with variations in μ for southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). The remainder was mostly due to variations in the magnetic reconnection rate, which were associated with variations in the length of the section of the separator line along which relatively strong reconnection occurs.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen is important in lakes – it is critical for ecosystem productivity, and too little or too much can impair ecosystem services in northern temperate forests. Climate change and climate-driven feedbacks on catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry have the potential to alter the atmospheric vs. aquatic fate of nitrogen in these forests. Warmer conditions over the past 30 years (i.e., 2°C warmer over the past three decades, y = 0.06x - 113.26, r2=0.205, p< 0.05) have resulted in lower hydrologic flows from catchments. However, these warmer conditions are accompanied by increased frequencies of extreme precipitation events that interact with geomorphology to influence the physical-chemical drivers of nitrogen transformations (including soil moisture, temperature, reduction-oxidation potential) within the catchments. Specifically, summer storm events result in hydrological flows over topographic depressions and flats, areas where nitrate-N fluxes are significantly higher than the average in the catchment, triggering the formation of redox conditions, which in turn, intercept the conversion of nitrate-N flowing to the stream by transforming it to nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen (N2) gas (y = 19.90x1.20, r2=0.744, p<0.05). An evaluation of the annual return period of summer storms that trigger significant N2O+N2 efflux events reveals that, for example, a 100 mm storm event that generates 100 g N2O+N2/ha/d has a return period of about 75 years under current climate scenarios but will have a much shorter return period of 25 years by 2100. A consequence of warmer temperatures and a higher frequency of extreme precipitation events is the shift from an aquatic to atmospheric fate for nitrogen, which in turn creates feedbacks for even warmer conditions due to increased effluxes of potent greenhouse gases as well as a reduction of nitrogen export to surface waters, which may promote N2-fixing cyanobacteria blooms.",

            "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in wind resources in the Gulf region, not only for evaluating wind energy potential, but also for understanding and forecasting changes in wind, as a regional climate variable. In particular, time varying variance—the second order moment—or heteroscedasticity in wind time series is important to investigate since high variance causes turbulence, which affects wind power potential and may lead to structural changes in wind turbines. Nevertheless, the conditional variance of wind time series has been rarely explored, especially in the Gulf region. Therefore, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (SARIMA-GARCH) model is applied to observed wind data in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This model allows considering apparent seasonality which is present in wind time series and the heteroscedasticity in residuals indicated with the Engle test, to understand and forecast changes in the conditional variance of wind time series. In this study, the autocorrelation function of daily average wind speed time series obtained from seven stations within the UAE—Al Aradh, Al Mirfa, Al Wagan, East of Jebel Haffet, Madinat Zayed, Masdar City, Sir Bani Yas Island—is inspected to fit a SARIMA model. The best SARIMA model is selected according to the minimum Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and based on residuals of the model. Then, the GARCH model is applied to the remaining residuals to capture the conditional variance of the SARIMA model. Results indicate that the SARIMA-GARCH model provides a good fir to wind data in the UAE.",

Based on a 1500 km long volcanic gap and intermediate depth seismicity patterns, the Peruvian flat slab appears to have the greatest along-strike extent and, therefore, has been suggested as a modern analogue to the putative flat slab during the Laramide orogeny in the western United States (~80-55 Ma). Combining 3D shear wave velocity structure and Rayleigh wave phase anisotropy between ~10° and 18° S, we find that the subducting Nazca plate is not uniformly flat along the entire region, but fails to the north of the subducting Nazca Ridge. Our results show that, in combination with trench retreat, rapid overriding plate motion, and/or presence of a thick cratonic root, the subduction of buoyant overthickened oceanic crust, such as the Nazca Ridge, is necessary for the formation and sustainability of flat slabs. This finding has important implications for the formation of flat slabs both past and present.",

            "abstract": "Roots change their surrounding soil chemically, physically and biologically. This includes changes in soil moisture and solute concentration, the exudation of organic substances into the rhizosphere, increased growth of soil microorganisms, or changes in soil structure. The fate of water and solutes in the root zone is highly determined by these root-soil interactions. Mathematical models of soil-root systems in combination with non-invasive techniques able to characterize root systems are a promising tool to understand and predict the behaviour of water and solutes in the root zone. With respect to different fields of applications, predictive mathematical models can contribute to the solution of optimal control problems in plant recourse efficiency. This may result in significant gains in productivity, efficiency and environmental sustainability in various land use activities.\nMajor challenges include the coupling of model parameters of the relevant processes with the surrounding environment such as temperature, nutrient concentration or soil water content. A further challenge is the mathematical description of the different spatial and temporal scales involved. This includes in particular the branched structures formed by root systems or the external mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi. Here, reducing complexity as well as bridging between spatial scales is required. Furthermore, the combination of experimental and mathematical techniques may advance the field enormously.\nHere, the use of root system, soil and rhizosphere models is presented through a number of modelling case studies, including image based modelling of phosphate uptake by a root with hairs, model-based optimization of root architecture for phosphate uptake from soil, upscaling of rhizosphere models, modelling root growth in structured soil, and the effect of root hydraulic architecture on plant water uptake efficiency and drought resistance.",

            "abstract": "Melting subducted mafic crust is commonly assumed to be the main process leading to silicic melts with an adakitic signature, which may form Archaean granitoids and generate early continental crust. Alternatively, melting of the overriding lower mafic crust and near-Moho depth fractional crystallisation of mantle melts can form differentiated magmas with an adakitic signature. Previous work shows how only very young slabs melt through dehydration melting, or depict melting of dry eclogites via water addition from deeper slab dehydration. Alternatively, underplated subducted material via delamination and diapirism may be important in the generation of felsic continental crust.\nWe quantify subduction dehydration and melting reactions in a warm subduction system using a thermo-mechanical subduction model with a thermodynamic database. We find that even young (hot) slabs dehydrate before reaching their solidus, which suppresses any slab dehydration melting and creates significant amounts of mantle wedge melting irrespective of slab age. Significant slab crust melting is only achieved in young slabs via water present melting if metamorphic fluids from the subducted mantle flux through the dry eclogites. These slab melts, however, interfere with massive mantle wedge melting and unlikely to participate in the overriding plate felsic magmatism, unlike the shallower, primitive mantle wedge melts.\nWe also explore the conditions for delaminating the mafic subducted crust. For a wide range of ages, the uppermost part of the subducted slab might delaminate to form compositionally buoyant plumes that rise through the mantle wedge. Thick crust on young slabs (as perhaps representative for a hotter, early Earth) may delaminate entirely and reside in the mantle wedge. Under such conditions, this ponded crust might melts subsequently, forming “adakitic” felsic melts contributing to a significant amount of the overriding plate crustal volumes.",

            "abstract": "In Taiwan two subduction zones come together in quasi-orthogonal, kinematically stable configuration. Under Taiwan the upper crust of Eurasia is decoupled from the rest of the lithosphere by a detachment that forms the main subduction interface between Eurasia (EU) and Philippine Sea plate (PSP). This interface is visible in both seismicity and crustal tomography at shallow depths and can be followed into the mantle to depths of 450-500 km using global tomography. The plate interface between EU and PSP in the upper 100 km changes from about 60 degrees in the south to vertical (south-central Taiwan) to overturned (north-central Taiwan). The Eurasian Moho is similarly folded, but it does not overturn. Shortening across the plate boundary is accomplished by a combination of subduction of Eurasian lithosphere, folding and thrusting in the Eurasian upper crust, and a secondary subduction zone within the PSP. We hypothesize that: (1) once arc-continent collision occurs, subduction of Eurasian continental lower crust and upper mantle can continue by lithospheric delamination and by continuity with the much larger Eurasian slab to the south; (2) the upper crust of EU deforms by faulting and folding; (3) the present convergence rate of about 90 mm/yr is limited to the last 2 Ma, whereas the long-term rate is about 30 mm/yr and in Taiwan the difference is being taken up by secondary subduction within the PSP margin; (4) a margin-parallel STEP (Subduction-Transform-Edge-Propagator) fault forms the northern limit of Eurasian subduction, which allows the whole system to propagate self-similarly southwestward.",

            "abstract": "The geographic distribution and areal extent of rock type, along with the hydrologic cycle, influence the efficiency of global silicate weathering. Here we define weathering efficiency as the production of HCO3- for a given land surface area. Modern basaltic catchments located on volcanic arcs and continental flood basalts are particularly efficient, as they account for <5% of sub-aerial bedrock but produce ~30% of the modern global weathering flux. Indeed, changes in this weathering efficiency are thought to play an important role in modulating Earth’s past climate via changes in the areal extent and paleo-latitude of basaltic catchments (e.g., Deccan and Ethiopian Traps, southeast Asia basaltic terranes).\nWe analyze paired river discharge and solute concentration data for basaltic catchments from both literature studies and the USGS NWIS database to mechanistically understand geographic and climatic influences on weathering efficiency. To quantify the chemical weathering efficiency of modern basalt catchments we use solute production equations and compare the results to global river datasets. The weathering efficiency, quantified via the Damköhler coefficient (Dw [m/yr]), is calculated from fitting concentration-discharge relationships for catchments with paired solute and discharge measurements. Most basalt catchments do not demonstrate ‘chemostatic’ behavior. The distribution of basalt catchment Dw values (0.194 ± 0.176 (1σ)), derived using SiO2(aq) concentrations, is significantly higher than global river Dw values (mean Dw of 0.036), indicating a greater chemical weathering efficiency. Despite high Dw values and total weathering fluxes per unit area, many basaltic catchments are producing near their predicted weathering flux limit. Thus, weathering fluxes from basaltic catchments are proportionally less responsive to increases in runoff than other lithologies. The results of other solute species (Mg2+ and Ca2+) are comparable, but are influenced both by the stoichiometry of local primary minerals and secondary clays. Our results provide a framework to interpret how small changes in the areal extent or geographic distribution of basaltic catchments may markedly influence the silicate weathering feedback.",

Correlations of magnetic signals with organic contaminants in soils and sediments were also reported; however, their significance is unclear because of co-existing heavy metal pollution. At a hydrocarbon (HC) contaminated former military airbase (Hradcany, Czech Rep.), where heavy metal contents are insignificant, we detected clearly higher magnetic concentrations at the top of the groundwater fluctuation (GWF) zone. Frequent GWF by up to ca. one meter was caused through remediation by air sparging. In this study and all previous ones magnetite was identified as the dominant phase for higher magnetic concentrations.\nTo determine the importance of microbial activity and soil parameters on changes in magnetic susceptibility (MS) laboratory batch experiments with different microbially active and sterile soils without carbon addition and with gasoline amendment were setup. MS of these microcosms was followed weekly. Depending on the soil MS either increased or decreased by up to ~7% and remained constant afterwards. The main findings were that MS changes were mainly microbially driven and influenced by the bioavailable Fe content, the initial MS and the organic carbon content of the soils. Moreover, we tested magnetic changes in laboratory columns, filled with sand from the field site Hradcany, by simulating water level changes. The observed changes were small and hardly statistically significant.\nOur laboratory studies revealed that different factors influence changes in magnetic properties of soil/sediments after HC contamination, with much smaller effects than expected from anomalies observed at field sites. With the present results, the ambitious goal of using magnetic monitoring for detecting HC contaminations by oil spills seem far from practical application.",

In both cases humidity-related weathering of magnetite to maghemite and hematite by low-temperature oxidation in the catchment is recognized as a main driver. In Qaidam basin fluctuations of low and high MS values show orbital cyclicities and reflect relatively higher and lower humidity, respectively, as revealed by calibration to pollen results. The range and possible changes of the catchment area, remains unclear. A tectonic control of the proxy record becomes evident by comparing results in an overlapping age interval (~2.7-1.7 Ma) of two cores in ~20 km distance. The records in the sediments of the Qaidam basin may be dominated by paleo-environmental changes near the lakeshore and controlled by regional water recycling. In Heqing basin the extent of the catchment is far clearer and processes in the catchment and their pathway into lake sediments are better understood. These processes comprise chemical weathering of limestone rocks, strong magnetic enhancement in soils by both enrichment of coarser-grained magnetite inherited from the bedrock and bacterial production of ultrafine magnetite. Relative changes of wind and surface water transport in more and less humid periods led to systematic variations of MS values and carbonate contents on a clear eccentricity (100-kyr) scale.

The access to past atmosphere conditions in the air bubbles trapped in ice-cores gave an important impulse as it made the green-house gases concentrations accessible a prerequisite for climate modelers. Indeed since the publication of CO2 and CH4 variations over the last climate cycle in Vostok ice-cores, our knowledge of the past climate conditions has improved tremendously. However, improvements in technical equipment and approaches indicate that more is still to come inducing expected new findings in terms of mechanisms. The IMAGES program yielded very good quality and long marine cores that permitted to compare marine and ice-core records with high confidence. Moreover they permitted to improve the knowledge of past oceans dynamics, especially those linked to the massive discharges of icebergs in the oceans, impacting the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. On the continent, various environments are drilled and cored to provide also comparable and reliable records of past climate: lakes, peatbogs, speleothems and loess. These records are complementary yielding important dataset to feed the earth system models necessary for a better understanding of past climate dynamics.\nTechnical limitation of the present equipments does not allow such important jump in the quality of the data, and therefore in the knowledge of i, past climate variations at extremely high resolution and ii, of the behavior of the different domains as studied in IPCC experiments while societal requirements are more and more expressed by policy makers. C2FN initiative at CNRS gathers the present coring equipments located in labs or at the technical division of INSU, and coordinates the different efforts provided by the concerned communities (ocean, ice and continent). Valorization of the results obtained are published in high ranked scientific journals and presented in scientific meetings.

These extremes will directly affect the availability and reliability of water and other critical resources. The most comprehensive suite of multi-model projections has been assembled under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) and assessed in the Fifth Assessment (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In order for these projections to be actionable, the projections should exhibit consistency and fidelity down to the local length and timescales required for operational resource planning, for example the scales relevant for water allocations from a major watershed.\nIn this presentation, we summarize the length and timescales relevant for resource planning and then use downscaled versions of the IPCC simulations over the contiguous United States to address three questions. First, over what range of scales is there quantitative agreement between the simulated historical extremes and in situ measurements? Second, does this range of scales in the historical and future simulations overlap with the scales relevant for resource management and adaptation? Third, does downscaling enhance the degree of multi-model consistency at scales smaller than the typical global model resolution? We conclude by using these results to highlight requirements for further model development to make the next generation of models more useful for planning purposes.",

            "abstract": "The knowledge of deep hydrous geological fluids has been strongly improved thanks to characterizations performed in situ in hydrothermal diamond anvil cells (HDAC) experiments. However, such investigations are suffering from pressure and temperature limitations (in most of the cases: up to 2 GPa, 1100°C), and from the need of pressure sensors at low pressures (from room pressure to a few GPa) and at high temperatures.\nThis study aims at providing an accurate method to determine in situ the sample pressure in a diamond anvil cell experiment. Therefore we report the calibration of the pressure shift of the Raman line of a 98.3 atom. % 13C diamond and we propose a new equation to determine the pressure up to 16 GPa and 800°C.This method is suitable for the study of geological fluids during hydrothermal experiments performed at low pressures (up to a few GPa) and high temperature (up to 800°C), particularly for subduction zone processes involving aqueous fluids or/and silicate melts. We also present a new designed hydrothermal diamond anvil cell allowing the study of geological fluids at crustal and mantle conditions. This HDAC is externally heated, it can be combined with laser heating. It is equipped with a pressure driven membrane, allowing isothermal decompressions. It is versatile enough to be used with any kind of diamond anvil (standard design, Boelher-Almax design or plates).\nAs an application, we have determined the total miscibility between water and a silicate melt of haplogranite composition and compared the pressure determined with the equation of state of water with the pressure measured through the 13C diamond sensor. We show that the use of the equation of state of water to calculate the pressure for such experiments is less accurate but valid.",

            "abstract": "Changes in global mean sea level (GMSL) are a sensitive indicator of climate variability during the current ice age. Reconstructions are largely based on local sea level records, and the mapping to GMSL is computed from simulations of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) on 1-D Earth models. We argue, using two case studies, that resolving important, outstanding issues in ice age paleoclimate requires a more sophisticated consideration of mantle structure and dynamics.\nFirst, we consider the coral record from Barbados, which is widely used to constrain global ice volume changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21 ka). Analyses of the record using 1-D viscoelastic Earth models have estimated a GMSL change since LGM of ~120 m, a value at odds with analyses of other far field records, which range from 130-135 m. We revisit the Barbados case using a GIA model that includes laterally varying Earth structure (Austermann et al., Nature Geo., 2013) and demonstrate that neglecting this structure, in particular the high-viscosity slab in the mantle linked to the subduction of the South American plate, has biased (low) previous estimates of GMSL change since LGM by ~10 m. Our analysis brings the Barbados estimate into accord with studies from other far-field sites.\nSecond, we revisit estimates of GMSL during the mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP, ~3 Ma), which was characterized by temperatures 2-3°C higher than present. The ice volume deficit during this period is a source of contention, with estimates ranging from 0-40 m GMSL equivalent. We argue that refining estimates of ice volume during MPWP requires a correction for mantle flow induced dynamic topography (DT; Rowley et al., Science, 2013), a signal neglected in previous studies of ice age sea level change. We present estimates of GIA- and DT-corrected elevations of MPWP shorelines from the U.S. east coast, Australia and South Africa in an attempt to reconcile these records with a single GMSL value.",

            "abstract": "A 20–40% reduction in soil moisture is projected for the boreal forest of Eastern Canada for the period 2070–99 relative to 1971–2000. In order to better predict the effects of a reduced water supply on the growth of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), a dominant tree species of the boreal forest, we simulated 2 consecutive years of summer droughts (starting in July) by means of throughfall exclusion.\nFour 100-m2 plots were established in 2010 with polyethylene sheets maintained 1.3–2 m aboveground and redirecting the water outside the plots. Wood microcores were extracted weekly from mature trees from April to October 2011 to analyse the time dynamics of wood formation in that year. The number of tracheids formed during and before treatment and their anatomical characteristics were determined through microscopic analyses. The growth of lateral and terminal branches and the water potential of balsam fir seedlings were also monitored.\nThroughfall exclusion significantly reduced soil water content by 5.8% in 2010 and 10.5% in 2011. Xylogenesis was affected significantly by the treatment. Tracheids were 16.1% smaller in diameter and their cell wall was 14.1% thicker during both years. The treatment delayed by more than a week the start of the tracheid differentiation process in the second year with a concomitant decrease (26%) in the number of tracheids produced. The seedlings displayed a 32% reduction in growth and a 40% reduction in leaf water potential. Our results suggest that a future regime of increased frequency and intensity of droughts could have nega­tive effects on the duration of xylogenesis and the amount of carbon sequestrated in balsam fir.",

In this scheme, the unknown model parameters (the conductivity/resistivity distribution) are represented in terms of a basis such as Fourier and wavelet (Haar and Daubechies). By applying a truncation criterion, the model may then be approximated by a reduced number of basis functions, which is usually much less than the number of the model parameters. Further, because the geophysical electromagnetic measurements have low resolution, it is sufficient for inversion to only keep the low-spatial frequency part of the image. This model-compression scheme accelerates the computational time and also reduces the memory usage of the Gauss-Newton method. We are able to significantly reduce the algorithm computational complexity without compromising the quality of the inverted models.",

Images and output data are available for use by the disaster relief and science communities with updates available every three hours (\nhttp://flood.umd.edu\n). The system currently uses the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis [TMPA]) and a hydrological and routing combination model, the Dominant river Routing Integrated with VIC Environment (DRIVE) system. The land surface and runoff calculations are carried out at 0.125° latitude-longitude resolution with routing and streamflow calculations done at that resolution and also at 1km resolution. Examples of results for recent flood events will be presented, including calculated inundation maps compared to those estimated from MODIS data.\nEvaluation of the system against a global flood event archive indicates skill for longer duration floods in terms of Probability of Detection (POD) [~ 0.8] and False Alarm Rates (FAR) [~0.6]. False alarms are often associated with the presence of dams (not accounted for in the system at present), but sometimes with overestimates of rainfall or artifacts (false rain) related to surface conditions (e.g., cold/wet ground). Failures of detection are often related to underestimation of rainfall, frequently due to shallow, orographic systems unseen or underestimated due to lack of a strong scattering signal in the passive microwave observations. Results from GPM-related hydrology field experiments in Iowa (IFloods) and North Carolina (IPHEX) will also be presented where the GFMS is used in a regional mode with rainfall input from various satellite and surface rainfall products, with results compared in terms of rainfall and streamflow.",

            "abstract": "As carbon solubility is low in basalts, MORB contain little dissolved CO2 (189±61 ppm, 1σ, n=600 [1]). A global negative correlation between CO2/Nb (proxy for amount of CO2 lost by degassing) and Ba/La (proxy for source enrichment) indicates that depleted MORB are less affected by degassing than enriched MORB: CO2/Nb ratios range from 0-100 for samples with Ba/La>4, while CO2/Nb range from 50 to 400 for samples with Ba/La<4 [1]. To assess the CO2 content of undegassed MORB, we analyzed the volatile content of 70 olivine-hosted, glassy melt inclusions (MIs) from four basalts dredged along MAR 1-5°S, a ridge segment that produces highly depleted MORB in terms of trace element enrichment and radiogenic isotopes [2, 3]. MIs contain CO2 contents (180-1420 ppm) that are higher than their respective matrix glasses (130-220 ppm, typical for vapor-saturated melts erupted at 3-5 km b.s.l.).\nOne of the four dredges (EN061 5D-3Ag) contains MIs that do not exhibit shrinkage bubbles. For this sample only, we find a positive correlation between the CO2 content (240-770 ppm) and the Cl content (6-20 ppm) of the MIs that is not found in the matrix glasses (see Fig.). We infer that the correlation between CO2 and Cl, both highly incompatible in silicate minerals during fractional crystallization, is strong evidence for vapor-undersaturation, as any CO2 degassing would have erased the correlation. Together with MIs from the Siqueiros Fracture Zone [4] and from northern Iceland [5], the MIs from EN061 5D-3Ag may represent another occurrence of carbon-undersaturated MORB. Our results will be used to model the primary carbon content of MORB and of the depleted upper mantle. Note that the average Cl content of the matrix glasses (20±1 ppm) is higher than those of the MIs (12±3 ppm, see Fig.). This indicates either that the matrix glasses assimilated a small amount of seawater Cl, or that the MIs are all more depleted than the matrix glass. We will acquire major and trace element data in order to further investigate the origin of the low Cl and high CO2 contents in these MIs.\nRef. [1] Le Voyer et al. 2014 Goldschmidt abstr.

            "abstract": "Located in the Sanbagawa subduction-related high-pressure metamorphic belt in SW Japan on the island of Shikoku, the Higashi-akaishi peridotite body is composed of dunite, lherzolite and garnet clinopyroxenite, interfingered in one locality with quartz-rich eclogite. Previous work indicates the P-T history of the peridotite includes rapid prograde metamorphism with peak temperatures of 700-810°C and pressures of 2.9-3.8 GPa [1] at ~88-89 Ma followed by rapid exhumation at >2.5 cm/yr [2,3]. Major and trace element and isotopic data from samples within the Higashi-akaishi peridotite presented here and in another recent study [4] provide a record of subduction zone melting processes in a paleo-mantle wedge. Ultramafic samples range from 40-52 wt.% SiO2, 1-11 wt.% Al2O3 and 21-45 wt.% MgO with olivine and clinopyroxene Mg#’s as high as 0.93. The quartz-rich eclogite contains 62 wt.% SiO2, 6 wt.% MgO and 13 wt.% Al2O3 with trace element concentrations that are enriched relative to the ultramafic samples. 87Sr/86Sr (.703237-.704288), 143Nd/144Nd (εNd=+2 to +6) and Pb isotopic compositions are within the range of previously studied Japanese arc rocks. We interpret the pyroxenites as shallowly crystallized cumulates with varying amounts of trapped hydrous melt and the harzburgites as residues of melting. The peak P-T conditions of these rocks are similar to the solidus conditions of H2O-saturated fertile mantle near the base of the mantle wedge [5,6]. The presence of garnet porphyroblasts that enclose primary euhedral chlorite together with the chemical evidence, suggest these samples are associated with mantle melting in the presence of H2O. Major element modeling suggests the quartz-rich eclogite composition can be reproduced through mixing melts of subducted sediment with wet peridotite melts in the mantle wedge. Thus the Higashi-aikashi rock suite provides an in-situ record of the beginnings of hydrous melting and the mechanisms of metasomatism in the mantle wedge.\n[1] Enami et al. (2004) J. Meta.

            "abstract": "The Eastern Volcanic Zone (EVZ) of Iceland is defined by a number of volcanic systems and large basaltic eruptions occur both through central volcanoes (e.g. Grímsvötn) and on associated fissure rows (e.g. Laki, Eldgjá). We have collected a large quantity of micro-analytical data from a number of EVZ eruptions, with the aim of identifying common processes that occur in the premonitory stages of significant volcanic events. Here, we focus on the AD 1783 Laki event, the early postglacial Saksunarvatn tephra and the sub-glacially erupted Skuggafjöll tindar and for each of these eruptions we have >100 olivine-hosted or plagioclase-hosted melt inclusion analyses for major, trace and volatile elements. These large datasets are vital for understanding the history of melt evolution in the plumbing system of basaltic volcanoes. Diverse trace element compositions in melt inclusions hosted in primitive macrocrysts (i.e. Fo>84, An>84) indicate that the mantle melts supplied to the plumbing system of EVZ eruptions are highly variable in composition. Concurrent mixing and crystallisation of these melts occurs in crustal magma bodies. The levels of the deepest of these magma bodies are not well constrained by EVZ petrology, with only a handful of high-CO2 melt inclusions from Laki providing evidence for magma supply from >5 kbar. In contrast, the volatile contents of melt inclusions in evolved macrocrysts, which are close to equilibrium with the carrier liquids, indicate that final depths of inclusion entrapment are 0.5-2 kbar. The major element composition of the matrix glasses shows that the final pressure of equilibration between the melt and its macrocryst phases also occurred at 0.5-2 kbar. The relationship between these pressures and seismic/geodetic estimates of chamber depths needs to be carefully evaluated. The melt inclusion and macrocryst compositional record indicates that injection of porphyritic, gas-rich primitive melt into evolved/enriched and degassed shallow magma bodies may be a common process. Formation and disaggregation of mush is also recorded in the eruptive products, and crystal zonation patterns indicate 1-10 day timescales between mush disaggregation and eruption, helping to constrain potential CO2 fluxes immediately prior to large EVZ events.",

A particular ATTREX emphasis is to better understand the dehydration of air as it passes through the cold tropical tropopause region. The ATTREX payload contains 12 in situ and remote sensing instruments that measure water vapor, clouds, multiple gaseous tracers (CO, CO2, CH4, NMHC, SF6, CFCs, N2O), reactive chemical compounds (O3, BrO, NO2), meteorological parameters, and radiative fluxes.\nDuring January-March, 2014, the Global Hawk was deployed to Guam for ATTREX flights. Six science flights were conducted from Guam (in addition to the transits across the Pacific), resulting in over 100 hours of Western Pacific TTL sampling and about 180 vertical profiles through the TTL.

            "abstract": "Flexible plants bend in response to fluid motion and this reconfiguration mechanism allows plants to minimize the increase of drag force with increasing velocity, ensuring survival in flow-dominated habitats. The effect of reconfiguration on the flow field can be modeled by introducing a drag coefficient that decreases with increasing velocity. Typically, a power-law decrease of the drag coefficient with increasing velocity is used, and the negative exponent is known as the Vogel number. In practice, the Vogel number is a function of canopy rigidity and flow conditions. In this work we show that accounting for the effect of reconfiguration is required for large-eddy simulation (LES) models to reproduce the skewness of the streamwise and vertical velocity components and the distribution of sweeps and ejections observed in a large cornfield. Additional LES runs are conducted to investigate the structure of turbulence in different reconfiguration regimes, with mean vertical momentum flux constrained by measurements. The change of the Vogel number has negligible effects on LES predictions of the total vertical momentum flux and the components of turbulent kinetic energy, but produces profound changes in the mechanisms of momentum transport. This work demonstrates the necessity to model the effect of reconfiguration in LES studies of canopy flows. It also highlights the impacts of reconfiguration on the structure of turbulence and the dynamics of momentum fluxes, as well as any other process that depends on velocity fluctuations above and within the canopy region.",

            "abstract": "The recovery of environmental signatures from coral skeletons is often made difficult by ‘vital effects’, which cause skeletal chemistry to deviate from the expected composition of aragonite in equilibrium with seawater. Recent studies show that Mg isotopes in scleractinian corals are subject to vital effects, which appear as a departure of the δ26Mg coral temperature dependence from that of inorganic aragonite [1]. However, different from the case for Mg/Ca or δ44Ca in coral, the magnitude of the observed Mg-isotope vital effect is small (on the order of 0.1 ‰ or less). In addition, measurements of different species of modern coral show similar fractionations, suggesting that coral δ26Mg is not species dependent [2]. Together, these observations indicate that corals should faithfully record the seawater Mg-isotope composition, and that vital effects will not bias reconstructions.\nWe measured Mg isotopes in a set of extremely well-preserved fossil scleractinian corals, ranging in age from Jurassic through Recent, to reconstruct past seawater δ26Mg. Well-preserved fossil corals of similar age show a range in δ26Mg of ~0.2 ‰, pointing to the presence of vital effects. However, our results show little variability in the δ26Mg of fossil corals across different geologic ages, suggesting that seawater δ26Mg has remained relatively constant throughout the Cenozoic and Mesozoic. This pattern has implications for our understanding of the mechanisms driving secular variations in seawater Mg/Ca. In particular, our data imply that dolomitization rates have not changed enough during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic to account for secular variations in seawater Mg/Ca.\nOur coral δ26Mg record agrees with a Cenozoic record from bulk foraminifera, further supporting the faithfulness of the coral archive. However, both of these records disagree with a third Cenozoic Mg-isotope record, derived from species-specific planktic forams [3].\n[1] Saenger, C. et al. (2014) Chem.

            "abstract": "Since the proposal by Brace and Byerlee [1966] that the mechanism of stick-slip is similar to earthquakes, many experimental studies have been conducted in order to improve the understanding of rupture mechanics. Here, we report the results of macroscopic stick-slip events in saw-cut samples deformed under controlled upper crustal stress conditions in the laboratory. Experiments were conducted under triaxial laoding (σ1>σ2=σ3) at confining pressures ranging from 10 to 100 MPa. Usual a dual gain system, a high frequency monitoring array recorded the microseismicity during stick-slip sequences and the particle accelerations during macroscopic instabilities. While strain, stress and axial shortening were measured until 10 Hz sampling rate, we also recorded for the first time the dynamic stress changes during macroscopic rupture using dynamic strain gages located close to the fault plane (10 MHz sampling rate).\nWe show that increasing the normal stress acting on the fault plane (i) increases the intensity of foreshock activity prior to the main rupture, (ii) increases the friction along the fault plane, (iii) increases the seismic slip, and (iv) induces the transition from sub-Rayleigh to supershear ruptures [Passelègue et al., 2013]. In addition, after demonstrating that our stick-slip instabilities exhibit a purely slip weakening behavior, we estimated the rupture processes parameters including the size of the breakdown zone (R), the slip-weakening distance (Dc), the energy rate (F) and the fracture energy (G). We compare our results with linear elastic fracture mechanics and previous experimental studies.\nFinally, the dynamic stress drop is almost complete at high normal stresses with dynamic friction drop ranging from 0.4 to 0.6. These results are consistent with the onset of melting, which was confirmed by our post mortem microstructural analysis (XRD, SEM, TEM). These results show that weakening mechanisms are activated after only 80 µm of slip, suggesting that, at least at the scale of asperities, the resulting dynamic stress drop could be much larger than current seismological estimates. In addition, we demonstrate that the radiation efficiency decreases with the dynamic friction coefficient, suggesting that rupture processes become more dispersive under high normal stress conditions.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic time series are the superimposition of a number of geophysical signals, errors, and noise. The objective of sources separation is to isolate and to identify each contribution. Indeed, when using geodetic data to study mass redistributions within the Earth system and the dynamics their reflect, it is a crucial step to separate the different geophysical signals in the time series.\nSources separation techniques generally estimate a separation matrix, which depends on assumptions on the nature of the sources. Here, several sources separation techniques were tested : PCA (Principal Component Analysis), rotated PCA, and two methods of ICA (Independant Component Analysis). PCA assumes that the sources are linearly independent, whereas ICA searches for sources that are statistically independent. Among the ICA techniques, different methods can be used to ensure this statistical independence. We tested two of them: non-gaussianity of the sources and minimization of the mutual information. First, we tested the adequacy between the hypothesis on the sources involved in each kind of separation technique, and the nature of and characteristics of these sources. Then, we built from these a priori sources synthetic geodetic time series and we tested the performances of each separation technique to retrieve the original sources. Results show great differences between the results obtained with the different separation techniques. In particular, if periodic signals are well retrieved by all separation techniques, PCA gives better results in order to retrieve interannual climatic signals and ICA performs better for some specific a priori sources like co-seismic signals.",

            "abstract": "Increasing demands on the limited and variable water supply across the West can result in insufficient streamflow to sustain healthy fish habitat. We develop an integrated decision support system (DSS) for modeling and mitigating stream temperature impacts and demonstrate it on the Sacramento River system in California. Water management in the Sacramento River is a complex task with a diverse set of demands ranging from municipal supply to mitigation of fisheries impacts due to high water temperatures. Current operations utilize the temperature control device (TCD) structure at Shasta Dam to mitigate these high water temperatures downstream at designated compliance points. The TCD structure at Shasta Dam offers a rather unique opportunity to mitigate water temperature violations through adjustments to both release volume and temperature. In this study, we develop and evaluate a model-based DSS with four broad components that are coupled to produce the decision tool for stream temperature mitigation: (i) a suite of statistical models for modeling stream temperature attributes using hydrology and climate variables of critical importance to fish habitat; (ii) a reservoir thermal model for modeling the thermal structure and, consequently, the water release temperature, (iii) a stochastic weather generator to simulate weather sequences consistent with seasonal outlooks; and, (iv) a set of decision rules (i.e., ‘rubric’) for reservoir water releases in response to outputs from the above components. Multiple options for modifying releases at Shasta Dam were considered in the DSS, including mixing water from multiple elevations through the TCD and using different acceptable levels of risk. The DSS also incorporates forecast uncertainties and reservoir operating options to help mitigate stream temperature impacts for fish habitat, while efficiently using the reservoir water supply and cold pool storage. The use of these coupled tools in simulating impacts of future climate on stream temperature variability is also demonstrated. Results indicate that the DSS could substantially reduce the number of violations of thermal criteria, while ensuring maintenance of the cold pool storage throughout the summer.",

            "abstract": "Atmosphere-ocean interactions play an important role for understanding processes and feedbacks in the Southern Ocean (SO) that play a key role for explaining the variability in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The most important atmospheric forcing at high and mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere is the westerly wind belt which strongly impacts the strength and extension of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), upwelling of deep-water masses, and also controls the back-flow of intermediate waters to the tropics.\nWe combine sea surface temperature, current strength, and mineral dust proxy data from the Pacific SO including Drake Passage with climate model results. Our data show that Drake Passage throughflow was reduced and the ACC generally weakened during the last glacial. The reduced Drake Passage throughflow was accompanied by a pronounced northward extension of the Antarctic cold-water sphere in the Southeast Pacific sector and stronger export of surface and intermediate water into the South Pacific gyre. These oceanographic changes are consistent with reduced westerly winds within the modern maximum wind strength zone over the subantarctic ACC and reduced wind forcing due to extended sea-ice further south. Despite of reduced winds in the core of the westerlies, we observe 3-fold higher dust deposition during glacial periods in the Pacific SO. This observation may be explained by a combination of factors including more expanded arid dust source areas in Australia and a northward extent or enhancement of the westerlies over Southeast Australia during glacials that would plausibly increase the dust uptake and export into the Pacific SO. Such scenario would imply stronger westerlies at the present northernmost margin of the wind belt coeval with weaker core westerlies and reduced ACC strength including Drake Passage throughflow during glacials. These results have strong implications for the global meridional overturning circulation and the interbasin exchange in the SO.",

In other hand, the structure and composition of hydrothermal systems are the result of complex interactions between heat sources, fluids, wall rocks, tectonic controls and even biological processes.\nUltraslow spreading ridges, including the Southwest Indian Ridge, the Gakkel Ridge, are most remarkable end member in plate-boundary structures (Dick et al., 2003), featured with extensive tectonic amagmatic spreading and frequent exposure of peridotite and gabbro. With intensive surveys in last decades, it is suggested that ultraslow ridges are several times more effective than faster-spreading ridges in sustaining hydrothermal activities. This increased efficiency could attributed to deep mining of heat and even exothermic serpentinisation (Baker et al., 2004).\nDistinct from in faster spreading ridges, one characteristics of hydrothermal mineralization on seafloor in ultraslow spreading ridges, including the active Dragon Flag hydrothermal field at 49.6 degree of the Southwest Indian Ridge, is abundant and pervasive distribution of lower temperature precipitated minerals ( such as Fe-silica or silica, Mn (Fe) oxides, sepiolite, pyrite, marcasite etc. ) in hydrothermal fields. Structures formed by lower temperature activities in active and dead hydrothermal fields are also obviously. High temperature precipitated minerals such as chalcopyrite etc. are rare or very limited in hydrothermal chimneys. Distribution of diverse low temperature hydrothermal activities is consistence with the deep heating mechanisms and hydrothermal circulations in the complex background of ultraslow spreading tectonics. Meanwhile, deeper and larger mineralization at certain locations along the ultraslow spreading ridges is also presumable.",

Mariner 2 flew by Venus in 1962 at a distance of 41,000 km, but no radiation was detected. The Mariner 4 mission to Mars did not observe planet-associated increase in radiation, but scaling arguments with Earth’s magnetosphere yielded an upper limit to the ratio of magnetic moments of MM/ME < 0.001 (Van Allen et al, 1965). Similarly, the Mariner 5 flyby closer to Venus resulted in a ratio of magnetic moments < 0.001 (Van Allen et al, 1967), dealing a blow to the expectation that all planetary bodies must possess significant VAB. The flyby of Mercury in 1974 by Mariner 10 revealed a weak magnetic field, but the presence of durably trapped higher energy particles remained controversial until MESSENGER in 2011.The first flybys of Jupiter by Pioneers 10, 11 in 1973 and 1974, respectively, measured a plethora of energetic particles in Jupiter’s magnetosphere and established the fact that their intensities were rotationally modulated. Later flybys of Jupiter and Saturn by the two Voyagers in 1979 and 1981 revealed that those magnetospheres possessed their own internal plasma source(s) and radiation belts. Subsequent discoveries of Van Allen belts at Uranus and Neptune by Voyager 2 demonstrated that VAB are the rule rather than the exception in planetary environments. We now know from the Voyagers and through Energetic Neutral Atom images from Cassini and IBEX that an immense energetic particle population surrounds the heliosphere itself. Thus, the reconnaissance of radiation belts of our solar system has been completed, some 56 years after the discovery of the Van Allen Belts at Earth.",

            "abstract": "The Oman ophiolite is the largest and best-known ophiolite in the world. It formed in the Cretaceous (~95 Ma) in the Neotethyan ocean, but its geodynamic setting of formation has been heavily debated for over three decades. Many workers have assumed that it formed in an open ocean setting, consequently utilising the ophiolite as a direct analogue for fast-spreading oceanic crust, whereas others argue that the complex formed in a subduction setting. Here, we make the case that the Oman ophiolite records the evolution of the upper plate of a newly initiated subduction zone.\nUsing a database of >1200 lava and dyke analyses (‘OmanDB’), we show that the earliest lava sequence (the Geotimes unit) is systematically different to modern mid-ocean ridge basalt, and that these differences can be explained by the presence of elevated water contents. This rules out a mid-ocean ridge origin, pointing instead to a subduction-related setting. The lavas evolved from the Geotimes ‘moist MORB’ to island-arc tholeiite and boninite (the Lasail and Alley units); hence, we conclude that the entire ophiolite formed in a subduction zone. The data suggest a progressive addition of water and concomitant depletion of the mantle source. High-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology indicates that this fundamental change in magmatic source occurred within ~2 million years.\nThe spreading structure of the ophiolite is characterized by a series of NW-SE trending propagating rifts that crosscut earlier N-S trending ridge segments. Together with palaeomagnetic evidence, which calls for 30° clockwise rotation between Geotimes and Lasail/Alley, and 120° between Lasail/Alley and the later Salahi lavas, it suggests that construction of the lithosphere was accompanied by significant plate rotation.\nCombined, the available evidence suggests that the rapid change in magmatic signature to increasingly arc-like compositions was coeval with large-scale rotational disaggregation of young ocean lithosphere and consequent reorganisation of the spreading system. This is consistent with the formation of the ophiolite above a newly initiated subduction zone, where a rapidly sinking slab changes the mantle melting regime and induces rotational stress due to differential rollback.",

            "abstract": "Geodetic observations of postseismic deformation have been widely modeled to constrain the rheology of lower crust and/or upper mantle in variable tectonic environments. In subduction zones, postseismic deformation following megathrust earthquakes is often explained by afterslip and/or viscoelastic relaxation (VER) processes, and explicitly modeled to infer the viscosity of the mantle wedge. Besides the megathrust events, large intermediate-depth normal faulting earthquakes also induce stresses in surrounding lithosphere. Presumably, these stresses will be gradually released by viscoelastic relaxation in any nearby weak layer(s) and hence provide opportunities to infer rheological properties.\nThe 2005 Mw 7.8 Tarapaca earthquake is identified as a result of normal faulting on a west-dipping plane at depths between 90 and 115 km within the subducting slab of northern Chile (Delouis and Legrand, 2007). The Envisat-recorded short-term postseismic deformation shows an elliptical pattern of subsidence across the fault’s surface projection. We construct a semi-analytical three-dimensional model, which takes into account the vertical and horizontal heterogeneities of viscosity. Our preliminary results of VER modelling show a first-order similarity in spatial pattern with the InSAR observed deformation, assuming a Maxwell viscosity of 5e18 Pa s for the continental upper mantle and 1e20 Pa s for the oceanic upper mantle. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using normal faulting earthquakes to constrain deep subduction zone rheology.",

A particularly expansive data set has been collected in Southern Africa, started through the Southern Africa Magnetotelluric Experiment (SAMTEX) experiment, now continuing north through Zambia as part of the Project for Rift Initiation Development and Evolution (PRIDE) experiment. The combined data set highlights large variability in lithospheric structure that broadly correlates with surface geology: cratonic lithosphere is generally thick and electrically resistive, while much thinner lithosphere is seen beneath mobile belts.\nIn areas of relatively uniform resistivity structure, we have constructed resistivity-depth profiles and use new laboratory data to place constraints on the water content of lithospheric mantle. Uncertainty in our estimates arises from differences between different laboratory results, but our data are generally consistent with a slightly damp upper lithospheric mantle above a dry and strong cratonic root.\nOther areas show complexity of structure that is difficult to understand using current knowledge of conductivity –the Bushveld complex, where the mantle is highly conductive, is one such example.\nIn southwestern Zambia, the lithosphere is seen to be very thin (around 50km) beneath mobile belt terrain, as was inferred nearly 40 years ago on the basis of high heatflow. The mantle is highly conductive, most likely due to a combination of elevated temperatures, water content and perhaps a trace amount of melting. This anomalous structure may be linked to the southwest propagation of the East African Rift system.",

Seafloor magnetotelluric data from four stations were analysed using 2-D regularized isotropic and anisotropic inverse modeling. The preferred electrical model for the region contains a 70-80 km thick resistive (>103 Ωm) lithosphere with a conductive (~50 Ωm) underlying asthenosphere. The preferred model is isotropic and lacks a highly conductive (≤10 Ωm) layer under the 70-80 km thick resistive lithosphere that would be indicative of partial melt. However, the model does contain a more conductive lower lithosphere and asthenosphere than predicted by dry olivine models. We averaged the model into a 1-D profile and compared the result with laboratory data, and models from other locations. Water, in the form of hydrogen dissolved in olivine, is the most likely mechanism responsible for the enhanced conductivity. Predicted bulk mantle water contents are low (20-50ppm) at 100km depth and increase slightly into the asthenosphere (40-500ppm), with the range of values dependent on the conductivity model chosen. The predicted water contents support the theory that the rheological lithosphere is a result of dehydration during melting at a mid-ocean ridge with the asthenosphere remaining partially hydrated and weakened as a result.",

As such they constitute a humankind asset in their importance for monitoring changes in global environmental conditions. With spaceborne Earth observation (EO) missions dating back to the 1970s, 40 years worth of observations are now available in EO data archives worldwide. Data holdings are growing exponentially, e.g. with the Sentinel series of high resolution EO satellites of the European Copernicus Program – which introduces a new dimension of data volumes to be handled.\nAs other EO data holders around the globe, the European Space Agency (ESA) and its member states are committed to keeping the valuable EO data assets safe, accessible, and useable for an unlimited timespan. Rapidly evolving information technology and changing user requirements call for a dedicated and coordinated approach to EO data long term preservation.\nIn Europe collaborative EO data stewardship activities are coordinated by ESA within the ESA long term data preservation (LTDP) program. With a view to the entire data set life cycle of historic and current missions an active LTDP working group addresses a wide range of relevant technical and organizational topics. Studies investigate archiving and access technologies, user expectations, or applicable standards; guidelines and best practices recommend preservation workflows, steps to take in curating individual data sets, the composition of the preserved data set, or concepts for introducing persistent identifiers. Fostering an active international exchange, the activities and documents developed within this European LTDP framework extend beyond Europe by being introduced to the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS).\nThe paper describes the European LTDP cooperation framework, discusses individual focus areas and current activities, and highlights the interaction with global data stewardship initiatives.",

            "abstract": "Cloud parameterizations in climate models include a number of adjustable parameters that arise from uncertainties in cloud processes. These parameters are often tuned to best reproduce specific aspects of the observed climate, such as the energy balance at the top of the atmosphere. Starting with the CMIP5 GFDL CM3 coupled climate model, we construct alternate model configurations that achieve the desired energy balance using different, but plausible, combinations of parameters. The present-day climate is nearly indistinguishable in all configurations, but the evolution of the surface temperature from pre-industrial to present-day differs markedly among these configurations due to a large spread in the magnitude of the aerosol indirect effect. Details of the cloud-to-rain conversion processes are found to be the source for this large spread.\nRecently developed methodologies to analyze the CloudSat and A-Train satellite observations are employed to construct the statistical “fingerprint” process-level signatures of the cloud-to-rain processes. These methodologies are applied to both satellite observations and climate models. Such comparisons can be used to help constrain uncertain parameters included in cloud parameterizations. One of the highlighted results demonstrates that the model predictability of twentieth-century historical temperature trends contradicts the process-based constraint on a tunable cloud parameter. This implies the presence of compensating errors at a fundamental level, and underscores the importance of observation-based, process-level constraints on model microphysics uncertainties for more reliable predictions of the aerosol indirect effect. This uncertainty in the magnitude of the aerosol indirect effect ultimately limits our ability to constrain the climate sensitivity.",

            "abstract": "Prolonged extension of the continents results in deep elongated rift valleys at the surface and a rift-centered magma ponding zones at the crust-mantle boundary. The ascending magma sometimes erupts to the surface producing volcanism both in the rift valley, or counterintuitively, at off-rift volcanic fields offset by tens of kilometers from the source of magma at depth. The driving forces behind the off-rift surface distribution of magmatism remain enigmatic. Here we demonstrate, with numerical boundary element models of dyke propagation, that the gravitational unloading induced by crustal thinning and rift border faulting can steer dykes away from the deep magma ponding zone towards the rift sides, eventually causing eruptions at tens of kilometers outside the rift border. Furthermore, our models predict the formation of stacked magmatic sills in the lower crust above the magma ponding zone, and the along-rift propagation of shallow dykes in rifting events. Gravitational unloading, which facilitates decompression melting of the asthenosphere, is fundamental in controlling the transfer of magma from depth to the surface. Our predictions are consistent with the location and shape of intrusions, as well as the distribution of volcanism from rift zones around the Earth.",

(1993) taking advantage of more recent geological constraints from ODP Leg 158 drill holes across the hydrothermal mounds and high-resolution bathymetry. The dipolar magnetic anomaly associated with the site is better reduced to the pole assuming an inclination of 10° (instead of 44° expected at 26°N) for the magnetization vector. Such an observation suggests that basalt surrounding the site, which belongs to a strongly \"faulted and fissured zone\" (FFZ), has been rotated by ~53° along a N30°E horizontal axis (parallel to the MAR axis in this area) as a probable consequence of the detachment tectonics inferred in this area. The FFZ faults, together with the deeper detachment, focus and guide the hot ascending hydrothermal fluid. Magnetic forward modeling of the site shows that, although insufficient to explain the whole observed negative anomaly, the hydrothermal material - and more specifically the stockwork zone - is a significant cause of missing magnetization that contributes to about a third of the observed anomaly. The rest of the anomaly is accounted for by a deeper source possibly related to thermal demagnetization of an ascending hydrothermal pipe beneath the active part of the site. The significant contribution of the stockwork zone to the magnetic signature of TAG confirms that it is a common character of all type of hydrothermal sites, of potential interest for deep-sea mineral exploration.\nTivey, M.A., Rona, P.A., and Schouten H., 1993, Reduced crustal magnetization beneath the active mound, TAG hydrothermal field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, at 26°N: Earth and Planetary Science Letters, v. 115, p. 101-115, doi:10.1016/0012-821X(93)90216-V.",

Glacier surface mass balance is monitored by the direct (also called glaciological, traditional or conventional) method and indirectly assessed by the geodetic (or cartographic) method. The current glacier monitoring programme includes direct surface mass-balance investigations on 14 glaciers. Since measurements started at Storbreen in 1949, mass balance has been measured on a total of 43 glaciers. The accuracy of the direct measurements depends on both the accuracy of the point observations and inter- and extrapolation of point values to spatially distributed values. Long series of measurements can be inhomogeneous because of changes in personnel, methods, and glacier topography. Reanalysing glacier mass balance series is recommended as standard procedure for every mass balance monitoring programme with increasing importance for long time series. Repeated, detailed glacier mapping by aerial photography and photogrammetric methods, and recently by laser scanning (LIDAR), have been performed to calculate geodetic mass balance. The geodetic results are used as an independent check of the direct method as well as to monitor volume, area and mass changes of glaciers that lack direct measurements. Since 2007, LIDAR campaigns have been conducted on a 1/3 of the glacier area in Norway including all current mass balance glaciers. The objectives of the surveys are to produce high quality digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos to document the present state of the glaciers and assess glacier changes since previous surveys. Furthermore, the DEMs and orthophotos provide an accurate baseline for future repeated mapping and glacier change detection. Here we present geodetic mass balance results for Norway over the last 50 years and compare the results with the direct in-situ measurements where available. We also show examples of how glacier mass balance data are being reanalyzed including homogenization and uncertainty assessments, and, in cases of unexplained discrepancies, adjusting the (annual) glaciological to the (multi-annual) geodetic balances.",

Although much of this organic matter and its element content accumulates and cycles relatively slowly, understanding the dynamics of these stores at a landscape scale requires a perspective that includes not only the vertical exchanges with the atmosphere but also the lateral movement and processing of carbon and nitrogen as they as they are transported down hillslopes and into and through lakes and streams. The pool sizes and residence times of C and N differ greatly among lakes, streams, and the terrestrial ecosystems at different locations along hillslopes and in catchments, yet they are all linked through this lateral transport and through the stoichiometry of organic matter cycling.\nLandscape-scale C and N budgets for the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, Alaska, indicate that significant amounts of C removed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis on land are later returned to the atmosphere from lakes and streams. Nitrogen, on the other hand, is much more strongly retained by terrestrial ecosystems and moves much more slowly across the land surface; this N retention and recycling is an important regulator of terrestrial productivity and C accumulation. These relationships are likely to change with climate and especially with climate-related disturbances including wildfire and thermal erosion of permafrost.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s low velocity zone, ubiquitous in the shallow oceanic mantle, is associated with the base of the lithosphere and a low viscosity zone. Recent observations of receiver function arrivals indicate a sharp discontinuity involving a decrease in both P and S velocities with depth demarking the lithosphere – asthenosphere boundary (LAB). While partial melting has often been viewed as the cause of the lowered velocity, the traditional mixing model of a solid and liquid indicates that the effect on velocity may be too small considering the small amount of liquid that can remain trapped in a partially molten zone (<2%). The magnitude of the effect is controlled by the volume fraction of melt, F. The expected gradual change in melt volume with depth precludes a seismic discontinuity such as required for the lithosphere asthenosphere boundary (LAB).\n The inadequacy of these models to sufficiently lower the shear velocity and provide a seismic discontinuity with small amounts of melt challenges the association of low velocity zone and melting. We assert that the dynamic process of melting and solidifying in response to the varying stress field of the seismic wave will significantly lower both the P and the S wave velocities with only small amount of melt present. Seismic velocity depends on the ratio of stress to strain, but is insensitive to the origin of the strain. Melting involves a change in volume, which induces a strain, and is driven by the stress field. The melting process will affect the elastic moduli in proportion to the pressure derivative of the melt fraction (dF/dP). Thus, the velocities can change discontinuously at the depth of the solidus even though F changes continuously.\nThermodynamic models such as MELTS require significant softening of the elastic moduli in the achievement of equilibrium for small amounts of melt in a peridotite. The relevant issue becomes: how much softening will occur on the time scale of the seismic period? We report results of experiments using a high flux synchrotron x-ray source examining samples at pressure, temperature, chemical composition, and seismic frequency that are present in the Earth’s low velocity zone. We conclude that seismic softening will occur for small amounts of partial melt with the possibility of a LAB discontinuity associated with the in situ solidus.",

            "abstract": "The state of Mato Grosso is the largest producer of soybean in Brazil with production continuously increasing since 2000 through a near tripling of cropland area under soybean cultivation. This increase in production has occurred by land cover transformation (extensification into natural ecosystems, e.g. forest to crop) and land use intensification (increase in area by conversion of already cleared land, e.g. pasture to crop), largely to satisfy international demand. In this study, we assess cradle-to-farm gate impacts of soybean production in Mato Grosso using life cycle impact assessment applied to data collected from 110 farms. We combine 21 impact indicators of land transformation and occupation (i.e. land use and land cover change) to show impacts of life cycle stages of production to land, air, water, resource use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. The greatest damage to human health and ecosystem quality came from land transformation which primarily takes place in the tropical forest (Amazon) and savanna (Cerrado/Cerradão) biomes. Soybean production in tropical forest landscapes has greater impacts on climate regulation, biotic production and groundwater recharge compared to production in native savanna areas, while impacts on biodiversity, erosion and soil water purification are roughly equivalent for tropical forest vs. savanna transformation and occupation. Soybean production practices showed hot spots of damage to environmental quality and resources from phosphorous fertilizer application and diesel consumption in machinery through impact pathways such as terrestrial and aquatic acidification and the use of non-renewable energy. Life cycle impact assessment modeling can provide further information into the production process to enlighten decision making with respect to impacts occurring along the soybean product supply chain.",

Water vapor plays a key role in humid atmospheric processes and precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a widely employed quantity to study these processes and compute water budgets. PWV can be retrieved with an accuracy of about 1-2 kg.m-2from the zenithal wet delays (ZWD) estimated during GPS data processing. In that perspective, six permanent GPS stations were deployed in West Africa within the framework of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project.\nThe current quality level of PWV could be reached thanks to successive improvements of the mapping functions used (NMF → GMF → VMF1) and of the a priori ZHD retrieved from meteorological models. However, standard GPS data processing does still not optimally take into account the climatic variability across stations and time: the stochastic constraints used for ZWD estimation are generally the same regardless of the station and of its local weather. This non-optimal modelling of GPS data affects the accuracy of GPS-derived PWV and is therefore one limiting factor for weather and climate studies. The purpose of this study is to quantify the influence of the stochastic constraints in the tropospheric model on ZWD and PWV estimates for tropical GPS stations. Possible improvements are suggested.",

            "abstract": "The timing of phenological events exerts a strong control over ecosystem function and leads to multiple feedbacks to the climate system. Phenology is inherently sensitive to temperature and recent warming is reported to have led to earlier spring, later autumn and increased vegetation activity. Such greening could be expected to enhance ecosystem carbon uptake, although reports also suggest decreased uptake for boreal forests. Here we assess changes in phenology of temperate forests over the eastern US during the past two decades, and quantify the resulting changes in forest carbon storage. We combine long-term ground observations of phenology, satellite indices, and ecosystem-scale carbon dioxide flux measurements, along with 18 terrestrial biosphere models. We observe a strong trend of earlier spring and later autumn. In contrast to previous suggestions we show that carbon uptake through photosynthesis increased considerably more than carbon release through respiration for both an earlier spring and later autumn. The terrestrial biosphere models tested misrepresent the temperature sensitivity of phenology, and thus the effect on carbon uptake. Our analysis of the temperature–phenology–carbon coupling suggests a current and possible future enhancement of forest carbon uptake due to changes in phenology. This constitutes a negative feedback to climate change, and is serving to slow the rate of warming. ",

            "abstract": "The origin of the terrestrial oceans and atmosphere is still a matter of intensive debate. For a while high D/H ratios in comets compared to both meteorites and Earth’s oceans (which share approximately the same range of values) has been taken as evidence for an asteroidal origin of the oceans. This possibility is in line with the N isotope composition of meteorites encompassing the terrestrial atmosphere value. Recently, Earth-like D/H ratios have been reported for two comets, thus re-vitalizing the possibility of cometary contribution to terrestrial volatiles. Nitrogen in cometary CN, HCN, and NH2 (the N-bearing molecules that can be analyzed remotely) is enriched by a factor of approx. 80% in 15N compared to terrestrial N. The question is whether or not these N-bearing molecules are representative of bulk N in comets. If nitrogen is trapped as N2 in cometary ices, its isotope composition could reflect that of the protosolar nebula, which was depleted by 40% relative to Earth. A cometary cocktail consisting of 1/3 reduced, 15N-rich N and 2/3 of nebula-like N2 would make the terrestrial N isotope composition. Another strong constraint will arise from the analysis of cometary noble gases which, if trapped at sufficiently low temperature in ice, could account for the elevated noble gas/H,C ratio of the terrestrial surface reservoirs. Hopefully, the ROSINA instrument on board of the Rosetta spacecraft which will analyze volatile elements degassed by comet 67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which should permit to shed light on this fundamental issue.",

Using extreme event metrics with a newly developed high resolution and long time series of crop statistics database we identify the frequency and type of extreme event driven crop production losses globally at high resolutions. In this presentation we will present our results as global maps identifying the frequency and type of extreme weather events that resulted in extreme crop production losses and quantify the losses. Understanding how extreme events affects crop production is critical for managing risk in the global food system",

            "abstract": "Threshold concepts in any discipline are the core concepts an individual must understand in order to master a discipline. By their very nature, these concepts are troublesome, irreversible, integrative, bounded, discursive, and reconstitutive. Although grasping threshold concepts can be extremely challenging for each learner as s/he moves through stages of cognitive development relative to a given discipline, the learner’s grasp of these concepts determines the extent to which s/he is prepared to work competently and creatively within the field itself. The movement of individuals from a state of ignorance of these core concepts to one of mastery occurs not along a linear path but in iterative cycles of knowledge creation and adjustment in liminal spaces – conceptual spaces through which learners move from the vaguest awareness of concepts to mastery, accompanied by understanding of their relevance, connectivity, and usefulness relative to questions and constructs in a given discipline. With the explosive growth of data available in atmospheric science, driven largely by satellite Earth observations and high-resolution numerical simulations, paradigms such as that of data-intensive science have emerged. These paradigm shifts are based on the growing realization that current infrastructure, tools and processes will not allow us to analyze and fully utilize the complex and voluminous data that is being gathered. In this emerging paradigm, the scientific discovery process is driven by knowledge extracted from large volumes of data. In this presentation, we contend that this paradigm naturally lends to inquiry-driven pedagogy where knowledge is discovered through inductive engagement with large volumes of data rather than reached through traditional, deductive, hypothesis-driven analyses. In particular, data-intensive techniques married with an inductive methodology allow for exploration on a scale that is not possible in the traditional classroom with its typical problem sets and static, limited data samples. In addition, we identify existing gaps and possible solutions for addressing the infrastructure and tools as well as a pedagogical framework through which to implement this inductive approach.",

            "abstract": "Renalysis data suggests that nearly 20% of the atmospheric moisture over the La Plata basin comes from Amazonian Evapotranspiration (ET). However, these estimates of ET are model dependent. Simulations using land-surface models (LSMs) in off-line mode (i.e. with prescribed atmospheric forcing) have shown that Amazonian ET depends on the groundwater dynamics. In this study we use the NoahMP LSM in off-line mode and the coupled system WRF-NoahMP to assess the role of groundwater on South American ET. In particular, we study the role of the groundwater in sustaining ET during the dry season in the southern Amazon and the La Plata basin. We compare simulations that do not account for the groundwater reservoir (free drainage approach) with simulations that include the Miguez-Macho and Fan parameterization to represent the groundwater storage, its lateral flow, and its interaction with the unsaturated zone. The off-line simulations show the effects associated solely with groundwater dynamics (as opposed to coupled land-atmosphere processes), while the coupled simulations provide information about the regulation and/or response from the atmosphere. Preliminary results from the coupled system suggest that the largest effects of the groundwater on ET are observed during the austral dry season. ET is larger over regions of Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina when groundwater is included, due to the existence of a relatively shallow water table over these regions, which via upward capillary fluxes reduces drainage during the rainy season and increases soil moisture availability in the dry season. These differences in the simulated ET could have an impact on the estimates of the transport of atmospheric moisture to La Plata basin.",

            "abstract": "Over the last few years there has been substantial progress to incorporate wave-particle interactions into global simulation models of the radiation belts. Models of plasmaspheric hiss and whistler mode chorus make a huge impact on the variability of the relativistic electron flux. Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves also cause electron loss from the radiation belts but their effectiveness has not been fully quantified. Here we present the results of simulations using a new chorus diffusion matrix and demonstrate that in principle the outer electron radiation belt can be formed by wave acceleration from a soft electron spectrum. We also describe a new model for EMIC waves. Wave data derived from the fluxgate magnetometer on CRRES was used to define the power spectrum as a function of geomagnetic activity, L* and magnetic local time for Hydrogen and Helium band waves. We show that wave power depends on activity as measured by AE and Kp. Using an assumed ion composition, and previously defined plasma density models the PADIE code was used to calculate bounce and drift averaged diffusion rates for EMIC waves and incorporated into the BAS Radiation Belt Model together with whistler mode chorus, plasmaspheric hiss and radial diffusion. Thus the model can be driven by a time sequence of Kp with appropriate boundary conditions. By simulating a 100 day period in 1990 we show that the model can produce electron flux up to energies of several MeV. When EMIC waves are included they cause a significant reduction in the electron flux for energies greater than 2 MeV but only for pitch angles lower than about 60 degrees. The simulations show that the distribution of electrons left behind in space looks like a pancake distribution at MeV energies. We show that EMIC waves cannot remove electrons at all pitch angles even at 30 MeV and are therefore unlikely to set an upper energy limit to the outer radiation belt.",

            "abstract": "The Coupling of three model components, WRF/PCE (polar climate extension version of weather research and forecasting model (WRF)), ROMS (regional ocean modeling system), and CICE (community ice code), has been implemented, and the regional atmosphere-ocean-sea ice coupled model named WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE has been validated against ERA-interim reanalysis data sets for 1989. To better understand the reasons that generate model biases, the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE results were compared with those of its components, the WRF/PCE and the ROMS-CICE. There are cold biases in surface air temperature (SAT) over the Arctic Ocean, which contribute to the sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) biases in the results of the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE. The cold SAT biases also appear in results of the atmospheric component with a mild temperature in winter and similar temperature in summer. Compared to results from the WRF/PCE, due to influences of different distributions of the SIC and the SST and inclusion of interactions of air-sea-sea ice in the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE, the simulated SAT has new features. These influences also lead to apparent differences at higher levels of the atmosphere, which can be thought as responses to biases in the SST and sea ice extent. There are similar atmospheric responses to sea ice biases at 700 and 500 hPa, and the strength of response weakens, with a height in January. The atmospheric responses in July reach up to 200 hPa. There are surplus sea ice extents in the Greenland Sea, the Barents Sea, the Davis Strait and the Chukchi Sea, resulting from the ROMS-CICE in winter and in the Beaufort Sea, the Chukchi Sea, the East Siberian Sea and the Laptev Sea in summer. These differences in the SIC distribution can all be explained by those in the SST distributions. These features in the simulated SST and SIC from ROMS-CICE also appear in the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE. It is shown that the performance of the WRF/PCE-ROMS-CICE is determined to a large extent by its components, the WRF/PCE and the ROMS-CICE.",

            "abstract": "In 2011 we acquired a large 3D seismic reflection data volume with the R/V Langseth to examine the structure of the Costa Rica margin, NW of the Osa Peninsula. Multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data also acquired during the cruise reveal mud mounds, pockmarks, and gas plumes that indicate numerous, previously unknown, seafloor vent-related features that extend from the lower slope to the outer shelf region (Kluesner et al., 2013). These features imply active or recently active seafloor vents; however, the processes of fluid focusing into vents are not apparent from the seafloor data alone. The 3D seismic reflection data reveal indirect indicators of fluids below the seafloor. In the slope cover sediment, within the uppermost 1000 m of the seafloor, we calculated the RMS amplitude of the seismic reflections to identify vent systems from anomalously high seismic reflection amplitudes. We attribute anomalously high-amplitude zones to fluid-filled fractures and concentrated free gas directly associated with vents. Along the lower slope where a BSR is present, vents inferred from amplitude anomalies are also coincident with local shallow BSR depth anomalies. Fluids feeding these shallow vent systems appear to originate from the underlying fault-cored fold and thrust systems of the margin wedge. High amplitude anomalies within the slope cover lie directly over margin wedge thrust anticlines that develop within the 2-to-8 km thick margin wedge sequence. These anticlines are typically cored by thrusts, many of which themselves have high amplitude, reversed polarity seismic reflections that we interpret as fault zone dilation and active fluid migration. Fluids originating from the plate interface appear to be migrating up toward the seafloor along these thrust faults, as well as along the imbricately stacked stratigraphic horizons within the margin wedge. Fluids become focused into the crest of fold anticlines and directed to the seafloor vent-related features. This crustal scale fluid migration system extends from the lower slope and across much of the shelf implying broad, active dewatering of the seaward most 50 km of the overriding plate. We interpret this large scale fluid migration system as an actively dewatering fold and thrust sequence driven by recent thickening of sediment sequences within the margin wedge.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion chronometry is an alternative method that can be used to assess timescales of magmatic events. It relies on the chemical relaxation of chemical zoning within magmatic crystals. By studying a range of elements within a single crystal we can probe a range of magmatic processes and interrogate timescales of processes from days to millennia. Diffusion modifies the elemental concentrations of adjacent crystal zones. The timescales that can be investigated are limited not only by the diffusivity of an element and the available diffusion coefficients but also the resolution of the measured chemical profile and hence the analytical technique used to acquire these profiles. To obtained reliable diffusion timescales the analytical length scale must be shorter than the characteristic diffusion length. In addition sufficient analytical points must be present on the profile to ensure that the profile is ‘real’ and not a convolution artefact. Thus in some cases, sub-micron spatial resolution is required. Two such possible techniques that can achieve nanoscale resolution are field emission gun electron probe micro analyser (FEG-EPMA) and NanoSIMS. Plagioclase and pyroxene crystals were analysed by FEG-EPMA and NanoSIMS to investigate the achievable spatial resolution that could be attained. For quantitative analyses, analytical protocols for FEG-EPMA for plagioclase and pyroxene have been developed that can achieve spot analyses of down to 300 nm diameters with 300 nm spacing for major and trace elements. NanoSIMS can achieve a 200 nm spot diameter, but currently the chemical profiles are only qualitative. This increase in spatial resolution of analytical techniques has demonstrated that compositional boundaries within zoned crystals are relatively sharp (< 2 microns). Thus assuming step-profiles as an initial condition in simple 1D diffusion models is appropriate in many cases.",

            "abstract": "The water level of the Dead Sea (Israel and Jordan) has been dropping at an increasing rate since the 1960s, exceeding a meter per year during the last decade. This water-level drop has triggered the formation of sinkholes and land subsidence along the Dead Sea shorelines, resulting in severe economic loss and infrastructural damage. We demonstrate the use of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements from COSMO-SkyMed images, combined with an airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Elevation Model to detect sinkhole-related subsidence. In several locations, precursory subsidence tens to more than a hundred meters wide, at rates between 0.5 and 2 mm/day started a few months to more than a year before an actual collapse of a sinkhole. The sinkholes, a few meters wide and up to 25 m deep, form generally at the perimeter of the subsiding areas. By means of a simplified model representing a distributed closure of a sill-like crack, we estimate the cavity volume occupied by the subsiding sedimentary overburden and explain the spatial relationships between the gradual surface subsidence and the sinkholes. The subsiding areas and successive sinkholes in a specific site migrate laterally, possibly due to progressive dissolution and widening of the underlying cavities. Combining InSAR measurements with sinkhole mapping and chemical and isotopic analyses of groundwater and surface water, we find a new mode of sinkhole formation. The sinkholes initiate by dissolution of a 10-20 m deep and 5-15 m thick halite layer by fresh groundwater. The process continues and accelerates as flash-floods are drained by existing or by newly formed sinkholes, the subsurface salt layer dissolves rapidly, the overlying ground subsides, and salt-saturated water seeps out downstream of the draining sinkholes. The number of sinkholes and the rates and dimensions of subsidence increase significantly during and immediately after the flood events, and decay exponentially thereafter.",

Mars rovers mostly have sampled old (Late Hesperian) sedimentary rocks, although Gusev rocks analyzed by Spirit constitute the best-characterized igneous province on Mars. Because we have only one sedimentary meteorite – NWA 7034, a regolith breccia composed of igneous clasts – we will focus on comparing igneous rocks.\nBasaltic rocks analyzed so far on the planet’s surface are more alkaline than the meteorites. Limited trace element ratios from rover APXS also indicate differences in composition from meteorites. Orbital geochemical and mineralogical data are generally consistent with a basaltic surface, showing localized exposures of sedimentary rocks. Compositional differences may arise from melting and fractionation at different depths, under different redox states, or with different water contents.\nThe various data sets do show some linkages, however. Major mineral compositions are similar (and different from Earth), and rocks tend to be oxidized. Although no hydrous igneous minerals occur (except apatite), many parent magmas contained water that was mostly lost on ascent. It is surprising, then, that calc-alkaline rocks have not been found.\nHighly fractionated rocks are uncommon, but tephrites and mugearites occur in Gusev, Gale, and NWA 7034. Feldspathic rocks discovered by remote sensing and encountered at Gale are not yet understood.\nThe geochemically distinct magmas represented by different classes of martian meteorites and surface rocks demonstrate that the mantle sources for magmas are heterogeneous. These differences are primary, likely inherited from a magma ocean, since there is no crustal recycling. With only one source of data (either meteoritic or spacecraft), we would have a greatly simplified and incorrect view of martian petrogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Andean ecosystems are major water sources for cities and communities located in the Tropical Andes; however, there is a considerable lack of knowledge about their hydrology. Two problems are especially important: (i) the lack of monitoring to assess the impacts of historical land-use and cover change and degradation (LUCCD) at catchment scale, and (ii) the high variability in climatic and hydrological conditions that complicate the evaluation of land management practices. This study analyses how a reliable LUCCD impacts assessment can be performed in an environment of high variability combined with data-scarcity and low-quality records. We use data from participatory hydrological monitoring activities in 20 catchments distributed along the tropical Andes. A set of 46 hydrological indices is calculated and regionalized by relating them to 42 physical catchment properties. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed to maximise available data while minimising redundancy in the sets of variables. Hydrological model parameters are constrained by estimated indices, and different behavioural predictions are assembled to provide a generalised response on which we assess LUCCD impacts. Results from this methodology show that the attributed effects of LUCCD in pair-wise catchment comparisons may be overstated or hidden by different sources of uncertainty, including measurement inaccuracies and model structural errors. We propose extrapolation and evaluation in ungauged catchments as a way to regionalize LUCCD predictions and to provide statistically significant conclusions in the Andean region. These estimations may deliver reliable knowledge to evaluate the hydrological impact of different watershed management practices.",

            "abstract": "The exposure of mantle peridotite to water at crustal levels leads to a cascade of interconnected dissolution-precipitation and reduction-oxidation reactions - a process referred to as serpentinization. These reactions have major implications for microbial life through the provision of hydrogen (H2). To simulate incipient serpentinization and the release of H2 under well-constrained conditions, we reacted uncrushed harzburgite with chemically modified seawater at 300°C and 35 MPa for ca. 1.5 years (13441 hours), monitored changes in fluid chemistry over time, and examined the secondary mineralogy at the termination of the experiment. Approximately 4 mol % of the protolith underwent alteration forming serpentine, accessory magnetite, chlorite, and traces of calcite and heazlewoodite. Alteration textures bear remarkable similarities to those found in partially serpentinized abyssal peridotites. Neither brucite nor talc precipitated during the experiment. Given that the starting material contained ~3.8 times more olivine than orthopyroxene on a molar basis, mass balance requires that dissolution of orthopyroxene was significantly faster than dissolution of olivine. However, the H2 release rate was not uniform, slowing from ~2 nmol H2(aq) gperidotite-1 s-1 at the beginning of the experiment to ~0.2 nmol H2(aq) gperidotite-1 s-1 at its termination. Serpentinization consumed water but did not release significant amounts of dissolved species (other than H2) suggesting that incipient hydration reactions involved a volume increase of ~40%. The reduced access of water to olivine surfaces due to filling of fractures and coating of primary minerals with alteration products led to decreased rates of serpentinization and H2 release. While this concept might seem at odds with completely serpentinized seafloor peridotites, reaction-driven fracturing offers an intriguing solution to the seemingly self-limiting nature of serpentinization. Indeed, the reacted sample revealed a number of textural features diagnostic of incipient reaction-driven fracturing. Reaction-driven and tectonic fracturing must have far reaching impacts on the release rate of H2 in peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems and therefore represent key mechanisms in regulating the supply of reduced gases to microbial ecosystems.",

The spatial property is important when discussing how the waves are excited and interact with particles. In this presentation, we describe Van Allen Probes observations of a long-lasting second harmonic poloidal standing Alfvén wave event (duration ~ 5 hours) that occurred on 2 March 2014 in the noon sector. The standing wave harmonic is inferred from the relationship between the oscillations in the electric field and magnetic field. During this event, the two spacecraft were very near the magnetic equator and stayed within the plasmasphere. Most importantly, the two spacecraft had a very small separation (less than 2000 km). From the phase delay of the wave signals detected when the spacecraft were on the same L shell but were separated by 300 km (0.6 degrees) in longitude, we estimate the azimuthal wave number to be greater than 100, corresponding to an azimuthal wavelength of less than 200 km. Modulation of the flux of ions was present with amplitude and phase that depend on energy and pitch angle. We use the observed frequency, the inferred standing wave mode structure, and the estimated azimuthal wave number to predict the energy and pitch angle dependence of drift-bounce resonance of ions and compare the prediction with the observed ion flux oscillations.",

Some of these parameters, such as Zenithal Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) are available on co-location sites, where more than one technique is present. Local ties (LT) are provided for these sites, and act as intra-technique links and allow resulting terrestrial reference frames (TRF) to be homogeneous, but their use can be problematic.\nSimilar co-locations can be found on multi-technique satellites, where more than one technique receiver is featured, but the challenge of using these space ties (ST) relies in the accurate knowledge or estimation of their values. In this study, results from a multi-technique combination including the Jason-2 satellite and its effect on the GNSS oribit determination are presented, as well as results on stations' positions determination. Comparing resulting orbits with official solutions provides an assessment of the effect on the orbit calculation by introducing orbiting stations' observations.\nMoreover, simulated solutions will be presented, showing the effect of adding multi-technique observations on the estimation of STs parameters errors.",

            "abstract": "Only recently has it become clear that the solar corona viewed in the EUV is detected out to far greater distances above the limb than had been expected (Seaton etal 2013). The reasons for the visibility of streamers out to >2 R_sol are unclear (Goaryaev etal 2014), but the fact that such structures can be seen is indisputable (Masson etal 2014). The EUV imaging instruments that have been used for these observations, such as TRACE, SWAP, STEREO and AIA, were not specifically designed to detect the extended corona, and such detection typically requires multiple exposures and mosaics. An instrument designed to obtain views of the extended EUV corona out to the nominal source surface with high efficiency is straightforward to build, and would provide 100X to 1000X higher sensitivity than current instruments. The main advantages of such EUV observations are: 1. the coronal dynamics and eruptions (such as CMEs) and the locations and effects of nearby streamers are visible from the start of the event on-disk; 2. the initial conditions of an event, including initial acceleration, changes of path due to interaction with nearby coronal structures, and propagation of coronal waves from the eruption site, are all directly seen; 3. the evolution of the eruption from the solar surface out to the inner edge of a white-light coronagraph can be seen, thus filling the gap in such WL images (Byrne etal 2014).\nWe will present a class of simple EUV wide-field imager designs for implementation on a low-cost platform. Operation in the EUV implies that Sun-centered pointing tolerances can be relaxed, dust and scattering are negligible issues, and simple optics will fulfill all requirements. Implementation on a Sun-pointed spinning spacecraft is possible without great difficulty.",

            "abstract": "Accelerated retreat of Andean glaciers in recent decades due to a warming climate has caused the emergence and growth of glacial lakes. As these lakes continue to grow, they pose an increasing risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). GLOFs can be triggered by moraine failures or by avalanches, rockslides, or ice calving into glacial lakes. For many decades Lake Palcacocha in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru has threatened citizens living in the city of Huaraz which was devastated by a GLOF in 1941. A safety system for Lake Palcacocha was put in place in the 1970’s to control the lake level, but the lake has since grown to the point where it is once again dangerous. Overhanging ice from the glaciers above and a relatively low freeboard make the lake vulnerable to avalanches and landslides.\nLake Palcacocha is used as a case study to investigate the impact of an avalanche event on the lake dynamics. Three-dimensional lake modeling in the context of glacial hazards is not common, but 3D simulations can enhance our understanding of avalanche-generated impulse waves and their downstream impacts. In this work, a 3D hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the generation of an impulse wave from an avalanche falling into the lake, wave propagation, and overtopping of the terminal moraine. These results are used as inputs to a downstream model to predict the impact from a GLOF. As lowering the level of the lake is the most likely mitigation alternative, several scenarios are considered to evaluate the impact from avalanche events with a reduction in the lake level.\nThe results of this work can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the current lake management system and potential lake-lowering alternatives. Use of a robust 3D lake model enables more accurate predictions of peak flows during GLOF events and the time scales of these events so that mitigation strategies can be developed that reduce the risk to communities living downstream of hazardous lakes.",

            "abstract": "A large, normal-faulting earthquake occurred on 3rd January 1739 on the eastern flank of the Helan Mountains. These mountains border the Yinchuan Graben, a major structural feature on the north-western side of the Ordos Plateau in northern China. Surface ruptures from this event extend discontinuously for a total of 88 kilometers with a maximum vertical component of slip of 4.4 meters. Greatest damage was sustained in the cities of Yinchuan and Pingluo and an estimated 50,000 people were killed.\nFault scarps have previously been identified in late Quaternary alluvial fans at Suyukou, Xiaoshigou, Jianquan and Hongguozigou, where it is believed that the Great Wall of China was offset. The Suyukou scarps are particularly impressive, preserving a free face along most of their length. Compound scarps and a series of terrace surfaces also document a history of at least three faulting events prior to 1739. These scarps provide a unique opportunity not only to characterise a large-magnitude (approximately Mw 7.5) continental normal-faulting earthquake, but also to determine a recurrence interval for this type of event.\nIn this study we combine remote sensing techniques, field observations and paleoseismological work in order to tackle these questions. We have produced a nominally 1 meter resolution digital elevation model of the entire length of the rupture using Pleiades stereo imagery. This detailed topography has allowed us to map the 1739 rupture, its associated fissures, and the footwall terrace surfaces along the Suyukou scarps in unprecedented detail. We have used a series of topographic profiles across the scarps to measure vertical offsets and the shape of the rupture front. This data is then used to reconstruct the slip variation along strike in the 1739 earthquake and compared with the offsets from older events. These offset measurements are supplemented by our field samples from the Suyukou scarps. Quaternary geochronology—including radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, and 10Be exposure dating—will be used, along with previous paleoseismological work, to constrain the timing of the recent earthquakes on the fault.",

Here we use a new forecast system to assess seasonal predictability of winter North Atlantic climate. We demonstrate that key aspects of European and North American winter climate and the surface North Atlantic Oscillation are highly predictable months ahead. We demonstrate high levels of prediction skill in retrospective forecasts of the surface North Atlantic Oscillation, winter storminess, near-surface temperature, and wind speed, all of which have high value for planning and adaptation to extreme winter conditions. Analysis of forecast ensembles suggests that while useful levels of seasonal forecast skill have now been achieved, key sources of predictability are still only partially represented and there is further untapped predictability.",

            "abstract": "In many ways, decompression melting and focused melt transport beneath oceanic spreading ridges is the best understood igneous process on Earth. However, there are remaining – increasing – uncertainties in interpreting residual mantle peridotites.\nIndicators of degree of melting in residual peridotite are questionable. Yb concentration and spinel Cr# are affected by (a) small scale variations in reactive melt transport, (b) variable extents of melt extraction, and (c) “impregnation”, i.e. partial crystallization of cooling melt in pore space. Roughly 75% of abyssal peridotites have undergone major element refertilization. Many may have undergone several melting events.\nThe following three statements are inconsistent: (1) Peridotite melt productivity beyond cpx exhaustion is > 0.1%/GPa. (2) Crustal thickness is independent of spreading rate at rates > 2 cm/yr full rate (excluding ultra-slow spreading ridges). (3) Thermal models predict, and observations confirm, thick thermal boundary layers beneath slow spreading ridges. If (a) melt productivity is << 0.1%/GPa beyond cpx-out, and (b) cpx-out occurs > 15 km below the seafloor beneath most ridges, then the independence of crustal thickness with spreading rate can be understood. Most sampled peridotites from ridges melted beyond cpx-out. Cpx in these rocks formed via impregnation and/or exsolution during cooling. Most peridotites beneath ridges may undergo cpx exhaustion during decompression melting. This would entail an upward modification of potential temperature estimates. Alternatively, perhaps oceanic crustal thickness does vary with spreading rate but this is masked by complicated tectonics and serpentinization at slow-spreading ridges.\nDissolution channels (dunites) are predicted to coalesce downstream, but numerical models of these have not shown why > 95% of oceanic crust forms in a zone < 5 km wide. There may be permeability barriers guiding deeper melt toward the ridge, but field studies have not identified them. Permeable “shear bands” may guide melt to the ridge, but their nature in open systems at natural grain size and strain rates is uncertain. 2D and 3D focused solid upwelling due to melt buoyancy deep in the melting region, where pyroxenes are abundant and permeability is low, may warrant renewed attention.",

            "abstract": "Flexible plants bend in response to fluid motion and this reconfiguration reduces drag forces, which protects against uprooting and breaking. The impact of reconfiguration can be described quantitatively by introducing a drag coefficient (CD) that decreases as a power-law function of velocity (U) with a negative exponent known as the Vogel number (B). That is, CD is proportional to UB. In this experimental study, we explored the link between reconfiguration and turbulence dynamics using a model seagrass meadow. As the flow rate in the channel increased, both the mean and unsteady reconfiguration increased. The unsteady reconfiguration, called monami, provides visual evidence that stronger turbulent events cause greater reconfiguration, and we hypothesize that the greater reconfiguration leads to proportionally lower drag, as reflected in a lower drag coefficient, such that stronger turbulent events preferentially penetrate deeper into the meadow. The preferential penetration of stronger events is reflected in the skewness of the streamwise velocity, which increases as the penetration of strong events gain greater preference. The measurements confirmed that a more negative Vogel number led to a higher skewness peak within the canopy. Previous studies were used to link the Vogel number and the Cauchy number. In the transition between the asymptotic regimes of negligible (B = 0) and strong (B = -2/3) reconfiguration, there is a regime of weak reconfiguration that extends over Ca = 10 to 100. The Vogel number achieved its peak negative value (B = -1.1) within the weak reconfiguration regime. The peak skewness also occurred within the regime of weak reconfiguration.",

            "abstract": "Erosion is intimately linked to chemical weathering, however we lack quantitative constraints on how erosion processes impact mineral weathering rates. Here we use the uranium-series isotope composition of river-borne material in small catchments of Puerto Rico and southeastern Australia to study the effect of contrasting erosion regimes on weathering.\nThe U-series isotope composition of stream sediments was modelled to infer a weathering age, i.e. the average time elapsed since the sediment’s minerals have started weathering. In southeastern Australia, the weathering age of stream sediments ranges between 346 ± 12 kyr and 1.78 ± 0.16 Myr, similar to values inferred from weathering profiles in the same catchment. Old weathering ages likely reflect the shallow origin of sediments mobilised via near-surface soil transport, the main mechanism of erosion in this catchment. Contrastingly, in Puerto Rico weathering ages are much younger, ranging from 5.1 ± 0.1 to 19.4 ± 0.4 kyr, reflecting that sediments are derived from less weathered, deeper saprolite, mobilised by landslides.\nWeathering ages of stream sediments are used to infer catchment-wide, mineral-specific weathering rates that are one to two orders of magnitude faster for Puerto Rico than for southeastern Australia. Thus, the type of erosion (near-surface soil transport vs. landslide) also affects the weathering rate of river sediments, because their weathering ages determine the potential for further weathering during sediment transport and storage in alluvial plains.",

Models predict earlier spring and later fall under future climate change, which would help slow the rate of warming by enabling increased carbon sequestration. That said, current models perform poorly, and there is little consensus as to what are the determining controls of spring and autumn phenology. Here, using global observations of deciduous forest phenology we determine the dominant biotic and abiotic controls, and develop a new suite of predictive models. We examine relationships between spatial and temporal variability, derive a coherent temperature sensitivity of spring phenology, and show that the timing of autumn senescence is dependent on the timing of spring budburst.",

            "abstract": "With the construction of the first midlatitude SuperDARN radar at NASA Wallops Flight Facility in 2005 it quickly became apparent that much activity can be observed in the midlatitude ionosphere even outside of large storm intervals. Over the last five years a chain of SuperDARN radars has been deployed at midlatitudes under the NSF Mid-Sized Infrastructure program that extends across the western hemisphere as far as east Asia. The new radars are providing unprecedented large-scale views of disturbance effects such as the storm-time expansion of auroral flows, subauroral polarization streams (SAPS), and travelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). When combined with large-scale mapping of GPS/TEC it is possible to observe directly the generation of plasma structures such as storm-enhanced density features (SEDs), tongues of ionization (TOIs), and polar cap patches, and to understand their dependence on the dynamic convection pattern reaching to the mid-latitude region. One unexpected result is the observation of backscatter from irregularities distributed throughout the quiet-time nightside subauroral ionosphere. This phenomenon gives us views of electric fields that are conjugate to the inner magnetosphere and also reveals the occurrence of large transients in the quiet-time subauroral electric fields. In this talk we summarize over the effects identified to date and discuss the insights gained in understanding the disturbed midlatitude ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Land surface models and large-scale hydrological models are often used to study climate change impacts on hydrology at regional to global scales. These impacts are then presented as maps of change in specific runoff metrics that are relevant to basin management and water resources planning. Knowing the limits of model performance for the respective metrics of interest at different spatial and temporal scales is thus important, but often performance is only known for annual or long-term means. This contribution summarizes and reflects on the challenge of continental hydrological model simulations from the WATCH multi-model ensemble with distributed streamflow observations from small basins of reference networks in Europe. Characteristics of hydrological dynamics that were compared include spatial and temporal runoff persistence, high and low flows, and long-term trends and variability. Whereas common annual statistics between models and observations correlate well even if the amounts disagree, larger differences were found for metrics that focus on the dynamics of streamflow response and persistence. For example, models appear to respond comparably fast to precipitation, and as a consequence underestimate the duration of streamflow drought events. Investigating the general streamflow persistence in time and space, however, also showed large differences among the different models. Long-term trends in annual flow and annual weekly peak flow in Europe agreed on the large-scale patterns, but particularly seasonal trends and trends in extremes in regions with mixed observed runoff trends or in complex terrain revealed discrepancies to the observations even regarding the sign of the trend. Before the display of changes in hydrological characteristics related to response and persistence of flow situations, models should therefore always be tested specifically for their limits to represent such metrics.",

            "abstract": "Forests influence the budgets of greenhouse gases, and understanding how they will respond to environmental change is critical to accurately predicting future GHG trends. The time scale for climate change is long and forest growth is slow, thus very long measurement periods are required to observe meaningful forest response. We established an eddy flux tower within a mixed forest stand dominated by red oak and red maple at the Harvard Forest LTER site in 1989 where CO2, H2O and energy fluxes together with meteorological observations have been measured continuously. An array of plots for biometric measurements was established in 1993. Flux measurement at an adjacent hemlock stand began in 2000. Records of land use and disturbance and vegetation plot data extend back to 1907. The combined suite of measurements merges observations of instantaneous ecosystem responses to environmental forcing with details of vegetation dynamics and forest growth that represent the emergent properties relevant to long-term ecosystem change. Both the deciduous stand and hemlock stand are accumulating biomass. Each has added over 20 Mg-C ha-1 as woody biomass in trees >10cm dbh since 1990, even though the hemlock stand is older. Net carbon exchange shows enhanced uptake in early spring and late fall months in response to warmer temperatures and likely an increase in evergreen foliage at the deciduous site. Net carbon uptake efficiency at the deciduous stand has increased over time as well as indicated by peak NEE under optimum light conditions. The trend is only partly explained by variation in mean leaf area index and cannot be directly attributed to climate response. The combination of longer growing season and increased uptake efficiency yields a general trend of increasing annual NEE (Fig. 1). However, significant excursions in the trend highlight the sensitivity of forest carbon stocks. The pulse of high annual carbon uptake (peak 6 Mg-C ha-1y-1 in 2008) from 2000-2008 is only partially matched by carbon stored in woody biomass, leaving a large fraction of carbon to have accumulated in litter and fine roots in the forest floor, which has as much carbon as the above-ground woody biomass, but shorter turnover time. Invasion by Hemlock wooly adelgid, an insect that kills hemlock trees portends a major shift in NEE for the hemlock stand in the next decade.",

            "abstract": "Irrigated agriculture is the human activity that has by far the largest impact on water, constituting 85% of global water consumption and 67% of global water withdrawals. Much of this water use occurs in places where water depletion, the ratio of water consumption to water availability, exceeds 75% for at least one month of the year. Although only 17% of global watershed area experiences depletion at this level or more, nearly 30% of total cropland and 60% of irrigated cropland are found in these depleted watersheds. Staple crops are particularly at risk, with 75% of global irrigated wheat production and 65% of irrigated maize production found in watersheds that are at least seasonally depleted. Of importance to textile production, 75% of cotton production occurs in the same watersheds. For crop production in depleted watersheds, we find that one half to two-thirds of production occurs in watersheds that have not just seasonal but annual water shortages, suggesting that re-distributing water supply over the course of the year cannot be an effective solution to shortage. We explore the degree to which irrigated production in depleted watersheds reflects limitations in supply, a byproduct of the need for irrigation in perennially or seasonally dry landscapes, and identify heavy irrigation consumption that leads to watershed depletion in more humid climates. For watersheds that are not depleted, we evaluate the potential impact of an increase in irrigated production. Finally, we evaluate the benefits of irrigated agriculture in depleted and non-depleted watersheds, quantifying the fraction of irrigated production going to food production, animal feed, and biofuels.",

            "abstract": "Explosive eruptions can drastically alter hydrogeomorphic regimes of drainage basins. The extent and degree of eruption-induced alteration scale with eruption magnitude, volcanic process, and basin proximity to a volcano. The most important effects of explosive eruptions on basin hydrology are ones that alter production and routing of runoff: (a) vegetation damage, which decreases (or eliminates) interception and evapotranspiration (ET); (b) reduction of surface infiltration owing to tephra deposition, which increases overland flow; (c) alteration of stream-channel hydraulics, which enables efficient transport of water and sediment; and (d) alterations to drainage networks, which accelerate or delay geomorphic response. In combination, these effects alter flood magnitude and frequency and rates of sediment transport. Vegetation loss allows more water to fall directly to the ground surface and reduces ET, which affects soil moisture, water storage and runoff pathways. Tephra fall, which typically paves the landscape with nearly impervious sediment, can reduce infiltration by as much as 2 orders of magnitude compared to pre-eruption rates and can increase direct runoff from near zero to as much as 90%. Even very thin layers (2–5 mm) of extremely fine tephra can increase runoff and decrease lag times between peak rainfall and peak runoff. Volcanic sedimentation in river valleys can increase channel gradient, reduce planform resistance, and smooth channel hydraulics, allowing for more efficient flow routing and producing larger, flashier flows. Hydrological effects of eruptive disturbance can linger for decades, but the most extreme effects typically last but a few years. However, lake formation through tributary blockage by thick deposits can delay response and extend the hydrologic legacy of eruptive disturbances. Failures of lake-impounding dams can produce large floods that renew downstream channel instability and rejuvenate headwater erosion.",

            "abstract": "Thermal infrared (TIR) spectroscopy offers a novel opportunity for measuring emissivity spectra of natural surfaces. Emissivity spectra are not directly measured, they first have to be retrieved from the raw measurements. Once retrieved, the spectra can be used, for example, to discriminate plant species or to detect plant stress.\nKnowledge of plant species distribution is essential for the sustainable management of ecosystems. Remote sensing of plant species has so far mostly been limited to data in the visible and near-infrared where, however, different species often reveal similar reflectance curves. Da Luz and Crowley showed in a recent paper that in the TIR plants indeed have distinct spectral features. Also with a certain species, subtle changes of emissivity in certain wavebands may occur, when biochemical compounds change due to osmotic adjustment induced by water stress.\nHere we show, that i) emissive imaging spectroscopy allows for reliable and accurate retrieval of plant emissivity spectra, ii) emissivity spectra are well suited to discriminate plant species, iii) a reduction in stomatal conductance (caused by stress) changes the thermal infrared signal.\nFor 13 plant species in the laboratory and for 8 plant species in a field setup emissivity spectra were retrieved. A comparison shows, that for most species the shapes of the emissivity curves agree quite well, but that clear offsets between the two types of spectra exist.\nDiscrimination analysis revealed that based on the lab spectra, 13 species could be distinguished with an average overall classification accuracy of 92% using the 6 best spectral bands. For the field spectra (8 species), a similar high OAA of 89% was achieved. Species discrimination is likely to be possible due to variations in the composition of the superficial epidermal layer of plant leaves and in internal chemical concentrations producing unique emissivity features. However, to date, which spectral feature is responsible for which chemical compound remains unclear.\nThis new technique of TIR spectroscopy bears great potential for floristic mapping and vegetation stress monitoring, besides other applications. Future airborne and spaceborne studies, however, will have to overcome a number of challenges, for instance the cavity effect, atmospheric influences, and signal-to-noise.",

            "abstract": "In recent decades, significant changes have been observed to the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) climate, changes which, amongst other factors, have been increasingly attributed to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) forcing. Using an AGCM, we further investigate this possibility by documenting contemporary spring-time relationships between SST trends and the SH extratropical atmospheric circulation. A suite of idealised simulations are analysed wherein the AGCM is forced by underlying SST conditions in which which trends over 1979-2009 are constrained to individual ocean basins (Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic), allowing the impact of each region to be assessed in isolation. When forced with global SST, the model broadly replicates the spatial pattern of geopotential height trends seen in reanalyses. Forcing the model by each ocean basin separately, however, reveals significant differences in the associated teleconnection patterns, with similar structures to reanalyses simulated only when Atlantic SST trends are included. It is revealed that such Atlantic teleconnections are associated with dynamical changes in the zonal Walker Circulation and a corresponding intensification of the local Hadley Cell, the impact of which results in the development of atmospheric Rossby waves. Thus, increased Rossby waves, forced by positive Atlantic SST trends, may have played a role in driving geopotential height trends in the SH extratropics. Consequently, changes to the regional atmospheric circulation promote warming throughout the Antarctic Peninsula/West Antarctica, with a pattern that closely matches observations. As such, Atlantic SST trends, via a teleconnection to the SH extratropics, may have contributed to springtime climatic change in Antarctica.",

There are deployments of GPS sites aimed at testing the stability of different types of monuments. One such experiment is being performed by UNAVCO as part of the Plate Boundary Observatory and seeks to compare drilled braced monuments will pillar type monuments. Other locations have had multiple monuments installed as part of the geodetic network around a collocation site. Tests have also been carried out with radomes being removed and replace specifically at sites where the radome can not be easily calibrated due to their geometry (i.e., the radome is attached to the top of a pillar or to the ground.) In this presentation we examine these data and assess the magnitudes of the variations seen in the position estimates and thus provide a lower bound on the stability of monuments and the effects of some radomes. We will also apply different analysis methods to these data to assess the impacts of processing methods. For radomes, site multipath effects and antenna problems, comparing dual frequency analyses (the method always needed for site separations of more than 1 km) with single frequency solutions can yield bounds on the frequency dependent errors that can arise from multipath and possibly radomes. In some cases, there can be up to 3 mm position differences between single and dual frequency results. The best of the short baseline results have root-mean-square (RMS) scatters of 100 microns horizontally and 200 microns vertically over a 12-month period but even with this precision annual signals with amplitudes of order 200 microns vertically and 70 microns horizontally can be seen. Some monument types show much greater variations. Radome effects can be several millimeters and in some cases the largest effect of removing radomes can be in the horizontal coordinates.",

They define the state of a hydrological system, which is critical for budget and process studies, like for instance threshold-governed subsurface redistribution, or water availability for evapotranspiration. Ground-based gravity measurements provide integrated (on a few tens of meters radius, the ‘plot’ scale) response to water storage changes (WSC) signal, which depends on mass and location changes of underground water. This information may be used for instance for process identification, for budget estimates, for specific yield retrieval, or for hypothesis testing through hydrological modeling. We try to address some of these issues based on our experience of a small catchment in the hard-rock Sudanian area of West-Africa (Djougou, northern Benin), where three state-of-art gravimeters have been deployed: a GWR superconducting gravimeter (SG), a Micro-g FG5 absolute gravimeter and a Scintrex CG5 microgravimeter. Spatial (i.e. at the catchment scale) distribution of WSC may be obtained using a hybrid gravimetry (CG5 + SG) approach. Significant hydrological information may be gained from gravity measurements, as long as these are analyzed in a joint approach, together with near-surface geophysics and hydrological monitoring for instance.",

This vision, supported in no small measure by a dedicated community of researchers who submitted their best research to WRR, have helped the journal maintain its international leadership in this field. As we enter the second 50 years of WRR, new trends in scientific publishing, open access publication and web-based discussion forums, pose challenges (and opportunities) for sustaining WRR's leadership role. In this presentation, we will present the vision of the present editorial board for the future of WRR, and discuss several steps we are undertaking to adapt the journal to modern trends in communicating scientific research. This includes the introduction of new article types, such as the forthcoming \"Debates on Water Resources\", targeted special sections, and efforts to improve the timeliness of the review process. We humbly stand on the shoulders of the thirty-four dedicated previous editors of WRR, and remain open to receiving suggestions from the AGU hydrologic community.",

            "abstract": "Arctic lakes and ponds can represent up to one quarter of the land surface in permafrost landscapes, particularly in lowland tundra landscapes characterized by ice wedge organic polygons. Thaw ponds can be defined as the aquatic ecosystems associated to thawing of organic soils, either resulting from active layer processes and located above low-center peat polygons (hereafter low-center polygonal or LCP ponds), or resulting from thermokarst slumping above melting ice wedges linked to the accelerated degradation of permafrost (hereafter ice-wedge trough or IWT ponds). These ponds can merge together forming larger water bodies, but with relatively stable shores (hereafter merged polygonal or MPG ponds), and with limnological characteristics similar to LCP ponds. These aquatic systems are very small and shallow, and present a different physical structure than the larger thermokarst lakes, generated after years of development and land subsidence. In a glacier valley on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, thermokarst and kettle lakes together represent 29% of the aquatic area, with a thermal profile resembling those of more standard arctic lakes (mixed epilimnion). The IWT ponds (44% of the area) are stratified for a large fraction of the summer despite their shallowness, while LCP and MPG ponds (27% of the area) show a more homogeneous water column. This will affect gas exchange in these diverse aquatic systems, in addition to their unique microbiota and organic carbon lability that control the production and consumption rates of greenhouse gases. The stratification in IWT ponds generates hypoxic conditions at the bottom, and together with the larger availability of organic carbon, stimulates methanogenesis and limits the mitigating action of methanotrophs. Overall, thaw ponds are largely supersaturated in methane, with IWT ponds dominating the emissions in this landscape (92% of total aquatic emissions estimated for the same valley), and they present large variations in emission rates. Conventional wind-based models seem inappropriate to simulate GHG exchanges, as seen when comparing with floating chamber estimations. Surface renewal models that consider heat exchanges are used to estimate flux more accurately, and ebullition flux are measured with submerged funnels to compare with diffusive flux estimations.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic redistribution (HR) of soil water by plants occurs in seasonally dry ecosystems worldwide. During HR, soil water flows from wet soil into roots, through the root system, and out of roots into dry rhizosphere soil. Hydraulic redistribution affects plant physiology and landscape hydrology, and it has long been hypothesized that upward HR of deep water to dry, nutrient-rich surface soil may also stimulate soil nutrient cycling and thus enhance nutrient availability to plants in the field. We report results from a sagebrush-steppe field experiment in northern Utah, USA, showing that stimulation of sagebrush-mediated HL increased rates of nitrogen cycling in the surface soil layer around shrubs at summer’s end, and more than quadrupled uptake of nitrogen into developing sagebrush inflorescences.\nWe have built on these empirical data by folding Ryel et al.’s (2002) HR formulation into CLM4.5 and examining how well the combined model can simultaneously simulate measured evapotranspiration, the vertical profile of soil moisture, and the amplitude of HR-associated diel changes in water content, at multiple seasonally-dry Ameriflux sites: Wind River Crane (US-Wrc), Southern California Climate Gradient (US-SCs,g,f,w,d,&c), and Santa Rita Mesquite Savanna (US-SRM). The simulated hydraulic lift during the dry periods has an average value in the range from 0.09 (at US-SCc) to 0.64 (at US-SCf) mm H2O d-1. In many cases, the combined model reproduced seasonal and daily (diel) observations with reasonable accuracy. Among the many model parameters tested, the Clapp and Hornberger parameter “B” in CLM4.5 was critical for a realistic simulation of soil moisture. Modeled HR was also sensitive to the maximum radial soil-root conductance and the soil water potential where that conductance is reduced by 50%. Our next step is to explore how modeled carbon and nutrient cycling in soil layers are affected by redistributed water in the soil column caused by inclusion of HR in CLM4.5.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the energy dissipation during earthquakes by analysis of high-velocity shear experiments conducted on room-dry, solid samples of granite, tonalite, and dolomite sheared at slip-velocity of 0.0006-1m/s, and normal stress of 1-11.5MPa. The experimental fault were loaded in one of three modes: (1) Slip-pulse of abrupt, intense acceleration followed by moderate deceleration; (2) Impact by a spinning, heavy flywheel (225 kg); and (3) Constant velocity loading. We refer to energy dissipation in terms of power-density (PD=shear stress*slip-velocity; units of MW/m^2), and Coulomb-energy-density (CED= mechanical energy/normal stress; units of m).\nWe present two aspects: Relative energy dissipation of the above loading modes, and relative energy dissipation between impact experiments and moderate earthquakes. For the first aspect, we used: (i) the lowest friction coefficient of the dynamic weakening; (ii) the work dissipated before reaching the lowest friction; and (iii) the cumulative mechanical work during the complete run. The results show that the slip-pulse/impact modes are energy efficient relatively to the constant-velocity mode as manifested by faster, more intense weakening and 50-90% lower energy dissipation. Thus, for a finite amount of pre-seismic crustal energy, the efficiency of slip-pulse would amplify earthquake instability.\nFor the second aspect, we compare the experimental CED of the impact experiments to the reported breakdown energy (EG) of moderate earthquakes, Mw = 5.6 to 7.2 (Chang et al., 2012). In is commonly assumed that the seismic EG is a small fraction of the total earthquake energy, and as expected in 9 out of 11 examined earthquakes, EG was 0.005 to 0.07 of the experimental CED. We thus speculate that the experimental relation of Coulomb-energy-density to total slip distance, D, CED = 0.605 × D^0.933, is a reasonable estimate of total earthquake energy, a quantity that cannot be determined from seismic data.",

Near a coast the pulse limited footprint is contaminated by land within the much larger radar footprint, causing data quality to decay within 10 km from a coast. In the open ocean, the instrument noise limits the detection of dynamic ocean signals to wavelengths longer than 70 km. Using the technique of radar interferometry, the proposed Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission would reduce instrument noise to resolve ocean signals to 15 km in wavelength over most of the open ocean without land contamination in the coastal zone. Sea surface height would be measured in two dimensions over a swath 120 km wide across the satellite’s flight path. SWOT is under development as a joint mission of NASA and the French Space Agency, CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the UK Space Agency. The launch is baselined for 2020. An overview of the projected mission performance for oceanographic applications will be presented. SWOT would also measure the elevation of land surface water with hydrological applications.",

            "abstract": "Ocean circulation at scales down to 1 km is a complex system with rich structures as revealed by satellite images of sea surface temperature and color. Traditional nadir-looking satellite altimeter, measuring sea surface height (SSH) that is diagnostic of surface geostrophic currents, is limited in spatial resolution by instrument errors and sparse cross-track sampling. The popular gridded two-dimensional SSH products from AVISO data center have spatial resolution on the order of 150 km in wavelength. Even the original along-track data are limited to 50-70 km in resolution owing to instrument noise. Using the radar interferometry technique, the proposed SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) Mission currently in development promises to produce SSH observations over a swath of 120 km with resolution reaching 15 km in most part of the global oceans. To ensure the coverage of the entire earth between the 78-degree latitudes dictated by the mission’s non-sun-synchronous orbit, the orbit repeat period is 21 days. The number of observations in a repeat cycle ranges from 2 near the equator to more than 10 at the highest latitudes. To reconstruct SSH from the irregularly sampled observations with complex error characteristics will pose a significant challenge for advancing the study of ocean circulation from this new type of observation. We offer a simple tool for simulating SWOT observations that can be applied to an ocean general circulation model, allowing the exploration of ideas and methods to optimize information retrieval from the SWOT Mission in the future.",

            "abstract": "In partially molten regions of the mantle, deviatoric stresses cause large-scale deformation and mantle flow. The same stresses also lead to preferential wetting of coherently oriented grain boundaries [DK97, T10]. This alignment is called melt-preferred orientation (MPO). Because of the contrast between the physical properties of melt and solid grains, MPO has the potential to introduce anisotropy into the mechanical and transport properties of the liquid/solid aggregate. Here we consider the possible consequences for (and of) anisotropic viscosity and permeability of the partially molten aggregate.\nThe consequences are evaluated in the context of laboratory experiments on partially molten rocks. The controlled experiments involve deformation of an initially uniform mixture of solid olivine and liquid basalt [KZK10]. The resultant patterns of melt segregation include two robust features: (i) melt segregation into bands with high melt fraction oriented at a low angle to the shear plane; and (ii) melt segregation associated with an imposed gradient in shear stress, in experiments where this is present. Although there are other reproducible features of experiments, these are the most robust and provide a challenge to models.\nA theoretical model for the effect of MPO on mantle viscosity under diffusion creep is available [TH09] and makes predictions that are consistent with laboratory experiments [TK13,KT13,QKKT14,AK14]. We review the mechanics of this model and the predictions for flow in torsional and pipe Poiseuille flow, showing a quantitative comparison with experimental results. Furthermore, it is logical to expect MPO to lead to anisotropy of permeability, and we present a general model of tensorial permeability. We demonstrate the consequences of this anisotropy for simple shear deformation of a partially molten rock.\nREFERENCES: \nDK97 = Daines & Kohlstedt (1997), JGR, 10.1029/97JB00393.

In this study, we present results from assimilating satellite SSS fields from NASA’s Aquarius mission into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) operational Modular Ocean Model version 4 (MOM4), the oceanic component of NOAA’s operational seasonal-interannual Climate Forecast System (CFS). Experiments on the sensitivity of the ocean’s overall state to different relaxation time periods were run to evaluate the importance of assimilating high-frequency (daily to mesoscale) and low-frequency (seasonal) SSS variability. Aquarius SSS data (Aquarius Data Processing System (ADPS) version 3.0), mapped daily fields at 1-degree spatial resolution, were used. Four model simulations were started from the same initial ocean condition and forced with NOAA’s daily Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) fluxes, using a relaxation technique to assimilate daily satellite sea surface temperature (SST) fields and selected SSS fields, where, except as noted, a 30-day relaxation period is used. The simulations are: (1) WOAMC, the reference case and similar to the operational setup, assimilating monthly climatological SSS from the 2009 NOAA World Ocean Atlas; (2) AQ_D, assimilating daily Aquarius SSS; (3) AQ_M, assimilating monthly Aquarius SSS; and (4) AQ_D10, assimilating daily Aquarius SSS, but using a 10-day relaxation period. The analysis focuses on the tropical Pacific Ocean, where the salinity dynamics are intense and dominated by El Niño interannual variability in the cold tongue region and by high-frequency precipitation events in the western Pacific warm pool region. To assess the robustness of results and conclusions, we also examine the results for the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Preliminary validation studies are conducted using observations, such as satellite sea-surface height (SSH) fields and in situ Argo buoy vertical profiles of temperature and salinity, to demonstrate that SSS data assimilation improves ocean state representation of the following variables: ocean heat content (0-300m), dynamic height (0-1000m), mixed-layer depth, sea surface heigh, and surface buoyancy fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Dike intrusions both deform Earth's surface and induce propagating earthquake swarms. We develop methods to utilize both deformation and seismicity from brittle, volcano-tectonic earthquakes to image time-dependent dike propagation. Dieterich's [1994] seismicity rate theory is used to relate dike-induced stress changes to seismicity rate, and is combined with elastic Green's functions relating dike opening to deformation. Different space-time patterns of seismicity develop if earthquakes occur at the same depth as the dike, as opposed to above or below the dike. In the former, seismicity initiates near the dike's leading edges but shuts off as the dike tips pass and seismogenic volumes fall into stress shadows. In the latter, seismicity continues at a decaying rate after the dike tips pass. We focus on lateral propagation and develop a non-linear inversion method that solves for dike length and pressure as a function of time.\nThe method is applied to the 2007 Father's Day intrusion in Kilauea Volcano. Seismicity is concentrated at ~3 km depth, comparable to geodetic estimates of dike depth, and decays rapidly in time. With lateral propagation alone it is difficult to fit both GPS time series and the rapid down-rift jump in seismicity, suggesting significant vertical propagation. For the events to have occurred below the dike requires a very short aftershock decay time, hence unreasonably high background stressing-rate. The rapid decay is better explained if the dike extends somewhat below the seismicity. We suggest that joint inversion is useful for studying the diking process and may ultimately allow for improved short-term eruption forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Numerical modeling of paleoglaciers can yield information on the climatic conditions necessary to sustain those glaciers. In this study we apply a coupled 2-d mass/energy balance and flow model (Plummer and Phillips, 2003) to reconstruct local last glacial maximum (LLGM) glaciers and paleoclimate in ten study areas along the crest of the U.S. Rocky Mountains between 33°N and 49°N. In some of the areas, where timing of post-LLGM ice recession is constrained by surface exposure ages on either polished bedrock upvalley from the LLGM moraines or post-LLGM recessional moraines, we use the model to assess magnitudes and rates of climate change during deglaciation.\nThe modeling reveals a complex pattern of LLGM climate. The magnitude of LLGM-to-modern climate change (temperature and/or precipitation change) was greater in both the northern (Montana) Rocky Mountains and southern (New Mexico) Rocky Mountains than in the middle (Wyoming and Colorado) Rocky Mountains. We use temperature depression estimates from global and regional climate models to infer LLGM precipitation from our glacier model results. Our results suggest a reduction of precipitation coupled with strongly depressed temperatures in the north, contrasted with strongly enhanced precipitation and much more modest temperature depression in the south. The middle Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming appear to have experienced a reduction in precipitation at the LLGM without the strong temperature depression of the northern Rocky Mountains.\nPreliminary work on modeling of deglaciation in the Sangre de Cristo Range in southern Colorado suggests that approximately half of the LLGM-to-modern climate change took place during the initial ~2400 years of deglaciation. If increasing temperature and changing solar insolation were the sole drivers of this initial deglaciation, then temperature would need to have risen by slightly more than 1°C/ky through this interval to account for the observed rate of ice recession.",

There are now a few dozen of these events examined within these supplements, but these studies have all differed in their input data sources as well as their approaches to defining the events, analysing the events, and considering the role of anthropogenic emissions. Here we re-examine most of these events (limited by feasibility) using a single analytical approach and the same experiment data source.

            "abstract": "During geomagnetically active conditions, the Van Allen Probes observe magnetic dipolarizations associated with enhancements in > 1 keV electron energy flux and the presence of nonlinear electric field structures (e.g. double layers and phase space holes) in the inner magnetosphere (4-6 Re). These dipolarization events are observed most frequently between dusk and midnight, though some appear between midnight and dawn. In some cases, nonlinear electric field power shows abrupt onset that is nearly simultaneous with electron energy flux enhancements across a range of energies. By comparing magnetic field, electric field, and particle data from both spacecraft, recorded when the twin Van Allen Probes are in close proximity, it is found that some of these abrupt onset features can be identified as earthward-propagating fonts with speeds on the order of 30 km/s. The presence of coherent propagating dipolarization fronts well inside the nominal flow breaking region (9 - 12 Re) suggests that earthward plasma flows may influence the magnetospheric plasma environment at the radial distances associated with the ring current and radiation belts. Possible mechanisms for this influence include the localized injection of particles adiabatically energized by their earthward transport, and wave-particle interactions related to the high amplitude parallel electric fields associated with the nonlinear electric field structures observed near these propagating fronts.",

            "abstract": "Mangrove forests cover just 0.1% of the Earth’s terrestrial surface, yet they provide a disproportionate source (~10 % globally) of terrestrially derived, refractory dissolved organic carbon to the oceans. Mangrove forests are biogeochemical reactors that convert biomass into dissolved organic and inorganic carbon at unusually high rates, and many studies recognize the value of mangrove ecosystems for the substantial amounts of soil carbon storage they produce. However, questions remain as to how mangrove forest ecosystem services should be valuated and quantified. Therefore, this study addresses several objectives. First, we demonstrate that seasonal and annual net ecosystem carbon exchange in three selected mangrove forests, derived from long-term eddy covariance measurements, represent key quantities in defining the magnitude of biogeochemical cycling and together with other information on carbon cycle parameters serves as a proxy to estimate ecosystem services. Second, we model ecosystem productivity across the mangrove forests of Everglades National Park and southern China by relating net ecosystem exchange values to remote sensing data. Finally, we develop a carbon budget for the mangrove forests in the Everglades National Park for the purposes of demonstrating that these forests and adjacent estuaries are sites of intense biogeochemical cycling. One conclusion from this study is that much of the carbon entering from the atmosphere as net ecosystem exchange (~1000 g C m-2 yr-1) is not retained in the net ecosystem carbon balance. Instead, a substantial fraction of the carbon entering the system as net ecosystem exchange is ultimately exported to the oceans or outgassed as reaction products within the adjacent estuary.",

            "abstract": "Recent efforts have sought to compare and contrast the radiative forcings excited by forest disturbances due to both biogeochemical and biogeophysical mechanisms (Bonan et al., 2008) using either in situ measurements (e.g. Randerson et al., 2005; Randerson et al., 2006) or modeling (e.g. Brovkin et al., 2004). Study of boreal forest disturbances led to the important finding that the albedo increase from snow exposure after a canopy destroying fire offsets the warming from carbon emissions (Randerson et al. 2005). Similar study is lacking for temperate forests, leading to uncertainty about the net effect of albedo and carbon forcings following their disturbance. This work quantifies the gross and net radiative forcings from albedo and carbon mechanisms at two clear cut sites in Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, one a Norway spruce plantation clear cut in 2008 and the other a red pine plantation cleared in 1990. Carbon fluxes are estimated from detailed biomass inventories at both sites, as well as additional measurement with eddy covariance at the 2008 clearing. Associated radiative forcing is estimated with conventional methods estimating the perturbation to CO2 in the atmosphere and its lifetime considering ocean uptake (pulse response) and vegetation regrowth. Albedo change is assessed with Landsat derived albedo for both sites, as well as in situ measurements at the 2008 clearing. Associated radiative forcing is estimated with the model-derived radiative kernels provided by Shell et al (2008). From these extensive records we offer an in depth characterization of albedo and carbon forcings immediately following disturbance through to canopy closure and stem exclusion stages of forest growth in a mid-latitude temperate forest region.",

            "abstract": "Observations of isotopic ratios show that the seasonal cycle as well as interannual variations of atmospheric CO2 are caused primarily by the response of terrestrial ecosystems to short-term variations of climate. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the ongoing multi-decadal increase is 100% due to human activitites, and thus we are collectively responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect, accompanied by acidification of the oceans, that is expected to last hundreds, and likely thousands, of years. Potential carbon cycle climate feedbacks, such as emissions of CH4 and CO2 from Arctic permafrost warming, are still difficult to quantify, so that in the forseeable future the emissions from fossil fuel burning will continue to dominate. CO2 removal from the atmosphere, which is energetically expensive, will cause the rate of transfer into the oceans to slow, and eventually to reverse. Managed carbon storage in the terestrial biosphere has very limited potential compared to current fossil fuel emissions. The primary imperative of climate change mitigation is to remove reduced carbon entirely from our sources of primary energy at the greatest possible pace.",

            "abstract": "Over recent decades, the surface of the Southern Ocean has been cooling while the sea-ice cover around Antarctica has been modestly increasing. These changes are surprising given the rapid warming and sea-ice loss observed in the Arctic over the same period. We argue here that these Southern Ocean changes are best explained in terms of (i) a Southern Ocean ‘thermostat’ (driven by Ekman upwelling south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current) that has acted to substantially delay surface warming compared to the rest of the world oceans, and (ii) separate processes giving rise to surface cooling and sea-ice expansion. What are these cooling processes? Several compelling hypothesis have been proposed, such as cooling driven by ozone depletion (through surface wind trends changing ocean circulation) and cooling associated with upper ocean freshening (possibly from enhanced melt water from Antarctica). Here we investigate a competing hypothesis that natural variability has played a substantial role. Indeed, unforced model simulations show substantial multi-decadal variability in the Southern Ocean that are as large or larger than the observed trends. To test this hypothesis, we characterize the modes and patterns of Southern Ocean temperature and salinity variability as simulated by CMIP5 models and compare these to the patterns of observed trends. We also consider changes within idealized, ocean-only simulations with the MITgcm forced by a simplified representation of greenhouse gas forcing and hydrologic cycle changes.",

Using ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry data, the nitrogen-containing features of the dissolved organic matter in septic-impacted and non-impacted samples were compared. A larger abundance of nitrogen-containing formulas were present in the septic-impacted groundwater sample. Impacted samples have additional DON features in the regions ascribed as ‘protein-like’ and ‘lipid-like’ in van Krevelen space and have more intense nitrogen-containing features in a specific region of a carbon versus mass plot.

To test this hypothesis, we developed a numerical model that integrates the Dynamic Energy Budget concept for microbial physiology, microbial trait-based community structure and competition, process-specific thermodynamically ­­based temperature sensitivity, a non-linear mineral sorption isotherm, and enzyme dynamics. We show, because mineral surfaces interact with substrates, enzymes, and microbes, both temperature sensitivity and microbial carbon use efficiency are hysteretic and highly variable. Further, by mimicking the traditional approach to interpreting soil incubation observations, we demonstrate that the conventional labile and recalcitrant substrate characterization for temperature sensitivity is flawed.\nIn a 4 K temperature perturbation experiment, our fully dynamic model predicted more variable but weaker carbon-climate feedbacks than did the static temperature sensitivity and carbon use efficiency model when forced with yearly, daily, and hourly variable temperatures. These results imply that current earth system models likely over-estimate the response of soil carbon stocks to global warming.",

This has been done by creating and strengthening partnership and collaboration within scientific and educational communities around the country and the world.\nBecause CloudSat was formally recognized as a Earth System Science Pathfinder campaign with the GLOBE program, the CEN developed a set of field protocols for student observations that augmented the GLOBE atmosphere protocols when there was a satellite overpass.

In addition, the CEN has developed productive relationships with other NASA missions and EPO teams. Specifically, in collaboration with the NASA CERES mission projects S’Cool and MyNASAData, we have co-presented at NSTA conferences and with schools participating in a NASA EPOESS-funded formal education project.

In addition to the expected IMF BY-related asymmetries between the dusk and dawn convection cells, which tend to display the opposite sense in the two hemispheres, we find asymmetries related to magnetotail dynamics that exhibit a more complex behaviour. We attribute this to differences in the timescales required for the development of IMF-related asymmetries, and those associated with internal magnetospheric processes.

Asian Monsoons are also characterised by the aridification in Central Asia due to the foehn effect north of the Tibetan Plateau and the inherent perturbation of the atmospheric circulation generated by the monsoons. According to climate models, Asian Monsoons have been mainly governed by Tibetan plateau uplift, the retreat of a vast epicontinental sea (the Proto-Paratethys sea) and global climate changes. Evidence for monsoons a old as Eocene are starting to be established by proxy and model data. This corresponds to the timing of the Proto-Paratethys retreat, however, the role of this sea on climate and the monsoonal expression in that period remain to be established. Here we show, using infra-annual geochemical proxies from oyster shells of the Proto-Paratethys sea and climate simulations, that the Central Asian region was generally arid with high seasonality from hot and arid summers to wetter winters. This high seasonality in Central Asia therefore supports an intense monsoonal circulation was already established although the climate pattern was significantly different than today. During winter months, a strong influence of the Proto-Paratethys moisture is indicated by enhanced precipitations as well as modelled stable isotopic composition of precipitation significantly higher than today. This supports a strong influence on local climate of the Proto-Paratethys sea, which subsequently retreated and was replaced by the Pamir mountains. During Eocene summers, the local climate was more arid despite the presence of the Proto-Paratethys. This may be explained by a strong anticyclonic Hadley cell descending at these latitudes (25 to 45 N) over Central Asia during Eocene times. Furthermore, the Tibetan plateau emerging to the south may have generated a strong Foehn effect during summer months bringing warm and dry air in Central Asia.",

Given the infrequent nature of flooding events, a long time series of ARs, orographic precipitation processes, and flood occurrence is required to yield statistically robust results characterizing conditions necessary to lead to significant precipitation.\nThis project analyzes the mesoscale to synoptic processes relevant for controlling extreme precipitation from atmospheric rivers at the regional scale, crucial for decision making about disaster planning and water budgeting in a changing climate system. First, a 30-year catalog of atmospheric rivers is constructed with an objective identification tool applied to the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis. A complementary catalog of extreme precipitation events across California is then identified in gridded daily observation-based data. Synoptic characteristics of the subset of these atmospheric rivers that are extreme-precipitation-producing are compared against similar statistics for non-extreme-precipitation-producing atmospheric rivers. A subset of both extreme and non-extreme events are then investigated in high resolution regional climate model simulations generated with the Weather Research and Forecast model run at 6km horizontal grid spacing across California. These model simulations are compared to results from two other models of varying complexity, including a simple linear model of orographic precipitation and a simplified dynamical weather model. The high-resolution model simulations will help identify the mesoscale processes responsible for determining basin-scale response to the larger-scale water vapor fluxes associated with atmospheric rivers, as well as the model complexity necessary to properly represent these processes. The latter results will be used to inform a future experiment downscaling atmospheric rivers in global climate model output.",

            "abstract": "Although Curiosity landed in a sedimentary setting, geochemical compositions determined by Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and ChemCam suggest that major element concentrations of some rocks were little modified by chemical weathering, and in these cases, the bulk (>70%) of the crystalline components determined by ChemMin are igneous. Gale rocks can therefore largely preserve the composition of their igneous protoliths and provide insight into the crystalline basement exposed in the north crater rim. Four end-member compositions are recognized on the basis of APXS analyses. (1) The diverse, evolved Jake M class (n=12) of inferred igneous origin includes float blocks and cobbles. Jake M rocks are phonotephritic/mugearitic to trachyandesitic and characterized by low MgO contents (3.0-5.7 wt%) and high Al and alkalis, particularly Na2O (up to 7.35 wt%). (2) The Bathurst class of siltstones to coarse sandstones (n=13) occurs as dark-toned float and bedded outcrop and is basaltic to trachybasaltic, ranging to high K2O (up to 3.8 wt%). Alteration of the protolith(s) or during diagenesis may have affected this class. (3) The Darwin class of conglomerates to coarse sandstones (n=10) has high Na and Al, likely reflecting a sodic plagioclase-rich mineralogy, but with higher Fe than Jake M class (13.0-17.1 vs. 6.0-12.5 wt%). (4) The low alkali “normal” Mars basaltic composition is typified by the Portage soils (n=6) and the John Klein class (n=13; includes the Sheepbed mudstone). Some degree of mixing and/or contamination with this low alkali basaltic compositon has affected all APXS analyses. Overall, Gale rocks are strongly enriched in total alkalis (at the same MgO) relative to basaltic shergottites and many have higher K2O than igneous rocks analyzed by Spirit and Opportunity, suggesting that the mantle beneath Gale is alkali-rich (likely as a result of a metasomatic event) and that alkalis are heterogeneously distributed in the planet’s interior.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between fluviodeltaic channel dynamics and external forcings is fundamental to our interpretation of stratigraphic records. While there have been great advances in subjects such as the effects of tectonic steering and base-level variation through field campaigns and physical experiments, numerical modeling has been relatively under-developed. This is partly due to the lack of models that are able to produce emergent channel dynamics, respond physically to various boundary conditions, and run efficiently over geological timescales.\n\nIn this work we apply a reduced-complexity model which satisfies the above criteria, DeltaRCM, to study how channel dynamics in a depositional system are affected by two factors: differential subsidence and base-level variation. In particular we investigate: (1) the changes in channel mobility with base-level rise; (2) how the fluvial surface is reworked with a set of tectonic styles and base-level cycles; (3) the preservation potential of the surface channel network in the sedimentary record. We present comparisons between our model results and physical experiments, with a discussion on the applicability of our reduced-complexity approach. An application on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Jamuna Delta shows how the model can be used as a tool for hypothesis formulation.",

            "abstract": "Understanding physical parameters, such as frictional coefficients, velocity change, and dynamic history, is important issue for assessing and managing the risks posed by deep-seated catastrophic landslides. Previously, landslide motion has been inferred qualitatively from topographic changes caused by the event, and occasionally from eyewitness reports. However, these conventional approaches are unable to evaluate source processes and dynamic parameters.\nIn this study, we use broadband seismic recordings to trace the dynamic process of the deep-seated Akatani landslide that occurred on the Kii Peninsula, Japan, which is one of the best recorded large slope failures. Based on the previous results of waveform inversions and precise topographic surveys done before and after the event, we applied numerical simulations using the SHALTOP numerical model (Mangeney et al., 2007). This model describes homogeneous continuous granular flows on a 3D topography based on a depth averaged thin layer approximation. We assume a Coulomb's friction law with a constant friction coefficient, i. e. the friction is independent of the sliding velocity. We varied the friction coefficients in the simulation so that the resulting force acting on the surface agrees with the single force estimated from the seismic waveform inversion.\nFigure shows the force history of the east-west components after the band-pass filtering between 10-100 seconds. The force history of the simulation with frictional coefficient 0.27 (thin red line) the best agrees with the result of seismic waveform inversion (thick gray line). Although the amplitude is slightly different, phases are coherent for the main three pulses. This is an evidence that the point-source approximation works reasonably well for this particular event.\nThe friction coefficient during the sliding was estimated to be 0.38 based on the seismic waveform inversion performed by the previous study and on the sliding block model (Yamada et al., 2013), whereas the frictional coefficient estimated from the numerical simulation was about 0.27. This discrepancy may be due to the digital elevation model, to the other forces such as pressure gradients and centrifugal acceleration included in the model. However, quantitative interpretation of this difference requires further investigation.",

            "abstract": "Long-term ecosystem and carbon cycle responses to climate change are needed to inform mitigation policy, yet our understanding of how these responses may evolve after 2100 remains highly uncertain. Using the Community Earth System Model (version 1.0), we quantified climate-carbon feedbacks from 1850 to 2300 for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (and its extension). In three simulations, land and ocean biogeochemical models were exposed to the same trajectory of increasing atmospheric CO2. In one simulation, atmospheric CO2 and other forcing agents were radiatively active (fully coupled), modifying temperature and other aspects of climate. In another, CO2 was radiatively uncoupled, and in the third, both CO2 and other atmospheric forcing agents (including CH4, N2O, and aerosols) were radiatively uncoupled. In the fully coupled simulation, global mean air temperatures increased by 9.3°C from 1850 to 2300, with 4.4°C of this warming occurring after 2100. Without radiative forcing from CO2, cumulative warming was much lower at 2.4°C, but exceeding 2°C targets needed to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system. In response to climate change, ocean and land rates of carbon uptake were reduced, with the size of the impact increasing over time. In the oceans, reductions in cumulative carbon uptake from climate change increased from 3% during the 20th century to 40% during the 23rd century. By 2300, climate change had reduced cumulative ocean uptake by 330 Pg C, from 1410 Pg C to 1080 Pg C. Most of this reduction occurred after 2100 as a consequence of increases in surface stratification and decreases in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Land fluxes similarly diverged over time, with climate change inducing a cumulative loss of 230 Pg C by 2300. On land the intensification of the hydrological cycle globally increased terrestrial water storage, although asymmetric responses were observed across different continents in the tropics. Net loss of carbon from tropical forest ecosystems, in response to large temperature increases, were partly offset by increases in carbon uptake in temperate and high latitude ecosystems. We conclude by presenting an assessment of how climate variability over land and burned area change century by century.",

And how do we know that we are making a difference? With just over a dozen NASA Earth remote sensing missions flying, NASA is providing remote sensing data on a daily basis, where the data and information can contribute to the relevancy of science in our daily lives and bring perspective to common knowledge. To date, we are seeing a widening gap in the general awareness and understanding of the basic science and concepts among the formal and informal audiences. At a time when we are discovering and understanding more about our home planet, using cutting edge technologies that should inspire people, we have also discovered that we have estranged a generation of potentital users.\nThe reality is that NASA data is being used by a relatively small group of people and they are nearly all scientists. Even when we “collaborate” with other federal agencies or universities, the actual work and impact remains on a scale that is only statistically significant. This is a far cry from being socially significant. There are key factors that are essential for success in communicating and working with both the technical and less technical audiences; they are the foundation to bridging the audience gaps and ultimately, truly engaging them. We need to show that the content is important and meaningful in our everyday lives by appealing to the audiences' sensibilities, packaging the content in a format that will be used by the audience, and we need to encourage and support people to create and innovate with this data and information. When you come right down to it, NASA is still the only agency that is continually putting up the new technologies, enabling and maintaining that crucial data flow, and supporting the umbilical cord of global data sets to the science community world-wide. But times have changed. It is not sufficient to only reach out to the same scientific communities and say that we are increasing our data users, when we know that talent pool is dwindling and aging. We need to start expanding our user base and that should include support for content developement and alignment for K-12 students, pre-service teacher preparation, introduction to data use and analysis and citizen science projects.",

Mapping the 3D configuration of these fields remains a challenge, but as observational and modeling capabilities advance, we can expect to improve our knowledge of the field leaving the Sun. I will review the current status of our capabilities to model the 3D field above solar active regions, summarize our growing skills at using observations of solar surface and corona to drive these models, and discuss opportunities for the near future.",

            "abstract": "In the present study we numerically model the progradation and size stratification of a Gilbert type delta subject to base level fluctuations. A foreset-dominated Gilbert delta is a delta that is dominated by sediment avalanches over its front. It forms when a river flows into a basin or sea characterized by a flow depth that is much larger than the one in the fluvial reach and the sediment is relatively coarse. A Gilbert delta is typically described in terms of a low-slope topset, a steep-slope foreset, and a bottomset. Our model consists of three main submodels: a sediment mixture mass conservation model suitable for mixed sediment in the fluvial reach, a delta progradation model, and a lee face sorting model. In order to calibrate and validate the model under base level variation conditions, we reproduce three laboratory experiments in which the base level varied between the experiments: (I) constant base level, (II) a gradually rising base level, and (III) a slowly varying base level. The model is able to properly reproduce the main characteristics measured in the laboratory experiments. The active layer coarsens at the start of the runs similar to the mobile armor that formed in the laboratory experiments. Base level rise induces an M1 backwater curve over the fluvial reach. This results in an increasing flow depth in streamwise direction and so a streamwise decrease of the sediment transport capacity. This then induces aggradation over the fluvial reach and a slower delta progradation rate. The opposite happens when base level fall is imposed. The model captures the slightly coarser-than-fed grain size distribution of the topset deposit. The predicted size stratification in the foreset results to be weaker (i.e. less sorted) than measured.",

Furthermore, based on precipitation minus evapotranspiration anomalies, and a hydraulic analysis using Envisat altimetry data, the source of the Cuvette Centrale wetland’s water is likely to be local upland runoff rather than the fluvial process of river-floodplain exchange as in the Amazon.\nOn the other hand, if we consider the Cuvette Centrale as the lower middle reach of the Congo, little attention has been paid to the upper middle reach of the Congo River, from just downstream of Kisangani to the intersection where the mainstem and the Lulonga River meets. In this study, we will use PALSAR images and Envisat altimetry data to estimate surface water storage changes over the floodplains in the upper middle reaches to make comparison with the lower middle reach. We will also perform the hydraulic analysis using Envisat altimetry height profiles over the river and its adjacent floodplains to examine the source of its water. Finally, the total storage changes, estimated from GRACE regional solutions with higher temporal and spatial resolutions based on the energy conservation principle and the Hillslope River Routing (HRR) model will be investigated to highlight their differences between the upper and lower middle reaches.",

For example, over the past few decades Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased more rapidly than predicted by state-of-the-art climate model simulations. In addition, it is unclear whether extreme events, such as the record melt event over the Greenland Ice Sheet in July 2012, will occur more frequently as a response to an increase in greenhouse gases. In this study we investigate how advection of moisture from lower-latitudes impacts Arctic climate, focusing on cloud formation and the surface energy budget at Summit, Greenland. Sensitivity studies from regional climate model simulations will be presented and discussed that explore how moisture advection into the Arctic during extreme events such as the July 2012 record melt and the 2010 extended period of atmospheric blocking impact cloud formation and the surface energy budget at Summit. The impact on the cryospheric mass budget of the Greenland Ice Sheet via precipitation and modulation of the surface energy budget will be discussed. Diagnostic studies will be presented that identify how air masses advected to Summit are modified through turbulent mixing, surface fluxes, and cloud radiative cooling, as well as, how this modification of air masses impacts cloud formation at Summit.",

The short-term magnitude of these responses depend strongly on the meteorology in the year following disturbance. Intermediate and long-term impacts, however, depend on post-disturbance recovery rates and potential species change, that may reflect longer-term climate drivers. In mountain environments, underlying geology shape both of these responses, through topographic influences on climate and through geologic controls on water storage and lateral redistribution. We use RHESSys, a coupled eco-hydrologic model, to quantify potential across site variation in responses to disturbance for several transects along in California mountains. At within watershed scales, we also look at how hydrologic responses to vegetation loss are influenced by subsurface geologic controls and contrast estimated disturbance effects as a function of different assumption of subsurface storage capacity and connectivity. Results highlight the tight coupling between geology and climate that influence hydrologic responses to disturbance.",

We summarize recent literature on field-based examples of analyses which show both increases and decreases in streamflow following moderate thinning either through drought-related mortality or forest management. We use RHESSys, a coupled eco-hydrologic model, to disentangle the controls that may influence thinning responses. We examine both within watershed (topography, water holding capacity) and between watersheds differences in climate and their influence on thinning effects. We use the model to develop probability distributions of streamflow and productivity responses across inter-annual variation in meteorology forcing in the year following thinning. We also look at longer-term, multi-year response to examine potential impact of thinning on subsequent drought vulnerability and mortality risk. A somewhat surprising result from this analysis is that there are scenarios where thinning can actually increase subsequent vulnerability of water resources to drought stress.",

            "abstract": "Most volcanic eruptions deplete ozone ~6% for a few years, allowing more high-energy, ultraviolet-B radiation to warm earth. Record low levels of total column ozone followed the 1991 explosive eruption of Pinatubo. Yet 6% depletion also followed the smaller and more effusive eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull (2010) and Grímsvötn (2011) in Iceland. Explosive volcanoes also eject 10-20 megatons of sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere, forming sulfuric-acid aerosols that reflect and diffuse sunlight causing a net cooling of ~0.5°C for 3 years. High rates of explosive volcanos cool earth into ice ages while high rates of effusive basaltic volcanism in Iceland between 11,500 and 9,500 years ago clearly warmed Earth out of the last ice age depositing sulfate recorded in ice cores in Greenland. Basalts from these eruptions are observed as tuyas in Iceland dated during this period. The 25 Dansgaard-Oeschger abrupt warmings are contemporaneous with increased sulfate in Greenland and with the few older dates available for tuyas in Iceland. Extensive flood basalts were formed during the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum and during times of most major mass extinctions when global temperatures rose substantially, with fossil evidence for ozone depletion.\nGreenhouse-gas theory assumes electromagnetic radiation travels through space as waves and therefore thermal energy reaching earth is proportional to the square of wave amplitude. Thus the change in energy reaching Earth due to ozone depletion is considered small compared to infrared energy absorbed by greenhouse gases. But waves travel in matter and there is no matter in space. Electromagnetic energy is transmitted as frequency, as shown by radio signals, where energy equals frequency times the Planck constant. Thus thermal energy reaching earth when ozone is depleted is 50 times thermal energy involved in greenhouse gases. Global warming from 1970 to 1998 was caused primarily by 3% ozone depletion due to anthropogenic CFCs.",

            "abstract": "Climate and hydrology are strong drivers of ecosystem structure and function in arid landscapes. Arid regions are characterized by high interannual variation in precipitation, and these climate patterns drive the overall hydrologic disturbance regime (in terms of flooding and drying), which influences geomorphic structure, biotic distributions, and nutrient status of desert stream ecosystems. We analyzed the long-term pattern of discharge in a desert stream in Arizona to identify hydrologic regime shifts, i.e., abrupt transitions between sequences of floods and droughts at periods of months to decades. We used wavelet analysis to identify time intervals over a 50-year time series that were negatively correlated with one another, reflecting a shift from wet to dry phases. We also looked with finer resolution at the most recent 10-year period, when wetlands have come to dominate the ecosystem owing to a management change, and at individual flood and drought events within years.\nIn space, there is high site fidelity of wetland plant cover, corresponding to reliable water sources. Comparing five-year patterns of plant distribution and stream metabolism between wet and dry years suggested the primacy of geomorphic controls in drought periods. Nutrient limitation of algal production varied from moderate to very strong N limitation, with only one year when there was a (weak) suggestion of secondary P limitation. Over the longer period of record, we identified times characterized by hydrological regime shifts and asked whether ecosystem variables would have changed over that time period. We hypothesized, in particular, that the changes in nutrient status of the stream ecosystem would result from these regime shifts. We used our most complete long-term dataset on stream nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and N:P ratios as a proxy for nutrient limitation. However, N:P varied primarily at fine scales in response to individual flood events.",

Thus, it is important to understand the sources and presence of these compounds in the environment, especially because OH-BDEs are breakdown products of PBDEs and also naturally produced compounds. In this work, the levels of OH-BDEs were determined in lake sediments from Minnesota and esturaine sediments from San Francisco Bay.

            "abstract": "Halfway between the Salton Sea and San Gorgonio Pass, the southernmost San Andreas Fault (SAF) bifurcates into the Mission Creek and Banning strands. These strands bound the Indio Hills (IH), and mark the first of a series of left-stepping branches that define the transpressional, southern Big Bend of the SAF. Between the fault strands, the Quaternary Ocotillo Formation is deformed with fold axis orientations consistent with dextral shear; structurally the IH are synclinal in the east, transitioning to a complex antiform with increased uplift suggested by exhumation of Tertiary units in the west. We report new long- and short-term erosion rates across the IH and uplift rates on the Banning strand, and we evaluate these measurements in terms of slip rates across the fault system and structural deformation within the IH. Two methods of catchment-averaged erosion rates provide minimum rates yield similar results, (0.08 to 0.34 mm/yr) across 6 catchments. The long-term rates are calculated from eroded volumes estimated from a 10-m DEM surface enveloping the Indio Hills and assume that all folding and uplift initiated ca. 500ka (the 750 ka Bishop ash is uplifted and warped within the IH). The short-term rates, determined from 10Be dating of alluvial sediments, increase gradually to the northwest. Similarity of the rates suggests steady state uplift over the history of the fold; ongoing structural analysis and dating needed to constrain the maximum rates will test this possibility. The new uplift rate for the Banning strand at the east end of the IH is determined from a 60 pts/m^2 DEM produced by structure from motion photogrammetry and U-series ages and cosmogenic dates that provide an age range of 20-76ka for a fan vertically offset by ~2.5 m. The resulting uplift rate on the fault (0.03-0.125 mm/yr) overlaps with the short-term catchment-averaged erosion rate for this location (0.08 mm/yr). Consequently, we interpret that vertical strain is partitioned onto both the Banning fault and in uplift and folding of the IH. The uplift rates increase westward along the IH, possibly indicating increased activity on the Banning strand to the west. This pattern will be considered in the context of paleoseismic and horizontal slip rate studies in the region, and implications for rupture directivity on this hazardous fault system.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence is investigated using in-situ measurements both in the solar wind and within a high-speed reconnection jet in the terrestrial magnetotail. In the solar wind, reconnection events and current sheets are found for the first time to be concentrated in intervals of intermittent turbulence: within the most non-Gaussian 1% of magnetic field fluctuations, 87-92% of reconnection exhausts and about 9% of current sheets are found. Also, the likelihood that an identified current sheet will also correspond to a reconnection exhaust increases dramatically as the least intermittent fluctuations are removed. Hence, the turbulent solar wind contains a hierarchy of intermittent magnetic field structures that are increasingly linked to current sheets, which in turn are progressively more likely to correspond to sites of magnetic reconnection. In a magnetotail reconnection jet, the work done by electromagnetic fields on the particles, J·E, is found for the first time to have a non-Gaussian heavy tailed probability density function. Furthermore, J·E is non-uniform and concentrated in regions of high electric current density. This suggests magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy within the reconnection jet in a manner that is intermittent, and could be analogous to fluid-like turbulent phenomenology where dissipation proceeds via coherent structures generated by an intermittent cascade. These results could have far reaching implications for space and astrophysical plasmas where turbulence and magnetic reconnection are ubiquitous.",

The activities which alter vegetation cover, biomass, and phenology, directly influence regional to global climate through modification of surface biophysical properties and the surface energy balance. Land-use activities are also impact climate through changes in carbon and nitrogen balances and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, land-use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet future demands for food, feed, fiber, and energy. The fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) achieved a qualitative scientific advance in studying the effects of land-use on climate, for the first time explicitly accounting for the effects of global gridded land-use changes (past-future) in coupled carbon-climate model projections. Enabling this advance, the first consistent gridded land-use dataset (past-future) was developed, linking historical land-use data to future projections from Integrated Assessment Models, in a standard format required by climate models (“Land-use Harmonization”). Results from climate models indicate that the effects of land-use on climate, while uncertain, are sufficiently large and complex to warrant an expanded treatment of land-use. Here, we review past progress, future priorities, and present on new data and models designed to improve the understanding of the effects of land-use on climate (past-future).

            "abstract": "Landscape functions depend on how matter, energy, and organisms exchange between elements in hydrologic and habitat networks. Wetlands are important network elements, providing hydrological, biogeochemical and biological functions that vary along a continuum of connectivity with nearby and downstream waters. Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), those surrounded by uplands, occupy the entire connectivity continuum, but generally fall outside US legal protections unless a “significant nexus” to navigable waters is demonstrated. Geographic isolation does not imply hydrological, biogeochemical or biological isolation. Here we show multiple lines of evidence to support the inference that GIWs are integral to the function of navigable waters. Moreover, while GIW hydro-chemical connectivity may be episodic or slow (e.g., via groundwater), and biological connectivity limited by overland dispersal, reducing material or organism exchange is specifically what enables important, sometimes unique, functions. This relational connectivity, wherein precluded exchange creates functionality, may be as important to downstream waters as more obvious connections. Logic and evidence support the presumption that anthropogenic changes to GIW prevalence, condition and connectivity have significant downstream impacts.",

            "abstract": "The upper continental crust (UCC), the interface between the atmosphere and solid Earth, is the site of weathering that produces sedimentary rocks, influences ocean chemistry through runoff of soluble elements, and affects climate through CO2 draw-down. The UCC also contains more than 50% of the crust’s highly incompatible element budget (including K, Th, and U). Therefore, understanding its composition and evolution provides insight into how continents have formed, evolved, and interacted with the hydrosphere. New major and trace element compositions of >100 glacial diamictites and >100 Archean shales, plus δ7Li and δ18O for a subset of these samples, combined with data from the literature, show that the average composition of the UCC has changed through time, reflecting both the rise of atmospheric oxygen and its attendant effects on weathering, as well as the mode of crust formation and differentiation. Some changes that occur as a step function near the Archean/Proterozoic boundary (increased Th/U, decreased Mo/Pr, V/Lu) reflect the rise of oxygen at the great oxidation event (GOE) and its influence on chemical weathering signatures in the UCC. Other changes are more gradual with time (e.g., higher Th/Sc and δ18O, lower Ni/Co, La/Nb, Eu/Eu* and transition metal abundances) and reflect an UCC that has transitioned from a more mafic to a more felsic bulk composition, and which experienced increased interaction with the hydrosphere with time. The gradual nature of these compositional changes likely reflects the waning heat production of the Earth, rather than an abrupt change in tectonics or style of crust formation. These more gradual changes in crust composition, which contrast with the abrupt changes associated with the GOE, suggest that a fundamental change in the nature of crust differentiation is unlikely to be responsible for the rise of atmospheric oxygen (cf. Keller and Schoene, 2012). Indeed, it appears that the opposite may be true: that the rise of oxygen has influenced crust composition (and possibly differentiation).",

Understanding the sources of ice nuclei (IN) should lead to better predictions of climate. Many current instruments for measuring atmospheric concentrations of IN are not capable of providing size-resolved information. Such knowledge is useful in identifying the sources of IN. The recently developed micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor-droplet freezing technique (MOUDI-DFT) provides size-resolved information by combining an established immersion freezing apparatus with a cascade impactor for sample collection. Here we show results from a field study undertaken at a remote coastal site in Western Canada in August, 2013 using this technique. The size distributions of IN will be presented. A recent study suggested that the IN population in remote marine regions might be dominated by primary biogenic particles. To address the sources of IN from this campaign, correlations between IN concentrations and biological aerosols, carbonaceous aerosols, and other possible IN sources will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The NW Australian coast is impacted by 1–2 tropical cyclones (TCs) per year, and ten historical tsunamis have been recorded since 1858, including the 1883 Krakatoa tsunami. However, no sedimentary evidence on this particular event has been presented yet, and little is known about the geological imprint of (pre)historic TCs and tsunamis in NW Australia. High resolution geo-bioarchives, such as speleothems, promise to provide detailed information on occurrence patterns of past TCs for the era prior to historical documentation. Likewise, past TCs and tsunamis may be inferred from geomorphic and sedimentary archives, i.e. in the form of particular landforms (beach ridges, washover fans), deposits (washover sediments in lagoons) or erosional features. Notwithstanding, the identification and interpretation of event deposits in geological archives is associated with site- and archive-specific difficulties, and both event types may produce identical sedimentological characteristics. The differentiation between tsunami and storm in the geological record thus remains challenging, notably where modern deposits and/or historical reports on the event are absent.\nHere we present a sedimentary record from the Ashburton Delta (WA). It spans the last ~150 years and stores deposits of historical TCs and the 1883 Krakatoa tsunami. It is shown how optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) can be a key in linking such a record to historical events. The study aims at (i) providing a detailed characterization of the event deposits; (ii) distinguishing between TC and tsunami deposits based on multi-proxy sediment analyses; (iii) establishing a robust chronostratigraphy by OSL, and assigning layers to known TCs and tsunamis; and (iv) demonstrating how narrow the window of opportunity for recording coastal events may be if the sediment archives are located in dynamic sedimentary environments. Finally, our results contribute to the data pool of TC and tsunami deposits in Holocene stratigraphies.",

            "abstract": "Surface water inundation strongly regulates land-atmosphere energy and carbon exchange in northern environments. However, the dynamic nature of inundation in boreal-Arctic landscapes, and the impact of changing surface water extent on wetland methane (CH4) emissions, is not well understood. We examine recent (2003-2011) changes and spatiotemporal variability in surface inundation across high latitude wetland regions (> 45 deg. N) using passive microwave remote sensing retrievals of fractional open water extent (Fw) derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) 18.7 and 23.8 GHz brightness temperatures. The daily Fw retrievals are sensitive to sub-grid scale (~25-km resolution) open water area (e.g. lakes and emergent vegetation), and are insensitive to solar illumination and atmosphere contamination effects. We also explore the potential implications of surface Fw variability on high latitude methane emissions using a remote sensing data driven model sensitivity analysis. Our results show widespread surface wetting across the Arctic continuous permafrost zone, which increased model simulated high latitude methane emissions by 0.56 Tg CH4 yr-1 relative to the 2003-2011 mean. This increase was largely offset (-0.38 Tg CH4 yr-1) by drying in boreal Alaska, Canada and western Eurasia. We also find that accounting for dynamic Fw variability in model simulations may significantly lower regional methane emission budgets. These findings accentuate the need for frequent satellite remote sensing driven Fw monitoring across the high latitude systems, to better assess regional sensitivities to climate change. An extended Fw record using AMSR2 data and enhanced (3-9 km) resolution L-band active/passive microwave retrievals from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive mission, are expected to improve understanding of regional surface water trends and variability, and reduce uncertainty in boreal-Arctic wetland emission estimates.",

The dominant factors influencing the propagation of infrasound are the spatial and temporal variations in temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. In recent years, Infrasound Science has experienced a renaissance due to the installation of an international monitoring system of 60 infrasound arrays for monitoring the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and to the demonstrated value of regional infrasound networks for both scientific and applied purposes. Furthermore, in the past decade, significant advances have been made on using measurements of infrasound to invert for these properties of the atmosphere at altitudes where alternative measurement techniques are extremely costly.

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of montane groundwater-fed peatlands called fens as gauges for changes in groundwater recharge through time. Due to their consistent groundwater flows, fens remain saturated during the growing season, thus serving as ecological refugia for a range of sensitive biota including the federally threatened Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus canorus). In this project, five fens in the Sierra Nevada and two in the southern Cascade Mountains were studied over a 50-80 year period using historic aerial photography and GIS analysis. Fen areas were delineated using vegetation distributions and site wetness as visual keys to fen areal extent. In addition, a climate analysis of precipitation, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and mean minimum monthly temperature (Tmin) was carried out for the years 1950 – 2010 using a distributed parameter water-balance model called the Basin Characterization Model. Over the study period, all five Sierra fens decreased by 10-15% in delineated area, but little change occurred in the Cascade fens. The climate analysis revealed major changes through time in Tmin and the frequency of June months with zero snowpack (snowpack longevity) at the five Sierra sites. At the Cascade sites, increases in Tmin occurred more recently and decreases in snowpack longevity were more subtle. The different behavior of fens in the Cascades versus the Sierra Nevada suggests that underlying geology, particularly hydraulic conductivity, rock porosity, and size of groundwater reservoirs, may be an important buffer to change. These results show that fens in the Sierra Nevada are highly responsive ecohydrologic gauges that can be used to track reductions in groundwater recharge due to climate change. Further studies using isotopic and/or geochemical approaches are needed to quantify the changes in groundwater recharge that were identified with fens. Because fens provide critical habitat for sensitive species, major changes in hydrology would likely lead to impacts on wildlife populations. The establishment of fen monitoring networks could be a highly effective method by which to identify and track both hydrologic and ecologic impacts from climate change in California and potentially other parts of the arid West.",

We highlight some of the critical issues and major challenges to predicting disturbance impacts on water resources and natural hazards and outline some of the opportunities for improved mechanistic understanding of how disturbances propagate through landscape hydrological processes. In particular, we emphasize synthesis of conceptual commonalities and opportunities from other disciplines, primarily ecologic sciences, which are well versed in the study of disturbed landscapes. Cross scale interactions and complex adaptive systems theory are examples of useful concepts for synthesis across different disturbance effects. We also highlight the importance of improved understanding of disturbance hydrology for predicting the effects of extreme hydroclimatic events on the hydrologic response of the Critical Zone.

            "abstract": "We present cellular automata simulations and high-resolution field measurements of five sites along the United States Atlantic Coast, to investigate the erosion of marsh boundaries by wave action.\nFor several years, we tracked marsh contours of three sites in Plum Island Sound and two sites in the Virginia Coastal Reserve using a Real-Time-Kinematic GPS, and measurements were collected up to 20 cm apart. The cellular automata model consists of a 2D square lattice, whose elements have randomly distributed resistance. Randomly distributed resistance values are meant to take into account the variety of biological and geomorphologic processes affecting each portion of the marsh. Among others, seepage erosion, crab burrowing, vegetation and sediment cohesion make difficult to predict which portion of the marsh will collapse first.\nIn case of high wave power, erosion proceeds uniformly because each marsh portion has similar resistance if compared to the main external driver. On the contrary, when wind waves are weak and the local marsh resistance is strong, jagged marsh boundaries form.\nFrom a statistical viewpoint, the system behaves differently for the two extreme conditions of very low and very high wave power. The frequency magnitude distribution of erosion events approaches a Gaussian distribution in case of high wave power. In case of low wave power, the frequency magnitude distribution is characterized by a long-tailed power-law distribution. For the low wave power case, a long time is required to erode very resistant cells. However, once the most resistant cells are eliminated, several weak sites remain exposed and can be rapidly removed, with consequent generation of large-scale failures.\nField data confirm model results, and show the passage from a logarithmic frequency magnitude distribution of erosion events to a Gaussian distribution for increasing wave power exposure.\nThe logarithmic frequency magnitude distribution suggests the emergence of a critical state for marsh boundaries, which would make the prediction of failure events impossible. Internal physical processes allowing salt marshes to reach self-organized criticality are geotechnical, biological, and related to the non-homogeneity of salt marshes whose material discontinuities act as stress raisers.",

However, utilizing these frameworks at local to regional scales needed for environmental management is problematic due to their coarse spatial and (often) thematic resolution. We have developed techniques to extend global change projections to ecoregions of the conterminous United States, while maintaining coherence at global and local scales. We present a comparison of 1) scenario frameworks, and 2) scenario downscaling methods, and the effect each has on the composition of land-cover over the 21st century. Second, we demonstrate how historical and future projections of land-cover change impact at the regional scale 1) the capacity of ecosystems to store and sequester carbon, and 2) land-cover albedo induced changes to surface radiative forcing. Downscaled projections for IPCC SRES scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathways were developed along with business-as-usual scenarios based on local scale land-use histories. Three downscaling techniques were explored, where coarse-scale gridded data (half-degree) was allocated to ecoregions based on 1) an area weighting method, 2) land-cover composition, and 3) land-use histories. Each resulting scenario was then simulated using stochastic Monte Carlo methods within a state and transition simulation model. In addition to land-cover change, we also tracked changes across a range of carbon stocks and fluxes, and changes in surface radiative forcing. This comparative assessment provides important insight into the use of global-scale scenarios at regional scales.",

            "abstract": "The response of stratocumulus clouds to global warming as predicted by earth system models is uncertain. Recently, simulations of low clouds in the Hadley cell with single-column model versions of climate models were performed as part of the CGILS project. The results show a divergent behavior in the sign of the low cloud radiative feedback under an idealized global warming scenario. To understand these different model outcomes steady-state solutions of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer are studied with a mixed-layer model (MLM) in a phase space consisting of the lower tropospheric stability and the free tropospheric specific humidity. In one set of experiments the sea surface temperature (SST) is increased. In case the entrainment rate is kept constant to the control case value it can be shown analytically from the MLM equations that the cloud liquid water path, the sensible and latent heat fluxes will increase. By contrast, if the entrainment rate is allowed to respond to the perturbed SST, both the LWP and the sensible heat flux may decrease. The latent heat flux will increase even further by a drying of the boundary layer due to an enhanced entrainment. Similar experiments were performed with five single column model versions of Earth System Models and the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation model DALES. The findings strongly suggest that in a future climate changes in the free tropospheric specific humidity are key in controlling the response of stratocumulus cloud layers.",

            "abstract": "One emerging and important control on catchment hydrological functions of water storage, mixing and release is bedrock geology. Until today, catchment-based work has been limited by small ranges of rock types in adjacent basins. Moreover, conventional hydrological tracer approaches suffer from limitations inherent to the large storages related to certain bedrock types (e.g. the damping of stable isotope tracer signatures in deep storage catchments and obliteration of output signals at larger spatial scales).\nHere, we show how a multi-tracer approach, based on terrestrial diatoms and different stable and radioactive isotopic tracers can help refining our understanding of the dominant controls on catchment hydrological functions, especially the role of bedrock geology. We present new data and results from a nested catchment set-up, located in the Alzette River basin in Luxembourg (Europe). These 16 catchments (with sizes ranging from 0.47 to 285 km2) are characterized by clean and mixed assemblages of geology and land use. We have monitored these systems since 2002, including meteorological variables (precipitation, air temperature, etc.), as well as 15 minute discharge. Additional parameters have been monitored bi-weekly and at the event time scale, including geochemical and isotopic (3H, D, 18O) tracers, as well as terrestrial diatom communities in streamwater.\nOur results show that water balance derived dynamic storage significantly differs across the 16 catchments and scales. Catchment mixing potential inferred from standard deviations in stream baseflow ∂D (as a proxy for the damping of isotopic signatures in precipitation), as well as tritium-derived baseflow transit times, both exhibit a significant spatial variability, but strong correlation to bedrock pemeability. Terrestrial diatom assemblages in streamwater, as a proxy for rapid flow pathway connectedness to the stream network, are highly variable across the study catchments but also show strong correlation with geology.\nOur work suggests a hierarchy of controls on catchment function. Eventually, geology (namely bedrock permeability) trumps other physiographic characteristics such as land use or topography in controlling fundamental catchment functions of storage, mixing and release.",

            "abstract": "In soils and sediments microorganisms perform essential ecosystem services through their roles in regulating the stability of carbon and the flux of nutrients, and the purification of water. But these are complex systems with the physical, chemical and biological components all intimately connected. Components of this complexity are gradually being uncovered and our understanding of the extent of microbial functional diversity in particular has been enhanced greatly with the development of cultivation independent approaches. However we have not moved far beyond a descriptive and correlative use of this powerful resource. As the ability to reconstruct thousands of genomes from microbial populations using metagenomic techniques gains momentum, the challenge will be to develop an understanding of how these metabolic blueprints serve to influence the fitness of organisms within these complex systems and how populations emerge and impact the physical and chemical properties of their environment.\nIn the presentation we will discuss the development of a trait-based model of microbial activity that simulates coupled guilds of microorganisms that are parameterized including traits extracted from large-scale metagenomic data. Using a reactive transport framework we simulate the thermodynamics of coupled electron donor and acceptor reactions to predict the energy available for respiration, biomass development and exo-enzyme production. Each group within a functional guild is parameterized with a unique combination of traits governing organism fitness under dynamic environmental conditions. This presentation will address our latest developments in the estimation of trait values related to growth rate and the identification and linkage of key fitness traits associated with respiratory and fermentative pathways, macromolecule depolymerization enzymes and nitrogen fixation from metagenomic data. We are testing model sensitivity to initial microbial composition and intra-guild trait variability amongst other parameters and are using this model to explore abiotic controls on community emergence and impact on rates of reactions that contribute to the cycling of carbon across biogeochemical gradients from the soil to the subsurface.",

These models are mostly deterministic and where available are built upon a detailed understanding of microbial physiology and response to environmental factors. However as most soil microorganisms have not been cultivated, for the majority our understanding is limited to insights from environmental ‘omic information. Information gleaned from ‘omic studies of complex systems should be regarded as providing hypotheses, and these hypotheses should be tested under controlled laboratory conditions if they are to be propagated into deterministic models.\nIn a semi-arid Mediterranean grassland system we are attempting to dissect microbial communities into functional guilds with defined physiological traits and are using a range of ‘omics approaches to characterize their metabolic potential and niche preference. Initially, two physiologically relevant time points (peak plant activity and prior to wet-up) were sampled and metagenomes sequenced deeply (600-900 Gbp). Following assembly, differential coverage and nucleotide frequency binning were carried out to yield draft genomes. In addition, using a range of cultivation media we have isolated a broad range of bacteria representing abundant bacterial genotypes and with genome sequences of almost 40 isolates are testing genomic predictions regarding growth rate, temperature and substrate utilization in vitro. This presentation will discuss the opportunities and challenges in parameterizing microbial functional guilds from environmental ‘omic information for use in trait-based models.",

            "abstract": "Detrital sedimentary rocks provide average samples of the continental crust formed at different times and in different places. Some materials are more susceptible to erosion and/or to preservation bias than others, and one issue is to understand how the compositions of a range of source rocks are then recorded in the sediments. Here we considered two different approaches to model the growth of the continental crust:\n(i) The variation of Nd isotopes in continental shales with different deposition ages, which requires a correction of the bias induced by preferential erosion of younger rocks through an erosion parameter usually referred to as 'K'. The determination of K, and the extent to which it varies in different erosion systems, thus have fundamental implications for the models of continental growth based on radiogenic isotopes in continental sediments.\n(ii) The variations in U-Pb, Hf and O isotopes in detrital zircons, from ‘modern’ sediments sampled worldwide. In this approach, O isotopes are used to screen ‘hybrid’ Hf model ages (i.e. ages resulting from mixing processes of crustal material from different ages) from Hf model ages that represent actual crust formation ages.\nThese two approaches independently suggest that the continental crust has been generated continuously, but with a marked decrease in the continental growth rate at ~3 Ga. The >4 Ga to ~3 Ga period is characterised by relatively high net rates of continental growth (~3.0 km3.a-1), which are similar to the rates at which new crust is generated, and destroyed, at the present time. Net growth rates are much lower since 3 Ga (~0.8 km3.a-1), which may be attributed to higher rates of destruction of continental crust. The inflexion in the continental growth curve at ~3 Ga indicates a change in the way the crust was generated and preserved. This change may be linked to onset of subduction-driven plate tectonics and discrete subduction zones.",

Wills et al.’s (2000) site-condition map for California was found to correlate with seismic amplification (Field, 2000) and was adopted as a standard depiction for many applications of seismic shaking estimates (ShakeMap for example). Wills and Clahan (2006) modified that map to show simplified geologic units and corresponding Vs30 values. Preparation of this map raised a number of questions on how best to distinguish units within younger alluvium. Wills and Gutierrez (2011) found that a simple system based on surface slope could be used to subdivide the younger alluvium into three classes that have distinct Vs30 ranges. The classes defined by slope have approximately the same variability in Vs30 as the previously defined classes, but the total number of classes is reduced and the system can be easily applied to other tectonically active areas. We have now applied the system of Wills and Gutierrez (2011) to create a new map of California using the most detailed available geologic maps. Use of more detailed geologic maps, from 1:250,000 scale used in previous maps to 1:24,000 scale used for much of California in the current version, results in a much more detailed and accurate depiction of the surficial geology and, we anticipate, a more detailed and accurate depiction of seismic amplification due to the near-surface materials.",

            "abstract": "High Resolution Topographic (HRT) datasets are predominantly stored and analyzed as 2D raster grids of elevations (i.e., Digital Elevation Models). Raster grid processing is common in GIS software and benefits from a large library of fast algorithms dedicated to geometrical analysis, drainage network computation and topographic change measurement. Yet, all instruments or methods currently generating HRT datasets (e.g., ALS, TLS, SFM, stereo satellite imagery) output natively 3D unstructured point clouds that are (i) non-regularly sampled, (ii) incomplete (e.g., submerged parts of river channels are rarely measured), and (iii) include 3D elements (e.g., vegetation, vertical features such as river banks or cliffs) that cannot be accurately described in a DEM. Interpolating the raw point cloud onto a 2D grid generally results in a loss of position accuracy, spatial resolution and in more or less controlled interpolation. Here I demonstrate how studying earth surface topography and processes directly on native 3D point cloud datasets offers several advantages over raster based methods: point cloud methods preserve the accuracy of the original data, can better handle the evaluation of uncertainty associated to topographic change measurements and are more suitable to study vegetation characteristics and steep features of the landscape. In this presentation, I will illustrate and compare Point Cloud based and Raster based workflows with various examples involving ALS, TLS and SFM for the analysis of bank erosion processes in bedrock and alluvial rivers, rockfall statistics (including rockfall volume estimate directly from point clouds) and the interaction of vegetation/hydraulics and sedimentation in salt marshes. These workflows use 2 recently published algorithms for point cloud classification (CANUPO) and point cloud comparison (M3C2) now implemented in the open source software CloudCompare.",

            "abstract": "Despite being the second largest river basin in the world, with a drainage area greater than 3.7 million square kilometres, little is known about the hydraulics of the Congo River. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to a mixture of conflicts and the difficulty of accessing existing data.\nWe present results of studies which have focused primarily on the middle reach of the Congo River, located between Kisangani and Kinshasa, and its six main tributaries (Kasai, Ubangai, Sangha, Ruki, Lulonga and Lomami rivers). Through a combination of remotely sensed datasets and a hydrodynamic model we investigated what factors control the hydrodynamics of the middle reach.\nFrom the analysis of the remotely sensed datasets, we discover that variability in river width of the middle reach of the Congo is large and cannot be represented by empirical equations which relate channel geometry to basin area and discharge. Water surface slopes vary from 3.5 cm/km to 9 cm/km, which is far more than previous studies suggest. The remote datasets indicate that there exist 5 large constrictions in the river width which may result in backwater affecting between 11 and 33 percent of middle reach at low and high water respectively. These results were corroborated by the hydrodynamic model. In fact, when all constrictions caused by a narrowing in width of 1 km or more are considered, water levels along 43 percent of the middle reach change by at least 0.5 m.\nUsing the hydrodynamic model we also investigated the importance of the wetlands to the attenuation of the flood wave through the system. Initial results suggest that for the Congo River, floodplains have far more impact on the peak magnitude than the timing of the flood wave. When the model was run with no floodplain interactions an increase in the magnitude of flood peak was observed, with the timing of the waves being consistent with observed measurements.",

            "abstract": "The burial of organic carbon (OC) in river deltas and continental margins worldwide account for approximately 90% of the carbon burial in the ocean. In particular, sediments in large-river delta-front estuaries have been shown to be repositories and integrators of land-use change across expansive watersheds that drain the continents to the ocean. Thus, separating natural and human-driven changes in the transport of terrestrial organic carbon (TOC) to ocean is important in understanding the effects of climate change on TOC fluxes. Molecular biomarkers of TOC (e.g., lignin phenols, fatty acids, sterols) in LDE sediments have been used extensively to reconstruct of carbon cycling changes that are reflective of land-use change in the watersheds. However, due to the highly variable hydrologic regimes across continents, continental margins (e.g., active versus passive), and coastal dynamics in LDEs, the fate and transport of these molecular biomarkers varies considerably. Here I will discuss some of the key molecular biomarkers that have been used to date in such historical reconstruction exercises in LDEs (e.g., Mississippi/Atchafalaya, Yangtze, Yellow, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Colville Rivers), and explore how margin-type, residence time of transport, redox, and molecular stability, to name a few, impact the utility of using different biomarkers in paleo-reconstruction studies.",

Low- and high-magma supply study areas at 95°W and 92°W have similar spreading rates (53 and 55 mm/yr), but differ by 30% in the time-averaged rate of magma supply (0.3×106 and 0.4×106 m3/km/yr) as a result of varying proximity to the Galápagos hotspot. We use major and trace element analyses of glass and whole rock samples, chemical analyses of mineral phases, and observations of rock microstructure to characterize fractional crystallization, assimilation, magma mixing, and the timescales of magmatic recharge events relative to eruptions. At 92°W, high magma supply sustains a shallow melt lens ~1.7 km below the seafloor, within which the competing effects of fractional crystallization, assimilation, and frequent magmatic recharge result in eruption of lavas with low crystal contents and highly variable MgO (2.7-8.2 wt. %). Resident magma can be repeatedly tapped by low-volume fissure eruptions between magmatic recharge events. In contrast, at 95°W melt-rich bodies are likely only present intermittently, and at greater depths (3.0-3.4 km) below the seafloor. Magmatic evolution at this location is dominated by processes involving crystal-rich mush, which is co-mingled in varying proportions with hotter, more melt-rich magma during recharge events that closely precede volumetrically larger and probably less frequent eruptions. Erupted lavas are generally more phyric than those at 92°W, with higher and less variable MgO (6.2-9.1 wt. %). Limited residence within melt-rich reservoirs allows mixing trends to be preserved in erupted lavas.",

A major goal of these efforts is to build policy networks that enable land managers to access information and expertise needed for responding to local climate risks. This paper investigates whether the perceived and modeled climate risk faced by different land managers is leading to larger networks or more participating in climate adaptation. In theory, the benefits of climate planning networks are larger when land managers are facing more potential changes. The basic hypothesis is tested with a survey of public land managers from hundreds of local and regional public lands management units in the Southwestern United States, as well as other stakeholders involved with climate adaptation planning. All survey respondents report their perceptions of climate risk along a variety of dimensions, as well as their participation in climate adaptation planning and information sharing networks. For a subset of respondents, we have spatially explicity GIS data about their location, which will be linked with downscaled climate model data. With the focus on climate change, the analysis is a subset of the overall idea of linking social and ecological systems.",

            "abstract": "The Los Angeles basin is host to a complex network of active strike-slip, reverse, and oblique slip faults. Because of the large metropolitan region occupying the basin, even moderately large earthquakes (M6+) pose a significant natural hazard. Since geologic estimates have not fully characterized the distribution of active fault slip rates in the region, we use a mechanical model driven by geodetically-measured shortening rates to calculate the full three-dimensional fault slip rate distributions in the region. The modeled nonplanar fault geometries are relatively well-constrained, and use data from the SCEC community fault model. Area-weighted average fault slip rates predicted by the model match previously measured geologic slip rates in most cases; however, some geologic measurements were made in locations where the slip rate is non-characteristic of the fault (e.g. near a fault tip) and the geologic slip rate estimate disagrees with the model-predicted average slip rate. The largest discrepancy between the model predictions and geologic estimates occurs on the Sierra Madre fault, which has a model-predicted slip rate approximately 2 mm/yr greater than the geologic estimates. An advantage of the model is that it can predict the full three-dimensional mechanically compatible slip distribution along all modeled faults. The fault surface slip distribution maps show complex oblique slip patterns that arise due to the nonplanar geometries and mechanical interactions between intersecting and neighboring faults. For example, the Hollywood fault exhibits a net slip of 0.7 mm/yr at depth which increases to 1.6 mm/yr where it is intersected by the Santa Monica fault in the near-surface. Model results suggest that nearly all faults in the region have an oblique component of slip at depth, so slip rate estimates of only dip or strike-slip may underestimate the total net slip rates and seismic hazards in the region.",

Processes that play a role in modulating gas exchanges include biological, soil biogeochemical, snow chemical, and snow physical processes. Environmental conditions underneath the snow are relatively stable throughout the winter period. Above the snow surface, variations in temperature, radiation, and wind exert a wide range of influences on snowpack gas chemistry, gas exchanges at the snow-air interface, and chemical interactions between the interstitial snowpack air and vegetation and soil below the snowpack. This presentation will present an overview of experimental approaches for continuous, all winter-long experiments conducted at a permafrost site at the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) station at Toolik Lake on the north slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska. These studies include observations of carbon dioxide and the reactive gases ozone, nitrogen oxides, and gaseous elemental mercury.

            "abstract": "The recent development of anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) scenarios that cover all or part of the preindustrial Holocene (11,700 BP to ~AD 1850) has led to a number of modelling studies on the impacts of land cover change on climate, using both GCMs and regional climate models. Because most ALCC scenarios arrive at similar estimates of anthropogenic deforestation by the late preindustrial, most models agree that the net biogeophysical effect of ALCC by AD 1850 is regional cooling at mid- to high-latitudes and warming and drying over the tropics and subtropics. In particular, tropical deforestation appears to lead to local amplification of externally forced drought cycles, e.g., from ENSO. The spatial extent of these climate changes varies between models because the choice of ALCC scenario leads to large differences in the initial forcing. Those model studies that considered biogeochemical feedbacks show that the importance of preindustrial CO2 emissions ranges from being insignificant to larger than the global biogeophysical feedback, depending on assumptions made about potential natural atmospheric CO2 at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. While the net magnitude of deforestation is similar among ALCC scenarios at AD 1850, the timing of deforestation varies widely, which, in addition to affecting the inferred importance of biogeochemical feedbacks, leads to large differences in the estimated importance of ALCC on climate earlier in the Holocene. For example, modelling experiments performed on Europe and the Mediterranean representing conditions at the peak of the Roman Empire or in Mesoamerica for the Classic Maya period show large differences in the estimated importance of the biogeophysical feedback to regional climate depending on the ALCC scenario used. The wide variety of results gained so far from ALCC and climate modelling experiments shows that the question of “how much did humans influence the state of the Earth System before the Industrial Revolution?” is far from being resolved. Future improvements to ALCC scenarios that improve thematic resolution to go beyond simple deforestation are essential, for example to include locally important types of historical land use such as irrigation and forest pasture, and Earth System models should move towards coupling between ALCC and climate.",

The goal is to develop a climate model suitable for: a) projecting future climate change up to several hundred years into the future, b) for the attribution of climate change over the past century, and c) prediction of climate variability at seasonal to decadal time scales. This effort represents a unification of modeling capability including forcing with aerosol precursor and carbon emissions and representation of extreme phenomena while reducing biases through physically meaningful development.\nPrototype atmospheric configurations (AM4) are currently under active development. These configurations are rooted in previous generation GFDL models, but with increased resolution and updated physics. The target horizontal resolution for AM4 is 0.5 deg, with an option for a lower resolution version of 1 deg for certain applications. The reduction of long-standing systematic errors is also a focus of the development efforts through updates to the model physics. For example, an updated convective parameterization reduces the equatorial cold tongue SST biases as well as improves the representation of MJO. Modifications to the boundary layer and cloud parameterizations show promise in significantly reducing long-standing marine stratocumulus clouds biases. Most AM4 prototype configurations exhibit a higher climate sensitivity compared to previous generation models. Given uncertainties in climate sensitivity and aerosol cloud interactions, we are also investigating the feasibility and viability of creating an alternate lower climate sensitivity model configuration.",

The location and strength of the North Pacific Ocean high pressure system off the California coast determine the amount of rain during winter by blocking or allowing the pass of winter storms through the region. It also determines the strength and timing of alongshore winds that drive coastal upwelling, which in turns lead to cool coastal water during the spring and summer that is closely relate to fog formation.\nTiming and intensity of coastal upwelling vary year to year due to a number of climate processes impacting the high pressure system and the coastal atmospheric and ocean conditions. Notably, persistent summer upwelling varies independently from the sporadic winter/early spring upwelling events (as well as other weather patterns), and in turn they impact differently the marine and terrestrial ecosystems.\nHere, we review the variability and source of variability of the North Pacific High, its impact on the upwelling conditions along the California coast, and investigate their influence on terrestrial rain and fog during winter and summer, highlighting their impact on coastal and terrestrial ecosystems.",

On the Southeastern Brazilian Continental Shelf, Cabo Frio region represents the limit between Santos and Campos basin oil reserves. The continental drainage in this area is not expressive, nevertheless presents a complex interaction between the western boundary Brazil Current (BC) and shelf border mechanisms providing amid-shelf intrusion and a coastal upwelling of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) over the shelf. Satellite images of the region shows expressive shelf plumes with sedimentary contributions from Paraiba do Sul river located approximately 180 km northward of Cabo Frio, as well as from Guanabara bay, located 150 km westward of Cabo Frio. In order to understand the role of plumes in sedimentary processes over the continental shelf, this study analyzed 10 years of MODIS true-color 250 m remote sensing data in order to understand the temporal variability of the shelf front and the area of plumes. The remote data were obtained from the Aerosol Robotic Network and USDA Foreign Agricultural Service subsets. Selected 17% of daily images were cloud-free to allow shelf plumes to be delimited and processed to enhancement of features as well as land masking, geo-referencing, and daily area calculation on pixel basis. During austral winter (dry season) the plumes get its maximum extension in area over the shelf, suggesting that the mechanism of sediment transport is connected with high energetic wave-wind interactions on the coast followed by wind-driven dispersion less than continental drainage. The interannual pattern shows a general decreasing trend, mainly in the last 4 years, associated with sediment availability on the inner shelf, which is driven by river discharge during the austral summer (rain season). We also calculated the spatial probability function of the plume front on the shelf showing the areas were high contrast between clear oceanic waters and sediment rich plume waters can be found. The region corresponds to deposition centers of fine sedimentary material on the shelf, which corroborates our hypothesis.",

Among the datasets produced from MISR and MODIS observations are joint histograms of cloud-top-height (CTH) and optical-depth (OD). An examination of monthly CTH-OD histograms shows that while there has been no change in global, total cloud fraction (the sum of all CTH-OD components) over the past decade, there has been a significant change in some of the CTH-OD components. Of particular note is a systematic decrease in the amount of the most reflective, most optically thick cloud (OD > 23). This reduction in optically thick cloud has occurred primarily in the extratropics of both hemispheres. In this presentation, I report on early efforts to attribute the changes in cloud cover over the Southern Ocean near New Zealand to changes in synoptic weather patterns. Preliminary results suggest the reduction in optically thick cloud and other changes in cloud cover in this area are not due to a change in the distribution of synoptic patterns but rather is associated with relatively subtle changes in the pressure and position of baroclinic systems, and is tied to the Southern Annualar Mode.",

            "abstract": "Since 2009 the central and eastern United States has experienced an unprecedented increase in the rate of M≥3 earthquakes that is unlikely to be due to natural variation. Where the rates have increased so has the seismic hazard, making it important to understand these changes. Areas with significant seismicity increases are limited to areas where oil and gas production take place. By far the largest contributor to the seismicity increase is Oklahoma, where recent studies suggest that these rate changes may be due to fluid injection (e.g., Keranen et al., Geology, 2013; Science, 2014). Moreover, the area of increased seismicity in northern Oklahoma that began in 2013 coincides with the Mississippi Lime play, where well completions greatly increased the year before the seismicity increase. This suggests a link to oil and gas production either directly or from the disposal of significant amounts of produced water within the play.\nFor the purpose of assessing the hazard due to these earthquakes, should they be treated differently from natural earthquakes? Previous studies suggest that induced seismicity may differ from natural seismicity in clustering characteristics or frequency-magnitude distributions (e.g., Bachmann et al., GJI, 2011; Llenos and Michael, BSSA, 2013). These differences could affect time-independent hazard computations, which typically assume that clustering and size distribution remain constant. In Oklahoma, as well as other areas of suspected induced seismicity, we find that earthquakes since 2009 tend to be considerably more clustered in space and time than before 2009. However differences between various regional and national catalogs leave unclear whether there are significant changes in magnitude distribution.\nWhether they are due to natural or industrial causes, the increased earthquake rates in these areas could increase the hazard in ways that are not accounted for in current hazard assessment practice. Clearly the possibility of induced earthquakes needs to be considered in seismic hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "When we think of sensor networks, we often focus on hardware development and deployments and the resulting data and synthesis. Yet, for networks that cross institutional boundaries, such as distributed federations of observatories, people are the critical network resource. They establish the linkages and enable access to and interpretation of the data. In the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON), we found that careful integration of three networks --people, hardware, and data--was essential to providing an effective research environment. Accomplishing this integration is not trivial and requires a shared vision among members, explicit attention to the emerging tenets of the science of team science, and training of scientists at all career stages. In GLEON these efforts have resulted in scientific inferences covering new scales, crossing broad ecosystem gradients, and capturing important environmental events. Network-level capital has been increased by the deployment of instrumented buoys, the creation of new data sets and publicly available models, and new ways to synthesize and analyze high frequency data. The formation of international teams of scientists is essential to these goals. Our approach unites a diverse membership in GLEON-style team science, with emphasis on training and engagement of graduate students while creating knowledge.\nExamples of the bottom-up scientific output from GLEON include creating and confronting models using high frequency data from sensor networks; interpreting output from biological sensors (e.g., algal pigment sensors) as predictors for water quality indices such as water clarity; and understanding the relationship between occasional, highly noxious algal blooms and fluorometric measurements of pigments from sensor networks. Numerical simulation models are not adequate for predicting highly skewed distributions of phytoplankton in eutrophic lakes, suggesting that our fundamental understanding of phytoplankton population dynamics needs modification as do our models, both of which can be improved with the use of high frequency data.",

            "abstract": "The carbon isotopic composition of plant biomarkers (δ13C) can provide unique insights into the past carbon cycle perturbations and associated climate change, however local records are influenced by ecological processes, local climate, as well as changes in the carbon isotope composition of the atmosphere. To examine the sources and amounts of geographic variation, we focused on long-term changes in the carbon cycle. We combined modern calibrations, δ13C of biomarkers in sediment, and Monte Carlo analyses to measure and predict the fractionation of carbon isotopes by plants (Δleaf) and to estimate error. We used data from multiple sites of different ages, in the western U.S. For each age and location, Δleaf was calculated from the δ13C of plant biomarkers and atmospheric δ13C values inferred from marine carbonates. Δleaf values calculated from n-alkanes and triterpenoids (angiosperm biomarkers) were found to be the same at each site. Δleaf calculated from diterpenoids (conifer biomarkers) was 2‰ lower. This is consistent with differences in Δleaf between living angiosperms and conifers. Predicted Δleaf values, from modern calibrations and paleoclimate data, were consistently offset (0.7‰) from measured values indicating that modern calibrations are useful for reconciling past changes in plant fractionation and that vegetation and precipitation, like modern plants, were the key controls on Δleaf in ancient vegetation. However, uncertainties in the measured and predicted Δleaf values were very large (>2‰, 1σ). A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis indicates that ‘biological noise’ in modern calibrations explains most of this uncertainty. If the full extent of this biological noise were transferred to sediments, then extracting signal from noise would be challenging. However, we speculate that the process of deposition homogenizes variability at the leaf and tree level thereby reducing ‘biological noise’ observed in modern calibrations.",

AGWA (see: www.tucson.ars.ag.gov/agwa or http://www.epa.gov/esd/land-sci/agwa/) is a GIS interface jointly developed by the USDA-Agricultural Research Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the University of Arizona, and the University of Wyoming to automate the parameterization and execution of a suite of hydrologic and erosion models (RHEM, WEPP, KINEROS2 and SWAT). Through an intuitive interface the user selects an outlet from which AGWA delineates and discretizes the watershed using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The watershed model elements are then intersected with terrain, soils, and land cover data layers to derive the requisite model input parameters. With the addition of a burn severity map AGWA can be used to model post wildfire changes to a catchment. By applying the same design storm to burned and unburned conditions a rapid assessment of the watershed can be made and areas that are the most prone to flooding can be identified.\nPost-fire precipitation and runoff records from gauged forested watersheds are now being used to make improvements to post fire model input parameters. Rainfall and runoff pairs have been selected from these records in order to calibrate parameter values for surface roughness and saturated hydraulic conductivity used in the KINEROS2 model. Several objective functions will be tried in the calibration process. Results will be validated. Currently Department of Interior Burn Area Emergency Response (DOI BAER) teams are using the AGWA-KINEROS2 modeling interface to assess hydrologically imposed risk immediately following wild fire. These parameter refinements are being made to further improve the quality of these assessments.",

            "abstract": "Human demand for food, fuel, and industrial products results in the release of 61% of the newly fixed anthropogenic N to the environment in the US each year. This 15.8 Tg N yr-1 input to air, land and water has important social, economic and environmental consequences, yet little research clearly links this N release to the full suite of effects. Here we connect the biogeochemical fluxes of N with existing data on N-associated damages in order to quantify the externalities of N release related to human health, ecosystems and climate regulation for the US at national and watershed scales. Release of N to the environment was estimated circa 2000 with models describing N inputs by source, nutrient uptake efficiency, leaching losses, and gaseous emissions at the scale of 8-digit US Geologic Survey Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC8s). Potential damages or benefits of anthropogenic N leaked to the environment were calculated by scaling specific N fluxes with the costs associated with human health, agriculture, ecosystems, and the climate system. For the US, annual damage costs of anthropogenic N leaked to the environment in 2000 totaled $289 billion USD. Approximately 57% of the total damages were associated with fossil fuel combustion, driven by the human respiratory health impacts of NOx as a precursor of ozone and a component of particulates. Another 37% of the damage costs were associated with agricultural N. Damages associated with agriculture were $85.5 billion, largely through eutrophication and harmful effects on aquatic habitat. Through aggressive but tangible improvements in atmospheric emissions, agricultural N use and wastewater treatment, we could reduce N export to the coast by nearly 25% within 30 years. These improvements would reduce the externalities associated with the leakage of N beyond its intended uses in agriculture, transportation and energy with minimal impact to these sectors dependent on anthropogenic N fixation.",

            "abstract": "Snowmelt over frozen soils has been observed to account for over 80% of the annual runoff and almost all streamflow in the Canadian Prairies. It is also an important source for recharging soil moisture and filling wetlands. Typical streamflow hydrographs peak in April from snowmelt and cease in May from lack of sub-surface inputs. This study evaluated the detailed hydrological impact of regional changes to climate on an instrumented research catchment, Smith Creek Research Basin; a wetland dominated instrumented catchment in southeastern Saskatchewan, Canada. The region has recently experienced increased streamflow and repeated flooding. Precipitation, temperature, and streamflow records were analyzed for trends and change points and the source of streamflow was analyzed by examination of meteorological and hydrological records. The massive spring flood of 2011 in Smith Creek resulted from heavy rainfall onto a record deep melting snowpack. For the first time in any record, large summer runoff events occurred in 2012 and were repeated in 2014, breaking record peak flows. These unique summer floods resulted from rainfall runoff in mid-summer, well after spring snowmelt filled much of the available surface and sub-surface storage. Local meteorological observations from 1942 to present show substantial climate change: mean annual temperatures have increased by 1.1 °C, triggering a 9% increase in the rainfall fraction of annual precipitation. Despite the lack of trends in annual precipitation, annual streamflow volume has increased four-fold since 1994. Spring rainfall onto snowpacks overlying frozen soils tends to create and ice layer on top of the soil that restricts infiltration during snowmelt and can increase snowmelt rates. Streamflow observations since 1975 show a 10-fold increase in the Smith Creek streamflow volume derived from combined snowmelt and rainfall, whereas streamflow derived solely from snowmelt has declined. Storage of spring meltwater runoff in the prairie ponds creates antecedent conditions that promote summer streamflow generation if large rainfall volumes follow as occurred in 2012 and 2014. This research highlights the growing need to understand how increasing rainfall contributes to dramatically changing streamflow regimes on the Canadian Prairies.",

The -5 common spectrum eventually rolls over at a speed corresponding to the maximum energy to which particles are accelerated. In the inner heliosphere the rollover occurs at quite low energies and thus the -5 portion is only observed in suprathermal particles. In the heliosheath, the rollover occurs at much higher energies and the common spectrum is observed over the full energy range of the Voyager energetic particle instruments, up to energies of ~100 MeV. Here recent and previous observations of the common spectrum in the heliosphere and heliosheath are presented, with emphasis on those that best reveal the conditions in which the acceleration must operate. Finally, we describe the physics of the pump acceleration mechanism, that yields the common -5 power law spectrum, and relate the rollover speeds to conditions in the regions where particles are accelerated.",

Indeed, a regional fossil fuel and biofuel inventory for gases and particulates described in Liousse et al. (2014) has been developed for Africa at a resolution of 0.25° x 0.25° for the years 2005 and 2030. For 2005, the original database of Junker and Liousse (2008) was used after modification for updated regional fuel consumption and emission factors. Two prospective inventories for 2030 are derived based on Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) model (Criqui, 2001). The first is a reference scenario (2030ref) with no emission controls and the second is for a \"clean\" scenario (2030ccc*) including Kyoto policy and African specific emission control. This inventory predicts very large increases of pollutant emissions in 2030 (e.g. contributing to 50% of global anthropogenic organic particles), if no emission regulations are implemented.\nThese inventories have been introduced in RegCM4 model. In this paper we will focus on aerosol modelled concentrations in 2005, 2030ref and 2030ccc*. Spatial distribution of aerosol concentrations will be presented with a zoom at a few urban and rural sites. Finally mortality rates (respiratory, cardiovascular) caused by anthropogenic PM2.5 increase from 2005 to 2030, calculated following Lelieveld et al. (2013), will be shown for each scenarios.\nTo conclude, this paper will discuss the effectiveness of scenarios to reduce emissions, aerosol concentrations and mortality rates, underlining the need for further measurements scheduled in the frame of the new DACCIWA (Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud Interactions) program.",

            "abstract": "Despite the seemingly diverse circumstances under which crustal earthquakes occur, scale-invariant stress drop and apparent stress, the ratio of radiated seismic energy to moment, is observed. The magnitude-independence of these parameters is central to our understanding of both earthquake physics and strong ground motion genesis. Estimates of stress drop and radiated energy, however, display large amounts of scatter potentially masking any secondary trends in the data. We investigate sources of this uncertainty within the framework of constant stress drop and apparent stress. We first re-visit estimates of energy and stress drop from a variety of earthquake observations and methods, for events ranging from magnitude ~2 to ~9. Using an empirical Green’s function (eGf) deconvolution method, which removes the path and site effects, radiated energy and Brune stress drop are estimated for both regional events in the western US and Eastern Honshu, Japan from the HiNet network, as well as teleseismically recorded global great earthquakes [Baltay et al., 2010, 2011, 2014]. In addition to eGf methods, ground-motion based metrics for stress drop are considered, using both KikNet data from Japan [Baltay et al., 2013] and the NGA-West2 data, a very well curated ground-motion database. Both the eGf-based stress drop estimates and those from the NGA-West2 database show a marked decrease in scatter, allowing us to identify deterministic secondary trends in stress drop. We find both an increasing stress drop with depth, as well as a larger stress drop of about 30% on average for mainshock events as compared to on-fault aftershocks. While both of these effects are already included in some ground-motion prediction equations (GMPE), many previous seismological studies have been unable to conclusively uncover these trends because of their considerable scatter. Elucidating these effects in the context of reduced and quantified epistemic uncertainty can help both seismologists and engineers to understand the true aleatory variability of the earthquake source, which may be due to the complex and diverse circumstances under which these earthquake occur and which we are yet unable to model.",

            "abstract": "Regional climate model (RCM) simulations from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Project (NARCCAP) and additional simulations from the Canadian RCM (CRCM) were analyzed for changes in extreme precipitation. Metrics of extreme precipitation included annual maxima and 30-yr maxima of 24-yr, 48-hr, 72-hr, and 120-hr total precipitation. These are being compared with U.S. observations of these extremes for the reference period of 1971-2000. One particular aspect of interest is the spatial variability of extreme amounts in the model simulations. Preliminary results indicate that this spatial variability is quite large. This is of central interest because these simulations are being used to estimate future changes in extreme rainfall engineering design values. We are addressing two questions. One, is the model-simulated variability similar to observed variability. Two, how should this variability be interpreted, specifically how much is sampling noise and how much is forced by local features.",

            "abstract": "While regional groundwater flow has been a topic of research for more than a century, open questions still remain regarding the relative importance of topography, geology and climate in determining groundwater configuration. Previous research on this topic has utilized analytical solutions, observations and regional hydrologic models. However, to date no study has considered groundwater flows at the continental scale using an integrated groundwater surface water model. Here we present the results of a high-resolution (1km) simulation of the majority of the Continental US generated using ParFlow, a physically based integrated hydrologic model. The model is forced with spatially distributed recharge derived from historical precipitation and evaporation and the subsurface is composed of laterally heterogeneous geologic units. Results illustrate clear multi scale behavior and regional shifts in the relative control of topography, geology and climate on water table depth and groundwater flux. Previous analysis at the continental scale, has used non-dimensional water table ratios to classify water table configurations as topographically dominated or recharge dominated, while groundwater exchanges with the surface have been classified using the ratio of runoff to total recharge. In agreement with previous studies, model results highlight relatively greater topographic control and more significant groundwater exchanges with streams in the arid west than in the humid east. However, by using an integrated modeling platform that solves the surface and subsurface systems simultaneously we are also able to demonstrate the limitations of metrics that rely on simplifications. While we observe regional patterns in groundwater that are consistent with large-scale gradients in aridity and geographic features; at the local scale the interactions with subsurface heterogeneity are complex. In some cases subsurface heterogeneity is clearly manifest in groundwater fluxes while in others topographic gradients control the flow. Results demonstrate the complexity of the natural system and the difficulty in classifying groundwater behavior using simplified approaches.",

            "abstract": "Biochar is the solid byproduct from the pyrolysis of agricultural crop residues, manures, green wastes and wood-based materials. Pyrolyzing biomass causes inorganic and organic compounds to be concentrated within the carbonized remains of the original lignin and cellulose structure. It is through this complex mixture of organic aromatic structures and inorganic elements that potentially imparts biochars with special multi-functional capabilities. Our current research has focused on developing biochar to simultaneously sequester soil carbon and remediate degraded soils. This is accomplished by directly improving soil nutrient and moisture contents, sorbing pollutants, as well as altering microbial signaling. Maintaining these improvements needs to account for biochar physical degradation, which may be overcome by biochar-mineral associations. Additional research is focused on biochar use that minimizes soil microorganism population shifts in order to maintain current ecosystem services. Future USDA research involves more evaluations to understand the multifunctional role of biochar in the agricultural and environmental sectors (e.g., USEPA superfund locations). This presentation will provide highlights of current and future coordinated biochar research efforts from several key laboratory locations across the US.",

            "abstract": "Both observations and 20th century coupled model (CMIP3/5) simulations suggest that severe weak monsoon years (seasonal mean rainfall less than 15% of the normal) over South Asia are associated with a developing El Nino. During these years and within the summer season, monsoon breaks last for a prolonged period (> 7 days). Detailed diagnostics show that dry advection is the primary initiator for the dryness while cloud-radiative processes maintain it. In all future RCP projections, a robust signal in the time-mean is a basin-wide SST warming along the equatorial central-eastern Pacific (El Nino-like conditions). Question of interests include: in a warmer planet, what is the probability that the monsoon extremes would increase and intensify? Are there any changes in the dynamical and thermodynamical processes that shape these extremes? To address the above questions, a detalied diagostics of CMIP3/5 solutions in conjunction with a series of idealized numerical experiments were performed in an ensemble mode. Model solutions suggest that compared to present-day, intensity of severe weak monsoons increases, and frequency and intensity of prolonged break conditions also increase. Furthermore, an examination of temporal evolution of area-averaged daily rainfall over South Asia suggests “persistence” of dryness throughout the summer season. Our model solutions imply the dominant role of boundary forcing, enhancing predictability of severe weak monsoons. The actual processes that shape these extremes as well as limitations in the present research, and future directions will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We examine the balanced and transient dynamics of large-scale overturning circulations in the tropical atmosphere using idealized equatorial β-plane models. When deep diabatic heating in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is prescribed as slowly varying with time, the deep Hadley circulation is of first order importance. In the absence of deep diabatic heating, the interior circulation associated with Ekman pumping cannot penetrate deep into the troposphere because the resistance of fluid parcels to horizontal motion (i.e., inertial stability) is significantly smaller than their resistance to vertical motion (i.e., static stability). In this scenario, only a shallow Hadley circulation exists. The meridional asymmetry between the winter and summer deep and shallow Hadley cells is attributed to the anisotropy of the inertial stability parameter, and as the ITCZ widens meridionally or as the forcing involves higher vertical wavenumbers, the asymmetry between the winter and summer cells increases. When we prescribe both a slow and fast \"switch-on\" deep diabatic heating, we learn that inertia-gravity waves propagate in the meridional direction away from the ITCZ and bounce back at critical latitutes in the zonally symmetric framework. When the assumption of zonal symmetry is relaxed, we find that inertia-gravity waves propagate away from the ITCZ in not only the meridional direction but also in the zonal direction.",

After hydraulic deployment of the penetrometer, the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is completely decoupled from the penetrometer; this eliminates the adverse effects of ship heave. We tested the MDHDS at Site U1402 (the location of Site 1073, ODP Leg 174A), offshore New Jersey, during two days of ship time during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 342. We emplaced a penetrometer successfully and documented that the penetrometer was decoupled from drill string movement. The pore pressure (7.5 MPa) was slightly overpressured. Based on this successful field test, the MDHDS has been certified by the USIO for shipboard use. The MDHDS is an IODP-funded engineering development led by The University of Texas at Austin, in conjunction with the USIO and Stress Engineering Services.

The project’s aim is to involve classroom students in observing and reporting cloud parameters to assist in the validation of NASA’s CERES satellite instruments, thus connecting classroom science work to the outside world. In 2007, S’COOL added a Citizen Science component called ROVER. ROVER is geared toward informal observers not tied to one observation location. The S’COOL Project has been successful due to a combination of its flexibility of implementation, training and involvement opportunities, intuitive and free resources, and this authentic connection to an ongoing scientific activity.\nThrough S’COOL’s multiple participation avenues, all participants are invited to collect cloud data following S’COOL guidelines. Their cloud data is later matched with corresponding satellite data. Within a week of submitting their report, a participant will be sent a “match” email, if their observation aligns to a satellite overpass. This “match” shows their ground report next to the satellite data for comparison and analysis. All ground observations and satellite matches are archived in a S’COOL database, accessible to the public. This multi-step process enables an on-going, two-way interaction between students and NASA, which is much more engaging than more typical one-way outreach experiences.\nTo complement and enable the cloud observation component, the S’COOL website offers formal and informal education communities a wide variety of atmospheric science related learning resources. These educator created resources are supplemented with carefully crafted background information from the science team. Alignment of the project to the Next Generation Science Standards is underway now, and will highlight the many science process skills involved in S’COOL participation. The S’COOL team works to provide both formal and informal audiences with an authentic STEM experience for cloud observers of all ages.\nThis presentation will review best practices from 17 years of Earth Science Education and Public Outreach in reference to the S’COOL Project.",

            "abstract": "In support of a project for monitoring hazards for electric power grids, we present a new method for estimating electric fields that are induced in the Earth’s interior at a particular site during magnetic storms. For this, we adopt a model of the electrical conductivity of the lithosphere that is simple but sufficient to model most variation in the induced geoelectric field: two horizontal layers, each with uniform electrical conductivity properties that can be parameterized by a galvanic distortion tensor. After Laplace transformation of the induction equations into the complex frequency domain, we obtain an electromagnetic impedance function. Upon inverse transformation back to the time domain, convolution of the impedance tensor with a geomagnetic time series yields an estimated geoelectric time series. We optimize the model conductivity parameters using 1-sec resolution magnetic and electric field data collected at the Kakioka magnetic observatory during the October 2003 Halloween storm. We validate the algorithm against Kakioka magnetic and electric field data for the July 2000 Bastille-Day storm. Finally, we infer 1-sec geoelectric fields that were realized (but not directly measured) in Japan during the 1989 Quebec storm. Results highlight the need for improved ground-level monitoring of geomagnetic and geoelectric fields. They also reveal the need for accommodating the galvanic distortion of three-dimensional conductivity when predicting geoelectric fields in the lithosphere and geomagnetically induced currents in electric power grids.",

            "abstract": "Providing reliable seasonal drought forecasts continues to pose a major challenge for scientists, end-users, and the water resources community. Precipitation is the most commonly used variable to assess future drought and water supply outlooks. However, studies have shown that precipitation forecasts at seasonal lead times are highly uncertain, and skill drops off dramatically past one month. Recent research has shown that satellite based evapotranspiration (ET) and land surface model based evaporative demand (Eo) anomalies accurately represent drought at different time scales, often capturing the onset of drought several weeks before precipitation-based drought metrics. Therefore, forecasts of accumulated Eo anomalies could provide additional early warning to water managers and the agricultural community. This study has two main objectives: 1) provide evidence that Eo anomalies can capture historical drought episodes, and 2) evaluate the predictive skill of a physically based Eo and individual forcings. Objective 1 is accomplished by comparing the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) to the satellite energy balance based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), and the United States Drought Monitor. EDDI is derived using physically based Eo estimates from the ASCE Standardized ",

The GBD is home to > 150 million people with a mean population density of more than 1000 people/km2. The fertile soils, abundant water and favorable climate also make the delta one of the most agriculturally diverse and productive areas on Earth. We seek to better understand the coupled natural and anthropogenic dynamics of the delta through a number of cross-disciplinary field studies of the contributing geophysical, biophysical and anthropogenic processes. To provide a synoptic multitemporal perspective for these studies, we use a variety of remotely sensed observations collected over the delta since 1988. In this overview we provide a synthesis of recent results from studies of 4 interrelated processes; river channel migration, coastal erosion and deposition, co-evolution of agriculture and aquaculture, and economic development. In each study we use multi-sensor spatiotemporal analysis of remotely sensed imagery spanning more than 2 decades to observe and quantify a variety of processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales. MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) composites provide 16 day temporal and 250m spatial resolution of the entire delta from 2000 to present. This image time series captures not only agricultural phenology over the entire delta but also the development of aquaculture on the lower delta and interannual fluvial dynamics on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI allow us to represent land cover as continuous fields of soil and sediment substrate, vegetation and dark surfaces (water and shadow) throughout the delta since 1988. Despite its irregular temporal sampling, Landsat’s 30 m pixels better resolve both natural and anthropogenic land cover units and its longer time series extends retrospective analyses back to 1988. More recent sensors like Ikonos, Quickbird, GeoEye and WorldView provide vicarious validation with meter-scale imagery. Annual composites of night-light brightness from the OLS and VIIRS sensors provide a complementary measure of urban growth and economic development back to 1992. The coevolution of these systems are depicted in a series of multitemporal animations spanning the past 2+ decades.",

Its primary objective is to clarify the presence or absence of a mantle plume beneath the Reunion hotspot, which is thought to have first pierced the surface 65 million years ago with the eruption of the Deccan Traps on India.\n RHUM-RUM’s central component is a one-year deployment (Oct 2012 – Nov 2013) of 57 broadband ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and hydrophones on an area of 2000x2000 km2 surrounding the hotspot. All OBS have been successfully recovered. We also have been operating 37 land seismometers on the islands of La Réunion, Mauritius, Rodrigues, southern Seychelles, îles Eparses, and on Madagascar between 2011 and 2014.\n As the data collection stage is drawing to a close, we discuss data yield and quality with respect to RHUM-RUM’s primary purpose (passive seismological imaging through all depth levels of the mantle) and secondary applications (“environmental seismology” in a sparsely instrumented area, e.g., tracking of tropical cyclones). We give an overview of the research questions investigated by the RHUM-RUM group, and present preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Ceres is the largest object in the main asteroid belt of the Solar System, with a diameter of 940 km and accounting for ~1/3 of the total mass of the asteroid belt. The recent unequivocal discovery of water vapor associated with localized sources on Ceres by Herschel Space Telescope confirmed its enrichment in volatiles as suggested by its low density and previous observations and theoretical models. Hence water must have played a significant role in the evolution of Ceres and even affected its current state. Spectral reflectance of Ceres surface reveals the pervasive signature of hydrated minerals and carbonates. The albedo and spectral homogeneity suggest that processes involving liquid-phase activity at the global scale may have occurred in the past. The current evolution models of Ceres indicate that liquid water was present following an early differentiation and drove hydrothermal activity for a few tens of My since its formation. Silicate leaching could lead to the concentration of soluble species in an ocean that could play a role in lowering the freezing temperature of that layer. The likely accretion of low-eutectic species such as ammonia hydrates could have promoted the long-term preservation of a deep liquid layer at the base of an icy shell over extended periods of time (possibly until present).\nThe significance of water on Ceres and its active nature as revealed by Herschel observations not only suggest that Ceres is an object that potentially hides important clues about volatile history in the inner solar system, but also indicate a world of potential astrobiological interest. The Dawn spacecraft is scheduled to arrive at Ceres in March 2015 to perform detailed geological, spectroscopic, compositional, and gravity mapping. In the mean time, we have begun an observing campaign using ground- and space-based facilities covering wavelengths from UV to sub-mm, to fully characterize the nature of water and hydration features detected at Ceres, and to facilitate theoretical studies. We expect our knowledge of the history and current status of water on Ceres to be significantly advanced in the coming years.\nPart of this work was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA.",

            "abstract": "The sedimentary strata of the North Sea Basin (NSB) record the glacial and interglacial history of environmental change in the Northern Hemisphere, and are a proposed location for the engineered storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from power plant and industrial sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These aspects interact in the geomechanical and fluid flow domain, as ice sheet dynamics change the properties of potential seal and reservoir rocks that are the prospective geological storage strata for much of Europe’s captured CO2.\nThe intensification of the global glacial-interglacial cycle at the onset of the Pleistocene (2.5-2.7 Ma) was a critical tipping-point in Earth’s recent climate history. The increased severity of glaciations at the Plio-Pleistocene boundary triggered the first development of large-scale continental ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. The central part of the NSB preserves a unique history of the depositional record spanning at least the last 3 Ma, which also forms the overburden and seal to the underlying CO2 reservoirs. There is good evidence that these ice sheets created strong feedback loops that subsequently affected the evolution of the Quaternary climate system through complex ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere linkages.\nUnderstanding NSB dynamics, including the role of fluids in controlling compaction, cementation, and diagenetic processes in shale-dominated basins, is essential for CO2 storage site characterisation to increase understanding and confidence in secure storage. An increased understanding of the overlying sequence will inform quantitative predictions of the performance of prospective CO2 storage sites in glaciated areas in Europe and worldwide; to include improved resolution of glacial cycles (depositional and chronological framework), characterise pore fluids, flow properties of glacial landforms within the sequence (e.g. tunnel valleys) and the geomechanical effects (quantify compaction, rock stiffness, strength and stress profiles) of advancing and retreating ice on the underlying strata to verify and constrain models of glaciation.\nThis presentation describes current work and introduces a proposal submitted to the Integrated Ocean Discovery Program (852-Pre) by the authors.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how water availability changes on inter-annual to decadal time scales and how it may change in the future under climate change are a key part of understanding future stresses on water and food security. Historic evaluations of water availability on regional to global scales are generally based on large-scale model simulations with their associated uncertainties, in particular for long-term changes. Uncertainties are due to model errors and missing processes, parameter uncertainty, and errors in meteorological forcing data. Recent multi-model inter-comparisons and impact studies have highlighted large differences for past reconstructions, due to different simplifying assumptions in the models or the inclusion of physical processes such as CO2 fertilization. Modeling of direct anthropogenic factors such as water and land management also carry large uncertainties in their physical representation and from lack of socio-economic data. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the impact of uncertainties in the meteorological forcings that underpin these historic simulations. Similarly, future changes in water availability are highly uncertain due to climate model diversity, natural variability and scenario uncertainty, each of which dominates at different time scales. In particular, natural climate variability is expected to dominate any externally forced signal over the next several decades. We present results from multi-land surface model simulations of the historic global availability of water in the context of natural variability (droughts) and long-term changes (drying). The simulations take into account the impact of uncertainties in the meteorological forcings and the incorporation of water management in the form of reservoirs and irrigation. The results indicate that model uncertainty is important for short-term drought events, and forcing uncertainty is particularly important for long-term changes, especially uncertainty in precipitation due to reduced gauge density in recent years. We also discuss uncertainties in future projections from these models as driven by bias-corrected and downscaled CMIP5 climate projections, in the context of the balance between climate model robustness and climate model diversity.",

            "abstract": "First-principles calculations1 have suggested that the inner core’s low shear velocity (3.5 km/sec) is a consequence of its temperature being very close to its melting temperature throughout its volume. Near the inner core’s freezing or melting boundary, the shear modulus could possibly approach zero. A test of this is made from observations of the amplitude of PKIIKP waves at antipodal (>175o) ranges. These underside reflections are very sensitive to the S velocity beneath the inner core boundary due to energy subtracted from PKIIKP by converted S energy. This sensitivity is exploited by modeling PKIIKP waveforms observed by a transportable array in Morocco, which recorded many high-quality antipodal waveforms from Tonga. Differences in the in the sampling of the upper inner core between PKIIKP arriving from the short (<180o) and long (>180o) distances make it feasible to investigate lateral differences in the elastic and anelastic states of uppermost inner core from the amplitude and frequency content of the waveforms. In computational experiments, we show that a zero or small shear modulus in the uppermost inner core is the most effective way of matching large amplitude PKIIKP’s observed from antipodal paths from Tonga to Morocco. The correlation of this bright spot in the PKIIKP reflection with a thin zone of low P velocity identified from multi-pathed PKIKP waves sampling a portion of the equatorial eastern hemisphere2suggests that at least this region of the inner core is near its melting temperature. Waveform modeling of PKIKP and PKIIKP from the combined effects of viscoelasticity and forward scattering is performed to determine whether this region of low shear modulus is consistent with freezing or melting.\n1Martorell, B., L.

            "abstract": "The position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has been hypothesized to play a role in linking the climate of the poles and in predicating important changes in ocean overturning, particularly on deglacial timescales. The position of the ITCZ has also been linked to changes in equatorial upwelling strength, marine productivity, terrestrial aridity and even the collapse of civilizations.\nOne method of tracking the paleo-position of the ITCZ is through the quantification of 230Thxs,0-normalized 232Th concentrations in marine sediments which acts as proxy for dust flux. Because the ITCZ is an efficient scavenger of atmospheric particulates, changes in the latitude of maximum dust flux can yield insight into variations in ITCZ position. Previous studies have used this technique to reconstruct the movement of the ITCZ during the last deglaciation at low resolution, but no studies have attempted to resolve the movement of the ITCZ during Termination II (Marine Isotope Stage 6-5) or during the ensuing glacial inception (MIS 5-4). Termination II is a time interval of particular interest because of its potential to yield information about the similarities of deglacial transitions despite different orbital configurations.\nWe present high-resolution (sub millennial) proxy records of dust flux, marine productivity and thermocline upwelling from 150-60 kyr at two sites in the central equatorial Pacific (cruise MGL-1208). These records provide the first evidence of an abrupt climatic shift during the deglaciation with timing similar to that of Heinrich Event 11 (H11). We evaluate the interpretation of this event both as a northern hemisphere increase in aeolian dust abundance concomitant with H11, and as a signature of an ITCZ shift during the deglaciation. We compare our data sets to existing records of the last deglaciation and infer large-scale similarities between Terminations I and II.",

Electromagnetic waves with these frequencies can form a standing pattern inside the spherical cavity formed by the surface of the earth and the ionosphere. In the experiment the ELF waves were excited by heating the ionosphere with X-mode HF electromagnetic waves generated by the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) facility in Alaska. The experiment demonstrates that heating of the ionosphere can excite relatively large-amplitude electromagnetic waves with frequencies in the range of the Schumann resonance, when the ionosphere has a strong F-layer and an electric field greater than 5 mV/m is present in the E-region.",

Most of the flow occurs during the summer monsoon causing widespread flooding. The impounded water represents a large surface load that is the second largest seasonal anomaly registered in the GRACE gravity field. Continuous GPS stations in Bangladesh record seasonal vertical motions up to 6 cm due to the monsoonal water load. We have used GRACE water mass estimates and surface water monitoring to calculate the seasonal load together with GPS observations of seasonal deformation due to this load in order to invert for lithospheric properties.\nTo estimate the water load in Bangladesh, we use >300 daily river gage measurements of water level and >1200 weekly groundwater level measurements from wells for the period 2003-2010. The total impounded water mass is partitioned between surface water and groundwater by using the SRTM DEM. The seasonal water loads calculated from the surface data and are in excellent agreement with GRACE estimates and are used to validate them. They show that seasonally ~100GT of water are stored in Bangladesh (7.5% of annual discharge), but can reach 150GT during extreme events. To calculate the water loads beyond Bangladesh, we project GRACE solutions using mascons to estimate the water mass in irregular blocks that represent the major areas of flooding and groundwater storage in the surrounding regions. These water loads cause elastic deformation with a large lateral extent. Therefore, deformation from these water loads are now calculated on a spherical earth in order to estimate deflections at 18 continuous GPS sites distributed throughout Bangladesh. The region of study and the GPS stations span different tectonic regions from the strong Indian craton to the weak, deep Bengal Basin. We vary Young’s modulus (E) and hence the strength of the lithosphere across these regions to estimate values of E corresponding to the different tectonic regions.",

There has been a precipitous decrease in particles accelerated in the heliosphere, and a substantial increase in galactic cosmic rays, suggesting easy escape of the former across the heliopause, and entry of the latter. The question is, has V1 actually crossed the heliopause and is it now in the interstellar medium? Here the evidence is inconclusive. The direction of the magnetic field observed by V1 is unchanged from the direction of the heliosheath magnetic field, and is in a substantially different direction from the expected direction of the interstellar magnetic field. However, observations of plasma oscillations and thus of the plasma electron density argue that the densities are comparable to the densities expected in the interstellar medium. In this talk we present a model for the nose region of the heliosheath in which the high plasma densities are due to compressed solar wind and not interstellar gas, and thus both the observed magnetic field direction and the observed plasma density indicate that V1 remains in the heliosheath. The model has a simple test: we predict that V1 will encounter the heliospheric current sheet that marks the polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field before the end of 2015.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a significant driver of energetic particle\nevents both within the heliosphere and the broader astrophysical\nenvironment. How magnetic energy at the largest spatial scales of a\nsystem is dissipated on the Alfvenic time-scales seen in observations,\nhowever, remains an unsolved problem. In large-scale systems do\nparticles gain energy at a single reconnection site or at multiple\nsites? What role does reconnection play in the dissipation of\nturbulence at the smallest spatial scales? Answering such questions\nrequires a fundamental understanding of how the conversion of magnetic\nto particle energy takes place. For collisionless systems where the\nparticles are magnetized there are three basic mechanisms for particle\nenergy gain: motion along parallel electric fields; and the magnetic\ncurvature and gradient B drifts along perpendicular fields. The latter\ntwo produce the classical Fermi and betatron acceleration,\nrespectively. Observations in the magnetosphere and solar wind have\nclearly established that most of the direct energy release during\nreconnection takes place in the large-scale exhaust and not in the\nmore localized diffusion region. Ion bulk flow and the\ncounterstreaming ions that develop as a result of Fermi reflection\ncarry most of the released energy. Thus, unlike in a classical fluid,\nenergy dissipation does not take place at small spatial scales. The\nobservational evidence on the physics of electron heating is not\nclear. Parallel electric fields are difficult to measure either\nbecause they are very weak or because they are highly localized,\nelectron holes and double layers being the exception. Particle-in-cell\nsimulations of reconnection suggest that electron energy gain is\ndominated by Fermi reflection except possibly in the large guide field\nlimit where parallel electric fields are important. Extensions of the\nParker transport model to describe reconnection-driven particle\nacceleration will be discussed as will the role of the upcoming MMS\nmission in sorting out electron acceleration.",

The largest scientific organization – the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) – has taken a clear position on this issue reporting “…the growing ability of scientists to make accurate predictions about natural phenomena provides convincing evidence that we are really gaining in our understanding of how the world works.” The term 'accurate' implicitly recalls the importance of model/hypothesis testing as further emphasized in the same AAAS document: “A hypothesis that cannot in principle be put to test of evidence may be interesting but it is not scientifically useful.” This talk explores these themes in a seismological context, in particular we review and discuss the earthquake predictability of foreshocks, defined in a generic sense as the seismic activity that precedes a large earthquake. Paraphrasing Donald Rumsfeld, we show what we know about foreshocks, what we know we don't know, and how to reveal possible unknown unknowns. We explore in detail an ideal (recursive) pathway to search for foreshocks that consists of: i) a collection of observations and the build of conceptual models, ii) the formulation of testable hypothesis, and iii) a prospective testing of the hypothesis with independent data. The vast literature on this issue shows that scientists are usually mostly concerned on the first of these points, but, as reminded by AAAS, all of them are necessary to make real scientific progresses on this field.",

            "abstract": "The seafloor can exert a significant control on Arctic sea ice patterns by guiding the distribution of ocean water masses and river discharge in the Arctic Ocean. Satellite observations of sea ice and surface temperature are used together with bathymetry data to understand dynamic and thermodynamic processes of sea ice. In particular, data from satellite radars, including scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments, are used to identify and map sea ice with different spatial and temporal resolutions across the Arctic. Data from a satellite spectroradiometer, such as MODIS, are used to accurately measure surface temperature under clear sky conditions. For seafloor measurements, advances have been made with new observations surveyed to modern standards in different regions of the Arctic, enabling the production of an improved bathymetry dataset, such as the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean Version 3.0 (IBCAO 3.0) released in 2012. The joint analyses of these datasets reveal that the seafloor can govern warm- and cold-water distribution and thereby dictate sea ice patterns on the sea surface from small local scales to a large regional scale extending over thousands of km. Satellite results show that warm river waters can intrude into the Arctic Ocean and affect sea ice melt hundreds of km away from the river mouths. The Arctic rivers bring significant heat as their waters come from sources across vast watersheds influenced by warm continental climate effects in summertime. In the case of the Mackenzie River, results from the analysis with the new IBCAO 3.0 indicated that the formation and break-up of landfast sea ice is related to the depth and not the slope of the seafloor. In turn, such ice processes can impact the discharge and distribution of warm river waters and influence the melting of sea ice. Animations of satellite observations of sea ice overlaid on both the old and new versions of IBCAO will be presented to illustrate science advances enabled by the new IBCAO 3.0. Furthermore, a new coastline derived from high-resolution SAR data shows accurate mapping of coastal characteristics including small islands and river mouths. The new coastline can provide more details to investigate sea ice processes in the littoral zones, and also help improve future bathymetry and topography datasets.",

            "abstract": "The mantle tranisition zone (TZ) is defined by discontinuities in seismic wave velocities at 410 and 660 km depth, and is thought to play an important role in governing thermo-chemical transport between the upper and lower mantle, in addition to the dynamic evolution of the planet. Furthermore, it has long been at the center of debate between whole-mantle and multi-layered convection models. Although not so well resolved in early tomographic models, improvements in imaging methods and availability of high-quality seismic data have provided increasingly detailed images capable of capturing TZ structure. The variations in isotropic velocity and presence of anisotropy can be used to infer constraints on the thermal and chemical nature of the TZ, and ongoing deformation and transport. For anisotropy in particular, its detection in the deep upper mantle and TZ has remained elusive, with few global models showing significant azimuthal anisotropy at these depths.\nWe utilize automated, multimode waveform inversion to extract structural information from surface, S, and multiple-S waveforms, resulting in a dataset of more than 3/4 of a million successful vertical-component fits. Using a more precise regularization of anisotropy, tuned to honour the amplitude and orientation of anisotropic terms uniformly, we have generated two new models with improved TZ sensitivity to variations in isotropic heterogeneity (SL2013sv), and the detection of azimuthal anisotropy (SL2013svA). For instance high-velocity isotropic anomalies associated with subducted Tethyan lithosphere are detected beneath Eurasia, as well as subducted high-velocity oceanic lithosphere beneath North America. We quantify the requirement for TZ anisotropy through analysis of SL2013svA. Finally we also compare our recent tomography models with other global models (both isotropic and anisotropic), and discuss the implications of their similarities and differences on mantle transition zone properties.",

A warmer climate has potential for a series of positive economic effects, such as development of maritime transportation, enhanced agricultural production and decrease in energy consumption. However, these potential benefits may be outwaited by negative impacts related to transportation accessibility and stability of existing infrastructure, especially in permafrost regions. Compared with the Arctic zones of other countries, the Russian Arctic is characterized by higher population, greater industrial development and urbanization. Arctic urban areas and associated industrial sites are the location of some of intense interaction between man and nature. However, while there is considerable research on various aspects of Arctic climate change impacts on human society, few address effects on Arctic cities and their related industries. This presentation overviews potential climate-change impacts on Russian urban environments in the Arctic and discusses methodology for addressing complex interactions between climatic, permafrost and socio-economic systems at the range of geographical scales. We also provide a geographic assessment of selected positive and negative climate change impacts affecting several diverse Russian Arctic cities.",

Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSI) analysis of interferograms was performed using the StaMPS software package resulting in approximately 2 million PSI points with their associated line-of-sight velocities and time series. These data outline several zones of anthropogenic motion likely due to groundwater usage and oil extraction. We identify two instances of highly localized subsidence due to oil extraction: one of up to 6 mm/yr across a 3x5 km wide oval-shaped zone along the Ventura Ave anticline and another of up to 12 mm/yr across a 3x15 km region near Maricopa. Both of these features are observed in regions of known oil extraction, and the subsidence zones parallel the local fold axes, suggesting that these observed features are real and not merely a product of noise. We also observe several features potentially related to groundwater extraction. The groundwater-related signals tend to be less localized than the oil extraction signals and typically are centered around urban or agricultural areas. The PSI data show a broad zone of subsidence in the greater Oxnard region (10 mm/yr maximum), and more localized zones of subsidence centered in the cities of Carpenteria (4 mm/yr), Ojai (4 mm/yr), and Santa Clarita (5 mm/yr). Several additional regions of potentially anthropogenic motion are also present in the PSI data to which the root cause is unclear. For example, we observe localized uplift of 5 mm/yr centered in the Stevenson Ranch housing development, 8 mm/yr of subsidence centered about 5 km NW of Moorpark near a large agricultural nursery, and a potentially tectonic broad pattern of 4 mm/yr of uplift in the mountains of Los Padres National Forest near Frasier Mountain.",

            "abstract": "Accounting for the value of ecosystem services is difficult for several reasons: we need to understand and model the behavior of humans, and how they respond to changes in policies, we need to quantify the changes in material fluxes or ecological responses resulting from their behavior, and finally we need to monetize the value of those material fluxes. Since coupled human-natural systems are highly idiosyncratic, integrated modeling can be challenging because it is not easy to transfer results from one system to another. Moreover, modeling changes in multiple ecosystem services often requires the simultaneous coordination of several biophysical models. In a non-static world, climate change models are also often necessary to identify future challenges and opportunities for better policy-making.\nWe will discuss results from an integrated modeling perspective for the Raccoon River watershed in central Iowa. The watershed is in the heart of the Corn Belt, and it is under very intensive agricultural production which results in nitrate levels so high that a Total Maximum Daily Load has been put in place. The Des Moines Water Works that provides water to Iowa’s capital either from the Raccoon or the Des Moines River has had to build several layers of treatment to ensure the water is safe to drink.\nWe will present results from the integration of an agent-based model with a surface water quality model (the Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and an edge of field environmental model (the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate). The integration can simultaneously provide changes in water quality indicators – particularly nitrates, which can be monetized using the avoided cost method – and carbon sequestration – for which monetary values are readily available in the literature. This integrated system is linked to regional climate change models to help assess changes in agricultural productivity and farmers’ behavior in the future.\nWe will discuss the importance of quantifying and monetizing as many services as possible in the context of conservation and agricultural policies that compensate farmers for more environmentally friendly agricultural practices such as the use of no till or the planting of perennial grasses. Monetizing ecosystem services allows for the direct comparison of the costs and benefits of these policies.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing biomes on earth. Research at the Toolik Field Station by the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research project provides a perspective on changes that are impacting the upland tussock tundra region of the North Slope of Alaska, a region that is typical of ~15% of the arctic region. The arctic is responding to a combination of long-term, gradual changes (presses) and short-term, event-driven changes (pulses). The most important press, of course, is the persistent rise in average annual air temperature observed in most places (though not at Toolik). Associated with this increase in SAT is a well-documented increase in shallow permafrost temperature (which is observed around Toolik). Our long-term research shows that this trend will favor taller and more productive shrub and grass vegetation. Higher SAT translates to earlier spring breakup and later onset of winter. This change in seasonality is affecting interactions between shrub leaf-out, insect emergence, and bird nesting. Persistent and more frequent droughts are having important impacts on the ability of Arctic grayling – the top consumer is most upland tundra streams – to survive and has the potential to block their ability to migrate to essential overwintering lakes. The interaction between temperature (which is changing) and light (which is not) creates a “seasonal asynchrony” that may be increasing the loading of nutrients – notably nitrate – to upland tundra streams late in the season, with impacts that we do not fully understand yet. The upland tundra environment is also responding to an increasing frequency of pulses, most notably wildfires and the development of thermo-erosional failures (TEFs). Wildfires transfer large quantities of carbon and nitrogen directly to the atmosphere. TEFs may deliver large quantities of sediment and nutrients to streams and lakes. Currently these pulse disturbances seem to be having only limited, local impacts. However, as shallow permafrost in the arctic region approaches the 0ºC tipping point, the combination of presses and pulses may radically and rapidly alter upland tundra terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These changes will almost certainly occur more rapidly than would be the case if the region were influenced by the press of warming temperature alone.",

            "abstract": "Meridional circulations play a crucial role in mediating the angular momentum transport within stellar convection zones and, likely, in determining the nature and timing of their dynamos. The length of the solar cycle, for instance, is thought to depend intimately on the transport of magnetic fields by the meridional circulations in the convection zone. We present a series of 3-D nonlinear simulations of solar-like convection, carried out using the Anelastic Spherical Harmonic (ASH) code that are designed to provide insight into those processes responsible for driving and shaping the meridional circulations established within stellar convection zones. These 3-D models have been constructed in such a way as to span the transition between regimes of solar-like differential rotation (fast equator, slow poles) and regimes of so-called ``anti-solar'' differential rotation (slow equator, fast poles). Solar-like states of differential rotation are characterized by multiple cells of meridional circulation in depth at low latitudes, whereas anti-solar states of differential rotation are characterized by a single cell of circulation within each hemisphere. We demonstrate that the transition from single-celled to multi-celled meridional circulation profiles in these two different regimes is directly linked to a change in the nature of the convective Reynolds stress. These results suggest that if convection in the Sun is strongly rotationally-constrained, a multi-cellular meridional circulation profile may well be expected. Transitional regimes do exist, however, and we conclude by examining a simulation wherein convection that is only marginally rotationally constrained can drive both mono-cellular meridional circulation and solar-like differential rotation.",

Such measurements are potentially important both as a stepping stone towards the study of more complex organic molecules and, in its own regard, to understand processes controlling the generation, migration and destruction of natural gas. Isotopic clumping on C-C and C-H bonds could be influenced by thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, diffusion or gas mixing. Previous work showed that 13C-D clumping in methane generally reflects equilibrium and provides a measure of formation temperature (Stolper et al 2014a), whereas 13C-13C clumping in ethane is likely most controlled by chemical-kinetic processes and/or inheritance from the isotopic structure of source organic compounds (Clog et al 2014). 13C-D clumping in ethane has the potential to provide a thermometer for its synthesis, as it does for methane. However, the difference in C-H bond dissociation energy for these two compounds may suggest a lower ‘blocking temperature’ for this phenomenon in ethane (the blocking temperature for methane is ≥~250 C in geological conditions). We present analytical techniques to measure both 13C-13C and 13C-D clumping in ethane, using a novel two-instrument technique, including both the Thermo 253-Ultra and the Thermo DFS. In this method, the Ultra is used to measure the relative abundances of combinations nearly isobaric isotopologues: (13C12CH6 + 12C2DH5)/12C2H6 and (13C2H6 + 12C13CDH5)/12C2H6, free of other isobaric interferences like O2. The DFS, a very high resolution single-collector instrument, is then used to measure the ratios of isotopologues of ethane at a single cardinal mass: 12C2DH5/13C12CH6, and 12C13CDH5/13C2H6, with precisions of ~1 permil. Those 4 measurements allow us to calculate the bulk isotopic composition (D and 13C) as well as the abundance of 13C2H6 and 13C12CDH5. We also present progress on the development of software tools to use the data measured with the DFS efficiently.",

            "abstract": "A goal of paleotsunami research is to quantitatively reconstruct wave hydraulics from sediment deposits. Inversion models tend to be based on assumptions about sediment transport and open channel flow that may poorly describe tsunamis. Published hydraulic reconstructions are reasonably consistent with some recent and historical tsunamis, but little flow data exist with which to independently evaluate model accuracies. We conducted controlled flume experiments to measure flow hydraulics, source grain size distributions and deposit characteristics. Scaled tsunamis were created in a 32 m flume by raising a computer-controlled liftgate and releasing ~6 m3 of impounded water. The resulting bore entrained sediment from an upstream “source dune” and deposited it downstream. Bores produced thicker bedload waves in the upstream ~1/3 of the flume, followed by thin suspension-dominated deposits that fined downstream. First, we compare experimental velocities to predictions of TsuSedMod, a previously published inversion model. Assuming a hydraulic roughness for flow over ponded water of Manning’s n=0.025 (consistent with a previously published inundation model), TsuSedMod tended to overpredict flow velocity by a factor of 2 to 3. Model results are fairly sensitive to hydraulic roughness over the experimental parameter space. Second, a previously proposed advection-settling model based on suspended D95 grain sizes is also applied to the experimental data to quantify model uncertainty. At 95% confidence, the model predicted time-averaged flow depths to within nearly a factor of two, and time-averaged flow velocities to within a factor of 1.5. Finally, we find that the advection-settling model tends to more accurately predict depths and velocities for our data if the median grain size (D50) is used, rather than D95. We propose a mechanistic interpretation for why D50 may give more accurate results than D95 when using advection-settling models to infer flow hydraulics from suspension-dominated deposits.",

            "abstract": "Humans have been releasing mercury (Hg) to the environment for millenia through activities such as mining and fuel combustion. The result has been an enrichment of the ocean, atmosphere, and terrestrial ecosystems. Consumption of marine fish contaminated with methylmercury (MeHg) is the primary route of exposure in many populations globally. We present an updated analysis of sources of MeHg exposures in the United States that shows the majority (>70%) is from oceanic fish rather than coastal species. Using a fully coupled biogeochemical box model we also estimate Hg accumulation across major ocean basins and show anthropogenic enrichment is highest in the North Atlantic Ocean and lowest in the deep Pacific Ocean. Our results for contemporary ocean concentrations are consistent with recent data from the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans measured as part of the CLIVAR repeat hydrography program. Our estimates of natural (i.e., pre-anthropogenic) seawater Hg concentrations are lower than suggested by other studies, implying a greater anthropogenic perturbation in the ocean. Our work suggests total accumulation of anthropogenic Hg in the global oceans is greater than recently derived based on anthropogenic CO2. We compare modeled seawater concentrations since 1980 to observations over this period to evaluate evidence for changes in recent decades and then investigate potential impacts of changing global emissions. To do this, we use a range of historical and future anthropogenic Hg emission inventories. Our previous work using the box model indicates burial of Hg at ocean margins is the single largest global sink of anthropogenic Hg. We will discuss how the magnitude and permanence of this sink affects estimates of enrichment and time scales of recovery in all geochemical Hg reservoirs. Governing time scales of response in each ocean basin are diagnosed using eigenanalysis and discussed in the context of changes in human MeHg exposure resulting from regulation of human Hg sources.",

            "abstract": "The bulk of the literature on floods relates to the computation of the flood frequency curve, which is based on the annual maximum or threshold exceedance characteristics of flows at a site. Practically, the duration of a flood may be just as important for response and recovery, and the volume of the flood for determining the adequacy of storage for flood control. Where many assets are at risk, either for property owners, or for a supply chain, or for an insurance portfolio, the coincidence of floods in certain areas may be of greatest interest. A trivial calculation shows us that as the number of assets considered increases, the probability of exceedance of multiple assets being flooded increases. Given climate variations such as ENSO that have impacts across the globe, global portfolio risk may be substantially higher than indicated by an analysis that does not conisder such spatial variability. Of course many assets are located in the same river basin and their correlated risk for flooding is well recognized but rarely modeled.\nToday, as we consider resilience and other performance metrics for infrastrucutre systems, the correlation of flood risk in terms of peak, volume and duration, in space and in time needs to be considered. In this talk, I will present some evidence of the importance of this risk, and propose a hierarchical framework for the analysis of flood risk in a changing climate from this perspective.",

            "abstract": "The rhizosphere is a hotbed of nutrient cycling fueled by carbon from plants and controlled by microbes. Plants also strongly affect the rhizosphere by driving water flow into and out of roots, and by oxygenating saturated soil and sediment. Location and dynamics of plant-spurred microbial growth and activities are impossible to discern with destructive soil assays mixing microbe-scale soil microenvironments in a single”snap-shot” sample. Yet data are needed to inform (and validate) models describing microbial activity and biogeochemistry in the ebb and flow of the dynamic rhizosphere.\nDynamics and localization of rapid microbial growth in the rhizosphere can be assessed over time using living soil microbiosensors. We used the bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as host to plasmid pZKH2 containing a fusion between the strong constituitive promoter nptII and luxCDABE(genes coding for light production). High light production by KT2440/pZKH2 correlated with rapid microbial growth supported by high carbon availability. Biosensors were used in clear-sided microcosms filled with non-sterile soil in which corn, black poplar or tomato were growing. KT2440/pZKH2 revealed that root tips are not necessarily the only, or even the dominant, hotspots for rhizosphere microbial growth, and carbon availability is highly variable in space and time around roots.\nRoots can also be sources of oxygen (O2) to the rhizosphere in saturated soil. We quantified spatial distributions of O2 using planar optodes placed against the face of sediment blocks cut from vegetated salt marsh at Plum Island Ecosystems LTER. Integrated over time, Spartina alterniflora roots were O2 sources to the rhizosphere. However, “sun-up” (light on) did not uniformly enhance rhizosphere O2 concentrations (as stomata opened and O2 production commenced). In some regions, the balance of O2 supply (from roots) and O2 demand (root and microbial) tipped toward demand at sun-up (repeatedly, over days). We speculate that in these regions, carbon produced during photosynthesis was released from roots and stimulated microbial O2 demand in the light. In situ, such dynamics in O2 and carbon availability around plant roots will influence interlinked sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon cycling in salt marsh rhizosphere.",

We found that all lakes were net sources of atmospheric CH4 and CO2 but that the climate warming impact of lake CH4 emissions was two times higher than that of CO2. Ebullition and Diffusion were the dominant modes of CH4 and CO2 emissions respectively. Geographically, CH4 emissions from stratified, dystrophic interior Alaska thermokarst (thaw) lakes formed in icy, organic-rich yedoma permafrost soils were 6-fold higher than from non-yedoma lakes near Toolik Field Station and the rest of Alaska. Total CH4 emission was correlated with soil carbon stocks adjacent to lakes, concentrations of phosphate and total nitrogen in lake water, Secchi depth and lake area, with yedoma lakes having higher carbon stocks and nutrient concentrations, shallower Secchi depth, and smaller lake areas. Our findings suggest that permafrost type plays important roles in determining CH4 emissions from lakes by both supplying organic matter to methanogenesis directly from thawing permafrost and by enhancing nutrient availability to primary production, which can also fuel decomposition and methanogenesis.",

            "abstract": "On 22 March 2014 a large, rapidly moving landslide impacted the community of Steelhead Haven, near Oso, Washington, killing 43 people. The slide displaced about 8 million m3 of sand and silt from a 200-m high glacial terrace destroying 40 homes and burying more than 1.0 km of State Route 530. The landslide temporarily dammed the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River flooding an area of about 1.4 km2. The unusually long travel distance, in excess of 700 m from the base of the slope, and apparent speed of the slide led to the great loss of life and destruction. Landslide science was critical in supporting the response to the disaster. Landslide monitoring, process understanding, pre- and post-event high-resolution digital topography, and numerical simulations were used to advise search operations. Recognizing that buildings and their contents were swept tens to hundreds of meters from their original locations, maps of deposit thickness, and estimates of landslide trajectories were used to develop safer and more efficient search strategies. Teams of county, state, and federal scientists, engineers, and specialists were formed to assess the stability of the landslide dam and to monitor stream flow and the level of the lake impounded by the slide, and to assess the geomorphic response of the river to the landslide for gauging future effects on flood hazards and aquatic ecosystems. Another scientific team assessed the threat of additional landslide activity to search operations. This team’s activities included establishing a communications protocol among landslide watch officers and search operations, deploying instrument platforms developed for use on volcanoes (Spiders) to remotely detect ground movement by means of GPS technology and to detect vibrations indicative of landslide movement using seismometers. The team was responsible for monitoring and integrating data from the Spiders and other instruments and making determinations with regards to the potential for additional landsliding during daylight hours, 7 days a week, until the conclusion of active search operations on 28 April 2014. Landslide understanding, data collected prior to and during the response, and modeling results were critical for informing search operations, decision makers, and the community.",

            "abstract": "Deforestation in the tropics causes important changes in the energy and water balance because pasturelands and croplands generally have a higher albedo and decreased water demand, evapotranspiration, and atmospheric turbulence compared to the forests they replace. These changes to the water and energy balance work at a variety of time and space scales and the combined influences on regional hydrology are complex. Field observations, satellite data products and a suite of numerical ecosystem models have been used to document and understand changes to the energy and water balances at micro (<1 km2), meso (100s km2) and large (10,000 km2) spatial scales in the southeastern Amazon. The results show that at regional scales deforestation has decreased net radiation and evapotranspiration and increased surface temperature, sensible heat flux, soil moisture, stream flow and stream temperature. These changes result from the increased albedo, reduced leaf area index, altered phenology, decreased root density and depth, and total water demand of the pasture and crops compared to the native vegetation. Global and meso-scale climate model applications indicate that continued deforestation may significantly reduce regional precipitation because of decreases in the net surface radiation, surface roughness, moisture convergence over the basin, and water recycling. Future changes brought about by deforestation may be of a scale to negatively impact ecosystem services such as hydropower generation and crop productivity.",

            "abstract": "Characteristic differences in delta morphology suggest different balances of wave, tidal, and fluvial processes on different coastlines. These insights have been used to interpret stratigraphic deposits and reconstruct paleogeography of ancient fluvial-deltaic environments. This work is often accomplished through combined efforts to map the architecture of ancient delta deposits and document the abundance and distribution of sedimentary structures that indicate sediment transport by uni- or bi-directional currents or waves. Statistical tools for quantifying sedimentation patterns in ancient deposits provide an opportunity to directly compare architectural patterns among ancient delta deposits. In order to evaluate the degree to which interpreted influence of waves or tides is manifested as a change in delta architecture, we compare detailed stratigraphic measurements from ancient deposits. Well-studied Cretaceous deltaic deposits in the Western Interior Seaway (USA), including the Ferron and Sego formations, have been interpreted as reflecting wave- and tide-influenced conditions, respectively. Using measurements made in the field and from terrestrial lidar outcrop scans, we compare the compensation index and paleohydraulic reconstructions from distributary channel deposits in order to quantify sedimentary architecture in each unit. Preliminary results suggest that the scaling and architecture of topset, foreset, and prodelta deposits in each of these units may have been broadly similar, despite distinct differences in the abundance of wave- and tidal-indicators present within each unit. This indicates that the presence of traditionally diagnostic deposits, particularly sedimentary structures indicative of fluvial, tidal, or wave processes, may not accurately reflect the balance of these processes acting on paleo-shorelines.",

            "abstract": "The richness of the deep-time record and its potential for revealing important characteristics of ancient fluvial landscapes has been demonstrated time and again, including compelling examples of rivers altering their behavior in response to changes in vegetation patterns or abrupt shifts in water and sediment discharge. At present, reconstructions of ancient river and floodplain dynamics are commonly qualitative, and when quantitative metrics are used, it is often for comparison among ancient deposits. Without being able to reconstruct, more comprehensively, important aspects of ancient river and floodplains dynamics, this information has only anecdotal relevance for evaluating and managing present-day landscapes. While methods for reconstructing hydrodynamic and morphodynamic aspects of ancient rivers and floodplains are useful, uncertainties associated with these snapshots complicate the ability to translate observations from geologic to engineering scales, thereby limiting the utility of insight from Earth’s past in decision-making and development of sustainable landscape-management practices for modern fluvial landscapes. Here, we explore the degree to which paleomorphodynamic reconstructions from ancient channel and floodplain deposits can be used to make specific, quantitative inferences about ancient river dynamics. We compare a suite of paleoenvironmental measurements from a variety of ancient fluvial deposits (including reconstructions of paleoflow depth, paleoslope, paleo-channel mobility, the caliber of paleo-sediment load, and paleo-floodplain heterogeneity) in an effort to evaluate sampling and empirical uncertainties associated with these methods and identify promising avenues for developing more detailed landscape reconstructions. This work is aimed at helping to develop strategies for extracting practicable information from the stratigraphic record that is relevant for sustainably managing and predicting changes in today’s environments.",

            "abstract": "The specific rheology of the lithosphere that allows the existence of plate tectonics on Earth is poorly understood. This rheology must explain why plate tectonics initiated on Earth but not on Venus, which has very similar size and gravity, but also how changes in plate motion can occur on time scales more rapid than that of the deeper convection (~100 myrs). We suggest that a key ingredient of this rheology is the coupling of the grain size evolution of the polycrystalline rocks that constitute the mantle, with the flow. We demonstrate this process using a grain evolution and damage mechanism (Bercovici and Ricard, 2012) with a composite rheology, which are compatible with field and laboratory observations. Our model predicts that the grain size is controlled by an dynamic equilibrium where deformation tends to reduce the grain sizes which otherwise would spontaneously increase. The presence of secondary phases is crucial as it eases the grain size reduction and inhibits their too fast recoveries. The resulting time-dependent rheology is non-linear, leads to localisation on time scales much shorter than those of the typical transit time of mantle convection but has also a long healing time. These characteristics of fast damage and long term memory is shown in simple models to spontaneously generate plates on a planet with Earth's parameters. For Venus hotter surface conditions, accumulation and inheritance of damage is negligible; hence only subduction zones survive and plate tectonics does not spread. This rheology also explains how subducting slabs can be rapidly detached when a buoyant crust is drawn into subduction and therefore how rapid plate changes can occur.",

This is a central focus of GEWEX over the next 10 years in addressing a very important yet tractable problem. The anticipated ways forward include the exploitation of improved data sets of precipitation (especially from the Global Precipitation Measurement mission), soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and related variables such as water storage and sea surface salinity expected in the coming five years. Closure of the surface energy budget globally remains a major issue, with the main tradeoffs being between radiation and evapotranspiration latent heating. The broad 22% spread in CMIP5 models in the latter from 76 to 92 W m-2 versus a new observed estimate of 79 W m-2 undermines confidence in projections. Continental scale water budgets that are forced to reconcile all fields provide examples of ways forward. The advanced datasets and analyses should improve our ability to close the water budget over land and thus provide improved information for products related to water availability and quality for decision makers and for initializing climate predictions from seasons to years ahead.",

            "abstract": "Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry has great potential for solving long-standing questions in paleoceanography as it provides temperature estimates that are independent from assumptions regarding the isotopic or elemental composition of seawater. However, the application to foraminifera, which would allow reconstructing surface and deep-sea temperatures through the Cenozoic and beyond, is currently hampered by the relatively large sample amount requirements. Normally, several aliquots of 3-10 mg carbonate are needed to arrive at a precision of around 2 °C.\nAt ETH we have worked towards decreasing the sample requirements by employing the Kiel carbonate preparation device. The Kiel system improves the gas use efficiency and allows balancing sample amount and precision for each sample due to the fact that multiple small aliquots are analyzed. Per measurement we normally use 8-10 aliquots of 150-200 µg carbonate each. With three such measurements (i.e., 4.5-6 mg carbonate) we typically arrive at a precision of around 2 °C (Meckler et al., RCM, 2014), and better precision can be achieved with an increased number of replicates.\nWe are currently testing ways to reduce sample size and/or increase gas use efficiency further. Recent tests have shown that the size of individual aliquots can be reduced to 100 µg, suggesting that useful temperature estimates (± 2 °C) can be derived with as little as 2.5 mg carbonate.\nUncertainties still exist in the temperature calibration of the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer, which seem at least in part to be associated with differences in the methodology applied by different laboratories. We have therefore derived calibrations for the Kiel method based on synthetic and natural calcites. Current and planned applications of the improved Kiel clumped isotope method to paleoceanography focus on long-term trends and major events during the Cenozoic.",

We accept 4D-space vortex treatise: a double helix spiral, two spirals creating a standing wave, stationary state oscillation. Now one can stress attention on seismonomy treatise of seismoids' dynamics manifestation in the realm of solid media: stochastic emergence of indestructible oscillating units through their life-span; its five postulates with insight into Universal Coherentism, the Doctrine of Dynamics Monism. Seismoid is a unitary entity which can not contain the same fractal level seismoids as its structural parts. Energy exchange between seismoids can be called Machian-energy quanta radiation. Obviously the basic vortex unit in essence is a seismoid, also possessing electromagnetic attributes. Evidently, the universe is a fractal! Beginning by first stratum with its master unit and subordinate units, which are rotating and revolving around it. This pattern is progressively replicated top-down in varying forms on each hierarchical stratum till Planck's scale. Thus, the whole, holistic unit oscillation is the master control over its subordinates and constitutes segregated space-time of the stratum, but in turn it is an element in a greater whole. Contemplating on outermost stratum, its master entity limits further ascension, and can not be a subordinate, one can assume that the entire universe is encapsulated into this superior entity which is devoid of space-time of its own.

The most-trusted approach to compute Green's functions, especially in areas of low-seismicity where high-resolution velocity models are not available, is through waveform modeling of regional earthquakes to produce a 1D velocity model. However, the 1D velocity model assumption is the greatest source of error in the moment tensor solution and has never been thoroughly investigated for source-type discrimination. We propose to determine the effect of a 1D velocity model assumption as a function of data quality, passband, and sensor configuration through a synthetic study, as well as through application to Western US events where we have well-calibrated moment tensor solutions. In the synthetic study we will produce waveforms with the effects of 3D velocity heterogeneity. The effect of the 1D velocity model assumption can then be interpreted via the difference between input and inverted solutions. By varying the heterogeneity strength, passband, signal-to-noise, and station configuration, we can derive error covariance matrices for various recording configurations. These matrices can then be used to calculate moment-tensor-derived confidence for use in discriminant analysis",

The NDMC is a national center founded in 1995 and located at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The NDMC conducts basic and applied research, provides a variety of services and produces decision support applications. In addition, the NDMC is involved heavily in education, outreach and planning activities and maintains a number of operational drought-related tools and products including the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), Drought Impact Reporter (DIR), Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI) and the Drought Risk Atlas (DRA).\nThe NDMC’s recently launched Drought Risk Atlas (DRA) (http://droughtatlas.unl.edu) and the continually evolving U.S. Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu;) will be the focus of this presentation. The DRA was launched in 2014 in order to help better answer the common questions of “How does this drought compare to the Dust Bowl years or some other regional drought of record?”, or “How often do we see a drought as severe as this?”, and “Are we seeing trends in drought frequency?”. Access to new digital data sources, geospatial tools and analyses, and dissemination through a web-based interface has allowed us to triple the original National Drought Atlas station sample size and roughly double the period of record in standing up the new DRA. Building off of feedback from the user community, the SPI, SPEI, PDSI, self-calibrated PDSI, Deciles and other climatology (to also include hydrology) products are included. It is anticipated that this tool will heighten awareness and enhance decision support activities with regards to drought risk for policy makers, resource managers, producers, planners, media and the public. Examples of the DRA’s data, maps and visualization tools built into the freely accessible web interface will be discussed. In addition, a brief history of the USDM will also be given as an overview to the process along with a look back at its growth and applications to date, including other regions of the globe.",

            "abstract": "Rapid developments in computing resources have allowed for cloud resolving model (CRM) simulations to be conducted over larger domains at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. Indeed, global CRMs are now a reality. Within such modeling frameworks, microphysical processes cannot be isolated from the vertical velocity that drives them, from the impact of energy exchanges due to phase changes, nor from the precipitation they produce, as has historically been the case with more highly parameterized frameworks. The increasing utilization of such high resolution, large-domain CRMs therefore introduces a new set of observational challenges. Instead of only taking into account global distributions of clouds and precipitation, observational strategies now need to be adapted to focus on the actual microphysical processes and feedbacks that are responsible for such cloud and precipitation distributions. Incorrectly representing such processes and feedbacks has significant implications for precipitation rates, efficiency and partitioning; the horizontal and vertical distribution of clouds; anvil ice properties; the partitioning between the liquid water and ice phase; and the location and amount of latent energy release associated with phase changes, all of which have subsequent implications for the global energy and water budget.\nNumerous microphysical and dynamical processes, and the feedbacks between them, are not well represented in CRMs. However, correctly simulating the magnitude of vertical velocity, as well as various ice processes appear to be particularly challenging. This talk will focus on the range of precipitation and cloud responses obtained within CRM simulations due to changes in the manner various ice processes are represented including melting, riming and shedding. Those parameters causing the greatest simulated cloud and precipitation responses will be identified. Factors impacting the representation of vertical velocity will also be addressed. Finally, suggestions will be made regarding those processes that should form the focus of future satellite missions if significant improvements are to be made in representing such processes in regional and global CRMs.",

            "abstract": "Incorporating new genetic quantification measurements into traditional substrate pool models represents a substantial challenge. These decomposition models are built around the idea that substrate availablity, with environmental drivers, limit carbon dioxide respiration rates. In this paradigm, microbial communities optimally adapt to a given substrate and environment on much shorter time scales then the carbon flux of interest. By characterizing the relative shift in biomass of these microbial communities, we informed previously poorly constrained parameters in traditional decomposition models.\nIn this study we coupled a 9 month laboratory incubation study with quantitative gene measurements with traditional CO2 flux measurements plus initial soil organic carbon quantification. GeoChip 5.0 was used to quantify the functional genes associated with carbon cycling at 2 weeks, 3 months and 9 months. We then combined the genes which ‘collapsed’ over the experiment and assumed that this tracked the relative change in the biomass associated with the ‘fast’ pool. We further assumed that this biomass was proportional to the ‘fast’ SOC pool and thus were able to constrain the relative change in the fast SOC pool in our 3-pool decomposition model.\nWe found that biomass quantification described above, combined with traditional CO2 flux and SOC measurements, improve the transfer coefficient estimation in traditional decomposition models. Transfer coefficients are very difficult to characterized using traditional CO2 flux measurements, thus DNA quantification provides new and significant information about the system. Over a 100 year simulation, these new biologically informed parameters resulted in an additional 10% of SOC loss over the traditionally informed parameters.",

            "abstract": "We have a problem that may be a specific example of a generic one. The task is to estimate spatiotemporally distributed estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) in snow-dominated mountain environments, including those that lack on-the-ground measurements. Several independent methods exist, but all are problematic.\nThe remotely sensed date of disappearance of snow from each pixel can be combined with a calculation of melt to reconstruct the accumulated SWE for each day back to the last significant snowfall. Comparison with streamflow measurements in mountain ranges where such data are available shows this method to be accurate, but the big disadvantage is that SWE can only be calculated retroactively after snow disappears, and even then only for areas with little accumulation during the melt season.\nPassive microwave sensors offer real-time global SWE estimates but suffer from several issues, notably signal loss in wet snow or in forests, saturation in deep snow, subpixel variability in the mountains owing to the large (~25 km) pixel size, and SWE overestimation in the presence of large grains such as depth and surface hoar.\nThroughout the winter and spring, snow-covered area can be measured at sub-km spatial resolution with optical sensors, with accuracy and timeliness improved by interpolating and smoothing across multiple days.\nSo the question is, how can we establish the relationship between Reconstruction—available only after the snow goes away—and passive microwave and optical data to accurately estimate SWE during the snow season, when the information can help forecast spring runoff? Linear regression provides one answer, but can modern machine learning techniques (used to persuade people to click on web advertisements) adapt to improve forecasts of floods and droughts in areas where more than one billion people depend on snowmelt for their water resources?",

            "abstract": "NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft has collected more than 3.5 years of X-band radio tracking data in orbit around the planet Mercury. During its one-year primary mission, which started in March 2011, MESSENGER was in an eccentric, near-polar orbit of 12-hour period, and the periapsis altitude was actively maintained between 200 and 500 km. For its extended mission, the orbit period was reduced to 8 hours. As the orbit naturally evolved, in large part due to the third-body gravitational perturbation of the Sun, the periapsis altitude reached a maximum of ~450 km in March 2013 and then began to decrease.\nAn ambitious end of mission was designed to use the remaining fuel to delay impact and to observe the northern hemisphere for nearly a year at periapsis altitudes lower than 200 km, including four intervals of exceptionally low altitude (25–100 km). Periapsis passages are visible from Earth only for two of these intervals, in August and October 2014. These new data, the lowest-altitude radio tracking measurements to be acquired by MESSENGER, prompt an updated solution for the gravity field of Mercury.\nIn preparation for acquisition of the low-altitude (<100 km) data, we have reprocessed tracking data through 14 July 2014. These data already provide good coverage below 200 km over most longitudes. A preliminary gravity solution to degree and order 50 shows stronger gravity anomalies near the periapsis latitudes than in the most recent global solution, HgM005. To best capture the shorter-wavelength signals expected from the lowest-altitude passes, we are estimating a large number of local surface anomalies (arranged on a 1°x1° grid) in addition to a harmonic field.\nWe are also using the resulting gravity anomalies to update crustal thickness models and to explore the implications for gravity anomalies over basins and topographic rises and the modes of compensation of these features.",

            "abstract": "Slightly more than 60% of Massachusetts is covered with forest and this land cover type is invaluable for the protection and maintenance of our natural resources and is a carbon sink for the state. However, Massachusetts is currently experiencing a decline in forested lands, primarily due to the expansion of human development (Thompson et al., 2011). Of particular concern is the loss of “core areas” or the areas within forests that are not influenced by other land cover types. These areas are of significant importance to native flora and fauna, since they generally are not subject to invasion by exotic species and are more resilient to the effects of climate change (Campbell et al., 2009). However, the expansion of development has reduced the amount of this core area, but the exact amount is still unknown. Current methods of estimating core area are not particularly precise, since edge, or the area of the forest that is most influenced by other land cover types, is quite variable and situation dependent. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to devise a new method for identifying areas that could qualify as “edge” within the Harvard Forest, in Petersham MA, using new remote sensing techniques. We sampled along eight transects perpendicular to the edge of an abandoned golf course within the Harvard Forest property. Vegetation inventories as well as Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) at different heights within the canopy were used to determine edge depth. These measurements were then compared with small-footprint waveform aerial LiDAR datasets and imagery to model edge depths within Harvard Forest.",

            "abstract": "Recent investigations reveal an important and previously inconspicuous set of drivers of quiescent thermosphere-ionosphere variability, and confirm that the Earth’s atmosphere behaves as a complex component of the solar-terrestrial system, rather than a series of independent layers. Lower atmospheric drivers produce manifest thermosphere-ionosphere variations that characterize quiescent space weather conditions and underlie any geospace response to solar geomagnetic disturbances.\nDiurnal heating of the Earth’s lower and middle atmosphere through the absorption of solar infrared and ultraviolet radiation, as well as latent heating of evaporation associated with raindrop formation in deep convective tropical clouds, excite a spectrum of global-scale waves known as atmospheric tides. Some of these tides propagate upward, grow exponentially in the increasingly rarified atmosphere, and penetrate geospace. Therein, they impact the electro-dynamo process in the lower thermosphere-ionosphere or directly modulate the diurnal variations generated by in-situ absorption of extreme ultraviolet radiation aloft. The lower atmospheric tidal drivers are in turn affected by meteorological disturbances and carry those impacts into geospace as well. They also evolve from month-to-month and inter-annually, further complicating our ability to fully anticipate their impacts.\nThis presentation traces the evolution in our understanding of the drivers of thermosphere-ionosphere variability, underscores the challenges associated with unraveling the inherent complexity of this coupled subsystem that is also affected by the geomagnetic field, and identifies some unresolved questions for geospace research.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are the world’s largest natural source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. The strong sensitivity of these emissions to environmental factors such as soil temperature and moisture has led to concerns about potential positive feedbacks to climate change. This is particularly true at high latitudes, which have experienced pronounced warming and where thawing permafrost could potentially liberate large amounts of labile carbon over this century. Despite the importance of wetland methane emissions to the global carbon cycle and climate dynamics, global models exhibit little agreement as to the magnitude and spatial distribution of emissions, due to uncertainties in both wetland area and emissions per unit area driven by a scarcity of in situ observations. Recent intensive field campaigns across West Siberia make this an ideal region over which to assess the performance of large-scale process-based wetland models in a high-latitude environment. Here we present the results of a follow-up to the Wetland and Wetland CH4 Model Intercomparison Project focused on the West Siberian Lowland (WETCHIMP-WSL). We assessed 17 models and 5 inversions over this domain in terms of total CH4 emissions, simulated wetland areas, and CH4 fluxes per unit wetland area and compared these results to an intensive in situ CH4 flux dataset, several wetland maps, and two satellite inundation products. Findings include: a) estimates of total CH4 emissions from both models and inversions spanned almost an order of magnitude; b) forward models using inundation alone to estimate wetland areas suffered from severe biases in CH4 emissions; and c) aside from these area-driven biases, disagreement in flux per unit wetland area was the main driver of forward model uncertainty. We examine which forward model approaches are best suited towards simulating high-latitude wetlands and make recommendations for future modeling, remote sensing, and field campaigns to reduce model uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Given the absence of plate tectonics on Venus, the origin of major rift systems like Parga Chasma is unclear. As Venus and Earth have similar radii and radiogenic abundances, we assume they have a similar internal structure and composition. Venus does not appear to have plate tectonics, and its surface displays a range of volcanic and tectonic features, including those that are both similar and dissimilar to those on Earth.\nIn order to understand how Venus loses its heat, we study coronae at Parga Chasma. There are over 500 quasi-circular volcano-tectonic features called coronae on Venus, 131 of which are associated with Parga Chasma. Are these coronae important in the formation of the rift, or vice versa? How do they contribute to planetary heat loss? Coronae are believed to form via small-scale mantle upwellings, lithospheric instability, or a combination thereof. However, the genetic link between the coronae and rifts has remained unclear.\nBy drawing an analogy to the East African Rift, we propose a mechanism for the formation of off-rift coronae due to the rifting process. We model the interaction of a rising mantle plume associated with a rift with a preexisting layer of dense material at the lithosphere-mantle boundary and show that a rift and its associated off-rift coronae may be genetically linked. We calculate the resulting surface topographies, melt volumes, and Bouguer gravity anomalies and find a correlation to observations.",

It has also made it clear that the risks of missing this target would be very dire. But when read through a precautionary lens, it also illustrates potential risks of framing an appropriate climate target as 2°C. We ought to be doing all we can to limit the extent of climate change as much as possible, and framing our target as limiting warming to 2°C may mask the demandingness and urgency of addressing climate change aggressively and holistically.\nIn this session I will summarize my work on what precaution demands in the face of climate change and discuss how it applies to AR5. I argue for a Catastrophic Precautionary Principle that gives us strong moral reasons to take precautionary measures against threats of catastrophe, such as those posed by climate change. I will explain how the IPCC’s discussion of the five reasons for concern about climate change support a strong moral argument that we ought to be taking a much more precautionary approach to climate policy than is currently evidenced by UNFCCC agreements and domestic policies around the world. While AR5 supports the conclusion that we should not risk missing the 2°C target, it also supports reevaluating what our target – and more generally what our comprehensive approach to climate policy – should be. In this way, I will discuss the complex science-ethics-policy nexus and the role of climate science in guiding precautionary global climate policies.",

            "abstract": "During January 2014 Small Unmanned Meteorological Observer (SUMO) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to observe the boundary layer over the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. A total of 41 SUMO flights were completed during a 9-day period with a maximum of 11 flights during a single day. Flights occurred as frequently as every 1.5 hours so that the time evolution of the boundary layer could be documented. On almost all of the flights the boundary layer was well mixed from the surface to a depth of less than 50 m to over 350 m. The depth of the well-mixed layer was observed to both increase and decrease over the course of an individual day suggesting that processes other than entrainment were altering the boundary layer depth. The well-mixed layer was observed to both warm and cool during the field campaign indicating that advective processes as well as surface fluxes were acting to control the temporal evolution of the boundary layer temperature. Only a small number of weakly stably stratified boundary layers were observed. Strong, shallow inversions, of up to 6 K, were observed above the top of the boundary layer. Observations from a 30 m automatic weather station and two temporary automatic weather stations 10 km south and west of the main field campaign location provide additional data for understanding the boundary layer evolution observed by the SUMO UAVs during this 9-day period. This presentation will discuss the observed evolution of the summertime boundary layer as well as comment on lessons learned operating the SUMO UAVs at a remote Antarctic field camp.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in solar observations have led to higher-resolution surface (photosphere) images that reveal bipolar magnetic features operating near the resolution limit during emerging flux events. Further improvements in resolution are expected to reveal even smaller dynamic features. Such photospheric features provide observable indications of what is happening before, during, and after flux emergence, eruptions in the corona, and other phenomena. Visible changes in photospheric active regions also play a major role in predicting eruptions that are responsible for geomagnetic plasma disturbances. We present a new method to extract physical information from photospheric data (e.g., SOLIS Stokes parameters) based on the statistics of pixel-by-pixel variations in spectral (absorption) line quantities such as line profile width, asymmetry, and flatness. Such properties are determined by the last interaction between detected photons and optically thick photospheric plasmas, and may contain extractable information on local plasma properties at sub-pixel scales. Applying the method to photospheric data with high spectral resolution, our pixel-by-pixel analysis is performed for various regions on the solar disk, ranging from quiet-Sun regions to active regions exhibiting eruptions, characterizing photospheric dynamics using spectral profiles. In particular, the method quantitatively characterizes the time profile of changes in spectral properties in photospheric features and provides improved physical constraints on observed quantities.",

            "abstract": "We observed clear concentric waves and short-period oscillations in the ionosphere after the EF5 tornado hit Moore, Oklahoma, USA, on 20 May 2013 using a dense wide-coverage ionospheric total electron content (TEC) observation in North America. These concentric waves were non-dispersive waves with a horizontal wavelength of ~120 km and a period of ~13 minutes. They were observed for more than seven hours throughout North America. TEC oscillations with a period of ~4 minutes were also observed in the south of Moore for more than eight hours. Comparison between the TEC observation and the infrared cloud image from the GOES satellite indicates that the concentric waves were caused by supercells rather than the tornados themselves. Backward ray-tracing analysis suggests that the leaking of atmospheric waves in a thermal duct excited AGWs in the ionosphere. The short-period TEC oscillation could be explained by the acoustic resonance triggered by strong long-lasting supercells. This observational result provides the first clear evidence of a severe meteorological event causing atmospheric waves propagating upward in the upper atmosphere and reaching the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) loss from agricultural fields and delivery to surface waters persists as a water quality impairment issue. For dairy farms, P can be lost from cropland, pastures, barnyards, and open-air cattle lots; and all these sources must be evaluated to determine which ones are a priority for P loss remediation. We used interview surveys to document land use, cattle herd characteristics, and manure management for four grazing-based dairy farms in Wisconsin, USA. We then used the APLE and Snap-Plus models to estimate annual P loss from all areas on these farms and determine their relative contribution to whole-farm P loss. At the whole-farm level, average annual P loss (kg ha-1) from grazing-based dairy farms was low (0.6 to 1.8 kg ha-1), generally because a significant portion of land was in permanently vegetated pastures or hay and had low erosion. However, there were areas on the farms that represented sources of significant P loss. For cropland, the greatest P loss was from areas with exposed soil, typically for corn production, and especially on steeper sloping land. The farm areas with the greatest P loss had concentrated animal housing, including barnyards, and over-wintering and young-stock lots. These areas can represent from about 5% to almost 30% of total farm P loss, depending on lot management and P loss from other land uses. Our project builds on research to show that producer surveys can provide reliable management information to assess whole-farm P loss. It also shows that we can use models like RUSLE2, Snap-Plus, and APLE to rapidly, reliably, and quantitatively estimate P loss in runoff from all areas on a dairy farm and identify areas in greatest need of alternative management to reduce P loss.",

Some are based on purely statistical techniques, others are based on process based methods. Are the resulting models properly representing the main features of real karstic systems?\nIn this talk, we introduce a set of statistical indicators to characterize the geometry and topology of karstic networks. These indicators have been applied on a relatively large set of real karst networks. We then use these measures to compare synthetic karstic networks with their field counter parts. We use a supervised learning algorithm to automatically classify any new simulated network based on its statistical properties. Issues such as incomplete mapping of the karst system or systematic bias due to exploration conditions are discussed. We show that the method is able to estimate objectively how distant the simulated network is from the real karst networks. This distance can then be used as a quality measure of the simulation and may indicate the direction to take in order to improve future simulations.",

            "abstract": "The influences that vertically-propagating tides of lower atmosphere origin have on the dynamics, temperature, composition, and plasma structure of the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system continue to be revealed. Specifically, it is now recognized that dissipating tides exert significant changes in the mean state of the IT system with respect to latitude, season and solar cycle. However, the mechanisms and pathways through which this happens are not fully understood. Therefore, we utilize the National Center for Atmospheric Research Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM), forced with observationally-based tides at the model lower boundary from the Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT, from Oberheide et al. [2011]), to evaluate the different terms in the thermodynamic energy and momentum equations in order to elucidate how tidal dissipation acts to alter the mean thermal and dynamical structure of the IT. Numerical experiments are performed for all months of the year and for solar minimum, medium, and maximum conditions so as to quantify the seasonal and solar cycle variability associated with the different terms in the thermodynamic energy and momentum equations. Implications for more completely understanding prior results from Jones Jr. et al. [2014a, 2014b] concerning tidal effects on the mean neutral composition and electron density distributions are also assessed. Only select highlights of this work will be presented.\n",

A shift from a snow-dominated regime towards a rain-dominated regime is currently assumed to change the seasonal distribution of stream flow, but not to influence the mean stream flow significantly. Contradicting the current paradigm, we argue that mean stream flow is likely to reduce for catchments that experience significant reductions in the fraction of precipitation falling as snow. With more than one-sixth of the Earth’s population depending on melt water for their water supply and ecosystems that can be sensitive to stream flow alterations, the socio-economic consequences of a reduction in stream flow can be substantial.",

As follows from the SAMI2 two-fluid model calculations, their formation time should exceed 5-7 minutes. However, specially designed DMSP-HAARP experiments have shown that artificial ducts and ion outflows appear on the topside within 2 minutes. We describe the results of these observations and present a semi-quantitative explanation of the fast timescale due to suprathermal electrons accelerated by HF-induced plasma turbulence. There are two possible effects of suprathermal electrons: (1) the increase of the ambipolar electric field over the usual thermal ambipolar diffusion and (2) excitation of heat flux-driven plasma instability resulting in an anomalous electron-ion momentum exchange. Both effects result in faster upward ion flows.",

One method compares three adjacent, differently-aligned CSAT3 sonics to each other, using a data analysis technique similar to that of Kochendorfer et al.~(2012). The two 'outside' sonics are upright references while the central, test sonic is oriented with its v-axis vertical, so that fluctuations of wind direction are surrogates for variations in the vertical wind component. The second technique compares CSAT3 measurements to independent velocity measurements with a 3-component Doppler LIDAR. The LIDAR is focused at a distance of 0.8 m in front of the sonic and is thus a flow-distortion-free reference. Here we compare the results of the two techniques to each other, as well as to a transducer-shadowing model for CSAT3 flow distortion. On the basis of these measurements, recommendations are made for correction of CSAT3 flow distortion.",

            "abstract": "The km-deep chaotic terrains of the eastern Valles Marineris region have long been recognized as depositional sinks for eolian and air fall material. Furthermore, many have suggested that groundwater influx into these basins may have contributed to the development of lacustrine environments, basin-floor fluvial systems, and basin-marginal catastrophic outflow channels. However, the lacustrine hypothesis has been challenged by suggestions that the proposed fluvial-lacustrine landforms may have formed by non-aqueous mechanisms (e.g. volcanic) or processes that require low volumes of liquid water (e.g. glacial). In this work, we describe the basin-marginal landscape of eastern Valles Marineris at the junction between Eos Chaos and Aurorae Chaos basins. Using new high resolution topography data (HRSC DTMs), imagery (CTX), and impact crater chronology we identify and describe four catastrophic outflow channels that occur along a 500 km arc that traces the eastern margin of Eos Chaos. The fluvial origin of these channels is evidenced by (1) occurrence of longitudinal grooves that cross-cut Noachian-age (3.8 Ga) highland terrain, (2) multiple bedrock terraces that occur at consistent elevations across each channel, (3) streamlined landforms, (4) inner channels headed by cataracts, and (5) crater size frequency distributions that indicate resurfacing of highland craters (Figure 1). The terraces provide evidence for progressive incision from individual flood events with discharges of ~106 – 108 m3 s-1. The topographically highest terrace in each channel initiates at the same elevation of ~1000 m along the entire basin margin. The lowest terraces and grooved terrains require up to 5 km of total incision, down to a base level of ~4100 m that is set by the downstream floor of Aurorae Chaos. The observations not only require a regional topographic control on flood initiation in all channels, but the existence of a base level that suggests the chaotic terrains pre-date the flood events. This is confirmed by the older crater retention age of the basin floors (3.5 Ga) relative to the outflow channels (3.0 Ga). These combined observations point to the past occurrence of an upstream lake within Eos Chaos, spillover of that lake along its eastern margin, and incision of outflow channels, integrating Eos Chaos with Aurorae Chaos.",

Unfortunately, snow thickness variability and scaling issues at all scales from meters to hundreds of kilometers remain some of the main sources of error for altimetric sea ice thickness retrievals. To address this gap, extensive coincident airborne and in-situ ice and snow measurements were performed as part of the CryoSat Validation Experiment in March and April 2014 (CryoVEx 2014). In-situ ice and snow thickness measurements were performed at four locations representative of various Arctic ice and snow conditions. Two sites were located in first year ice near Barrow, Alaska; one was in the Canadian Beaufort Sea’s thin multiyear ice; and one was in thick multiyear ice situated north of Greenland. All four sites were overflown by a number of aircraft equipped with various ice and snow thickness sensors that captured ice and snow property variations. At our field sites, ice thickness, surface roughness, and snow thickness measurements were performed along 2 km transects. Centered on these transects were 60 m x 400 m intensive snow measurement grids with 5 m x 5 m point spacings and nested 60 m x 100 m grids with 1 m x 1 m point spacings. These snow thickness measurements were acquired to study the two-dimensional variability and to provide information on scales comparable to or exceeding the footprint sizes of airborne snow thickness radars operated by NASA and ESA. Here we present results of these snow and ice thickness measurements to shed light on the large- and small-scale spatial variability of these properties across the Arctic. In addition, we present first results from initial comparisons with the airborne and satellite snow and ice thickness retrievals.",

Habitat change analysis has revealed fragmentation, displacement of high marsh by low marsh species, and ecological drowning, while development of adjacent uplands limits upslope migration. Using inundation experiments, field surveys, and LiDAR datasets, we developed an elevation-productivity relationship for Spartina alterniflora specific to the U.S. Northeast states of New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, southern Massachusetts and located current salt marsh orthometric heights on this curve. We determined that 89% of salt marshes in these Northeastern states are located at elevations where growth is limited by inundation, suggesting links between current salt marsh loss patterns and sea level rise. By manipulating water column nutrients, precipitation, and elevation, we further found that altered precipitation receipt was associated with significant reductions in biomass, and that nutrient enrichment adversely impacts organic matter accumulation and peat formation. These results provide evidence that Northeastern U.S. marshes are vulnerable to the effects of accelerated sea level rise, and that neither precipitation changes, nor cultural eutrophication, will contribute positively to long-term salt marsh survival.

            "abstract": "The search for biosignatures of life on Earth includes measurement of the stable isotope fractionation of reactants and products attributed to enzymatic processes and comparison with the often smaller chemical (abiotic) fractionation. We propose that this approach might be applied to study the origin and fate of organic compounds contained in water vapor plumes emanating from Enceladus or other icy bodies, perhaps revealing information about the potential for biology occurring within a sub-surface “habitable” zone. Methanol and C2-hydrocarbons including ethylene, ethane and acetylene (C2H2) have been identified in the plumes of Enceladus. Biological degradation of acetylene proceeds by anaerobic fermentation via acetylene hydratase through acetaldehyde, with a second enzyme (acetaldehyde dismutase) forming acetate and ethanol. We found that incubation of cultures of acetylene-fermenting bacteria exhibit a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) associated with the net removal of C2H2. Consumption of acetylene by both growing and washed-cell cultures of bacteria closely related to Pelobacter acetylenicus (e.g, strain SFB93) was accompanied by a carbon isotopic fractionation of about 2 per mil (KIE = 1.8-2.7 ‰), a result we are examining with other cultures of acetylene fermenters. In addition, we are measuring the carbon isotopic composition of acetaldehyde, ethanol and acetate during fermentation to learn whether these products are fractionated sufficiently, relative to their substrate, to warrant measurement of their isotopic composition in Enceladus (or Europa) plumes to indicate enzymatic activity in liquid environments below the crust of these moons.",

To address Big Science, there are challenges in understanding the role of data in enabling researchers to attack not just disciplinary issues, but also the system-level, large-scale, and transdisciplinary global scientific challenges facing society.\nRecognizing that the volume of data is only one of many dimensions to be considered, there is a clear need for improved data infrastructures to mediate data and information exchange, which we contend will need to be powered by semantic technologies. One clear need is to provide computational approaches for researchers to discover appropriate data resources, rapidly integrate data collections from heterogeneously resources or multiple data sets, and inter-compare results to allow generation and validation of hypotheses. Another trend is toward automated tools that allow researchers to better find and reuse data that they currently don’t know they need, let alone know how to find. Again semantic technologies will be required. Finally, to turn data analytics from \"art to science\", technical solutions are needed for cross-dataset validation, reproducibility studies on data-driven results, and the concomitant citation of data products allowing recognition for those who curate and share important data resources.",

We also examined whether the nature and strength of flow through the Tsushima Strait (which is strongly affected by EASM precipitation, sea level changes, and EAWM cooling) influenced surface and deepwater conditions of the Japan, Yamato, and Ulleung Basins.\nDuring only six weeks of drilling, Expedition 346 recovered 6135.3 m of core, which established an IODP record for the amount of recovered material. Because of recent advances in drilling technology and newly developed analytical tools, we were able to examine records that were impossible to acquire even a few years ago. The newly engineered half piston core system recovered the deepest piston core in DSDP/ODP/IODP history (490.4 m in Hole U1427A), which was reached by continuous piston coring from the seafloor.\nThese advances delivered new surprises. We recovered pristine dark-light laminae from approximately 8 Ma sediment from 275 m below the seaﬂoor at Site U1425 (Yamato Rise) and from 210 m below the seafloor (10-12 Ma) at Site U1430 in the Ulleung Basin. Aggressive sampling for geochemistry provided important constraints on the diagenetic and chemical environments throughout these marginal seas, and yet did not negatively compromise paleoceanographic objectives. We are extending earlier pioneering results of the Quaternary dark and light layers in these basins and which record variations of EASM precipitation over South China. Drilling in the East China Sea is providing an excellent record of EASM precipitation because its surface water salinity and temperature during summer is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by Yangtze River discharge. Ash records are providing calibrated stratigraphic control and improving understanding of arc history. Interpreting these and other results in the context of other IODP drilling expeditions, such as Expedition 349 to the South China Sea, will be critical to develop a holistic understanding of the Asian monsoon system.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystem primary productivity has been considered to be primarily nitrogen (N) - limited, but may be co-limited by phosphorus (P), and possibly by potassium and micronutrients (K+m). The frequency, magnitude, and global extent of single or multiple nutrient limitations are poorly understood in natural systems, but can influence how anthropogenic nutrient enrichment affects ecosystem productivity and provisioning of ecosystem goods and services. We examined the occurrence and magnitude of nutrient limitation of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) by N, P, and K+m at 42 grassland sites on five continents in the Nutrient Network (https://www.nutnet.umn.edu). N, P, and K+m were factorially applied annually in a randomized block design at all sites. ANPP was measured annually for 3 to 5 years by clipping and weighing standing aboveground biomass.\nWe found clear evidence for nutrient limitation of ANPP in these grasslands. Across all sites and years, the combined addition of N and P increased ANPP by 39% over controls, more than occurred if either was added alone (N: 18%; P: 9%), suggesting co-limitation of ANPP by both nutrients. Co-limitation by other nutrient combinations was not detected. At individual sites, ANPP limitation was most often alleviated by adding N and P together, but K+m addition alleviated ANPP limitation at three sites. Also, site-level limitation of ANPP by any one nutrient was positively correlated (R2 0.07 to 0.21) with limitation by other single or multiple nutrients, suggesting generalized multiple nutrient limitation. We found no differences in nutrient limitation of ANPP among continents or management practices, between native and previously cultivated grasslands, or with site soil properties or climate. These novel patterns of nutrient limitation of ANPP in grasslands around the global contradict the long-held idea that N is the primary nutrient limiting productivity in these ecosystems. Grasslands are globally important, accounting for a third of Earth’s net primary production. Anthropogenic enrichment of grasslands with N or P will likely render ANPP increasingly P, K+m, or multiple-nutrient limited, with consequences for grassland ecosystem services provision.",

            "abstract": "While the majority of the Earth surface is still in pristine conditions, the totality of the hydrological systems that are relevant to humans are human impacted, with the only exception of small headwater catchments. In fact, the limited transferability of water in space and time implies that water withdrawals from natural resources take place where and when water is needed. Therefore, hydrological systems are impacted where and when humans are, thereby causing a direct perturbation of all water bodies that are relevant to society. The current trend of population dynamics and the current status of water systems are such that the above impact will be not sustainable in the near future, therefore causing a water emergency that will be extended to all intensively populated regions of the world, with relevant implications on migration fluxes, political status and social security. Therefore mitigation actions are urgently needed, whose planning needs to be based on improved interpretations of the above impact. Up to recent times, hydrologists mainly concentrated their research on catchments where the human perturbation is limited, to improve our understanding of pristine hydrology. There were good motivations for this focus: given the relevant uncertainty affecting hydrological modeling, and the even greater uncertainty involved in societal modeling, hydrologists made an effort to separate hydrological and human dynamics. Nowadays, the urgency of the above need to mitigate the global water crisis through improved water resources management calls for a research attempt to bridge water and social sciences. The relevant research question is how to build operational models in order to fully account for the interactions and feedbacks between water resources systems and society. Given that uncertainty estimation is necessary for the operational application of model results, one of the crucial issues is how to quantify uncertainty by means of suitable assumptions. This talk will provide an introduction to the problem and a personal perspective to move forward to set up improved operational models to assist societal planning to mitigate the global water crisis.",

            "abstract": "We evaluated spatial and temporal trends in total mercury and monomethylmercury (MMHg) in groundwater, lagoon water, and nearshore seawater to assess the drivers of MMHg production in a coastal lagoon system. Many West Coast streams transition from estuarine to lagoon conditions in the dry season when a sand berm develops at the stream mouth, restricting surface water exchange with the ocean. Because lagoons accumulate nutrients from their upstream watershed they are susceptible to eutrophication, which can promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria. In nearshore settings, these bacteria are primarily responsible for producing MMHg, a bioaccumulative neurotoxin. We found that MMHg concentrations in lagoon water (1 – 5 pM) were higher than in groundwater (0.2 – 1 pM) and coastal seawater (0.1 – 0.6 pM). Groundwater depth profiles combined with subsurface resistivity images suggest MMHg in lagoon water was transported through the sand berm to adjacent seawater. MMHg in seawater and groundwater followed similar trends, providing additional evidence of groundwater-surface water interaction. MMHg in groundwater directly below the lagoon was consistently higher where dissolved oxygen and NO3- decreased, implying MMHg production by anaerobic bacteria. Over a ~7-hour period we observed a 0.6 pM decrease in groundwater MMHg (1 to 0.4 pM) that coincided with a decrease in water temperature (16.5 to 13 °C). We hypothesize that microbial activity, and consequently MMHg production, were enhanced in warmer water. Because coastal lagoons support intricate food webs and serve as nurseries for a variety of organisms, processes that influence mercury speciation and transport in these ecosystems may have a disproportionate impact on nearshore mercury biogeochemical cycling.",

There are several challenges to simulating these interactions, including development of mathematical functions to represent the biophysical processes, collecting data to satisfy model inputs, and structuring model output so it is relevant to urban stakeholders. We describe how the i-Tree tools, including Eco, Design, and Hydro, represent the structure-function relationships between urban vegetation and the four categories of ecosystem services.

Using observations from EIS we analyze the structure of active region loops observed on 2012 September 7. We study the spectral line profiles of Fe XII, Fe XIII, Fe XV and Fe XVI and compare the non-thermal line broadening from this region to line-of-sight velocity from our Alfven wave turbulence modeling of the loops. In our computations, the relationship between the width of the coronal emission lines and the orientation of the coronal loops with respect to the line-of-sight direction is taken in to account. We predict that in coronal loops, the transverse component of plasma flows with respect to the loop axis move at the speed of 15–40 km/s. In conclusion, Alfven waves are a strong candidate in explaining the flows within the coronal loops and play an important role in the heating of the chromosphere and corona.",

            "abstract": "Landslide disasters cause thousands of fatalities each year and cumulatively produce more economic damage than most other natural disasters. However, the number and distribution of landslides remain poorly quantified due to their small size and the absence of local, regional or global observing or reporting mechanisms. As a result, there are very few global databases that describe landslide hazards. Characterizing the socioeconomic impacts of landslide hazards worldwide presents an even more challenging task due to the various reporting biases or information gaps in existing regional and global sources. An online system has been developed to improve reporting of landslide hazards at the global scale that leverages crowd sourcing capabilities. Through this portal, users are able to input landslide information in a series of specified fields, including the date, location, impacts, trigger, and setting of the event. They are also able to link to photos so that other users can improve the characterization of the landslide event based on additional information or expert opinion.\nThis hazard portal and editor provides a foundation to involve citizens in reporting, visualizing and sharing landslide events while improving a global landslide database and introducing them to other geospatial data in the process. A global landslide catalog of over 6,000 events developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center currently anchors this system. This research presents this new crowd-based system and outlines the technology used in developing this system. Preliminary findings of societal metrics, limitations on this type of interactive crowd sourcing portal, and lessons learned from the initial launch of this system will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Reconnection at the Earth’s magnetopause is the mechanism by which magnetic fields in different regions change topology to create open magnetic field lines that allow energy and momentum to flow into the magnetosphere. The location of the reconnection line at the magnetopause depends on the conditions of the solar wind, especially the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Dayside equatorial region locations of reconnection during southward IMF have been inferred from global ionospheric images and studies based on incident ion beams in the cusp and boundary layer of the magnetopause. For such conditions the most likely location is along the line of Maximum Magnetic Shear crossing the magnetopause (for large IMF BY cases) or along the high latitude antiparallel reconnection region (for large IMF BX or BZ cases). The same studies have also revealed a poleward of the cusp reconnection line for northward IMF conditions.\nIn this study we discuss several cusp crossings by the Polar satellite during conditions with a weak northward IMF component for which cusp ion-energy dispersion profiles typical for a equatorial dayside reconnection line have been observed. This dayside reconnection location during northward IMF conditions is also inferred from magnetopause crossings of the Double-Star satellites.",

Each fire is a minimally-controlled complex phenomenon producing a diverse suite of gases and aerosols that experience many different atmospheric processing scenarios. New lab, airborne, and space-based observations along with model and algorithm development are significantly improving our knowledge of biomass burning. Several campaigns provided new detailed emissions profiles for previously undersampled fire types; including wildfires, cooking fires, peat fires, and agricultural burning; which may increase in importance with climate change and rising population. Multiple campaigns have better characterized black and brown carbon and used new instruments such as high resolution PTR-TOF-MS and 2D-GC/TOF-MS to improve quantification of semi-volatile precursors to aerosol and ozone. The aerosol evolution and formation of PAN and ozone, within hours after emission, have now been measured extensively. The NASA DC-8 sampled smoke before and after cloud-processing in two campaigns. The DC-8 performed continuous intensive sampling of a wildfire plume from the source in California to Canada probing multi-day aerosol and trace gas aging. Night-time plume chemistry has now been measured in detail. Fire inventories are being compared and improved, as is modeling of mass transfer between phases and sub-grid photochemistry for global models.",

We obtain a specific location’s daily minimum and maximum temperatures from the nearest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather stations posted on the National Climate Data Center (NCDC) Climate Data Online (CDO) archive and compute GDD. The date range for this study is January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2012. We employ a novel process, a repeating logistic product (RLP), to compensate for short-term weather variability and data drops from the recording stations and fit a curve to the median daily GDD values, adjusting for asymmetry, amplitude, and phase shift that minimize the sum of squared errors when comparing the observed and predicted GDD. The resulting curve, here referred to as the surrogate GDD, is the time-temperature phasing parameter used to convert Cartesian NDVI values into polar coordinate pairs, multiplying the NDVI values as the radial by the cosine and sine of the surrogate GDD as the angular. Depending on the vegetation type and the original NDVI curve, the polar NDVI curve may be nearly circular, kidney-shaped, or pear-shaped in the case of conifers, deciduous, or agriculture, respectively. We examine the points of tangency about the polar coordinate NDVI curve, identifying values of 1, 0, -1, or infinity, as each of these represent natural inflection points. Lines connecting the origin to each tangent point illustrate and quantify the parametrically segmentation of the growing season based on the GDD and NDVI ostensible dependency. Furthermore, the area contained by each segment represents the apparent vegetation production. A particular benefit is that the inflection points are determined near real-time, as MODIS NDVI, 8-day composite data become available, affording an effective forecasting and hindcasting tool.",

            "abstract": "Cenozoic paleoclimate reconstructions of China, based on pollens, fossils and sedimentary deposits, show a change from planetary aridity to inland aridity of NW China by the early Miocene. However, the initiation of this paleoclimate transition is not well-documented and might be much earlier. The surface uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, the retreat of the Para-Tethys sea, and global cooling have all been suggested to influence the establishment of this inland aridity, although their relative significance remains obscure. This paper presents a stable isotope study of a 4435 m long sedimentary section from the western Qaidam Basin, northern Tibetan Plateau, that spans from the late middle Eocene to late Miocene. The lowermost and uppermost parts of the section are dominated by fluvial and alluvial fan deposits, while the majority of the middle of the section represents palustrine, lower fan delta and marginal to shallow lacustrine fine-grained sediments intercalated with coarse sandstone and conglomerate. Our isotope data show sporadic aridity events in the late middle Eocene to early Oligocene, which might mark the transition from planetary aridity to, or the initiation of, inland aridity in NW China, due to the retreat of the Para-Tethys sea, a process that might be significantly influenced by the early topographic growth of the south-central Tibetan Plateau. A negative shift in oxygen isotope values around 19 Ma is also in accordance with other geological evidence suggesting the Oligocene–early Miocene growth of the Kunlun mountains south of the Qaidam basin. Later intensification of aridity occurred at ~12 Ma that corresponds with a regional climate change event, which we attribute to the upward and outward growth of the northern Tibetan Plateau. The final establishment of extreme inland aridity that is comparable to present day was most likely established at ~3.1–2.6 Ma in the Qaidam basin, and therefore global cooling and northern hemisphere glaciation is a major candidate for the cause.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies in the arctic and subarctic show that CH4 emissions from pan-arctic lakes are playing much more significant roles in the regional carbon cycling than previously estimated. Permafrost thawing due to pronounced warming at northern high latitudes affects lake morphology, changing its CH4 emissions. Thermokarst can enlarge the extent of artic lakes, exposing stable ancient carbon buried in the permafrost zone for degradation and changing a previously known carbon sink to a large carbon source. In some areas, the thawing of subarctic discontinuous and isolated permafrost can diminish thermokarst lakes. To date, few models have considered these important hydrological and biogeochemical processes to provide adequate estimation of CH4 emissions from these lakes. To fill this gap, we have developed a process-based climate-sensitive lake biogeochemical model and a landscape evolution model, which have been applied to quantify the state and variability of CH4 emissions from this freshwater system. Site-level experiments show the models are capable to capture the spatial and temporal variability of CH4 emissions from lakes across Siberia and Alaska. With the lake biogeochemical model solely, we estimate that the magnitude of CH4 emissions from lakes is 13.2 Tg yr-1 in the north of 60 ºN at present, which is on the same order of CH4 emissions from northern high-latitude wetlands. The maximum increment is 11.8 Tg CH4 yr-1 by the end of the 21st century when the worst warming scenario is assumed. We expect the landscape evolution model will improve the existing estimates.",

            "abstract": "Of the first twelve solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by instruments on the ACE spacecraft during the rising phase of solar cycle 23, nine exhibited Fe/O abundance ratios >2 times the average SEP Fe/O ratio. Several explanations for these ‘Fe-rich’ events were put forth but conclusive testing required simultaneous SEP measurements from distinct longitudinal vantage points. This capability was achieved with the launch of the twin STEREO spacecraft in 2006, however it was not until 2013 that the first significantly Fe-rich SEP event would be measured by both STEREO and ACE. Several additional Fe-rich SEP events have been observed by multiple spacecraft since then. In this presentation we examine the longitudinal dependence of the composition of these events and compare their characteristics to those of the cycle-23 Fe-rich events. We will discuss these results in light of the characteristics of the weaker solar cycle 24 as well as the implications for the proposed scenarios for creating Fe-rich SEP events.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing contraction related to the regional-scale left step in the San Andreas fault, (i.e. the Big Bend) has resulted in a complex network of oblique-reverse slip faults that now accommodate shortening across the Ventura basin. Continuous GPS sites from the Plate Boundary Observatory measure horizontal contraction rates across the Ventura basin of approximately 7 mm/yr oriented north-northwest with rates decreasing to the west and east. Inversion of horizontal GPS velocities highlights a zone of localized fast horizontal contraction rates that roughly follow the Ventura basin where seismic velocity models show low modulus sediments. This pattern of localized horizontal contraction can be explained with simple models creeping reverse faults (edge dislocations) at depth; however, such models predict significant uplift gradients that are not observed in the GPS or InSAR data. In fact, the GPS and InSAR show almost no vertical strains in the regions that exhibit fast horizontal strains. Thus, the outstanding unanswered question in the region is: how can interseismic deformation in a contractional setting produce localized horizontal contraction with little to no uplift gradients?\nTo assess whether the simple models are inadequate in their fault geometry, we use a complex interseismic mechanical model incorporating three-dimensional, nonplanar, and geologically constrained fault surfaces from the Southern California Earthquake Center’s Community Fault Model (CFM). This model produces very little vertical strains, but cannot match the magnitudes and localization of fast horizontal strains, likely due to the modeled homogeneous rock stiffness. In the end, we suggest that it is possible that a significant portion of the horizontal strains are due to strain localization in the low modulus sediments of the Ventura basin, which may not be released in a future earthquake and potentially mask the interseismic deformation due to faulting. Additionally, the CFM-based model suggests that many faults in the region may have no interseismic signal at all since several faults merge with other faults above their locking depth. Thus, interseismic satellite geodesy may not be able to characterize all potential seismic sources.",

Also for the detection of orebodies (for example massive sulfides), seismoelectric techniques are promising. For hydrological purposes, seismoelectric techniques can provide us with information as well, mapping for example water tables and water-retentive layers. Also for mapping of water-bearing strata beneath glaciers or monitoring of ice fracturing, seismoelectric methods are argued to be very powerful as they can distinguish between conductive and non-conductive layers that have similar acoustic impedances and thus cannot be mapped in conventional seismic surveys.\nWe designed and developed an experimental setup in which acoustic to electromagnetic (EM) wave conversions at interfaces can be measured. Theoretical results are obtained with an electrokinetic full-waveform theoretical model, where use was made of the Sommerfeld approach. Using bimodal samples, different fluid-solid interface effects and saturating fluids were investigated. The contrast between water and water-saturated porous glass samples is larger than the contrast between water and oil-saturated porous glass samples. The contrast between water and water-saturated Fontainebleau sandstone is larger than the contrast between oil and water-saturated Fontainebleau sandstone. These data are shown to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions on the basis of the Biot-Pride theory.",

            "abstract": "The emergence of plate tectonics was Earth's defining moment. How and when plate\ntectonics started is shrouded in mystery because of the paucity of observations in the\nArchean as well the challenge of understanding how plates are generated. The damage theory\nof lithospheric weakening by grain-reduction provides a physical framework for plate\ngeneration. This model builds on grain-scale processes to elucidate planetary-scale\ntectonics, and is consistent with lab and field observations of polycrystalline rocks and\nlithospheric shear zones. The grain-damage model accounts for the evolution of damage and\nhealing (by grain growth) at various planetary conditions, hence predicts plate boundary\nformation and longevity, and how they depend on surface environment.\nFor example, the onset of prototectonics is predicted to require clement conditions to\nkeep healing from erasing weak zones; conversely, cool conditions possibly required\ntectonics to draw down primordial CO2. Thus whether tectonics preceded a cool climate (and\nwater) or vice versa is immaterial as they likely needed each other or neither would\nexist. Sparse evidence that prototectonics co-initiated with liquid water hints at the\nlink between tectonics, water and surface conditions.\nThe establishment of wide-spread plate tectonics started between >4Ga and 2.7Ga, and may\nhave taken over a billion years to develop. Under Earth-like conditions, combining\ngrain-damage with intermittent Archean protosubduction produces persistent weak zones that\naccumulate to yield well developed plates within 1Gyrs. In contrast, Venus' hotter\nsurface conditions promotes healing and prohibits weak zone accumulation, which explains\nwhy plate tectonics failed to spread on our sister planet.\nDamage and weak-zone inheritance may also influence plate evolution and reorganization in\nthe modern era. Changes in plate direction, such as reflected in the Emperor-Hawaiian\nbend, leave weak zones misaligned with plate motion, causing oblique plate boundaries that\npersist for the age of the plate. Grain-damage within a cold subducting slab may also\ncause its very rapid detachment, and the abrupt loss of the slab-pull force could account\nfor precipitous changes in plate motion, such as for the Pacific plate at both 47Ma and\n6Ma.",

Here we summarize the proposed mechanisms behind the time variation of effective climate sensitivity, and consider the implications for future climate prediction. CMIP5 simulations show a robust increase in effective climate sensitivity with transient global warming, indicating that estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity based on modern observations of transient climate change may be biased low. Moreover, this increase in effective climate sensitivity leads to fundamental issues with a widely used method for diagnosing equilibrium climate sensitivity, radiative feedbacks and forcing within climate models -- the regression of the global top-of-atmosphere radiation flux on global surface temperature. We show that reported regression-based estimates of both equilibrium climate sensitivity and CO2 forcing in CMIP5 models are systematically biased low.",

For a microorganism to do this, and be only slightly active, is a difficult process to maintain, as many cells are programmed to be constantly active or face death. In order to maintain low levels of activity, cells may need additional control on which genes are activated in their genomes. In the surface world, particularly in eukaryotes, gene activity is controlled by factors including methylation of genes to silence activity. Methylation is now recognized as being present in many bacterial and archaeal genomes, and we hypothesized that this may be a prevalent lifestyle in subsurface organisms. We saw initial signals of methylation activity in a deep subsurface metatranscriptome and have shown which genes are methylated in a shallower sediment core. Methylation does appear to be a widespread phenomenon in microbial genomes of the subsurface, and additional tests will be needed to prove it’s overall control on the potential for microbial activity.",

The new Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the NASA/NOAA Suomi-NPP satellite provides 12h global coverage at spatial resolutions of 375 m and 750 m. Compared to coarser resolution products, the new VIIRS 375 m active fire detection product enables early detection of small fires and improved mapping of large wildfires. NCAR’s Coupled Atmosphere-Wildland Fire Environment (CAWFE) combines a numerical weather prediction model with wildland fire behavior algorithms to simulate fire behavior. These not only predict a fire’s shape and extent, but extreme behaviors such as fire whirls, blow-ups, splitting of the head, flank runs, and pyrocumulus, all resulting from a fire’s interaction with its environment, i.e. how the fire creates its own weather. We use the new VIIRS 375 m fire data to initialize and evaluate the CAWFE model, enabling accurate simulation of complex fire behavior during long-lasting wildfires. Compared to traditional models, this approach can now be applied to monitor and predict the growth of a fire or a group of simultaneous wildfires in a management unit from first detection until containment – a previously unattainable goal due to accumulation of model error.",

The gradual emergence of the field into the solar atmosphere results in a network of magnetic loops, which interact dynamically forming current layers at their interfaces. The formation and ejection of plasmoids out of the current layers leads to patchy reconnection and the spontaneous formation of several small (size ≈1-2 Mm) flares. We find that these flares are short-lived (30 s-3 minutes) bursts of energy in the range O(1025-1027) erg, which is basically the nanoflare-microflare range.

The aim of the ICI-III mission was to investigate the physics of RFE class of cusp flow events. ICI-III intersected the first RFE (RFE1) in a sequence of in total 3 consecutive RFEs seen by the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR). The ESR and ICI-III were geographically looking at the same region of the ionosphere both at the time ICI-III entered RFE1 on its poleward boundary and left it on its equatorward boundary, hence ESR tracked the rocket perfectly on entering and leaving RFE1. ICI-III measured hence for the first time detailed flows and precipitation within an RFE with a resolution down to tens of meters.\nThe observations presented are used to test the various explanations that have been proposed as generation mechanisms for this phenomenon. The only consistent explanation that remains seems to be the theory suggested by Rinne et al. 2007, where an asymmetric version of the Southwood FTE twin cell model was proposed in which return flow develops predominantly on the poleward side of newly open flux since it is inhibited by the open-closed boundary (OCB) on the equatorward side to explain the RFE. By zooming into the RFE, detailed structure and dynamics within the RFE are revealed, previously unseen due to instrument resolution.",

            "abstract": "Metabolism, the biological processing of energy and matter, is driven by multiple reduction-oxidation reactions under unusually extreme physico-chemical conditions in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) is one such metabolism that is emerging as widespread in thermophilic members of the e-Proteobacteria and Aquificales, two abundant groups of vent microorganisms. In this study, we used Caminibacter mediatlanticus and Thermovibrio ammonificans as representatives of each group to study physiological and biogeochemical parameters associated with the oxidation of H2 coupled to DNRA. We observed that while C. mediatlanticus achieved higher cell densities than T. ammonificans, the overall metabolism of the latter was ~ 2.8 times higher and ~ 3 times faster. A comparison with previously published data from cultured vent e-Proteobacteria and Aquificales utilizing the same metabolism suggests that the bioenergetics observed in our experiments are generally conserved between these two groups. The discrimination values for the nitrogen isotope (15N/14N) fractionation during DNRA were -6.0 ± 0.7‰ for C. mediatlanticus and -8.4 ± 0.5‰ for T. ammonificans. Further laboratory culturing efforts at seafloor pressures (20MPa) showed that these δ15N discrimination factors were independent of pressure effects, while growth rates and nitrate reduction kinetic rate constants were significantly decreased in both representative microorganisms. Currently, we are complementing these pure culture research approaches with new studies using natural vent microbial communities to further constrain the role of DNRA at in-situ seafloor temperatures and pressures. This study represents the first detailed assessment of the relationship between growth efficiencies and metabolic rates during energy and matter transfer through H2-oxidizing DNRA by members of two mayor phylogenetic groups present at hydrothermal vents. Furthermore, determinations of nitrogen isotope fractionation during this metabolism will allow the evaluation of its contribution to the observed isotope geochemistry of NO3- and NH4+ in deep ocean environments.",

            "abstract": "Seismic reflection profiles and tomographic models developed from wide-angle seismic traveltime data document a 200-300-km-wide zone of thinned continental crust between the shelf and the continent-ocean transition (COT) across the NE South China Sea (SCS) rifted margin. Despite this wide rift zone and an apparent lack of significant synrift magmatism, a zone of exhumed continental mantle has not been identified near the COT. At other well-studied magma-poor rifted margins such as Iberia and Newfoundland, Tethyan margins now exposed in the Alps, and the southern rift margin between Australia and Antarctica, there is clear evidence that extreme crustal thinning can result in exhumation of the sub-continental mantle across the continent-ocean-transition. In the northeast SCS, there is a zone of extremely thin crust, perhaps thinner than 2-5 km, but this margin-parallel zone is only ~50-75 km seaward of the shelf edge. No data clearly document mantle exhumation here, but shallow levels of mantle may well have been serpentinized during the rifting process; we interpret this zone as a failed rift. More than 150 km to the south, ridges and seamounts become more prominent approaching the continent-ocean transition. In the COT zone, Moho reflections are present on some seismic profiles below 8-12 km-thick crust on the continental side and below 6-8 km-thick crust on the oceanic side, apparently excluding mantle exhumation as a possibility. The nature of the COT is not completely clear from the seismic reflection data, and neither these data nor magnetic anomalies indicate unambiguously how heavily this zone is influenced by magmatism. We suggest that this apparently abrupt transition from stretched continental crust to oceanic crust without a zone of exhumed mantle may represent an important variant in the spectrum of magma-poor rifted margin structures. However, additional imaging and extensive sampling must be conducted to constrain the nature and primary characteristics of this margin and continent-ocean transition.",

            "abstract": "Our Array of Arrays experiment consisted of eight 1-km aperture arrays, each containing 10-20 three-component continuously recording stations. One of these arrays ran continuously for five years and the others for more than one year. We applied frequency-domain beam forming to each array, and a multi-beam back projection method to detect and locate tremor on the Cascadia subduction plate interface every minute. We have also used the arrays to detect and locate over 10,000 tiny repeating Low-Frequency Earthquakes (LFEs) in dozens of distinct families. Repeating events are detected by autocorrelating every 6-s window with every other one during many 1-hour periods and stacking them across several stations to find repeating events. Clean templates are built for each family by iteratively scanning for new repeats and stacking them into the previous template. LFE catalogs are obtained by scanning templates through years of continuous data. Waveform similarities across LFEs and across stations within arrays are used to estimate seismic moment, double-difference event locations and source spectra. These methods have revealed fascinating space-time patterns in both tremor and LFEs that shed light on the propagation modes of slow slip earthquakes on the subduction plate interface including tremor streaks that propagate 100 km/hour parallel to relative plate motion, Rapid Tremor Reversals that propagate at 10 km/hour, and up to 4 times variations in the 0.4 km/hour along-strike propagation speed of the main rupture front that indicates sticky spots on the plate interface. Rather than following a standard Gutenberg-Richter power-law relation, the distributions of seismic moment of LFEs within each family follow an exponential law, allowing estimates of characteristic size. LFEs for a given family cluster in time. Going up dip, time between LFE bursts vary systematically from about a week to a year, durations from an hour to several days, and characteristic moment magnitudes from 1.25 to 1.85. The characteristic moment for up dip LFEs is thus 8 times bigger than their down-dip counter parts. Double-difference locations indicate that many of the families occur on patches that are elongated in the direction of relative plate motion, perhaps related to structural features on the plate interface.",

            "abstract": "Germany’s coastal areas are exposed to extra-tropical storms and related marine hazards such as wind waves and storm surges. About 50% of the coast is below 5 m NN and considerable parts are protected by an almost continuous dike line. Rising mean and extreme sea levels provide substantial threat. In this presentation we briefly review the present situation. Storm related sea level changes are characterized by pronounced inter-annual and decadal variability but do not show a long-term trend over the last century. Mean sea level has increased over the past about 100-150 years at a rate roughly comparable to global mean sea level rise. As a consequence extreme sea levels have increased in the area as increasing mean sea level shifts the baseline for storm surges and wind waves towards higher values. Different approaches for adaptation are investigated in a number ongoing research projects. Some case studies for potential adaptation and challenges are presented. Examples range from detailed analyses of retreat and accommodation strategies to multi-purpose strategies such as concepts for sustainable development of tidal estuaries.",

            "abstract": "This presentation will outline ongoing, multi-year hydroclimate change research between the Columbia River Management Joint Operating Committee (RMJOC), The University of Washington, Portland State University, and their many regional research partners and stakeholders. Climate change in the Columbia River Basin is of particular concern to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and many Federal, Tribal and regional stakeholders. BPA, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which comprise the RMJOC, conducted an extensive study in 2009-11 using climate change streamflows produced by the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group (CIG). The study reconfirmed that as more winter precipitation in the Columbia Basin falls as rain rather than snow by mid-century, particularly on the U.S. portion of the basin, increased winter runoff is likely, followed by an earlier spring snowmelt peak, followed by less summer flows as seasonal snowmelt diminished earlier in the water year.\nSince that initial effort, both global and regional climate change modeling has advanced. To take advantage of the new outputs from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP-5), the RMJOC, through BPA support, is sponsoring new hydroclimate research which considers not only the most recent information from the GCMs, but also the uncertainties introduced by the hydroclimate modeling process itself. Historical streamflows, which are used to calibrate hydrologic models and ascertain their reliability, are subject to both measurement and modeling uncertainties. Downscaling GCMs to a hydrologically useful spatial and temporal resolution introduces uncertainty, depending on the downscaling methods. Hydrologic modeling introduces uncertainties from calibration and geophysical states, some of which, like land surface characteristics, are likely to also change with time. In the upper Columbia Basin, glacier processes introduce yet another source of uncertainty. The latest joint effort attempts to ascertain the relative contributions of these uncertainties in comparison to the uncertainties brought by changing climate itself.",

This paper presents a series of model experiments using the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model that explores the sensitivity of MLT NOx to these factors and how they vary in importance between the hemispheres. Two that appear to play an important role in the Southern Hemisphere are the Prandtl number used to calculate the diffusivity due to gravity waves and the inclusion of medium energy electrons. In the Northern Hemisphere, as previously reported, the concentration of NOx additionally depends on if and when a stratospheric sudden warming occurs. The representation of these processes significantly affects the amount of NOx entering the stratosphere and subsequent EPP-induced ozone loss.",

            "abstract": "Understanding eddy-mean flow interactions is a long-standing problem in geophysical fluid dynamics with modern relevance to the task of representing eddy effects in coarse resolution models while preserving their dependence on the underlying dynamics of the flow field. Exploiting the recognition that the velocity covariance matrix/eddy stress tensor that describes eddy fluxes, also encodes information about eddy size, shape and orientation through its geometric representation in the form of the so-called variance ellipse, suggests a potentially fruitful way forward.\nHere we present a new framework that describes eddy-mean flow interactions in terms of a geometric description of the eddy motion, and illustrate it with an application to an unstable jet. Specifically we show that the eddy vorticity flux divergence F, a key dynamical quantity describing the average effect of fluctuations on the time-mean flow, may be decomposed into two components with distinct geometric interpretations: 1. variations in variance ellipse orientation; and 2. variations in the anisotropic part of the eddy kinetic energy, a function of the variance ellipse size and shape. Application of the divergence theorem shows that F integrated over a region is explained entirely by variations in these two quantities around the region’s periphery.\nThis framework has the potential to offer new insights into eddy-mean flow interactions in a number of ways. It identifies the ingredients of the eddy motion that have a mean flow forcing effect, it links eddy effects to spatial patterns of variance ellipse geometry that can suggest the mechanisms underpinning these effects, and finally it illustrates the importance of resolving eddy shape and orientation, and not just eddy size/energy, to accurately represent eddy feedback effects. These concepts will be both discussed and illustrated.",

            "abstract": "CO2-Plume Geothermal (CPG) energy utilization involves injection of CO2 as a working fluid to extract heat from naturally high permeability geologic units. The injected CO2 forms a large subsurface CO2 plume that absorbs heat from the geothermal reservoir and eventually buoyantly rises to the surface. The CO2 plume can be “tapped” for thermal and/or electric power production in a geothermal power system. In actual systems, the CO2 plume would likely be skewed opposite any likely dip direction of the reservoir-caprock interface. Here, we numerically analyze the characteristics of CO2 plume formation and geothermal heat extraction from geothermal reservoirs with dip. We find that the heat extraction rate and the total amount of heat extracted over time is the same for symmetric and skewed CO2 plume systems when the circular, horizontal production well is arranged according to the CO2 plume distribution around the injection well. We also conduct simulations of CO2 plume formation within a pre-existing groundwater flow field and find that groundwater flow is not capable of skewing the CO2 plume. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of reinjecting small amounts of brine that are produced with the CO2. Brine has a smaller mobility than supercritical CO2 at a given temperature and thus accumulates near the injection well. Such brine accumulation reduces the relative permeability for the CO2 phase, which in turn increases the pore-fluid pressure around the injection well. For this reason, and as injection of two fluid phases is problematic, we recommend removal of any brine from the produced fluid before the cooled CO2 is reinjected into the reservoir. Separated brine may be reinjected into the formation away from the CO2 plume, providing an additional means of controlling and directing the CO2 plume pressure field and flow direction and avoiding the need to treat and dispose of the CO2 near the land surface. In summary, we show that the geothermal heat extraction characteristics from saline aquifers is minimally affected by details of whether the CO2 is symmetrically distributed around the injection well or skewed, as long as production well geometries take this into account and that reinjection of produced fluid without removal of any brine is not recommended to avoid pressurization of the reservoir.",

The analysis is based on structural mapping, rock mechanics experiments, numerical modeling, and in-situ stress measurements at focal depth. The Archean cataclasite of the Pretorius fault was pervasively sintered and cemented to become brittle and strong, and thus, it was expected that the fault zone will fail similarly to an intact rock body, e.g., by array of tensile fractures. However, the study revealed a few puzzling features of the M2.2 rupture-zone: (1) the earthquake ruptured four, non-parallel, cataclasite bearing segments of the ancient Pretorius fault-zone; (2) slip occurred almost exclusively along the cataclasite-host rock contacts of the slipping segments; and (3) the local in-situ, static stress is not favorable to slip along any of these four segments, and slip could occur only if the friction coefficient was very low, below 0.12. We conducted rock mechanics experiments on the fault-rocks and host-rocks at relevant confining pressure (up to 120 MPa), and found a strong mechanical contrast between the quartzitic cataclasite zones, with elastic-brittle rheology, and the host quartzites, with damage, elastic–plastic rheology. The finite-element modeling of a heterogeneous fault-zone with the measured mechanical contrast indicates that the slip is likely to reactivate the ancient cataclasite bearing segments at the contact between the cataclasite and the host quartzitic rock (as observed) due to the strong mechanical contrast. We propose that the earthquake slip was facilitated by very intense dynamic weakening as observed in high-velocity friction experiments.",

            "abstract": "In the boreal forest of Alaska, watersheds are commonly underlain with discontinuous permafrost, which has a dominant control on catchment hydrology and the resulting input of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and nutrients into streams. Much of the permafrost is near the point of thawing, which will alter the hydrologic connections between watersheds and streams. Wildfires are also common in the boreal forest of Alaska and can impact streams hydrology and nutrients. Wildfires have been increasing in frequency and severity with recent warming, and have the potential to alter the delivery of DOM and nutrients to streams. Together, permafrost and wildfires interact to regulate hydrology and material inputs into streams.\nWe have been measuring stream flow since 1980, and water chemistry since 2000 in streams draining sub-catchments with varying extents of underlying permafrost in the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed in interior Alaska. Across sub-catchments, streams draining watersheds with extensive permafrost have flashier hydrographs compared to streams draining catchments with little permafrost. Coupled to patterns in flow, DOM concentration is greatest in streams draining watersheds with large extents of underlying permafrost, whereas nitrate concentration tends to be highest in streams draining lower permafrost catchments. Following a wildfire in the CPCRW, stream DOM concentration significantly declined compared with a control stream, suggesting that the fire either resulted in a loss of soil organic matter or altered hydrologic flowpaths through catchments. With climatic warming, permafrost thaw and changing fire frequency will interact to determine DOM concentration and composition in streams of the boreal forest, and will have important impacts on the coupling between DOM decomposition and nutrient cycling.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the behavior of magma and hydrothermal fluids at restless calderas is important for many reasons. The interplay between the magmatic and hydrothermal systems at caldera-forming volcanoes is key to interpreting many of the geophysical signals measured at the surface used to understand their subsurface state and structure. Several recent studies have highlighted that structural controls may be important in terms of the movements of both types of fluids in the Earth’s crust below volcanoes with implications including hazard management and geothermal prospecting. Caldera-forming systems are often characterized by eruptive activity covering a wide range of size scales and repose intervals. Understanding how these different scales of volcanism at the same system relate to each other is a key science challenge when seeking to understand these types of volcano. This presentation will explore these issues using examples from two caldera-forming systems. Santorini volcano in Greece is a relatively well-studied system that last erupted significantly about 75 years ago and has recently experienced a period of unusual unrest. Aluto volcano in Ethiopia is more poorly studied but has been shown to be actively deforming and is an area of focus for investment in geothermal power in the Main Ethiopian Rift. In each case lessons from field mapping and geochemistry, high-resolution digital elevation models, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and degassing surveys and compositions can be brought together to yield insights into the behavior of these and similar volcanic systems.",

            "abstract": "The predictability of weekly averaged atmospheric anomalies over North America, and their relationship to predictable anomalies in the Tropics and over southeast Asia, is investigated in a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from their observed simultaneous and time-lag correlation statistics for boreal spring. Forecast skill is found to be comparable to that of the current operational forecast models (CFS and GFS) run at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). The geographical and temporal variations of forecast skill are also similar in the two models. This makes the much simpler LIM an attractive tool for assessing and diagnosing atmospheric predictability at these forecast ranges.\nThe LIM assumes that the dynamics of weekly averages are linear, asymptotically stable, and stochastically forced. In a forecasting context, the predictable signal is associated with the deterministic linear dynamics, and the forecast error with the unpredictable stochastic noise. In a low-order linear model of a high-order chaotic system, this stochastic noise represents the effects of both chaotic nonlinear interactions and unresolved initial components on the evolution of the resolved components. Its statistics are assumed here to be state independent.\nIn this framework, the predictable variations of forecast skill from case to case are associated with predictable variations of signal rather than of noise. In the LIM, the predictable variations of signal are associated with variations of the initial state projection on the growing singular vectors of the LIM’s propagator. At times of strong projection on such structures, the signal-to-noise ratio is relatively high, and springtime climate anomalies are not only potentially but also actually more predictable than at other times.",

            "abstract": "Recently, it has been suggested that the predictability of ENSO has changed in the last few decades in correspondence with the observed increase of CP relative to EP ENSO events. We investigate this issue within the context of a statistically stationary stochastically forced multivariate linear dynamical system. Using a Linear Inverse Model (LIM) constructed from observed tropical Pacific oceanic and atmospheric anomalies, it is suggested that decadal changes in realized ENSO forecast skill may also reflect variations of different precursors to ENSO events and not necessarily a change in the underlying predictability of tropical Pacific coupled dynamics. These precursors can be excited by random weather forcing and subsequently result in SST anomaly amplification primarily through surface or thermocline feedbacks, respectively. That is, some ENSO events are inherently less predictable than others due to the relative importance of different physical processes, and periods when these events are more often randomly excited will be periods of reduced forecast skill.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which particular extreme weather and climate events are assessed as being attributable to anthropogenic climate change (e.g., that anthropogenic forcing influenced their probability of occurrence or other characteristics) can vary dramatically from case to case.\nOne example assessed at GFDL is the record or near-record annual mean temperature over a large region of Australia in 2013. According to this analysis of the CMIP5 models, the event was largely attributable to anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. Another 2013 case was the extreme positive annual mean precipitation anomalies in 5x5 degree gridded (GHCN) precipitation data that were observed along the U.S./Canadian border region. This is a region with a detectable long-term increase of precipitation since 1900. Nonetheless, the 2013 event is assessed as primarily attributable to internal (unforced) climate variability and only partly attributable to external forcing (natural and anthropogenic combined). There are many outstanding challenges to these studies. Among these are the limitations to historical data length, data quality, model ensemble size, and model control run length. Furthermore, there is room for improvement in addressing model biases, station/gridcell scale mismatches, modeling the extreme ends of the distributions e.g. with Generalized Extreme Value methods, etc.\nAnother project assesses anthropogenic influences on the track and evolution (but not the likelihood) of Sandy-like storms. Assuming the existence of a Sandy-like storm under non-industrial conditions, we use CMIP5 model simulations, a global atmospheric model time slice experiment, and regional hurricane model idealized simulations to suggest that the unusual left turn the storm took may have been made more likely by anthropogenic climate forcing. This does not imply that Sandy-like events are less likely in the non-industrial climate, because we assumed the existence of such a storm to begin with.",

            "abstract": "One of the major goals of the NASA Earth Venture - 1 DISCOVER-AQ project is to better quantify the spatial and temporal variability of pollutant gases in the lower troposphere, as this information is required for the design of new atmospheric chemistry satellite instruments. This objective has been addressed through a series of four field experiments (Baltimore-Washington, San Joaquin Valley, Houston, and Denver). DISCOVER-AQ observations that lend themselves to this analysis include in-situ measurements of trace gases by the NASA P-3B aircraft (spiral profiles and constant altitude flight legs), trace gas columns from the surface-based network of Pandora UV/Vis spectrometers, trace gas columns from the Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM) on board the NASA King Air, and in-situ tethered balloon observations. We make use of the P-3B observations to assess spatial variability and evaluate regional model simulations through the use of structure functions, which yield the mean difference in column abundance or mixing ratio between observation points at specified distances apart over a designated length of time. Agreement between the observations and model output indicates that the model can be used to derive more comprehensive variability analyses than are possible with the aircraft data. Subsequently, the structure function approach can be used to compute the mean difference over various time intervals to yield temporal variability estimates. The continuous Pandora data also allow for comprehensive temporal variability estimates for the tropospheric column, as does the frequent tethered balloon profiling at fixed sites for the lower portion of the boundary layer. Additionally, the fine-resolution pixels of the ACAM data allow further detailed spatial analysis. A second DISCOVER-AQ objective is to assess the relationship between column observations and surface air quality. We examine the temporal variability of these measurements over the daytime hours, and the strength of the relationship between sites through correlation analyses.",

A bits-and-pieces approach to these may miss essential aspects of change propagation and transformation by land-water through different segments of the Earth system. This paper proposes a conceptualization of the entire land-water geosphere as a scale-free catchment-wise organised system (Figure 1), emphasizing four key new system aspects compared to traditional hydrosphere/water cycle view: i) distinction of coastal divergent in addition to traditional convergent catchments; ii) physical and social-ecological system coupling through four main nodal zones/interfaces (surface, subsurface, coastal, observation); iii) flow-transport pathways as system coupling agents; iv) multiple interactions with the anthroposphere as integral system parts. Utilizing this conceptualization, we identify distinct patterns of direct anthropogenic change in large-scale water and waterborne nutrient fluxes, emerging across different parts of the world. In general, its embedment directly in the anthroposphere/technosphere makes land-water a key geosphere for understanding and monitoring human-driven biogeochemical changes. Further progress in system-level understanding of such changes requires studies of land-water as a continuous yet structured geosphere following the proposed spatiotemporal pathways of change propagation-transformation.",

This paper synthesizes results from recent modeling and observational studies of land-water flow and dissolved carbon transport in permafrost regions, departing from a new conceptualization of the land-water geosphere as a scale-free catchment-wise organized system (Figure 1), emphasizing several key new system aspects compared to traditional hydrosphere/water cycle view. Among these new aspects, we particularly investigate here the role of land-water flow and transport pathways as system coupling agents, with focus on their variability and change with varying permafrost conditions and permafrost thaw in a warming climate.

Accurate prediction of pollutant pathways and concentrations at the ocean surface requires understanding ocean dynamics over a broad range of spatial scales. Fundamental questions concerning the structure of the velocity field at the submesoscales (100 meters to tens of kilometers, hours to days) remain unresolved due to a lack of synoptic measurements at these scales. Using high-frequency position data provided by the near-simultaneous release of hundreds of accurately tracked surface drifters, we study the structure of submesoscale surface velocity fluctuations in the Northern Gulf Mexico. Observed two-point statistics confirm the accuracy of classic turbulence scaling laws at 200m-50km scales and clearly indicate that dispersion at the submesoscales is local, driven predominantly by energetic submesoscale fluctuations. The results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of deploying large clusters of drifting instruments to provide synoptic observations of spatial variability of the ocean surface velocity field. Our findings allow quantification of the submesoscale-driven dispersion missing in current operational circulation models and satellite altimeter-derived velocity fields.",

            "abstract": "There are a number of practical problems that demand an accurate knowledge of ocean currents near the surface of the ocean. It is known that oceanic coherent features transport heat and carry out vertical exchange of biogeochemical tracers. Ocean currents can affect biological primary production, air-sea gas exchanges and global tracer budgets. Ocean currents are also important for the dispersion of substances that pose a danger to society, economy and human health. Examples of such events include algal blooms, the Fukushima nuclear plant incident in the Pacific Ocean in 2011, and repeated large oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, namely the IXTOC in 1978 and the Deepwater Horizon event in 2010. Such incidents demand accurate answers to questions such as ``where will the pollutant go?\", ``how fast will it get there?\" and ``how much pollutant will arrive there?\", and in some instances ``where did the pollutant come from?\". The answers to these questions are critical to the allocation of limited response resources, and in determining the overall impact of the events.\nWe will summarize the efforts by the Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE). One of the primary objectives of CARTHE is to improve predictive modeling capability for flows near the air-sea interface. In particular, two large experiments, Grand Lagrangian Deployment (GLAD) and Surf-zone and Coastal Oil Pathways Experiment (SCOPE), coordinated with real-time modeling were instructive on processes influencing near-surface material transport. Findings on submesoscale flows as well as model deficiencies to capture processes relevant to transport will be discussed. Insight into future modeling and observational plans will be provided.",

            "abstract": "Geomorphological and thermo-hydrological changes after wildfire were investigated here to clarify the rates of permafrost degradation and impacts on the surrounding environment. Study sites are located in Kougarok on the central Seward Peninsula of northwestern Alaska. This area is classified as zones of either continuous and discontinuous permafrost. In 2002, wildfire burned a large area of this region. We selected an intact area and a burned area as research sites located close to one another and divided by a road. The surface organic layer was either combusted or reduced in thickness during the fire. It is assumed that the vegetation cover and subsurface conditions were similar between both sites before the fire. General vegetation at unburned sites was shrub-tussock tundra with more than 30 % evergreen shrubs, about 30 % deciduous shrubs and about 20 % sedges. Our studies of aerial photography and high-resolution satellite images showed that surface subsidence due to thermokarst developed differentially within some of the burned and vehicle-disturbed areas, exposing the polygonal reliefs on the surface. Within burned areas absent the thermokarst polygonal reliefs, soil moisture was higher at burned areas than unburned, and the active layer thickness was about 1.5-2.0 times deeper at the burned area during the initial stage of the study (2005-2007). In the following years, however, the difference in active layer thickness decreased, and thickness for the burned area seemed to be recovering to pre-fire status. Geophysical surveys demonstrated that there had been no detectable difference in the depth of the permafrost base between the burned and unburned areas. On the other hand, at the burned site with thermokarst polygonal reliefs, we confirmed using differential GPS that the polygonal reliefs actually coincides with depression lines along the subsurface ice wedge network. Near-surface unfrozen and frozen soil cores down to 1.6 m depth were sampled at seven and three points at burned and intact sites, respectively. Our geocryological analysis of cores has added evidence for permafrost disturbance, also suggesting that permafrost could be used for the reconstruction of development and degradation history of the study site.",

            "abstract": "Processes that influence H2O concentrations in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) and consequently regulate stratospheric humidity are investigated in simulations of clouds along backward trajectories of TTL parcels initialized with H2O measurements from Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). Trajectories are calculated using offline calculations of seasonal mean radiative heating rates in the tropics merged with MERRA extratropical heating rates and ERA-Interim temperature and wind data that have been modified to enhance wave-driven variability in the TTL. We also examine the impact of convective influence along parcel trajectories on cloud formation and dehydration. The distribution of 100 hPa H2O mixing ratios simulated on the final day of the trajectories in boreal winter 2006-07 resembles that of MLS with distinct minima over the western and eastern tropical Pacific, but exhibits an overall dry bias of approximately 20%. Averaged over the tropics, subgrid-scale waves dehydrate the 100 hPa level by ~0.5 ppmv, while convection and cloud microphysical processes moisten by ~0.5 and ~0.7 ppmv, respectively. These three processes combined increase the tropical mean H2O estimate by roughly 20% compared to that based solely on the Lagrangian Dry Point of the trajectories. Possible causes of the model dry bias and TTL cirrus statistics in comparison to those of recent aircraft campaigns will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Plasma density structures and associated irregularities in the nighttime midlatitude ionosphere are frequently observed as frontal structures elongated from northwest to southeast (NW-SE) in the Northern Hemisphere with a wavelength of 100-200 km, also known as medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs). The MSTIDs and the coupling process between the E and F regions are studied with a midlatitude ionosphere electrodynamics coupling (MIECO) model which can simulate two instability mechanisms: Perkins instability in the F region and sporadic-E (Es)-layer instability in the E region. Using the MIECO model, MSTID structure is reproduced from random perturbation on an Es layer in a wide horizontal coverage. A typical wavelength of ~150 km, larger amplitude, and smaller MSTID's tilt angles at lower latitudes are consistent with observations. It is shown that the polarization process in the E region driven by neutral winds is essentially important for the full development of MSTIDs as well as the seeding of NW-SE perturbation in the F region. The upgraded version of MIECO model comprises both hemispheres where electric field is solved by integrating conductivities in both hemispheres, and all other parameters such as plasma density and neutral wind are independent. In order to study the scale dependence of MSTIDs, the initial perturbation scale on the Es layer is given from 20 km to 320 km range. The results show that shorter scale perturbation tends to saturate faster both at the E and F regions, whereas the Es-layer instability does not work effectively at very long wavelength mode. As a result, the typical wavelength of MSTIDs (100-200 km) can be spontaneously generated without scale-dependent forcing.",

            "abstract": "In the northeast Japan arc, we can observe the along-arc variation of Quaternary volcano distribution, topography, seismic wave velocity, and Bouguer gravity anomaly whose characteristic wavelength is ~80 km. These observations may be related to 3D thermal structure in the mantle wedge and/or subducting Pacific slab. As a possible explanation of this, small-scale convection in the mantle wedge of thermal and chemical origin has been proposed so far. In this presentation, we will show another possible explanation for it.\nIt is known mainly based on surface heat flow observation that the mantle wedge in this region is decoupled from the subducting Pacific slab down to ~80 km depth for geological time scale. We also observe that the down-dip limit of low angle thrust type earthquakes in this region is ~50 km depth. These suggest that in the northeast Japan arc, the mantle wedge and the slab decouples by brittle failure down to 50 km depth and by plastic deformation from 50 to 80 km depth.\nIn order to test the effects of the plate interface on the thermal structure in this region, we construct 3D finite element models. The mantle flow is computed only in the mantle wedge, whereas temperature is computed for the whole model domain. We assume a thin, low viscosity layer just above the slab surface from 50 to 80 km depth to decouple the mantle wedge and the slab. We find that the along-arc variation in the slab surface temperature gradually develops with time. Its characteristic wavelength is ~100 km, which is comparable to or slightly higher than that observed. It arises because of the small-scale 3D circulation in the assumed low viscosity layer. The wavelength and the time of onset may depend on the viscosity and dimension of the low viscosity layer. Surface heat flow, on the other hand, does not show significant along-arc variation because forearc mantle is kept cold and hence rigid. These findings suggest that the observed along-arc variation in the northeast Japan arc originally comes from the variation in the slab surface temperature.",

The model is parameterized laterally by tessellated nodes and vertically as a series of geophysically identified layers, such as water, ice, sediments, crystalline crust, lithospheric lid, and asthenosphere. Model profiles are created by constructing an appropriate starting model and perturbing it to fit high-resolution surface wave dispersion maps (Love and Rayleigh, group and phase) over a wide frequency band (5-40 mHz). We will review the constructed model and compare it to a number of select studies at regional and global scales. We will also discuss avenues for future improvements if time and funding permit.

The cameras and spectrometer foreoptic are positioned on a pan-tilt mount on the tower that scans a 300o x 90o area every hour and allows us to collect images of hundreds of distinct plants. The imaging system is being used to test several approaches that have been proposed to detect vegetation stress, mortality, and species composition.

Such an encounter offers us the opportunity to do cometary flyby science for a dynamically new comet for the first time ever. Those observations have the potential to advance our understanding of comets in ways similar to previous flyby missions to periodic comets. An extensive observing campaign from many ground- and space-based platforms is supporting the “flyby” observations from Mars spacecraft. We will monitor the comet with Hubble Space Telescope for >24 hrs total observing time around the encounter, to obtain images of the inner coma at ~46 km/pix at the comet. These observations will allow us to perform detailed studies of the morphology of the dust and gas coma of C/Siding Spring, and to connect the observations performed from various platforms at various spatial resolutions and over a long time baseline. The ultimate goal is to correlate large-scale coma behaviors to the nucleus as resolved by MRO/HiRISE. We will report the HST observations and the preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Time is a central concept in geoscience. Geologic histories are composed of sequences of geologic processes and events. Calibration of their timing ties a local history into a broader context, and enables correlation of events between locations. The geologic timescale is standardized in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, which specifies interval names, and calibrations for the ages of the interval boundaries.\nTime is also a key concept in the world at large. A number of general purpose temporal ontologies have been developed, both stand-alone and as parts of general purpose or upper ontologies. A temporal ontology for geoscience should apply or extend a suitable general purpose temporal ontology.\nHowever, geologic time presents two challenges:\nGeology involves greater spans of time than in other temporal ontologies, inconsistent with the year-month-day/hour-minute-second formalization that is a basic assumption of most general purpose temporal schemes;\nThe geologic timescale is a temporal topology. Its calibration in terms of an absolute (numeric) scale is a scientific issue in its own right supporting a significant community. In contrast, the general purpose temporal ontologies are premised on exact numeric values for temporal position, and do not allow for temporal topology as a primary structure.\nWe have developed an ontology for the geologic timescale to account for these concerns. It uses the ISO 19108 distinctions between different types of temporal reference system, also linking to an explicit temporal topology model. Stratotypes used in the calibration process are modelled as sampling-features following the ISO 19156 Observations and Measurements model.\nA joint OGC-W3C harmonization project is underway, with standardization of the W3C OWL-Time ontology as one of its tasks. The insights gained from the geologic timescale ontology will assist in development of a general ontology capable of modelling a richer set of use-cases from geoscience.",

The technical aspects of my paper systematically studied the advanced geological exploration theory and application aspects for complicated tunnels, with discussion on the key technical points and useful conclusions.\nFor the all-aroundness and accuracy of advanced geological exploration results, the objective of my paper is targeted on the comprehensive examination on the structure and hydrous characteristic of the unfavorable geological bodies in complicated tunnels. By the multi-component seismic modeling on a more real model containing the air medium, the wave field response characteristics of unfavorable geological bodies can be analyzed, thus providing theoretical foundation for the observation system layout, signal processing and interpretation of seismic methods. Based on the tomographic imaging theory of seismic and electromagnetic method, 2D integrated seismic and electromagnetic tomographic imaging and visualization software was designed and applied in the advanced drilling hole in the tunnel face, after validation of the forward and inverse modeling results on theoretical models. The transmission wave imaging technology introduced in my paper can be served as a new criterion for detection of unfavorable geological bodies. After careful study on the basic theory, data processing and interpretation, practical applications of TSP and ground penetrating radar (GPR) method, as well as serious examination on their application examples, my paper formulated a suite of comprehensive application system of seismic and electromagnetic methods for the advanced geological exploration of complicated tunnels.\nThis research is funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41202223) .",

            "abstract": "A calibration, bridging and merging (CBaM) method has been developed to post-process outputs from general circulation models (GCMs) for seasonal forecasting of climate variables. An overview of the methodology and a summary of applications will be given.\nPost-processing of GCM forecasts is often necessary for the outputs to be more informative. CBaM attempts to maximise the value of GCM outputs by not only post-processing the variable of interest (calibration), but also using other available outputs such as sea surface temperatures to generate forecasts (bridging). Merging forecasts from calibration and bridging models leads to the opportunity to improve forecasting skill for some regions and time periods.\nIn CBaM, separate calibration and bridging models are established using a Bayesian joint probability modelling approach. The models generate forecasts in the form of ensembles. Forecasts from multiple calibration and bridging models are merged using Bayesian model averaging. Ensemble time series forecasts are produced by sequencing ensemble members using the Schaake Shuffle.\nResults to date are presented for a number of applications. The method is applied to produce gridded rainfall forecasts for Australia and China, using outputs from single or multiple GCMs. It is also applied to produce monthly forecasts of catchment rainfall for up to 12 months in advance. Monthly forecasts of catchment rainfall are used in a hydrological model to forecast streamflow for up to 12 months. CBaM forecasts are shown to extract skill from the atmospheric and oceanic modules of the GCM, and are also shown to be reliable.\nWork is in progress to apply CBaM to forecasts of other climate variables, including temperature, and to combine forecasts from multiple GCMs, including the ECMWF System 4 and NCEP CFSv2 models.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial discharge from the termini of tidewater glaciers drives submarine terminus melting, influences fjord circulation, erodes and redeposits subglacial sediment, and is a central component of proglacial marine ecosystems. The timing and variability of subglacial discharge can also exert a strong influence on the upstream flow of tidewater glaciers through hydrology-mediated changes in basal motion. However, a lack of observations of subglacial discharge at the ice-ocean interface hinders progress in understanding these processes and contributes to some of the largest uncertainties in sea level rise projections. Here we demonstrate that passive seismic observations collected adjacent to glaciers can meet this observational need. At tidewater and lake-terminating glaciers in Alaska and Greenland, we observe hourly to seasonal variations in low-amplitude, background seismic noise, termed glacio-hydraulic tremor. Variations in tremor amplitude correlate with discharge during the drainage of a glacially-dammed lake and reveal increases in discharge efficiency over the course of the melt season. Recordings of glacio-hydraulic tremor across a range of settings suggest widespread utility for our method. Reliable prediction of future sea level rise requires observations of subglacial discharge that elicit physical insight and can validate models. Our findings provide a platform for new understanding of ice-ocean interactions and related oceanographic, geologic, and ecological disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Past physics-based models of slow slip events (SSE) have shown that, when averaged over many SSE cycles, the shear stress within the SSE zone remains roughly constant. Stress accumulates between SSE, and then is released during slow slip events. However, the predicted long-term deformation rates from such models, assuming the plate boundary is locked to the top of the ETS zone, do not fit well GPS velocities and uplift rates determined from leveling and tide-gauge data. These physics-based models particularly misfit the vertical rates. At the same time, previous kinematic inversions display a gap between the down-dip limit of the locked region and the top of the ETS zone.\nOur inversions of geodetic data for fault slip rates exhibit a steeper slip-rate profile at the top of the ETS zone, relative to the constant shear stress model, as well as creep up dip of the ETS zone. We explore physics-based models with velocity-strengthening regions of different length up dip the ETS zone, i.e. within the “gap” identified in kinematic inversions. However, this still does not match the observations well. We therefore try a new approach: we invert for shear stress rates on the megathrust that best fit the data. We show that a small decrease in shear stress within the top of the ETS zone, reaching 5 kPa/year at a depth of ~ 30 km, is required to fit the data. Possible explanations for this include a slow decrease in normal stress with time, possibly due to an increase in pore pressure, or a reduction in fault friction. We explore these hypotheses, using 2D quasi-dynamic simulations with rate-and-state friction and isothermal v-cutoff models for generating slow slip events. The potential for creep above the top of the ETS zone has important implications for the mechanical relationship between deep slow slip and dynamic events in the locked region.",

This study aimed to detect possible changes in land-use patterns in response to biodiversity conservation and climate-change mitigation measures and the effects on ecosystem services across a watershed. For that purpose, we have developed a new method to combine land-use change scenarios and ecosystem service assessments. We analyzed land-cover change based on past and future scenarios in the rural Kushiro watershed in northern Japan. The analysis showed that if no conservation measures were implemented and the timber and agricultural industry remained small until 2060, supporting and provisioning services would decline due to less land management. Although biodiversity conservation measures are predicted to improve three of the ecosystem services that we studied, carbon sequestration and timber production would be improved to a greater degree by climate-change mitigation measures. The greatest land-cover changes are likely to occur in the unprotected area around the middle reaches of the Kushiro River, and such changes could affect the provision of ecosystem services throughout the entire watershed. Thus, our findings indicate that land-use decisions for the middle reaches of the watershed are particularly important for managing the integrated ecosystem services of the entire watershed for the future.",

            "abstract": "A realistic North Pacific simulation at high-resolution (1/30 degree in the horizontal and 100 vertical levels) highlights an efficient energy pathway, involving winter frontal instabilities at submesoscale set up by large-scale atmospheric forcings: these instabilities, through an inverse kinetic energy cascade, lead to a significant seasonal modulation of the kinetic energy over a broad scale range including submesoscales and mesoscales. The kinetic energy within the scale band of 10-200km is doubled in winter relatively to summer. This suggests a significant seasonal modulation of dispersion and transport of heat and tracers triggered by atmospheric forcings through this energy pathway. Monitoring such seasonal modulation is a major challenge because of the lack of high-resolution observations on a global scale. However the resulting meso/submesoscale field has been found to be statistically in geostrophic equilibrium at all seasons. This means that such modulation can be diagnosed, using the geostrophic approximation, from SSH data from the future SWOT and COMPIRA wide-swath altimeter missions.",

            "abstract": "The western end of the Sub-Himalayas is located in northern Pakistan, where salt tectonics greatly affects its deformation style of geological structures, hydrocarbon exploration and seismology. Three foreland sub-basins are located adjacent to each other in this area: the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range, Kohat Plateau-Surghar Range and the Bannu Basin-Marwat-Khisor Ranges. It is strongly believed that the difference in deformation intensity between these sub-basins is attributed to the presence or absence of a Pre-Cambrian salt layer. This study is an attempt to investigate the extent and role of salt in the geological deformation of northern Pakistan using the Small Baseline Subset Interferograms (SBAS) technique and 2-D seismic interpretations. 10 PALSAR images and 5 seismic profiles from the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range region were used in this study. SBAS results, derived from PALSAR images spanning from 2007 to 2010, suggest that the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range may still be tectonically active with the western portion of the region experiencing an uplift at an average rate of 12 mm/year. Time-migrated seismic profiles were interpreted, showing basement ramps due to normal faults. These ramps are believed to act as transition zones between different roles of salt; the salt layer acts as a decollement in northern Potwar Plateau while salt flow-induced structures are prominent in southern Potwar Plateau. These normal fault ramps are located in the central Salt Range and may be affecting the flow of salt by impeding the flow, which results in the salt being pushed to either side of the ramp. The integration of SBAS and 2D seismic interpretation has led to the suggestion that both the presence of the salt layer and the geometry of the basement influence the deformation style in northern Pakistan.",

This “one-way” communication runs counter to research suggesting that long-term impacts of park interpretive experiences must be established through direct connections with the visitor. Previous research in interpretation has suggested that interpretive experiences utilizing a “two-way” dialogue approach are more successful at facilitating long-term memories than “one-way” approaches where visitors have few, if any, opportunities to ask questions, offer opinions, or share interests and experiences. Long-term memories are indicators of connections to places and resources.\nGlobal anthropogenic change poses critical threats to NPS sites, resources, and visitor experiences. As climate change plays an ever-expanding role in public, political, social, economic, and environmental discourse it stands to reason that park visitors may also be interested in engaging in this discourse. Indeed, NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis stated in the agency’s Climate Change Action Plan 2012 – 2014 that, “We now know through social science conducted in parks that our visitors are looking to NPS staff for honest dialogue about this critical issue.\"\nResearchers from Indiana University will present preliminary findings from a multiple park study that assessed basic visitor knowledge and the impact of two-way interpretation related to climate change.

            "abstract": "Uplifted coral terraces throughout the Banda-Sunda Arc transition reveal how strain is distributed over the past thousand to million years in the active arc-continent collision, and are key to identifying hazardous active faults. U-series age analysis of the lowest coral terraces yields surface uplift rates that vary in a non-systematic way along strike from 0.2 to 1.5 mm/a over short wavelengths of a few kms. For example, coral terraces are tilted varying degrees northward in Sumba, SSE in Savu, NNW in Rote and generally south along the north coast of Timor. In all of these cases the tilt is away from zones of active thrusting and folding. In Sumba the forearc is ramping up and over the northern edge of the Scott Plateau along what is likely a north dipping thrust. In Savu the coral terraces rise where the back of the accretionary wedge is ramping up over the forearc basin on the south dipping Savu Thrust. In Rote coral terraces form on the front of the accretionary wedge where it is ramping up over the subducting Australian continental margin. The north coast of East Timor is likely uplifting due to internal thrusting and closure of the Wetar Strait. Localized uplift of circular islands is associated with diapirism. The diapiric island of Kisar is cored by syn-collisional metamorphic rocks.\nThe association of uplift and warping with short wavelength deformational processes argues against the commonly held interpretation that coral terraces in the Banda arc-continent collision manifest the effects of slab tear or some other lithospheric scale process. The pattern of uplift correlates best with proximity to active faults, folds and diapirs.\nIn terms of geohazards, flights of uplifted coral terraces are the smoking gun for sources of large earthquakes and tsunami. Many of the terraces show signs of co-seismic uplift. Tsunami deposits with young corals are found on some of these terraces as high as 20 m above sea level.",

            "abstract": "Investigating the response of ice sheets to climatic forcings in the past by climate-ice sheet modelling is important for understanding the ice sheets’ change. The 100-kyr cycle of the large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and fast termination of the glacial cycle are the prominent pattern known from paleoclimate records. We simulate the past glacial cycles with an ice sheet model, IcIES in combination with a general circulation model, MIROC, using the time series of insolation and atmospheric CO2. Feedback processes between ice sheet and atmosphere such as the ice albedo feedback, the elevation-mass balance feedback, desertification effect and stationary wave feedback are analyzed. We show that the threshold of termination of the glacial cycles can be explained by the pattern of the hysteresis of ice sheet change, i.e. multiple steady states of the ice sheets under climatic forcings. We find that slope of the upper branch of the multiple equilibria curve for Laurentide ice volumes is fundamental for the observed glacial patterns. Finally, we discuss the similarity and difference between the hysteresis structure of ice sheets variation for Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, Antarctica and Greenland.",

            "abstract": "A coastal region represents a dynamic interface where the processes of saltwater intrusion and freshwater flow create complex spatial and temporal changes in water chemistry. These changes in water chemistry affect both human use of coastal groundwater aquifers and the functioning of coastal ecosystems. Mapping out the subsurface distribution of saltwater and freshwater is a critical step in predicting, and managing, changes in water chemistry in coastal regions. Our research is focused on California’s Monterey Bay region where agriculturally-intensive land meets the sensitive marine environment of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Along the coast of Monterey Bay extensive groundwater extraction (groundwater provides more than 80% of the area’s water supply) has led to saltwater intrusion into aquifers at various locations. To date, the mapping of saltwater intrusion has relied on measurements of changing water chemistry in monitoring wells. But it is challenging with wells to capture the spatially complex hydrostratigraphy resulting from changing depositional environments and numerous faulting events. We suggest that geophysical methods be used to map and monitor the distribution of saltwater and freshwater by acquiring non-invasive, high-resolution continuous images of the subsurface. In a pilot study conducted over the past four years, we used electrical resistivity imaging to successfully identify regions of saltwater and freshwater 150 m below sea level along a 7 km stretch of the southern Monterey Bay coast. We employed large-offset electrical resistance tomography using a 96-electrode system with an overall array length of 860 m. The results showed excellent agreement with measurements in nearby monitoring wells. The large-scale image provided by the geophysical measurements revealed the hydrostratigraphic controls on the spatial distribution of the saltwater/freshwater interface. In October 2014 we will expand this study, using large-offset electrical resistance tomography to image to a depth of 300 m along a 40 km stretch of the Monterey Bay coast. The acquisition of this continuous dataset will provide an improved understanding of the biophysical and human factors controlling the processes of saltwater intrusion and freshwater flow in this coastal region.",

            "abstract": "Open biomass burning (OBB) experiments were performed in the laboratory environment to investigate the mixing state of refractory black carbon (rBC) in fresh smoke and its dependence on combustion state. A Single-Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) was adopted to measure variation of number size distribution of rBC-containing particles in high temporal resolution. General combustion state of each OBB case was indicated by modified combustion efficiency (MCE) using accumulated enhancement of mixing ratios of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide during the experiments. We found that mass equivalent diameter (MED) of rBC increased apparently with increase of MCE values, indicating the flaming-dominant combustion tend to produce the rBC particles with relative larger size, probably because of coagulation processes in high concentration condition. Coating thickness of rBC-containing particle was calculated by leading edge only fitting (LEO-fitting) method. In the present study we defined the rBC-containing particles with shell/core (S/C) ratio larger than 2 as “thickly coated” and that less then 1.5 as “thinly coated”. As a result, thickly coated rBC particles normally had a relatively small core (MED of rBC less than 150 nm) and its number fraction showed an evident decrease as a function of MCE value, whereas, larger rBC particles (MED larger than 150 nm) were normally thinly coated. Number fraction of both thinly coated and uncoated rBC particles had an positive correlation with MCE value. Substantial amount of light scattering particles (LSP) observed in the smoldering-dominant OBB plumes could partially explain the increase of number fraction of coated rBC particles. ∆rBC/∆CO ratio showed a good positive correlation with MCE with an average value of 16.8 (1.2 – 51.6) ng/m3/ppbv, and ∆rBC/∆CO2 ratio was found 628.7 ng/m3/ppmv, generally consistent with previous studies.",

This study focuses on the hydrological and sediment processes in the plateau, to provide scientific basis for local soil and water conservation planning. The Mabengnong catchment in southeast Tibet was selected as the study area. Field monitoring of rainfall, runoff and suspended sediment concentration was carried out during 2012 and 2013. Based on the field observation data, distributed models were used to analyze the hydrological and soil erosion processes in the study area. The following conclusions were derived through the study: (1) rainfall data shows that rainfall recorded at the nearby Nyingchi weather station was significantly correlated with rainfall observed in the study area and thus average precipitation durations and precipitation gradients were derived for different precipitation grades, ie., trace rain, light rain and moderate rain using both the Nyingchi weather station data and field observation data. (2) using the WEB-DHM hydrological model for runoff simulation, the results show that rainfall gradient has a great influence on the simulation results. Runoff will be seriously underestimated without consideration of rainfall gradient. (3) using the WASH123D sediment transport model for sediment flux simulation, the results show that the summer runoff suspended sediment concentration is mainly influenced by precipitation. The soil erosion parameterization scheme confirms that erosion intensity is closely related to rainfall intensity.",

            "abstract": "In a international geoscience prospect at the IPY, the ‘Polar Earth Observing Network (POLENET)’ was the largest contributions in establishing a seismic and GPS network in Antarctica. Several kinds of environmental signals associated with the atmosphere - ocean – cryosphere - solid earth systems were detected in the continental margins and surrounding oceans. Ice-related seismic motions for small magnitude events are generally named ‘ice-quakes’ ( ‘ice-shocks’) and can be generated by glacially related dynamics (Kanao et al., 2012). Such kinds of cryoseismic sources are consisted from the movements of ice sheets, sea-ice, oceanic tide-cracks, oceanic gravity waves, icebergs and the calving fronts of ice caps. Nettles and Ekstrom (2010), moreover, determined the hopocenter and magnitude of several large ice-quakes (glacial earthquakes) around Antarctica by using the long period surface wave data. These hypocenters locate mainly at the outlet of the large glaciers, otherwise the edge of ice shelves. Cryoseismic and oceanic waves (microseismis) are likely to be influenced by the variations in environmental conditions, including lower atmosphere, and the continuous study of their time-space variation provides indirect evidence of climate change. In this presentation, several characteristic features of cryoseismic waves observed the stations around the Lützow-Holm Bay (LHB) region are demonstrated, involving the surface environmental variations in vicinity of the area from continental coastal to the southern ocean. Hypocenters of local events in LHB, waveforms invlolving discharge of sea-ice, tide relating signals, as well as the tremor signals with characteristic frequency contents are demonstrated. As the glacial earthquakes are the most prominent evidence found recently in the polar region, these new innovative studies of polar seismology has been achieved on the basis of observational experiments and long-term monitoring under the extreme conditions in polar environment.",

The city cluster included five cities, which were Chengdu, Deyang, Mianyang, Meishan and Ziyang. Pollution source census and field measurements were conducted for the major emission sources such as the industry sources, on-road mobile sources, catering sources and the dust sources. The inventory results showed that in the year of 2012, the emission of SO2、NOX、CO、PM10、PM2.5、VOCs and NH3 in the region were 143.5、251.9、1659.9、299.3、163.5、464.1 and 995kt respectively. Chengdu, the provincial capital city, had the largest emission load of every pollutant among the cities. The industry sources, including power plants, fuel combustion facilities and non-combustion processes were the largest emission sources for SO2、NOX and CO, contributing to 84%, 46.5%, 35% of total SO2, NOX and CO emissions. On-road mobile sources accounted for 46.5%, 33%, 16% of the total NOx, CO, PM2.5 emissions and 28% of the anthropogenic VOCs emission. Dust and industry sources contributed to 42% and 23% of the PM10 emission with the dust sources also as the largest source of PM2.5, contributing to 27%. Anthropogenic and biogenic sources took 75% and 25% of the total VOCs emission while 36% of anthropogenic VOCs emission was owing to solvent use. Livestock contributed to 62% of NH3 emissions, followed by nitrogen fertilizer application whose contribution was 23%. Based on the developed emission inventory and local meteorological data, the regional air quality modeling system WRF-CMAQ was applied to simulate the status of PM2.5 pollution in a regional scale. The results showed that high PM2.5 concentration was distributed over the urban area of Chengdu and Deyang. On-road mobile sources and dust sources were two major contributors to the PM2.5 pollution in Chengdu, both had an contribution ratio of 27%. In Deyang, Mianyang, Meishan and Ziyang, industry sources had a relatively high contribution ratio to the PM2.5 pollution, accounting for about 35%, 33%, 38% and 24% respectively.",

            "abstract": "Destructive flash floods occurred more frequently in the small and medium river basins in China recently. However, meteorological and hydrological station networks in such river basins were usually poor. Some of them were newly-built only several years ago so that long-series observations are unavailable; and therefore, it is impossible to gain the most suitable parameters for flood forecast from the historical data directly. This paper developed a rolling flood forecast method for such regions, taking the Leli River basin in Guangxi Province, China, as the study area. The Digital Yellow River Integrated Model (DYRIM) was adopted to simulate the streamflows of the Tianlin hydrological station for each flood during the study period, and the model parameters were rolling optimized in real time as follows. First, the parameters were calibrated with the observed rainfall and streamflow data of the first flood, and they were used to forecast the flood caused by the next rain. Second, when the rain came true, the parameters were modified with the newly-observed rainfall and streamflow data if the simulation result obtained with the parameters of the last flood was not satisfied; and the new parameters would be used to forecast the next flood. Through repeating the above two steps for each flood, the parameters may be optimized constantly; and finally, the value ranges of the parameters could be obtained. From a sample demonstration, it can be concluded that this flood forecast method was feasible; it would be valuable for the flood forecast of river basins with newly-built meteorological and hydrological station network.",

            "abstract": "Singapore experienced an unprecedented 2-month dry spell at the beginning of 2014. A paltry 0.2 mm of rain in February, compared to the long-term monthly average of 161 mm, resulted in the driest month since 1869. Clear symptoms of water stress were observed in the evergreen vegetation of Singapore’s garden city, a number of bush fires broke out in vegetated areas, water reservoirs shrank substantially in size, and the dry weather in the region triggered wildfires in neighboring countries. The fires in peninsular Malaysia combined with the prevailing north-easterly winds generated hazy conditions with subsequent deterioration of the local air quality. In response to this rare climatological event, and contrary to other countries in the region, little action was taken to preserve water in Singapore. Water consumption actually increased 5%, likely due to increased bathing for relief during the hot and hazy days and increased watering of managed green spaces.\nThe reasons which resulted in increased water consumption are investigated in this paper from a climatological point of view. Using eddy covariance flux measurements of the different radiative and non-radiate (latent and sensible heat) fluxes conducted over a low-rise neighborhood, the changes in the components of the energy balance associated with the dry spell are investigated. An increase of 17% in net radiation and drier daytime conditions produced an increase of 45% in sensible and reduction of 14% in latent heat fluxes, respectively. The heat stored in the urban canopy increased by 3% compared to previous years.\nAlthough the projected impacts of climate change for Singapore are uncertain, an increase in frequency of dry periods like the 2014 episode are possible in Southeast Asia. A holistic approach, which includes aspects of the urban microclimate, is necessary to implement effective measures to reduce water demand and assure the water resilience of Singapore.",

Modelers use global and regional emissions inventories to assess temporal and spatial distribution of these emissions to estimate their impacts on regional and global air quality and climate. However, large uncertainties exist in emissions inventories and quantification of this uncertainty is essential for better understanding of the linkage between emissions and air quality, climate, and health. We focus on this uncertainty by comparing emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) from China in four different emissions inventories: Regional Emissions in Asia (REASv2.1); Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC); Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.2), and the inventory by Zhao. In addition to the total emissions, we also analyzed emissions from five sectors and at the provincial level, and found that large disagreements (~seven fold) among the four inventories exist in residential and transport sectors.",

Incomplete spatio-temporal observations of the full ocean water column, overlying ocean-ice-atmosphere fluxes, and adjacent polar dynamics challenge our ability to model the Southern Ocean. However, several studies have indicated this region is particularly important in the evolving climate, including the anthropogenic influences. Models coherently capture large-scale Southern Ocean patterns, however it is the magnitude and location of these patterns that varies widely. In particular, difficulties with modelling of small scale processes remains an outstanding issue.

            "abstract": "Boreal forests occupy latitudes that are experiencing the greatest rates of warming on earth, a pattern that is expected to continue over the coming decades. Much of the Boreal is underlain by permafrost, which can be expected to have important consequences for forest structure, composition and functioning as the climate warms. The southern margin of permafrost is especially susceptible to warming, since in this region, the permafrost is discontinuous, relatively thin, warm and ice-rich. In the discontinuous permafrost zone, permafrost often forms the physical foundation on which trees develop, forming tree-covered peat plateaus where trees contribute to permafrost maintenance and aggradation processes through reductions in radiation load and changes in snow accumulation. Forests are restricted to peat plateaus while wetland communities occupy intervening permafrost-free areas. The extent and distribution of each land cover type is an important determinant of how boreal forest-wetland landscapes in the discontinuous permafrost zone function as part of the climate system. Climate warming is rapidly thawing permafrost leading to ground surface subsidence and transformation of the forests into wetlands, increasing both the areal extent and connectivity of the latter. In this presentation, we will use an integrative framework at the ForestGEO Scotty Creek Forest Dynamics Plot site near Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories, Canada to demonstrate the changes in ecological, hydrological and biosphere-atmosphere interactions within this boreal forest-wetland landscape characterized by rapidly degrading permafrost.",

            "abstract": "A good ice thickness history model is essential in the study of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), its effects on coastal engineering, water resource management, fault stability and intraplate earthquakes, monitor global climate change, etc...\nIce history models can be constructed based on glaciology and climate data only, but Peltier mainly used GIA observations and simple ice physics to construct global models ICE-4G, 5G & 6G where the main uncertainty is the ice thickness in Antarctica and western Laurentide during the last glacial maximum.\nOne should note that most of the ice models constructed this way are based on the assumption that mantle rheology is linear and that rheology varies in the radial direction only. However, surface geology and seismic tomography show that Earth properties also vary strongly in the lateral direction. Moreover, high temperature creep experiments on mantle rocks show that mantle flow is better described by composite rheology since both diffusion (linear) and dislocation (nonlinear) creep operate in the mantle at the same time. The aim of our study is to construct global ice history models that are consistent with composite rheology and lateral heterogeneity. Thus we use the Coupled Poisson-Finite Element method to model GIA in a spherical, self-gravitating viscoelastic Earth with composite rheology and lateral heterogeneity.\nWe shall follow the approach of Peltier and use GIA observations and simple ice physics as constraints to our ice model. The limitation of using sea level data is that they only lie near the coast and thus there is little constraint on ice thickness inland. To overcome this, we will use gravity rate-of-change data from GRACE with the effect of hydrology accurately removed using GPS observations (rather than GIA models which introduce large uncertainties). However, these data only give the current-day rate-of-change, which is more than 8,000 years after the end of deglaciation. To further constrain our ice model, we also use river incision data which records tilting of the land since the formation of the river after local ice melted. We will also use the paleo-stress orientations induced from postglacial faults formed near the end of deglaciation to further constrain ice thickness changes. Some preliminary results will be presented.",

We investigate how land development influences spatial and temporal evolution of the carbon cycle from small streams to major rivers in the Eastern U.S. Along the watershed continuum, we show that there is spatial evolution in: (1) the amount, chemical form, and bioavailability of carbon; (2) carbon retention/release at the reach scale; and (3) ecosystem metabolism of carbon from headwaters to coastal waters. Over shorter time scales, the interaction between land use and climate variability alters magnitude and frequency of carbon \"pulses\" in watersheds. Amounts and forms of carbon pulses in agricultural and urban watersheds respond similarly to climate variability due to headwater alteration and loss of ecosystem services to buffer runoff and temperature changes. Over longer time scales, land use change has altered organic carbon concentrations in tidal waters of Chesapeake Bay, and there have been increased bicarbonate alkalinity concentrations in rivers throughout the Eastern U.S. due to human activities. In summary, our analyses indicates that the form and reactivity of carbon have evolved over space and time along the watershed continuum with major implications for downstream ecosystem metabolism, biological oxygen demand, carbon dioxide production, and river alkalinization.",

            "abstract": "In 2007, the first cap and trade legislation for a catchment nitrogen (N) budget was enacted to protect water quality in New Zealand’s iconic Lake Taupo. The clarity of the 616 km² N-limited oligotrophic lake was declining due to human-induced increases in N losses from the 3,487 km² catchment. Focus was placed on reversing increases in N inputs from agriculture, and to a lesser degree sewerage sources. The legislation imposed a cap equal to 20% reduction in the N inputs to the lake, and enabled trading.\nThe landmark legislation could have failed during appeal. Sources of disagreement included the N budgeting model and grand-parenting method that benchmarked the N leaching of individual farms. The N leaching rates for key land uses were also a major battleground, with strong effects on the viability of trading and relative value of enterprises. Sufficient science was applied to resolve the substantive issues in the appeal by 2008. Crucially, the decision recognized that N inputs to the “N cascade” mattered more than leaching evidence including land-use legacies.\nOther catchment cap-and-trade schemes followed. Rotorua Lakes had already capped inputs and established a ~33% N input reduction target after acceptance of a trading scheme compatible with groundwater lag times. In the Upper Manawatu catchment, a cap-and-trade scheme now governs river N loads in a more typical farming region, with an innovative allocation scheme based on the natural capital of soils.\nCollectively, these schemes have succeeded in imposing a cap, and signaling the intention of reductions over time. I conclude with common themes in the successes, and examine the role of science in the success and ongoing implementation.\nCentral to success has been the role of science in framing N budgets at farm and catchment scales. Long-term data has been invaluable, despite the need to correct biases. Cap-and-trade policies alter future science needs toward reducing uncertainty in overall budgets, the ability to measure success or failure in innovative source reductions at a management scale, and defining quantitative measures of aquatic health. Broadly, the schemes have enabled a culture of innovation, in farming and research. For example, recent evidence suggests it may be possible to flip the Rotorua Lakes into a P limitation regime through alum dosing.",

            "abstract": "Distributed modelling or conceptual hydrologic modelling – this is a dilemma that hydrologists have grappled with since long. While distributed hydro-ecological models are conceptually elegant and physically defensible, are they practical to apply given the significant computational burden they come at? One possible way of improving their computational efficiency is presented here.\nA new approach of modelling over an equivalent cross-section (ECS) is investigated. A homogenization test indicates that the representation of soil type is most critical in forming the ECS. If the soil type remains same within the sub-basin, a single ECS is formulated. If the soil type follows a specific pattern, i.e., different soil types near the centre of the river, middle of hillslope and ridge line, three ECSs (left bank, right bank and head water) are required. ECSs are formulated for 8 first order sub-basins and simulated using a 2-dimensional, Richards’ equation based distributed hydrological model. Simulated fluxes are multiplied by the weighted area of each ECS to calculate the total fluxes from the sub-basins.\nTo assess the accuracy of the ECS approach, the sub-basins are also divided into equally spaced multiple hillslope cross-sections. These cross-sections are simulated in fully distributed settings using the above model. The simulated fluxes are multiplied by the contributing area of each cross-section to get total fluxes from each sub-basin referred as reference fluxes. At the first order sub-basin scale, results show that the simulated fluxes using an ECS approach are very close to the reference fluxes and computational time is reduced of the order of ~4 to ~22 times compared to the fully distributed settings. Overall, the accuracy achieved in dominant fluxes, transpiration and soil evaporation, is higher than the other fluxes. Over a larger catchment with 822 sub-basins reasonable accuracy in simulated runoff against observed discharge is achieved. As a result, this approach provides a great potential for implementation of distributed hydrological models at regional scales. ",

            "abstract": "Water availability to riparian trees in lowlands is controlled through precipitation and its infiltration into floodplain soils, and through river discharge additions to the hyporheic water table. The relative contributions of both water sources to the root zone within river floodplains vary through time, depending on climatic fluctuations. There is currently limited understanding of how climatic fluctuations are expressed at local scales, especially in ‘critical zone’ hydrology, which is fundamental to the health and sustainability of riparian forest ecosystems. This knowledge is particularly important in water-stressed Mediterranean climate systems, considering climatic trends and projections toward hotter and drier growing seasons, which have the potential to dramatically reduce water availability to riparian forests.\nOur aim is to identify and quantify the relative contributions of hyporheic (discharge) water v. infiltrated precipitation to water uptake by riparian Mediterranean trees for several distinct hydrologic years, selected to isolate contrasts in water availability from these sources. Our approach includes isotopic analyses of water and tree-ring cellulose, mechanistic modeling of water uptake and wood production, and physically based modeling of subsurface hydrology. We utilize an extensive database of oxygen isotope (δ18O) measurements in surface water and precipitation alongside recent measurements of δ18O in groundwater and soil water and in tree-ring cellulose. We use a mechanistic model to back-calculate source water δ18O based on δ18O in cellulose and climate data. Finally, we test our results via 1-D hydrologic modeling of precipitation infiltration and water table rise and fall. These steps enable us to interpret hydrologic cycle variability within the ‘critical zone’ and their potential impact on riparian trees.",

            "abstract": "Ted Irving was no stranger to the Precambrian when he began paleomagnetic studies in the Canadian Shield (CS) that would dominate his research in the early and mid-1970’s. Twenty years before, his graduate work on billion-year-old strata in Scotland established paleomagnetic methodologies applicable to sedimentary rocks generally. In 1958, he and Ronald Green presented an ‘Upper Proterozoic’ APW path from Australia as evidence for pre-Carboniferous drift relative to Europe and North America (the poles actually range in age from 1.2 to 2.7 Ga). His first published CS poles were obtained from the Franklin LIP of the Arctic platform and demonstrate igneous emplacement across the paleoequator. Characteristically, his 1971 poles are statistically indistinguishable from the most recent grand mean paleopole of 2009. His main focus, however, was on the question of Precambrian continental drift. He compared APW paths with respect to Laurentia with those obtained from other Precambrian shields, and he compared APW paths from different tectonic provinces within the CS. He was consistently antagonistic to the concept of a single long-lived Proterozoic supercontinent, but he was on less certain ground regarding motions within the CS due to inadequate geochronology. With Ron Emslie, he boldly proposed rapid convergence between parts of the Grenville Province and Interior Laurentia (IL) ~1.0 Ga. This was controversial given the uncertain ages of multiple magnetic components in high-grade metamorphic rocks. With John McGlynn and John Park, he developed a Paleoproterozoic APW path for the Slave Province from mafic dikes and red clastics, encompassing the time of consolidation of IL during 2.0-1.8 Ga orogenesis. Before 1980, he constructed Paleoproterozoic APW paths for IL as a whole, finding little evidence for significant internal displacement. He recognized that the Laurentian APW path describes a series of straight tracks linked by hairpins, the latter corresponding in age to major orogenic events. He did not ascribe any hairpin to collisional orogenesis within IL, outward facing margins excluded, nor any track to true polar wander. After 1980, however, he argued that existing poles were too poorly dated to rule out interior plate motions. Irving was a strict empiricist who fearlessly went where his data led him, and no farther.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to understand the dynamics and evolution of dryland basins are complicated by the episodic nature of rainstorms, which generate discontinuous hillslope and channel flows and heterogeneous supply of sediment from hillslopes. Moreover, rainstorms in drylands tend to be highly spatially variable and often smaller than the basin area. Coupled with low infiltration rates and stony soils, rainstorms erode sediment from hillslopes, the grain size distribution of which varies depending on storm characteristics. Therefore, in these landscapes, the discrete and spatially variable nature of convective rainstorms and other basin characteristics create challenges for deterministic modeling of surface dynamics and evolution. Here we investigate the evolution of grain sizes on the hillslopes and in the channel over decadal timescales using a particle-based hillslope sediment transport model driven by a stochastic rainstorm generator that samples from probability density functions of storm properties (total annual rainfall, location, size, duration, peak rainfall intensity). We investigated sediment dynamics and grain size evolution based on data collected within a 170 km2 semi-arid basin in SE Spain. Over decadal timescales, our modeling suggests significant sediment redistribution on steeper hillslopes over multiple storm cycles, whereas low gradient hillslopes do not exhibit dramatic sediment size changes over time. At the reach scale, the cumulative effect of decades of storms is that the median fraction (D50) of sediment supplied by the hillslope is preserved in the coarse fraction of the channel grain size distribution (D90). Therefore, despite large fluctuations in supplied grain size from individual rainstorms, over decadal timescales, the inter-storm variability in coarse grain sizes supplied to the channel from hillslopes tends to converge to a characteristic grain size that reflects the balance between the most frequently occurring runoff event and the hillslope gradient and length. The combination of physics-based modeling with stochastic climate representation generates insights into the storm-driven dynamics and evolution of dryland basins.",

            "abstract": "Large-scale two-dimensional (2D) full particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are carried out for studying the relationship between the dynamics of a perpendicular shock and microinstabilities generated at the shock foot. The structure and dynamics of collisionless shocks are generally determined by Alfven Mach number and plasma beta, while microinstabilities at the shock foot are controlled by the ratio of the upstream bulk velocity to the electron thermal velocity and the ratio of the plasma-to-cyclotron frequency. With a fixed Alfven Mach number and plasma beta, the ratio of the upstream bulk velocity to the electron thermal velocity is given as a function of the ion-to-electron mass ratio. The present 2D full PIC simulations with a relatively low Alfven Mach number (MA ∼ 6) show that the modified two-stream instability is dominant with higher ion-to-electron mass ratios. It is also confirmed that waves propagating downstream are more enhanced at the shock foot near the shock ramp as the mass ratio becomes higher. The result suggests that these waves play a role in the modification of the dynamics of collisionless shocks through the interaction with shock front ripples.",

In this study the elasticity of cubic CaPv is reinvestigated using density functional constant-temperature first principles molecular dynamics simulations with strict calculation conditions. First, we computed the stable structure of CaPv and found that the cubic phase is more stable than the tetragonal and orthorhombic in the LM P,T condition. The thermal equation of state of CaPv was analyzed using the MD data set, which indicates its thermal properties including Gruneisen parameter quite similar to those of Bd. Along the adiabatic temperature, CaPv was found to have higher density than the PREM and 12.5% iron-bearing Bd. Next, we calculated elastic constants of cubic CaPv. Our new results clearly demonstrate that cubic CaPv does not have anomalously large shear modulus suggested by previous calculations with a small computation cell. This is because the cell applied in the previous studies is too small to allow the rotational phonon motion of SiO6 octahedra related to the zone boundary optic phonon instability. Acoustic wave velocities were finally determined from the elastic moduli, indicating no significant differences in velocities between CaPv and iron-bearing MgPv.",

An example is the Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, which has been using fault-based models to compute conditional probabilities in California since 1988. An example of a forecast is the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS), which is based on the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) magnitude-frequency law, the Omori aftershock law, and Poisson statistics. The method discussed in this talk is based on the observation that GR statistics characterize seismicity for all space and time. Small magnitude event counts (quake counts) are used as “markers” for the approach of large events. More specifically, if the GR b-value = 1, then for every 1000 M>3 earthquakes, one expects 1 M>6 earthquake. So if ~1000 M>3 events have occurred in a spatial region since the last M>6 earthquake, another M>6 earthquake should be expected soon. In physics, event count models have been called natural time models, since counts of small events represent a physical or natural time scale characterizing the system dynamics. In a previous research, we used conditional Weibull statistics to convert event counts into a temporal probability for a given fixed region. In the present paper, we move belyond a fixed region, and develop a method to compute these Natural Time Weibull (NTW) forecasts on a global scale, using an internally consistent method, in regions of arbitrary shape and size. We develop and implement these methods on a modern web-service computing platform, which can be found at\nwww.openhazards.com\nand\nwww.quakesim.org\n. We also discuss constraints on the User Interface (UI) that follow from practical considerations of site usability.",

The physical properties of the plasma vary drastically from the convection zone to the corona, with a density drop of 14 orders of magnitude. The interaction between the plasma and magnetic fields strongly distort the field structure during the emergence. The emerged fields dominate the dynamics in the corona and may drive magnetic eruptions, with significant release of magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy of the plasma. Here we present numerical simulations of flux emergence into pre-existing fields in a coupled convection-zone-corona system, and study the resulting eruption of the magnetic fields in the corona, e.g. blowout jets. Analysis of the simulation results illustrates how the mass and energy is transferred from the interior into outer atmosphere during the eruptions. Comparison with modern observations provides us a physical understanding of the observed coronal eruptions in flux emerging regions.",

            "abstract": "Geyser eruption intervals are determined by rates of water and heat discharge into shallow subsurface reservoirs and the conduit. In some geysers, small amounts of water discharge prior to a main eruption ('Preplay') can affect eruption intervals. Water discharge during preplay reduces the hydrostatic pressure, which in turn, induces boiling of water that is at, or near the critical temperature. Ascending steam slugs from depth can also lead to shorter eruption intervals (Namiki et al., 2014). In April 2014, we carried a five day experiment at Lone Star Geyser, Yellowstone National Park. Eruptions and their preplays were recorded with an infrared sensor that measured temperature variations immediately above the geyser cone (3.4~m high), temperature loggers that measured water temperature at the base of the cone and in the outflow channels, and visual observations. At Lone Star Geyser, during the preplay phase of the eruption, mainly liquid water is erupted, whereas the main phase of the eruption begins with the liquid-water dominated eruption and turns into the steam discharge. The temperature rise in an outflow channel indicates the occurrence of preplays and initiation of the main eruption. The acquired data suggests that the preplay patterns of Lone Star Geyser are vigorous and complex, consistent with previous observations (Karlstrom et al., 2013). Our new observations reveal two typical styles: 1) vigorous preplays with few events (<5) and long intervals (>20~minutes) that last approximately 40~minutes, and 2) less vigorous preplays that include several events (>5) with short intervals (few minutes), and continue approximately for one hour. Probability distributions of preplay durations show two peaks indicating the bimodal activity. The bimodality of Lone Star preplays may be a result of subtle change of temperature distribution in a convecting reservoir which has been observed in laboratory experiments (Toramaru and Maeda, 2013).",

            "abstract": "The original and innovative aspect of this programme stems from giving students the opportunity to install a seismometer in their school. The recorded signals, reflecting regional or global seismic activity, feed into an on-line database, a genuine seismic resource centre and a springboard for educational and scientific activities.\nThe network ’EduSismo’ (numbering some hundred stations installed in metropolitan France, the overseas departments and territories and a few French high schools abroad) is the outgrowth of an experiment conducted some twenty years back. Since then, the programme implemented has gone beyond simply acquiring seismic signals, which could have been procured by research and monitoring centres. By appropriating a scientific measurement, the student becomes personally involved and masters complex concepts about geophysics and geosciences. The development of simple devices and the design of concrete experiments associated with an investigative approach make it possible to instil the students with a high-quality scientific culture and an education about risks. Today, this programme is expanding with new tools providing by new research projects.\nSince last year, students can investigate ocean sound recorded by ‘Mermaid’ buoys and downloaded directly the data in the schools. Geosciences at school are opening new activities with seismic data from the ocean but also study of oceanographic currents or atmospheric events.\nWe are also preparing actively the French E&O plan for SEIS-InSight (the future mission on Mars). InSight (Interior exploration using Seismic Investigation, Geodesy and Heat Transport) is a NASA Discovery Program mission that would place a single geophysical lander on Mars to study its deep interior. This program will provide to the schools a lot of innovative tools related to scientific culture to bring more geosciences into the classroom.\nAs in the past, the French educational network will get the benefit of these new research programs to provide more tools to teach geosciences in the high schools.\nKeys words : seismology, Mermaid, SEIS-InSight, network, education, citizen science",

            "abstract": "The fate and dynamics of water stable isotopologues (1H2H16O and 1H218O) are currently well implemented into physically based Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models (e.g. Hydrus 1D, SiSPAT-I, Soil–Litter iso, TOUGHREACT). However, contrary to other state variables (e.g., water content and tension) that can be monitored over long periods (e.g., by time-domain reflectometry, capacitive sensing, tensiometry or micro-psychrometry), water stable isotope compositions (δ2H and δ18O) are analyzed following destructive sampling, and thus are available only at a given time. Thus, there are important discrepancies in time resolution between soil water and stable isotope information which greatly limit the insight potential of the latter.\nRecently however, a technique based on direct infrared laser absorption spectroscopy was developed that allows simultaneous and direct measurements of δ2H and δ18O in water vapor.\nHere, we present a non-destructive method for monitoring soil liquid δ2H and δ18O by sampling and measuring water vapor equilibrated with soil water using gas-permeable polypropylene tubing and a Cavity Ring-Down laser Spectrometer (CRDS).\nAn acrylic glass column (d=11 cm, h=60 cm) was (i) equipped with temperature and soil water probes in addition to gas-permeable tubing sections at eight different depths, (ii) filled with pure quartz sand, (iii) saturated from the bottom, and (iv) installed on weighing balances and let dry for 250 days.\nEach day, soil vapor δ2H and δ18O were measured for each depth by purging the soil water vapor sampled in the tubing sections with dry air and analyzing it with a CRDS. Soil liquid water δ2H and δ18O were then inferred from the values measured in the vapor.\nThe experimental setup allowed following the evolution of the soil water δ2H and δ18O profile, which developed as a result of isotope convective capillary rise and back-diffusion of the stable isotope excess at the soil surface due to fractionating soil evaporation, with unprecedentedly high temporal resolution. As the soil dried out, we could show for the first time the increasing influence of the depleted ambient water vapor on the enriched liquid water close to the soil surface. Finally, the obtained data was simulated using the fully coupled 1D isotope-enabled SVAT model SiSPAT-Isotope.",

            "abstract": "For U-Pb dating of small zircon grains as well as for nuclear forensics, sample volume is limited and the ion beam currents in TIMS analyses are typically down to the fA range. For some samples, all ion beams are measured sequentially in a peak jumping experiment using a single collector ion counting detector, i.e. a Daly or a secondary electron multiplier. Such analyses do not take advantage of multicollection and require reasonable ion beam stability. Because of the sequential measurement sample utilization is a concern. With respect to the attainable precision and accuracy, there are at least two major ion counter characteristics to be dealt with: 1) linearity effects related to the dead time of the ion counter and 2) the mass-dependent detection efficiency of the ion counter inducing an instrumental mass bias effect. Both effects need proper calibration and monitoring otherwise could lead to systematic errors. For instance, the accurate measurement of a 1 Mcps signal down to 0.01% would require an accuracy of the dead time correction to <100 ps, which in itself is a challenge. Also proper calibration of detector-induced mass bias effects to the required precision of 0.01% is difficult. For demanding applications like high-precision U-Pb geochronology TIMS measurements, the goal is even to get precision and accuracy down to 100 ppm.\nIn this paper, we present our latest developments on low noise Faraday cup amplifier technology, that completely avoids the dead time calibration as well as instrumental mass bias effects introduced by ion counters. Faraday cup detectors have proven accuracy down to the ppm range, but have a limitation due to the Johnson noise involved in classical current 1011 Ohm amplifiers. We have developed new current amplifiers using 100 times larger resistor values of 1013 Ohm, giving a signal-to-noise improvement of a factor of 10 over the classical 1011Ohm current amplifiers. As such the final precision of very small sample measurements on Faraday cups can potentially be improved by a factor of 10 too.\nThis presentation will focus on the analysis of small Pb and U using TIMS, for geochronology and nuclear forensics. In our setup, all U and Pb isotopes are measured simultaneously on Faraday cups, except 204Pb which is collected on the SEM since the 204Pb is the least abundant and required for common lead correction.",

            "abstract": "Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are a key species in atmospheric photochemistry. In the lower atmosphere, up to ~30% of the primary OH radical production is attributed to the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO), and field observations suggest a large missing source of HONO. The dominant sources of N(III) in soil, however, are biological nitrification and denitrification processes, which produce nitrite ions from ammonium (by nitrifying microbes) as well as from nitrate (by denitrifying microbes). We show that soil nitrite can release HONO and explain the reported strength and diurnal variation of the missing source. The HONO emissions rates are estimated to be comparable to that of nitric oxide (NO) and could be an important source of atmospheric reactive nitrogen. Fertilized soils appear to be particularly strong sources of HONO. Thus, agricultural activities and land-use changes may strongly influence the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. A new HONO-DNDC model was developed to simulate the evolution of HONO emissions in agriculture ecosystems. Because of the widespread occurrence of nitrite-producing microbes and increasing N and acid deposition, the release of HONO from soil may also be important in natural environments, including forests and boreal regions.\n",

            "abstract": "Convection in the solar interior is thought to comprise structures on a spectrum of scales. Here, we analyze observations of the wavefield in the solar surface using techniques of time-distance helioseismology to image convective flows in the solar interior. We downsample and synthesize 900 billion wavefield observations taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to produce 3 billion cross-correlations, which we average and fit, measuring 5 million wave travel times. Using these travel times, we deduce the underlying flow systems and study their statistics to bound convective velocity magnitudes in the solar interior as a function of depth and spherical-harmonic degree. At degrees less than 60, convective velocities are 20–100 times weaker than current theoretical estimates. Advection is dominated by Coriolis forces in this regime, with Rossby numbers smaller than 0.01 in the interior. This constraint suggests the prevalence of a different paradigm of turbulence from that predicted by existing models. Convective Reynolds stresses, thought to power observed large-scale rotational shear and meridional circulation in the Sun, would be too weak by three orders in magnitude. In this talk I will discuss the seismic analyses that went into generating this result and the current understanding of this puzzle.",

            "abstract": "The Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST) estimated the level of dynamic friction on the shallow portion of the fault that had the very large slip during the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. From both laboratory experiments on the fault zone material and temperature measurements across the fault zone, the shear stress during the earthquake rupture was estimated to be about 0.6 MPa at 820 meters below the sea floor (including the water depth this is equivalent to about 3. 5 km of rock overburden). This shear stress corresponds to a coefficient of friction of about 0.1. Combining these results with estimates of the radiated energy, show that the ratio of frictional heat to radiated energy is about 1 to 5 for the shallow portion of the fault,\nThese estimates are related to the large slip portion of the earthquake in the shallow region of the megathrust and are likely not representative of the deeper portions of the earthquake rupture area.",

            "abstract": "The building of a craton involves the extraction of continental crust from the Earth's mantle and the lateral accretion of juvenile volcanic terranes. Ascertaining which conditions allow a newborn continental assemblage to survive requires information on its mechanical strength, which depends on the amount and vertical distribution of radioactive elements in the crust. There is thus a connection between crust formation mechanisms and a successful amalgamation process.\nTo address outstanding questions concerning Archean cratons, the Superior province in Canada is the perfect region because it contains a well preserved geological record of accretion that provides compelling evidence for plate tectonic processes at 2.7 Ga. At almost the same time, the rate of continental growth decreased significantly, which may result from either slower crust formation or enhanced destruction through erosion and subduction. These issues are linked to the strength of the newborn continent.\nThe extensive heat flow data set now available in the Superior Province reveals a clear demarcation between a chemically depleted and differentiated craton core and weakly differentiated enriched juvenile accreted terranes. The Superior craton was thus made of a strong core surrounded by weak terranes. This dichotomy implies that the accretion process could not involve complex imbrication of the accreted belts into the craton core. Subsequently, the craton may have been protected from convective disruption or delamination by its weak margins. Differences between the craton core and accreted terranes may be due to different crustal extraction processes, such as melting in a mantle plume or magmatism in a subduction zone. If subduction started at about 3 Ga, as advocated by several authors, the assembly and survival of large cratons may well be a consequence of this key shift in mantle activity. Alternatively, the chemical depletion of the craton core may be due to a prolonged history of internal differentiation leading to an enriched upper crust that gets eroded away.",

            "abstract": "Enhanced tidal currents close to an island appear to present the potential for power extraction. In this research, a three-dimensional numerical model is employed to predict the tidal current energy extraction potential from turbine arrays near an island. One of the significant challenges is to determine an optimal configuration of turbine array. This paper presents a detailed work to investigate the combined influences of topographic features and array configuration on the performance of power generation. Three single row arrays and three multiple-row arrays, with turbines being arranged in a staggered manner, are examined. It has been found that a single row array with a relatively small spacing between two turbines could achieve good efficiency due to the blockage effects, whereas a larger lateral spacing gives a better performance for multi-row arrays. The reason is that the bypass flow in a staggered layout would results in shadowing effect on downstream turbines. Model results also show that the wake influence can be minimized by increasing not only the longitudinal spacing, but also the lateral spacing. The tidal current flows are shown to have been affected by the inclusion of turbines, with less fluctuant wave in a tidal cycle. The extents of the observed impacts are not only within the turbine array field, but also moving around the island and propagating to the far-field. This study can be used to provide the reference information of the commercial-scale farms for tidal energy development.\nKeywords: Tidal currents; Array configuration; Energy extraction; Hydrodynamic process",

            "abstract": "Current solar image archives contain information, lots of information, often so much information that \"end-point science\" is not immediately clear at the start of a project to survey them. However, in such datasets and their metadata, significant scientific could be hidden just a few queries below the surface. We will discuss quite possibly the largest astronomical database, the \"EUV Brightpoint Database\", which contains information about over 200 million individual features that are ubiquitously observed in the Sun's corona - EUV Brightpoints (or BPs). While end-point science was not clear in 2002 when the project to catalog the Sun’s BPs in the archive of SOHO's Extreme Ultraviolet Telescope (EIT) images began the impact of those few queries could cause a quite a stir in the field.\nOur systematic analysis of BPs, and the magnetic scale on which they appear to form, allowed us to demonstrate that the landmarks of sunspot cycle 23 could be explained in terms of the evolution and interaction of latitudinally and temporally overlapping bands of magnetic activity. Those bands appear to belong to the Sun’s 22-year magnetic activity cycle. The patterns that these bands make closely match helioseismic inference of the Sun’s torsional oscillation - a signature of rotational anomalies taking place the Sun’s interior. The high-latitude origin and start dates preceding sunspot formation by more than a decade - on the same activity band - pose a significant challenge to our understanding of the processes responsible for the production of the Sun’s quasi-decadal variability.\nWe sincerely doubt that the BP database is alone in containing information of such potential scientific value. Often one just has to get lucky, before being able to formulate the correct queries. We hope that the material presented in this talk can motivate a scientific exploitation of the computer vision databases currently being built from the stunning images of our star in addition to some retrospective investigations.",

            "abstract": "The coastal zone of the southern Po plain is characterized by low lying land, which is reclaimed to permit settlements and agriculture. The history, tourism resorts and peculiar coastal environments make this territory attractive and valuable. Natural and fluid-extraction-induced land subsidence along with coastal erosion are major problems. Touristic development has strongly modified the landscape; coastal dunes have been in part removed to make room for hotels and quarrying has caused the formation of gravel pit lakes close to the shoreline. Protected natural areas include a belt of coastal dunes, wetlands, and the internal historical forests of San Vitale and Classe. The dunes have largely lost their original vegetation ecosystem, because years ago they have been colonized with pine trees to protect the adjacent farmland from sea spray. These pine forests are currently a fire hazard. Land reclamation drainage keeps the water table artificially low. Results of these anthropogenic disturbances on the hydrology include a decrease in infiltration rates, loss of freshwater surface bodies, encroachment of saltwater inland from the river estuaries, salinization of the aquifer, wetlands and soil with a loss in plant and aquatic species biodiversity. Feedback mechanisms are complex: as land subsidence continues, drainage increases at the same pace promoting sea-water intrusion. The salinity of the groundwater does not allow for plant species richness nor for the survival of large pine trees. Farmland irrigation and fires in the pine forests, on the other hand, allow for increased infiltration and freshening of the aquifer and at the same time promote plant species diversity. Our work shows that the characteristics of the southern Po coastal zone require integrated management of economic activities, natural areas, and resources. This approach is different from the ad hoc measures taken so far, because it requires long term planning and setting a priority of objectives.",

The objective of this venture is to initiate possible collaborations between scientists from China, Germany, and US to develop innovative technologies, which can be utilized to characterize geological and hydrological structures and processes as well as other natural resources in regional scale geological basins of hundreds of thousands of kilometers (i.e., the Ordos Basin, China). This adaptive fusion of information aims to assimilate active (manmade) and passive (natural) hydrologic and geophysical tomography surveys to enhance our ability of seeing into hydrogeological basins at the resolutions of our interests. The active hydrogeophysical tomography refers to recently developed hydraulic tomgoraphic surveys by Chinese and German scientists, as well as well-established geophysical tomography surveys (such as electrical resistivity tomography, cross-borehole radars, electrical magnetic surveys). These active hydrogeophysical tomgoraphic surveys have been proven to be useful high-resolution surveys for geological media of tens and hundreds of meters wide and deep. For basin-scale (i.e., tens and hundreds of kilometers) problems, their applicabilities are however rather limited. The passive hydrogeophysical tomography refers to unexplored technologies that exploit natural stimuli as energy sources for tomographic surveys, which include direct lightning strikes, groundwater level fluctuations due to earthquakes, river stage fluctuations, precipitation storms, barometric pressure variations, and long term climate changes. These natural stimuli are spatially varying, recurrent, and powerful, influencing geological media over great distances and depths (e.g., tens and hundreds of kilometers). Monitoring hydrological and geophysical responses of geological media to these stimuli at different locations is tantamount to collecting data of naturally occurring tomographic surveys. Exploiting natural stimuli as tomographic surveys is a novel concept for cost-effective characterization and monitor of subsurface processes in regional-scale basins at great depths.",

            "abstract": "The Mw7.7 2013 Balochistan earthquake ruptured 200 km of the Hoshab fault, the southern end of the Chaman fault. Azimuth of the fault changes by more than 30° along rupture, from a well-oriented strike-slip fault to a more thrust prone direction. We use the MicMac optical image software to correlate pairs of Landsat images taken before and after the earthquake to access to the horizontal displacement field associated with the earthquake. We combine the horizontal displacement with radar image correlation in range and radar interferometry to derive the co-seismic slip on the fault. The combination of these different datasets actually provides the 3D displacement field. We note that although the earthquake was mainly strike-slip all along the rupture length, some vertical motion patches exist, which locations seem to be controlled by kilometric-scale variations of the fault geometry. 5 pairs of SPOT images were also correlated to derive a 2.5m pixel-size horizontal displacement field, providing unique opportunity to look at deformation in the near field and to obtain high-resolution strike-slip and normal slip-distributions. We note a significant difference, especially in the normal component, between the slip localized at depth on the fault plane and the slip localized closer to the surface, with more apparent slip at the surface. A high-resolution map of ground rupture allows us to locate the distribution of the deformation over the whole rupture length. The rupture map also highlights multiple fault geometric complexities where we could quantify details of the slip distribution. At the rupture length-scale, the local azimuth variations between segments have a large impact on the expression of the localized slip at the surface. The combination of those datasets gives an overview of the large distribution of the deformation in the near field, corresponding to the co-seismic damage zone.",

            "abstract": "Dynamic models incorporating crevasse-depth calving laws have enjoyed considerable success in simulating observed behavior of tidewater glaciers. Such models are based on the assumption that longitudinal strain rates exert a first-order control on calving, and that penetration of surface and basal crevasses provides the ultimate constraint on glacier extent. However, ‘second-order’ processes such as melt undercutting may significantly amplify calving rates, initiating seasonal and longer-term glacier retreats. We present high temporal and spatial resolution TerraSAR-X data from Svalbard that indicate a strong annual cycle in calving rates, peaking in September-October coincident with maximum fjord temperatures. This pattern is consistent for all studied glaciers irrespective of glacier activity (fast, slow, surging or quiescent), and we conclude that in Svalbard calving is paced by melt-undercutting followed by mechanical destabilization of the ice tongue.\nAlthough parameterizations of melt undercutting are included in many models employing the crevasse-depth calving criterion, amplification of calving by melt undercutting (the ‘O’Leary Effect’) has not been rigorously analyzed or tested against observations. We take a novel approach to this problem, and couple the finite element model Elmer-Ice with a discrete particle model (DPM) to explore in detail the links between melt undercutting and failure of the ice tongue. Employing glacier front geometries representative of Kronebreen (Svalbard), Columbia Glacier (Alaska) and Helheim Glacier (Greenland), we use Elmer-Ice to simulate progressive undercutting of the ice front by melting. At selected time steps, the model geometry was exported into the DPM, and runs conducted to study fracturing and calving behavior using different values of the fracture stress. We quantify the O’Leary Effect for different geometries, and propose a modified calving law incorporating the effects of melt-undercutting. The results highlight the importance of accounting for the impact of melt undercutting on calving losses in dynamic calving models.",

            "abstract": "The Indonesian maritime continent (IMC) is a miniature of our land-sea coexisting planet Earth. Firstly, without interior activity, the Earth becomes an even-surfaced “aqua-planet” with both atmosphere and ocean flowing almost zonally, and solar differential heating generates (global thermal tides and) Hadley’s meridional circulations with ITCZ along the equator as observed actually over open (Indian and Pacific) oceans in the both sides of IMC. ITCZ involves intraseasonal variations or super cloud clusters moving eastward. Secondly, the lands and seas over the actual Earth have been keeping the area ratio of 3:7 (similar to that of islands and inland/surrounding seas in IMC), but their displacements have produced IMC near the equator, which turns equatorial Pacific easterly current northward (Kuroshio) and reflects equatorial oceanic waves inducing coupled ocean-atmosphere interannual variations such as ENSO and IOD, or displacements of Walker’s zonal circulations. Thirdly, because IMC consists of many large/small islands with very long coastlines, many narrow straits become a dam for the global (Pacific to Indian) ocean circulation, and the land-sea heat capacity contrasts along the coastlines generate the world’s largest rainfall with diurnal cycles (sea-land breeze circulations). The diurnal cycles are dominant in the rainy season (austral summer in Jawa and Bali), because rainfall-induced sprinkler-like land cooling reverses the trans-coastal temperature gradient before sunrise, and subsequent clear sky on land until around noon provides solar heating dependent on season. These processes lead to rapid land/hydrosphere-atmosphere water exchange, local air pollutant washout, and transequatorial boreal winter monsoon (cold surge). In El Niño years the cooler sea-surface temperature suppresses the morning coastal-sea rainfall, and induces often serious smog over IMC. Lastly, high-resolution observations/models covering both over islands and seas are necessary. A radar-profiler network (HARIMAU) has been constructed during FY2005-09, and capacity building on radar operations and buoy manufacturing has been promoted during FY2009-13 by Japan-Indonesia collaboration projects, which are taken over by an Indonesian national center (MCCOE) established in November 2013.",

Although such seismic anisotropy can be explained by the crystal preferred orientation (CPO) of highly anisotropic minerals such as amphibole in the crust, experimental studies on the CPO of amphibole has been very limited. Here we show novel experimental results of simple–shear deformation of amphibolite at high pressure and temperatures (1 GPa, 480–700 °C). The deformed amphibole produced three types of strong CPOs depending on temperature and stress and resulted in a strong seismic anisotropy. Our data open up a new window for understanding the observed seismic anisotropy in the crust. The seismic data obtained from the amphibole CPOs revealed that anomalous seismic anisotropy observed in the deep crust, subducting slab and also at the mantle wedge can be attributed to the CPO of amphibole.",

We have developed GPR systems which can be applied to these purposes, and we will demonstrate examples borehole radar measurements.\nIn order to have longer radar detection range, frequency lower than100MHz has been normally adopted in borehole radar. Typical subsurface fractures of our interests have a few mm aperture and radar resolution is much poorer than a few cm in this frequency range. We are proposing and demonstrating to use radar polarimetry to solve this problem. We have demonstrated that a full-polarimetry borehole radar can be used for characterization of subsurface fractures. Together with signal processing for antenna characteristic compensation to equalize the signal by a dipole antenna and slot antennas, we could demonstrate that polarimetric borehole radar can estimate the surface roughness of subsurface fractures, We believe the surface roughness is closely related to water permeability through the fractures.\nWe then developed a directional borehole radar, which uses optical field sensor. A dipole antenna in a borehole has omni-directional radiation pattern, and we cannot get azimuthal information about the scatterers. We use multiple dipole antennas set around the borehole axis, and from the phase differences, we can estimate the 3-diemnational orientation of subsurface structures.\nWe are using optical electric field sensor for receiver of borehole radar. This is a passive sensor and connected only with optical fibers and does not require any electric power supply to operate the receiver. It has two major advantages; the first one is that the receiver can be electrically isolated from other parts, and wave coupling to a logging cable is avoided. Then, secondary, it can operate for a long time, because it does not require battery installed inside the system. It makes it possible to set sensors in fixed positions to monitor the change of environmental conditions for a long period. We demonstrated this idea using cross- hole borehole radar measurement. We think this method is useful for detecting any changes in hydrogeological situations, which will be useful for subsurface storage such as LNG and nuclear waste.",

            "abstract": "The publicly available global discharge database is limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Although regional exceptions exist, the population of the database has declined over the past several years. When aiming for global scale discharge at a sufficient temporal resolution and with homogeneous accuracy, the choice to use spaceborne sensors is only a logical step. In this respect, we take water storage changes from GRACE and water level measurements from satellite altimetry and present a comprehensive assessment of 5 different hydro-geodetic approaches for river discharge prediction: hydrological balance equation, hydro-meteorological balance equation, least squares prediction using the covariance matrices out of available old in situ data, satellite altimetry with quantile function based stage-discharge relationships and a runoff-storage relationship that takes time-lag into account. As a common property these approaches do not rely on hydrological modeling; they are either purely data driven or make use of atmospheric reanalyses. The discharge estimation skill of these approaches are validated against in situ data. Our validation shows that satellite altimetry, runoff-storage and least squares prediction approaches are able to capture river discharge with an error range (relative RMSE) of less than 15% for most of the rivers under study. We are thus able to avoid the complexity of hydrological modeling for discharge estimation. Our results show that the mentioned three approaches clearly outperform the global methods (hydrological and hydro-meteorological approaches). However, the global methods have the potential to provide discharge over all landmasses ---gauged and ungauged basins alike, but are still limited due to inconsistencies in the global hydrological and hydro-meteorological datasets that they use.",

            "abstract": "Water availability limits plant growth and production in most terrestrial ecosystems. However these ecosystems do not show the same sensitivity to changes in precipitation. Water-limited ecosystems are defined here as ecosystems where rainfall is the dominant climate constraint to plant growth. Drought-prone and often characterized by increasing human pressure on land and natural resources, these regions are amongst the most vulnerable on Earth. Despite the many years of research, a clear understanding of changes in vegetation dynamics and species distribution, as well as related drivers, has not been reached yet.\nIn this research we take advantage of the 30years time span offered by the GIMMS FAPAR3g dataset to investigate abrupt and gradual changes in Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE). Using the piece-wise regression method implemented in BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend) and BFAST01, a change type classification scheme is produced for water-limited ecosystems. Compared to classical non-parametric trend analysis, this approach allows detecting trend shifts during the study period.\nThis global scale analysis revealed that for more than 50% of the cases no significant changes in RUE were registered between 1982 and 2011. Whereas when significant changes were registered, monotonic increase was the predominant type of changes. Large patches of reversing trends were also observed, notably in Asia (China, Kazakhstan), in the Sahelian region (Sudan, Ethiopia, Senegal), and in South America (Peru and Argentina). Even though reversing trends appear to be more frequently observed in regions with high land cover change dynamics, a comprehensive attribution of drivers for all recorded changes is still under discussion. Indeed the co-occurrence of global drivers (such as change in climate and in extreme events) and local drivers (such as land-cover changes) makes it a very delicate task.",

The normalized cross-helicity, σC, is a measure of the predominance of one mode with respect to the other. The evolution of σC toward lower values with increasing radial distance is interpreted both as a decrease of the presence of the outward modes or as a continuous production of inward modes within those regions such as stream shears where some plasma instability is active.\nOn the other hand, it has been found that the decrease of σC is sometimes related also to the presence of compressive fluctuations in the form of magnetic field and density enhancements. Thus, compressibility effects might be able to play a non-negligible role in the evolution of the interplanetary plasma not properly considered so far.\nThe present analysis supports this point of view. We will study the effect of compressibility on Alfvénic correlations presenting both case studies and a statistical analysis over different phases of the solar cycle.\nOur findings indicate that the presence of magnetic field compression generally play a relevant role in the depletion of σC since it acts on the destruction of the v-b correlation of the outward modes.\nMoreover a study on the source regions of the solar wind, both slow and fast, will be presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice is a spatially and temporally varying thin layer whose existence and properties depend on small imbalances in fluxes of heat, moisture and momentum between the atmosphere and ocean; its accurate simulation in regional and climate models is a hard, and largely open, problem.\nA large part of the uncertainty in simulation of sea ice can be traced to atmospheric and oceanic conditions and their variability. Here, however, we focus on the role of the fidelity of sea ice model physics to simulation of the sea ice state.\nWe briefly describe novel physics in a stand-alone, i.e. forced, sea ice model. These include the first physical model of melt ponds including the role of melt pond refreezing, anisotropic rheology, spatially and temporally variable form drag and its impact on sensible and latent heat fluxes, basal dissolution, a variable mixed layer, a diagnosed floe size, floe-size dependent lateral melt rate, and a physically-sophisticated frazil ice treatment. Model simulations, drawn from ongoing work, are used to illustrate the role of this physics on simulation of the sea ice state.\nOne of our chief conclusions is that accurate representation of the physics of sea ice processes, above and beyond what is the current state of the art in climate models, sensibly and significantly affects the ability of these models to make accurate simulations, and predictions, of the Arctic sea ice state.",

            "abstract": "The ability to visualize networks of igneous intrusions in 3D using seismic reflection data has revolutionized our understanding of how magma migrates and is emplaced during continental breakup. Numerous seismic-based studies have shown that: (i) sub-horizontal or saucer-shaped sill intrusions represent a major component of magmatic systems within sedimentary basins; (ii) these sills may be interconnected to form laterally extensive (>100’s km2) sill-complexes; (iii) magma flow indicators can be mapped within the sills to reconstruct magma migration routes and source positions; (iv) space-making mechanisms (e.g., forced folds) can be identified, which provide constraints on intrusive style (e.g., brittle or non-brittle); and (v) cross-cutting and seismic-stratigraphic relationships between the sills and host rock can be used to constrain the age of igneous activity. We use a series of seismic data, primarily from the Rockall Basin, NE Atlantic and offshore Australia, to demonstrate how the observations described above can be synthesized to reconstruct the evolution of ancient magmatic systems located along continental volcanic rifted margins. Our results demonstrate that the architecture of such intrusive networks is significantly influenced by the pre-existing structure and lithology of the host rock. Importantly, relatively dating the intrusive and extrusive components of magmatic systems suggests igneous activity may occur more intermittently and over longer time periods than previously thought, potentially spanning entire break-up histories. Overall, seismic reflection data provide important insights into: (i) the role of magma before, during and after continental break-up; and (ii) the influence of crystallised intrusion networks on subsequent basin evolution and fluid flow processes.",

            "abstract": "We have demonstrated that dense GPR data acquisition typically antenna step increment less than 1/10 wave length can provide clear 3-dimeantiona subsurface images, and we created 3DGPR images. Now we are interested in developing GPR survey methodologies which required less data acquisition time. In order to speed up the data acquisition, we are studying efficient antenna positioning for GPR survey and 3-D imaging algorithm.\nFor example, we have developed a dual sensor “ALIS”, which combines GPR with metal detector (Electromagnetic Induction sensor) for humanitarian demining, which acquires GPR data by hand scanning. ALIS is a pulse radar system, which has a frequency range 0.5-3GHz.The sensor position tracking system has accuracy about a few cm, and the data spacing is typically more than a few cm, but it can visualize the mines, which has a diameter about 8cm. 2 systems of ALIS have been deployed by Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) in mine fields in Cambodia since 2009 and have detected more than 80 buried land mines.\nWe are now developing signal processing for an array type GPR “Yakumo”. Yakumo is a SFCW radar system which is a multi-static radar, consisted of 8 transmitter antennas and 8 receiver antennas. We have demonstrated that the multi-static data acquisition is not only effective in data acquisition, but at the same time, it can increase the quality of GPR images. Archaeological survey by Yakumo in large areas, which are more than 100m by 100m have been conducted, for promoting recovery from Tsunami attacked East Japan in March 2011.\nWith a conventional GPR system, we are developing an interpolation method of radar signals, and demonstrated that it can increase the quality of the radar images, without increasing the data acquisition points. When we acquire one dimensional GPR profile along a survey line, we can acquire relatively high density data sets. However, when we need to relocate the data sets along a “virtual” survey line, for example a straight line near the real survey line along which the data were acquired, we can interpolate the data using the acquired data sets. Combining with 3-dimenstional migration algorithm, we found that sparse data acquisition can re-construct subsurface images which were equivalent to that reconstructed from very dense data sets.",

            "abstract": "Ground deformation in relation to 2010 Eyjafjallajökull and 1998, 2004 and 2011 Grímsvötn eruptions in Iceland provide constraints on subsurface magma flow and pressure change. When compared with eruptive activity, eruption column and estimates of mass flow rate they can be used to constrain physical models of eruptive processes. The 1998 and 2004 Grímsvötn eruptions were captured by intermittent GPS observations but in 2011 the detailed temporal evolution of co-eruptive deformation was revealed by a kinematic 1 Hz solutions for the position of a single continuous GPS site on the volcano, supplemented with ground tilt observations. The observations can be explained by inflow of magma and pressure buildup between eruptions in a shallow chamber at about 1.7 km depth beneath the center of the Grímsvötn caldera complex, and pressure drop and magma outflow during eruptions. The rate of pressure change in the magma chamber correlates with the height of the volcanic plume over the course of the 2011 eruption. Peaks in activity relate to periods of rapid pressure drop in the chamber. GPS observations and interferometric analysis of satellite radar images from the TerraSAR-X satellite show that the explosive 2010 eruption at Eyjafjallajökull was on the other hand associated with gradual contraction of a source, distinct from pre-eruptive inflation sources at the volcano. For the initial 10-days of the summit eruption, a deflating sill source under the summit at about 5 km depth can explain the observed deformation, but then the source geometry appears to evolve. The rate of deflation was interrupted by inflow of new magma into the deflating source during the eruption in relation to peaks in explosive activity. The contrasting behavior of the two volcanoes is interpreted in terms of different magma plumbing systems of the volcanoes. In both cases, the erupted volume of magma is much larger than the inferred co-eruptive volume change, attributed to compressibility of magma residing in the sources where the eruptions originated from.",

            "abstract": "During the past decades molecular markers were discovered to be of diagnostic character for tracing the origin and fate of organic matter in soils. Molecular proxies themselves and their combination with compound-specific isotope analyses became powerful tools to distinguish between various biogenic and anthropogenic sources of organic matter and to trace carbon turnover at a molecular level. In the meantime various field and laboratory experiments provided deeper insight into soil organic matter dynamics at a molecular scale. We learnt from these experiments that carbon turnover at a molecular scale occurs in a similar time frame like for bulk soil organic matter and that selective preservation is not an issue for most coumpounds in active soils, but e.g. in fossil soils. Nevertheless, e.g. plant wax-derived alkanes and root-derived suberin markers point to a slower turnover of specific compounds. Recently, molecular markers enabled deciphering root-derived processes that occur in the rhizosphere of living and dead roots within the soil or even in the deep subsoil (up to several meters below the soil surface). Thus, the proposed carbon sequestration by roots in subsoils is not necessarily relevant in the long-term on a decadal or centennial scale. Although molecular markers were not determined to be valuable tools to sequester carbon in the soil, they strongly help elucidating processes relevant for cycling of bulk organic matter from the soil surface towards the deep subsoil.",

            "abstract": "The predictability of volcanic eruptions remains a challenging problem and forecast of volcano behavior (intrusion versus eruption) is a difficult task. Since 1979, the Volcano Observatory of Piton de la Fournaise (OVPF) maintains SP and BB seismic stations, tiltmeters, extensometers and GPS stations. In addition, the RER GEOSCOPE broadband station was installed in 1986, 8.5 km north of the summit crater. The analysis of 83 seismic crises from December 1985 to December 2010 (preceding 54 eruptions, 26 intrusions, 2 summit pit craters,1 caldera collapse) allowed us to identify short-term long period seismic transients (period > 100 s) for most events (Roult et al., 2012). These precursors observed on the horizontal components are tilt signals induced by the inflation/deflation of the volcano. We analyzed 17 eruptions and 7 intrusions spanning the 2005-2010 period with the aim of distinguishing whether an injection of magma will stop or if it can evolve towards an eruption. Transient signature is an acceleration step that can be large or not, with slopes more or less steep according to the acceleration rate. We show a clear differentiation between the acceleration rate of the intrusions (low rate) and the acceleration rate of the eruptions (high rate). With a ratio estimated to 7, the acceleration rate allows to determine a threshold value and to discriminate between intrusive and eruptive events. The real-time calculation of the ground acceleration of the horizontal components of the RER station after removal of the theoretical tide effect is integrated since April 2014 to the Piton de la Fournaise volcano monitoring. In June 2014, the “JERK”method predicted an eruption 50 minutes before the eruption onset.\nWe applied the \"material failure prediction\" of Voight and Cornelius (1991) with the aim to predict the onset time of the eruptions. Preliminary tests on the 17 eruptions of the 2005-2010 period have shown that the summit eruptions were relatively well predicted (error of a few minutes). The distal eruptions seem to be systematically predicted too early. This approach will be added to the monitoring system.\nRoult et al., 2012. JVGR, 241-242, 78-104\nVoight and Cornelius, 1991.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) significantly impacts Earth's climate due to its dual role as an inert potent greenhouse gas in the troposphere and as a reactive source of ozone-destroying nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere. However, there remain significant uncertainties in the global budget of this gas. The marked spatial divide in its reactivity means that all stages in the N2O life cycle—emission, transport, and destruction—must be examined to understand the overall effect of N2O on climate. Source and sink processes of N2O lead to varying concentrations of N2O isotopologues (14N14N16O, 14N15N16O, 15N14N16O, and 14N14N18O being measured) due to preferential isotopic production and elimination in different environments. Estimation of source and sink fluxes can be improved by combining isotopically resolved N2O observations with simulations using a chemical transport model with reanalysis meteorology and treatments of isotopic signatures of specific surface sources and stratospheric intrusions. We present the first few months of site-specific nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition data from the Stheno-TILDAS instrument (Harris et al, 2013) at Mace Head, Ireland and compare these to results from MOZART-4 (Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 4) chemical transport model runs including N2O isotopic fractionation processes and reanalysis meterological fields (NCEP/NCAR, MERRA, and GEOS-5).

In order to study the behaviour and distribution of photospheric magnetic features, efficient automated detection routines need to be utilised to identify and track magnetic features.\nIn this talk, I will discuss the pros and cons of different automated magnetic feature identification and tracking routines with a special focus on the requirements of these codes to deal with the large data sets produced by HMI. By patching together results from Hinode and MDI (high-res & full-disk), the fluxes of magnetic features were found to follow a power-law over 5 orders of magnitude. At the strong flux tail of this distribution, the power law was found to fall off at solar minimum, but was maintained over all fluxes during solar maximum. However, the point of deflection in the power-law distribution occurs at a patching point between instruments and so questions remain over the reasons for the deflection. The feature fluxes determined from the superb high-resolution HMI data covers almost all of the 5 orders of magnitude. Considering both solar mimimum and solar maximum HMI data sets, we investigate whether the power-law over 5 orders of magnitude in flux still holds. Furthermore, we investigate the behaviour of magnetic features in order to probe the nature of their origin. In particular, we analyse small-scale flux emergence events using HMI data to investigate the existence of a small-scale dynamo just below the solar photosphere.",

Recent technological advances in the extraction of oil and gas have increased the production rate dramatically since early 2000. In the context of CO2 emissions per energy generated, natural gas promises a tantalizing thermodynamic advantage over coal and other hydrocarbons. Natural gas emissions to the atmosphere along the entire path from well to customer, however, can wipe out the radiative forcing advantage once they surpass a threshold fraction of distributed gas. Recent studies have been undertaken to assess the methane emissions at various types of facilities within different sectors of the oil and gas industry. The distribution of observed facility level emission rates along with other results and conclusions from those studies will be presented. The implications that these findings have on the emissions inventories from these sectors will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric environment interacts with volcanic plumes produced by explosive eruptions in a number of ways. The wind field can affect atmospheric air entrainment into the column favouring its buoyancy. Similarly, the structure of the atmosphere and its properties can significantly influence the dynamics of volcanic plumes. In recent years, several numerical simulation tools and observation systems have investigated the action of wind field and atmospheric properties on volcanic column height and bending, revealing an important influence of these variables on plume behavior. A less explored issue is the action of wind and atmospheric properties on the eruptive style, i.e. on the buoyant or collapsing regimes shown by the plume, and the factors controlling the shift from one regime to the other. In this study, we address these issues using a new numerical simulation tool for solving the plume theory equations. This tool, named PlumeMoM (de’Michieli Vitturi et al., in preparation), allows the continuous polydispersity of pyroclastic particles to be described using a quadrature-based moment method, an innovative approach in volcanology well-suited for the description of the multiphase nature of magmatic mixture. Several physical processes and real conditions were considered: loss of mass along the column, entrainment of atmospheric air, vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and density, and atmospheric stability A global sensitivity analysis of the effects of these parameters on plume dynamics and stability was also performed by coupling the plume model with the DAKOTA statistics toolkit. Results provide a better understanding of the key processes affecting plume regime and identification of the main parameters controlling column behaviour.",

            "abstract": "Lakes are increasingly recognized as important components of the global terrestrial carbon budget. Northern lakes are especially of interest due to a high density of open-water ecosystems in Northern latitudes and a potential increase in lake areal extent where permafrost is thawing. A better understanding of lake-atmosphere interactions requires long-term and direct measurement of surface fluxes. This is rarely achieved in Northern landscapes where seasonally ice-covered lakes are mostly studied during the open water season, and measurement methods do not always allow an integration of all gas transport pathways to the atmosphere.\nWe present here ecosystem-scale data from Stordalen (68°20’N, 19°03’E), a thawing permafrost peatland in subarctic Sweden, where an eddy covariance system is used in an innovative way to quantify the importance of methane (CH4) emissions from a shallow lake. After more than a year of surface flux monitoring, it is found that spring is a crucial season for lake-atmosphere CH4 exchange. Despite its shallow depth, more than half of annual CH4 emissions from the lake were recorded at ice-out, suggesting significant winter CH4 production in lake sediments. Lake water dynamics seemed to drive the observed spring release rates. In contrast, summer methane emissions in Stordalen were dominated by the minerotrophic fens. This underlines the importance of considering the full annual budget when assessing the carbon source strength of seasonally ice-covered lakes. Carbon dioxide fluxes were also monitored and will be briefly discussed, as well as the significance of northern lakes spring burst for global atmospheric CH4 budget.",

            "abstract": "As one of the rare observational tools for studying deformation and stress within the Earth, seismic anisotropy has been one of the focuses of geophysical studies over the last decade. Recently, in order to unravel the anisotropic properties of the crust, the teleseismic receiver functions (RFs) methodology has been largely applied. Effects of anisotropy on the RFs dataset were illustrated in more than one theoretical study, showing the strong backazimuthal dependence of RFs on the 3D characteristics of the traversed media. The use of teleseismic RFs has the advantage of not being affected by heterogeneous depth distribution of local earthquakes, since teleseismic rays sample the entire crust beneath the stations. The application of this technique anyway, needs to be critically assessed using a suitable field test.\nTo test this technique, we need a crustal block where the underground structure is reasonably well-known, e.g., where there is extensive knowledge from local seismic experiments and drilling. Therefore a field test around the KTB (Kontinental Tiefbohrung) site in the Oberpfalz in Southeastern Germany, has been carried out to test the technique, and to compare with previous results from deep drilling, and high-frequency seismic experiments around the drill site.\nThe investigated region has been studied extensively by local geophysical experiments. The deep borehole was placed into gneiss rocks of the Zone Erbendorf-Vohenstrauss. Drilling activity lasted from 1987 to 1994, and descended down to a depth of 9101 meters, sampling an alternating sequence of paragneiss and amphibolite, with metamorphism of upper amphibolite facies conditions, and ductile deformation produced a strong foliation of the rocks.\nThe application of the RFs reveals strong seismic anisotropy in the upper crust related to the so-called Erbendorf body.",

            "abstract": "The Western Siberian plain (WSP) is the most bogged region of the World - in some parts up to 70-80% of its territory is covered by bogs, in overall 1 million km². Western Siberia acts as a terrestrial sink of atmospheric carbon and thus plays an important role in the global cycle of carbon. For thousands of years the vast taiga forest and pristine peatland areas south of the permafrost area have been sequestrating substantial amounts of atmospheric carbon. The biggest at the World – Great Vasiugan Mire GVM (total area – 7.5 million hectare settles down in its territory. This unique mire representing the object of a nature of the world value, comparable on the importance and a rank with the lake Baikal. The peat stock accumulated in the GVM is around 18 billion tons of dry organic matter, representing 16.5% of total peat stock deposits in the WSP (Vaganov etc., 2005). According to our investigations carried out in the Western Siberian Plain, contrasting processes are occurring in the Southern and Northern parts of the region. In the south, bogs are expanding in the taiga zone and there is progressive swamping which leads to forest death. As a result, in this part of Western Siberia bogs act as a kind of “global cooler” due to carbon sequestration in their peat layers. The situation in the northern part of the Western Siberian Plain is completely opposite. The bogs there are reducing their area and the forest-tundra area is being subjected to thermokarst activity and colonization of bogs by trees. Due to incredibly increased thermokarst activity, two contrast processes are observed here - a) increase of lake surface due to melting of lakes' coasts, and - b) decrease of surface area or disappearance of lakes due to water escape downstream the hydrological network. Moreover, thermokarst processes increase carbon effluxes, especially from the small lakes. This is likely to be linked to the recent climatic changes and, undoubtedly, with global warming.",

            "abstract": "The growth of continental ice sheets at equatorial sealevel during the Neoproterozoic Marinoan are of considerable interest, because they may have served as a filter for animal evolution and atmospheric oxygenation. Further, the hypothesised post-glacial extreme greenhouse state provides the opportunity to test climate system responses to rapid warming. In particular, the debate focuses on whether the ubiquitous post-glacial deposition of cap carbonates and associated negative δ13C excursion was caused by an enhanced weathering-driven delivery of atmospheric CO2 to the oceans, or by the thermal destabilisation of marine methane hydrates.\nLithium isotopes are a relatively novel tracer of continental weathering. Li is almost entirely situated in silicates, rather than carbonates, and its isotopic fractionation in rivers is demonstrably due to the intensity of silicate weathering. In addition, Li isotope fractionation remains constant in marine carbonates, regardless of changes in temperature or type of skeletal calcite. Determination of Li isotope ratios through several well-characterised sections of the Otavi Group, NW Namibia, indicates similar trends, with δ7Li decreasing sharply by ~13‰, with the isotopic minimum occurring within the cap carbonates, and before the δ13C minimum. The δ7Li values are the lowest ever recorded in carbonate. These trends strongly suggest a significant increase in the intensity of silicate weathering during the deglaciation. Combining these data with a series of Earth system models coupled to δ13C allows a comprehensive interpretation of the changes in continental weathering and atmospheric pCO2, and the link between the two, during the deposition of the cap carbonates. Together, this data-model approach helps elucidate climate system behaviour during this period of rapid and extreme climate warming.",

Gaseous nitrogen oxides are toxic, regulated by regional authorities and the WHO, and their emissions and chemistry are important for the formation of ozone and aerosols. Nitrogen oxides are thought to act as a net climate cooler, mostly via enhancing the oxidative capacity of the global troposphere resulting in CH4 lifetime reductions, and via the formation of light-scattering particles. In this paper I will discuss how tropospheric NO2 column retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on board EOS-Aura have pushed the envelope in various scientific applications over the last decade. A categorization of these applications shows that OMI NO2 data have been used for (1) high-resolution monitoring of NOx emissions, (2) monitoring trends in NO2 air pollution levels, (3) evaluating mid-day NOx chemistry, (4) evaluating secondary pollutant formation, (5) estimating surface NO2 concentrations, (6) improving forecasting skills of air quality and chemistry transport models, (7) estimating nitrogen deposition to ecosystems, and (8) outreach activities to the general public. I will show some intriguing examples of the above applications, and pay close attention to the steps necessary to arrive at these successful applications. These steps include advanced filtering of the data for e.g. wind direction or speed, spatial pattern recognition to isolate specific emission categories, and more generally improving the description of NOx emission categories and chemistry in models at spatial and temporal scales relevant to OMI and upcoming TROPOMI and geostationary sensors.",

Automated tracking of individual convective cells in high time-resolution SEVIRI data allows us to composite complementary satellite data sources, providing novel insights into the convective lifecycle and aerosol-convection interactions.

            "abstract": "Idealized laboratory experiments investigate the glacier-ocean boundary dynamics near a vertical ‘glacier’ (i.e. no floating ice tongue) in a two-layer stratified fluid, similar to Sermilik Fjord where Helheim Glacier terminates. In summer, the discharge of surface runoff at the base of the glacier (subglacial discharge) intensifies the circulation near the glacier and increases the melt rate with respect to that in winter. In the laboratory, the effect of subglacial discharge is simulated by introducing fresh water at melting temperatures from either point or line sources at the base of an ice block representing the glacier. The circulation pattern observed both with and without subglacial discharge resembles those observed in previous studies. The buoyant plume of cold meltwater and subglacial discharge water entrains ambient water and rises vertically until it finds either the interface between the two layers or the free surface. The results suggest that the meltwater deposits within the interior of the water column and not entirely at the free surface, as confirmed by field observations. The submarine melt rate increases with the subglacial discharge rate. Furthermore, the same subglacial discharge causes greater submarine melting if it exits from a point source rather than from a line source. When the subglacial discharge exits from two point sources, two buoyant plumes are formed which rise vertically and interact. The results suggest that the distance between the two subglacial discharges influences the entrainment in the plumes and consequently the amount of submarine melting and the final location of the meltwater within the water column.

            "abstract": "We have identified a number of carbonate bodies interpreted as seep-related from near the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary in Svalbard, arctic Norway. The paleoseeps discovered so far occur over 50 km along strike, representing a seepage field of considerable extent. Ammonites indicate a base Cretaceous (Late Volgian to Late Ryazanian) age. The carbonate bodies are highly fossiliferous, with a very diverse fauna consisting mainly of normal-marine species but also seep-restricted taxa. Carbonate d13C isotopes reach -46‰, which, considering mixture with seawater-derived carbon, is interpreted as indicating a biogenic methane source. It is of interest to note the correlation of this paleoseepage with an episode of extremely high burial of organic matter near the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary, noted both in Svalbard (top Slottsmøya Member of the Agardhfjellet Formation), in the Barents Sea (Hekkingen Formation) and in the North Sea (Mandal Formation), possibly providing a shallow source for biogenic gas. Together with near contemporaneous events in the Boreal Realm such as ongoing rifting, the base Cretaceous unconformity, the Mjølnir meteorite impact and a possible minor extinction event, these finds contribute to the impression of the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary as a highly dynamic and interesting time in the North Atlantic area.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic detachment faults (ODs) are known to play a significant role in oceanic crustal accretion along slow-spreading ridges, and many display a poorly understood corrugated fault surface. The ODEMAR cruise (Nov-Dec’14) studied the 13°20’N and 13°30’N ODs along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge via extensive microbathymetric surveys with AUV ABYSS (GEOMAR), combined with geological observations and sampling using ROV VICTOR (IFREMER).\nThe 13°20’N OD is largely intact, with an undisrupted corrugated surface. An abrupt, continuous moat where the OD emerges from the seafloor sloping at ~12-18° continuously sheds rubble onto the OD fault plane, blanketing it. An apron surrounds the detachment dipping ~10-14° towards volcanic rift valley floor thus forming a thin wedge above the active OD fault, which uplifts hangingwall material. In contrast, the 13°30’N OD is cut by recent high-angle faults, and is likely inactive. The OD fault is well exposed along these recent high angle fault scarps, and along mass wasting scarps.\nThe OD fault displays individual microbathymetric lineations throughout the >150 m of fault zone thickness, that are traced up to ~2 km in the spreading direction. Flanks of individual lineations display fault planes extending ~20-100 m laterally with well-developed, extension-parallel striae. At 13°20’N. These fault surfaces are primarily basalt fault breccias and minor serpentinite. At 13°30’N the scarps cutting the detachment system reveal highly heterogeneous deformation, with phacoidal blocks of undeformed peridotite, gabbro, and basalt enclosed in anastomosing shear zones. Basalt often shows greenschist grade alteration, and is only present in the upper 50 m of the OD fault zone.\nIn detail, OD faults are characterized by anastomosing zones of localized, strongly anisotropic deformation at different scales (m to km), bounding bodies of largely undeformed rock (basalt, gabbro, peridotite) elongated in the extension direction. Hangingwall material (basalt and dolerite) gets reworked into the fault zone in the green schist facies and effectively accreted to the footwall, both as fault breccia and as large blocks within the fault. Such fine-scale, in situ observations provide unprecedented insights into the three-dimensional and heterogeneous strain localization at OD fault zones.",

            "abstract": "The APEC Climate Center (APCC) is a leading climate information service provider and research institute that serves the 21 APEC member economies and the broader international community. Since 2007, APCC has issued operational monthly rolling three-month forecasts based on the well-validated multiple model ensemble (MME) prediction system. Currently, 14 prominent operational climate centers and research institutes from nine APEC member economies participate in the APCC operational MME prediction by routinely providing their predictions in the form of ensembles of global forecast fields. Various MME methods implemented in APCC’s MME system were compared with a simple averaged MME (with equal weightings), for predicting seasonal mean temperature and precipitation one-month ahead. The results indicate that the simple averaged MME consistently outperforms the multiple regression-based MMEs, when considering all aspects of the predictions from operational prediction systems (i.e., in different variables, regions, seasons) whereas the calibrated MME shows the capability to reduce errors and improve forecast skills in a large proportion of cases.\nIn 2013, APCC has also begun to provide forecast information service for the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO). The BSISO prediction system includes monitoring, forecast, and validation. The forecast is contributed by five different models from four operational centers in collaboration with the CAS/WCRP Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) Task Force. As demonstrated in this study, the BSISO forecast information can be useful for predicting summer monsoon onset and activity within the East Asia region. Verification of the BSISO forecasts during 2013 shows a similar level of skill for the main BSISO mode (BSISO1) compared to the MJO, but less for the 2nd mode (BSISO2). APCC will develop a methodology relevant to the BSISO MME and the outcome will be available in the coming years.",

            "abstract": "Goethite nanoparticles are being considered as a tool to enhance in situ remediation of aquifers contaminated with aromatic hydrocarbons. Injection of goethite nanoparticles into the plume is expected to enhance microbial iron reduction and associated beneficial oxidation of hydrocarbons in a cost-effective manner. Amongst others, current challenges associated with this novel approach are the monitoring of nanoparticle delivery and the nanoparticle and contaminant concentration dynamics over time. Obviously, non-invasive monitoring of these properties would be highly useful. In this study, we aim to evaluate whether spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurements of the complex electrical conductivity are suitable for such non-invasive characterization. In principle, this is not unreasonable because the electrical double layers of the goethite nanoparticles are expected to affect electrical polarization and thus the imaginary part of the complex electrical conductivity. In a first set of measurements, we determined the complex electrical conductivity of goethite nanoparticle suspensions with different nanoparticle concentrations, pH, and ionic strength in the mHz to kHz frequency range. In a second set of measurements, mixtures of sand and different concentrations of goethite nanoparticles and variable pH and ionic strengths were analyzed. Finally, flow experiments were monitored with SIP in a 1-m long laboratory column to investigate dynamic effects associated with goethite nanoparticle injection and delivery. The results showed that the imaginary part of the electrical conductivity was only affected in the high frequency range (Hz – kHz), which is expected from the small size of the goethite nanoparticles. Overall, we found that the goethite nanoparticles are associated with a small increase in the imaginary electrical conductivity at 1 kHz that can be measured in situ using recently improved borehole electrical impedance tomography measurement equipment that provides the required accuracy for frequencies above 100 Hz.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the role of atmospheric CO2 in driving global climate is one of the great challenges facing Earth Scientists today. Ultimately we are driven by the pressing need to predict how hot the Earth will get in the near future. Increasingly the palaeo-community has been willing to contribute to the debate, since the geological record is littered with examples of warm climate states, in part associated with elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. Whilst these provide real world examples of how the Earth System responds to CO2 forcing, no geological period is a perfect analogue for our warm future. Furthermore, climate models suggest that a significant level of state dependency exists for climate sensitivity. Therefore examining the response of the climate system to CO2 forcing in the Eocene, for example, does not have direct relevance due to the different continental arrangements, ice sheet configurations and vegetation. When these factors are accounted for, it has however been recently shown that the available palaeo-data largely confirms the sensitivity of the Earth system to CO2forcing determined by climate models alone [1].\nDespite this overall conformity, there are several warmer time periods in the geological record (e.g. the Pliocene, the PETM) that apparently exhibit significantly elevated climate sensitivites (e.g. [1]). Importantly, these are above the range typically, but not always (e.g. [2]), achievable in climate models – clearly suggesting that the Earth can exist in states that appear to be particularly sensitive to CO2 forcing. Such a state dependency to sensitivity has worrying implications for predictions of our warm future climate. In this contribution I will summarise the results of new boron isotope data from planktic foraminifera from a number of key periods. I will also focus on the challenges of generating accuract CO2 data form boron isotope measurements and discuss methodologies to use such data to further probe the response of the Earth system to CO2 change. This study provides new insights into the possibility of “hidden” feedbacks and the likelihood of a state dependency to climate sensitivity.\n[1] Rohling, E.J., et al., 2012. Nature, 491: 683-691.

We investigate: (1) Effect of stress heterogeneities on deformation behavior and microstructural development and, (2) effect of such microstructures on post-deformational recrystallization.\n(1) Full-field elasto-viscoplastic modelling (CraFT) is used to predict the local stress and strain field during transient creep in a polycrystalline ice sample. Modeling input includes the experimental starting microstructure and a validated slip system dependent flow law. EBSD measurements on selected areas are used to estimate the local dislocation field utilizing the Weighted Burgers Vector (WBV) analysis. Areas of local stress concentration correlate with triple junctions and grain boundaries, originating from strain incompatibilities between differently oriented grains. In these areas, the WBV analysis shows a non-negligible c-axis component that must be related to resolved shear stress in a prismatic plane, coherent with the predicted elevated stress levels. The resultant defect structure is necessary for the formation of the observed kink bands which have a well-defined crystallographic character, lattice distortions and subgrain development.\n(2) The microstructures arising from (1) significantly affect post-deformational behavior. Combined post-deformational annealing experiments and numerical simulations using the microdynamic modeling platform ELLE, allow prediction of the local microstructural evolution taking recovery within grains, grain boundary migration and nucleation into account.\nResults from this study, can explain several of the observed features in natural ice, and help to refine large scale models.",

            "abstract": "The interaction of climate, disturbance, and management on forest structure and composition can alter carbon dynamics. Understanding how these factors influence forest carbon dynamics individually and in combination is necessary for making forest projections under altered climatic conditions. Model and emission scenario uncertainty in climate projections presents one challenge. When simulating disturbance, such as fire, projected climate influences both fire behavior and post-wildfire regeneration. The outcome of management actions implemented to alter forest conditions can be influenced by both climate and disturbance. Simulation results in both single- and multi-species forests occupying different future climate space indicate the importance of between climate model variation and variation between emission scenarios. The variation in projected biomass as a function of climate model input is as much as 40%. Response to emission scenario varies as a function of climate space, with increased late-century divergence in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and biomass. When fire is simulated, climate model influence on biomass ranged from 0-27 Mg ha-1, while the effect on NEE ranged from -279 to 238 g m-2. Management implemented to reduce fire risk or provide wildlife habitat influences near- and long-term carbon dynamics as a function of projected climate, with the difference between no management and management for fire risk yielding a range in biomass of 0.6 to 10.78 Mg ha-1 and relatively little change in NEE (-8 to 21 g m-2). Given the range of results, including a suite of models and emission scenarios allow for bracketing the range of future forest conditions. However, the mismatch in scales between climate projections and the microclimatic influences on regeneration and the influence of projected climate on wildfire frequency and type add sources of uncertainty to these projections that require additional investigation.",

We developed a parsimonious but physically-based model of hyporheic flow for application in large river basins: Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage (NEXSS). At the core of NEXSS is a characterization of the channel geometry, geomorphic features, and related hydraulic drivers based on scaling equations from the literature and readily accessible information such as river discharge, bankfull width, median grain size, sinuosity, channel slope, and regional groundwater gradients. Multi-scale hyporheic flow is computed based on combining simple but powerful analytical and numerical expressions that have been previously published. We applied NEXSS across a broad range of geomorphic diversity in river reaches and synthetic river networks. NEXSS demonstrates that vertical exchange beneath submerged bedforms dominates hyporheic fluxes and turnover rates along the river corridor. Moreover, the hyporheic zone’s potential for biogeochemical transformations is comparable across stream orders, but the abundance of lower-order channels results in a considerably higher cumulative effect for low-order streams. Thus, vertical exchange beneath submerged bedforms has more potential for biogeochemical transformations than lateral exchange beneath banks, although lateral exchange through meanders may be important in large rivers. These results have implications for predicting outcomes of river and basin management practices.",

            "abstract": "Olympus Mons volcano on Mars has been mapped in detail by remote sensing instruments from numerous Mars missions. It is characterized by faulting and mass movements, a circumferential scarp, and upper- to mid-flank terraces on the shield. These morphologies have been variously interpreted to be the result of lithospheric flexure, volcanic spreading, or combinations thereof. The evolutionary details and structural history of Olympus Mons are unknown, however. Therefore we aim to understand the role of the combined effects of lithospheric flexure and volcanic spreading in the evolution of the volcano. For this purpose we first re-investigate the structural geology as seen in high resolution satellite imagery. Second, we simulate the deformation of a volcanic cone including elastoplastic rheology and a variable coupling-decoupling behavior at the interface between volcano and lithosphere. We show that terrace-bounding faults on Olympus Mons flanks are thrust faults, and result from compression due to lithospheric flexure that is transferred into the edifice interfering with volcanic spreading. The presence and expression of these faults hence depends on the coupling of volcano and lithosphere, on the time of volcano growth relative to mantle relaxation, and on the edifice cohesion. We further show that a decoupling interface between volcano and lithosphere leads to normal faulting in the edifice center near the transition to the lithosphere, and to basal overthrusting probably correlated to Olympus Mons’ scarp. From a comparison of morphologies observed on Olympus Mons with remote sensing methods and faulting structures resulting from finite element models, we can interpret the state of stress inside the edifice which is crucial to magma ascent.",

            "abstract": "Reliable information is needed on ongoing and future changes in high latitude terrestrial snow cover for a wide range of geophysical applications, to advise policy and decision makers, and inform impact and adaptation activities. . The objective of this presentation is to provide an update on the current state of consistency between various analyses (satellite and model-derived) of Arctic snow cover extent (SCE) and snow water equivalent (SWE), and the implications of this uncertainty on modeling applications such as evaluating the simulation of snow cover in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models.\nMonthly SCE determined from the NOAA snow chart climate data record was compared to four other snow products based on meteorological forcing from reanalysis coupled with different land surface models. While all the datasets show spring snow cover extent (SCE) in the Arctic (land surface >60N) has undergone significant reductions over the past decade, the uncertainty (standard deviation) in monthly mean Arctic SCE (April, May, June) for the 5 SCE products varies between 50 and 75% of the between-model standard deviation for 14 CMIP5 models over the 1981-2010 period. The same multi-dataset approach was utilized to determine spread in pan-Arctic SWE. There is a similar degree of variability between the SWE products relative to CMIP5 simulations, but the coupled models tend to have a higher magnitude of peak pre-melt SWE than the observational analyses, which may contribute to a slower rate of spring SCE loss in the CMIP5 simulations.\nWhile the resolution of current SWE products (25 – 100 km) is sufficient for climate model evaluation, many applications (for example initialization of numerical weather prediction and hydrological models) are limited by these coarse resolutions. Analysis of airborne data from recent experimental field campaigns near Inuvik, Canada and Toolik Lake, Alaska have illustrated the potential for Ku-band radar measurements to provide high resolution (i.e. 500 m) SWE products sensitive to the range of SWE (0 to 150 mm) characteristic of high latitude snow cover.",

            "abstract": "Realistic estimates of geoengineering effectiveness will be central to informed decision-making on its possible role in addressing climate change. Over the last decade, global-scale computer climate modelling of geoengineering has been developing. While these developments have allowed quantitative estimates of geoengineering effectiveness to be produced, the relative coarseness of the grid of these models (tens of kilometres) means that key practical details of the proposed geoengineering is not always realistically captured. This is particularly true for marine cloud brightening (MCB), where both the clouds, as well as the tens-of-meters scale sea-going implementation vessels cannot be captured in detail. Previous research using cloud resolving modelling has shown that neglecting such details may lead to MCB effectiveness being overestimated by up to half. Realism of MCB effectiveness will likely improve from ongoing developments in the understanding and modelling of clouds. We also propose that realism can be increased via more specific improvements (see figure). A readily achievable example would be the reframing of previous MCB effectiveness estimates in light of the cloud resolving scale findings. Incorporation of implementation details could also be made – via parameterisation – into future global-scale modelling of MCB. However, as significant unknowns regarding the design of the MCB aerosol production technique remain, resource-intensive cloud resolving computer modelling of MCB may be premature unless of broader benefit to the wider understanding of clouds. One of the most essential recommendations is for enhanced communication between climate scientists and MCB designers. This would facilitate the identification of potentially important design aspects necessary for realistic computer simulations. Such relationships could be mutually beneficial, with computer modelling potentially informing more efficient designs of the MCB implementation technique.

In this session I will look at the literature basis that was available for TCRE at the time of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, providing an easy-to-access introduction into the TCRE concept. Building on this basis and summarizing my own recent work on this, I will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the use of TCRE for climate policy.

            "abstract": "The Indonesian archipelago encompasses a wide range of tectonic environments, including island arc volcanism, subduction zones, and arc-continent collision. Many of the details of this tectonic activity are still poorly understood, especially where the Australian continent collides with Indonesia, separating the Sunda Arc in west from that at the Banda Arc in the east. While it seems clear that the Australian plate is subducted under both the Sunda and Banda Arcs, it is not clear what happens along the 1000 km -long stretch in between. The question of just where the plate motion is accommodated is of major importance to assessments of earthquake and tsunami hazard in the region.\nTo help resolve these questions the Geospatial Information Agency of Indonesia has collaborated with the Australian National University and the Bandung Institute of Technology in a GPS campaign spanning much of eastern Indonesia, from Lombok in the west to Alor in the east. We have combined these data with those from previous campaigns, resulting in over 27 campaign and 18 continuous GPS sites being used in the analysis. The improvement in site density allowed us to develop of a more complete description of tectonic activity in this region than has been obtained in previous studies. Our preliminary results suggests that there is a relatively simple transition from subduction at the Java Trench off east Java, to a partitioned convergence along both the Timor Trough and the Flores Thrust in the Nusa Tenggara region.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we describe the OpenGeoSys (OGS) project, which is a scientific open-source initiative for numerical simulations of thermo-hydro-mechanical/chemical processes in fractured porous media. The basic concept is to provide a flexible numerical framework (using primarily the Finite Element Method (FEM)) for solving multi-field problems in porous and fractured media for applications in geoscience, hydrology and energy conversion. To this purpose OGS is based on an object-oriented (OO) FEM concept including a broad spectrum of interfaces for pre- and post-processing. OGS has been developed since the mid-eighties, has been continuously improved in concept and evolved through Fortran, C, and C++ implementations. The idea behind OGS is to provide an open platform to the scientific community featuring professional software-engineering tools such as platform-independent compiling and automated benchmarking. Comprehensive benchmarking books (Kolditz et al. 2012, 2014) and tutorials (Sachse et al. 2014) are being published. Benchmarking has proven to be a valuable tool for cooperation between different developer teams, for example, for code comparison and validation purposes (DEVOVALEX, CO2 BENCH and SSBENCH projects). The computational efficiency of OO codes is very important in scientific computing (Wang et al. 2009). We have already parallelized the OO codes by using both custom schemes and the PETSc library (Wang et al. 2014). Meanwhile the 6th version, ogs6, is under construction to further foster various parallel computing techniques and to improve code modularity for enhancing collaborative development by several researchers. The code is openly accessible via GitHub (\nhttps://github.com/ufz/ogs\n) and our development workflow extensively builds on Git features such as branching, merging automatic compiling, executing unit tests and code review to improve communication among developers and maintain code quality. OGS also provides a graphical user interface (DataExplorer)to visualize and construct complex hydrological models together with measured data (Rink et al. 2014). Thus, the OpenGeoSys project provides a powerful means for the analysis, simulation and visualization of coupled problems across different scales and scientific disciplines.",

            "abstract": "Characteristics of precipitation extremes are important in many practical applications, including hydrological modelling, design of hydraulic structures, urban planning, etc. Numerous studies have examined the distributions of precipitation extremes in observed data and climate model simulations, using methods of local or regional frequency analysis of different complexity. Rather surprisingly, little attention has been given to the possibility of modelling probabilities of precipitation extremes using a two-component generalized extreme value (TCEV) distribution for precipitation extremes of predominantly convective and stratiform origin. The probable reason is the lack of long-term series of precipitation data disaggregated according to their origin into convective or stratiform.\nWe apply a recently proposed algorithm for disaggregating station precipitation data (Rulfová and Kyselý 2013), and analyze disaggregated 6-hour precipitation amounts with respect to their characteristics at 11 stations in the Czech Republic over 1982-2010. The TCEV distribution is used for estimating high quantiles, and the results are compared with fitting a single generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. Regional frequency modelling, which takes into account all data from the 11 stations to describe the extreme value distribution at any site is considered to reduce random and climatologically irrelevant variations in the estimates of the model parameters and high quantiles. The model developed in this study allows the location parameter to vary over the region, while the dispersion coefficient (the ratio of the scale and location parameters) and the shape parameter are assumed to be constant over the region. The adequacy of this regional model is tested thoroughly. The use of nonparametric and parametric bootstrap methods to construct confidence intervals for high quantiles is discussed.\n",

Along with other hydrated minerals, they mostly formed during the first million years of the Solar System by aqueous alteration on the meteorite parent body. These secondary minerals could provide constraints to the processes of alteration. Here we developed a two-step protocol (room temperature gel precipitation / hydrothermal growth, in anoxic conditions) for the synthesis of Fe-serpentines with a controlled Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio in order to improve our understanding of Fe-serpentines formation. XRD analyses of the gels and electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) suggest the formation of Fe-serpentine seeds at room temperature. These germs have integrated significant amounts (up to 24%) of tetrahedral Fe3+, as indicated by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Hydrothermal growth at 60°C yields a clear improvement of crystallinity, further suggesting that Fe-serpentines form at low temperatures, lower than Mg-serpentines. We report that among the samples, whose composition covers the solid solution between greenalite (Fe2+-serpentine) and cronstedtite, crystallinity improves with the Fe/Si and the Fe3+ content, which respective roles remain to be evaluated. In chondrites’ parent body, Fe is mostly released by the aqueous alteration of metallic alloys and Fe2+-bearing anhydrous silicates (mostly olivine and pyroxene) and sulfides. We suggest that the formation of cronstedtite, which is associated with the early stages of parent body alteration, might have been kinetically favored by the oxidation of Fe. This raises the question of the processes involved, in the anoxic chondritic environment.",

            "abstract": "During the spring of 2014, a team of Spanish and Mexican scientists explored the western margin of Mexico in the frame of the TSUJAL project. The two main objectives were to characterize the nature and structure of the lithosphere and to identify potential sources triggering earthquakes and tsunamis at the contact between Rivera plate-Jalisco block with the North American Plate. With these purposes a set of marine geophysical data were acquired aboard the RRS James Cook.\nThis work is focus in the southern part of the TSUJAL survey, where we obtain seismic images from the oceanic domain up to the continental shelf. Thus, more than 800 km of MCS data, divided in 7 profiles, have been acquired with a 6km long streamer and using an air-gun sources ranging from 5800 c.i. to 3540 c.i. Furthermore, a wide-angle seismic profile of 190 km length was recorded in 16 OBS deployed perpendicular to the coast of Manzanillo. Gravity and magnetic, multibeam bathymetry and sub-bottom profiler data were recorded simultaneously with seismic data in the offshore area.\nPreliminary stacked MCS seismic sections reveal the crustal structure in the different domains of the Mexican margin. The contact between the Rivera and NA Plates is observed as a strong reflection at 6 s two way travel time (TWTT), in a parallel offshore profile (TS01), south of Manzanillo. This contact is also identified in a perpendicular profile, TS02, along a section of more than 100 km in length crossing the Rivera transform zone, and the plate boundary between Cocos and Rivera Plates. Northwards, offshore Pto. Vallarta, the MCS data reveals high amplitude reflections at around 7-8.5 s TWTT, roughly 2.5-3.5 s TWTT below the seafloor, that conspicuously define the subduction plane (TS06b). These strong reflections which we interpret as the Moho discontinuity define the starting bending of subduction of Rivera Plate.\nAnother clear pattern observed within the first second of the MCS data shows evidences of a bottom simulating reflector (BSR) along the continental margin, particularly strong offshore Pto.

            "abstract": "Subglacial overdeepenings are common features beneath contemporary ice masses and in formerly glaciated regions that raise management issues related to the disposal of radioactive waste in deep geological repositories. Their formation mechanisms are still unclear but subglacial hydrology likely plays a key role. Subglacial water flow is strongly influenced by the bed topography through the dependence of the melting point of ice on pressure. This means that water descending into an overdeepening has more energy available to melt channels and conversely water ascending out has less or even no energy available for melt. The latter process leads to a reduced drainage capacity and, consequently, to increased water pressures.\nI investigate the effects of an overdeepening on subglacial hydrology using the GlaDS model, which simulates distributed and channelized drainage in 2D. Of primary interest are the extent and location of distributed and channelised flow, and magnitude and distribution of effective pressure. I present results for different bed topographies as well as for a range of model parameters and forcings. I interpret the results using GlaDS coupled to models of erosion based on plucking, and sediment transport capacity in suspension and as bed-load.",

            "abstract": "GIFT workshops are a two-and-a-half-day teacher enhancement workshops organized by the EGU Committee on Education and held in conjunction with the EGU annual General Assembly. The program of each workshop focuses on a different general theme each year. Past themes have included, for example, “Natural Hazards”, “Biodiversity and Evolution”, “The Polar Regions”, “The Carbon Cycle” and “The Earth from Space”. These workshops combine scientific presentations on current research in Earth and Space Sciences, given by prominent scientists attending EGU General Assemblies, with hands-on, inquiry-based activities that can be used by the teachers in their classrooms to explain related scientific principles or topics. Participating teachers are also invited to present their own classroom activities to their colleagues, regardless of the scientific topic. The main objective of these workshops is to communicate first-hand scientific information to teachers in primary and secondary schools, significantly shortening the time between discovery and textbook. The GIFT workshop provides the teachers with materials that can be directly incorporated into their classroom, as well as those of their colleagues at home institutions. In addition, the full immersion of science teachers in a truly scientific context (EGU General Assemblies) and the direct contact with leading geoscientists stimulates curiosity towards research that the teachers can transmit to their pupils. In addition to their scientific content, the GIFT workshops are of high societal value. The value of bringing teachers from many nations together includes the potential for networking and collaborations, the sharing of experiences and an awareness of science education as it is presented in other countries. Since 2003, the EGU GIFT workshops have brought together more than 600 teachers from more than 25 nations. At all previous EGU GIFT workshops teachers mingled with others from outside their own country and informally interacted with the scientists, providing a venue for rich dialogue for all participants. The dialogues often included ideas about learning, presentation of science content and curriculum. Programs and presentations of past GIFT workshops, with some available with Web streaming, are available at: http://gift.egu.eu/gift-symposia.html",

            "abstract": "The export of terrestrial carbon into the coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine was investigated from an extended field program that spanned three years and sampled four of the largest Maine and New Brunswick watersheds. Monthly observations of optical, biogeochemical and water quality parameters were collected at 67 stations during ice-free conditions. Optical proxies for biogeochemical properties were quantified with the emphasis on investigating three pools of organic carbon: algal carbon from chlorophyll fluorescence, particulate organic carbon from particle backscattering, and dissolved organic carbon from fluorescent dissolved organic matter. These proxies remained statistically robust throughout the sampling period and between watersheds. Seasonal and interannual patterns in the carbon pools varied predictably with latitude, land cover and discharge. Monthly observations indicated that dissolved organic carbon dominated total carbon export and further, that its concentration exhibited a strong coherence with river discharge, particularly the fall discharge peak. Watersheds with significant wetland were associated with the highest dissolved organic carbon concentrations over other land coverage types. While algal carbon from riverine primary production is not significant in terms of carbon export, it does significantly reduce the inorganic nutrient flux from rivers to coastal waters. Non-algal particulate organic carbon was the smallest component with isolated tributaries contributing non-negligible contributions to total organic carbon flux. In situ optical sensors deployed at the mouths of each river yielded hourly estimates of organic carbon concentration and export allowing elucidation of the variability in flux dynamics such as a hysteresis in the relationship between carbon concentration and river discharge that was not observed on weekly or monthly sampling regimes. Such observations are used to improve modeled estimates of annual carbon export.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, much research has been directed to understanding the coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere. In particular, major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events (and the breakdown of the wintertime Northern Hemisphere polar vortex) have been linked to the descent of stratospheric polar temperature and wind anomalies toward the surface and their projection onto the annular mode of climate variability. Recently, between 2005-2013, major SSWs have occurred in 7 separate NH winters – more frequently than what had been observed prior to 2005.\nObservational and modeling capabilities above the upper stratosphere reveal that major SSWs are invariably coupled to the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). With the onset of rapid polar warming and wind reversal, this upward reach of major SSWs is manifested in the elevation of the stratopause, cooling of the polar mesosphere, and enhanced descent of trace species into the stratosphere from their MLT reservoirs. Thus, examining the MLT dynamics associated with major SSWs may improve our understanding of SSW evolution and its eventual impact on surface climate.\nHere, we use 3-hourly output from the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with “Specified Dynamics”, in which the simulation is constrained by meteorological re-analyses below 1 hPa. Model results are complemented by MLT meteor radar measurements and satellite observations from NASA SABER and MLS. To elucidate the associated MLT dynamics, case studies and composite of major SSW events with elevated stratopause occurring between 1994-2013 are carried out.\nThe interplay between gravity wave (GW) and planetary wave (PW) forcing is important in the initiation of major SSW and the vortex recovery. Characteristics of both GWs and PWs evolve with the SSW lifecycle. MLT GW zonal momentum forcing switches from westward to eastward with SSW onset and back to westward at the formation of the elevated stratopause. Enhancement of PWs in the MLT occurs shorty after SSW onset and is associated either with strong upward propagating PWs (of tropospheric origin) that had been ducted into the MLT or generated in situ by flow instability induced by the altered circulation. The combined GW and PW forcings drive the strong wind and temperature anomalies linking the polar stratosphere with the MLT.",

With the goal of moving beyond testing the null hypothesis that the sediment core data are consistent with the modern circulation we seek to reconstruct the most probable paleocirculation based on our knowledge of ocean dynamics and available constraints from sediment-core radiocarbon records. We propose a Bayesian inversion approach in which we use a modern circulation estimate constrained by modern radiocarbon data to define the mean of the prior probability distribution for the unknown paleocirculation. The approach resolves the indeterminacy of the inverse problem by choosing a paleocirculation that is minimally different from the modern circulation while still being consistent with the available sediment-core radiocarbon records. In this talk we will present the general formulation of the method as well as various approximations to reduce the computational challenge.",

Such seasonal or decadal deformation signals are useful for the estimation of the amount of load and the parameterization of crust and upper mantle – typically under an elastic or a visco-elastic mechanism. Since 2010, we established a study of surface loading using small baseline InSAR time-series analysis. Four sites are included in this study, which are Vatnajokull ice cap, Lake Yamzho Yumco, Petermann glacier, and Barnes ice cap using different satellites such as ERS1/2, Envisat, Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X.\nWe present results that mainly answer three questions: 1) Is InSAR time-series capable for the detection of millimeter level deformation due to surface loading; 2) When the Earth’s rheology is known, how much load change occured; 3) When the surface loading is known, what are the Earth’s parameters such as Young’s modulus, viscosity. For glacier retreat problem, we introduce a new model for the ice mass loss estimation considering the spatial distribution of ice loss. For lake unloading problem, modeled elastic parameters are useful for the comparison to other 1-D models, e.g. the model based on seismic data.",

            "abstract": "The South China Sea (SCS) region was situated during Mesozoic on the upper plate of a subduction zone. It later evolved as a collapsed continental basin on the edge of the Yenshanian Andean-type orogeny which has been since then considerably eroded, exposing only granites and relicts of Cretaceous molasse basins. The continental crust rifted from the Paleocene to the Mid Oligocene in the eastern part, and the rifting continued until the Middle Miocene in the SW, in an environment of marginal basin opened in the midst of the lower plate. Both spreading and rifting ceased when the subduction of the Proto South China Sea (PSCS) was blocked. Finally the SCS basin which was previously always open to the NE, became isolated by the docking of the northern Philippine Mobile Belt in Luzon, Mindoro and Taiwan islands, during the Late Miocene. Since then the basin subsided whereas the margins observed various amount of uplift, and subsequent gravity tectonics.\nWe illustrate how these event are interdependent, the Cretaceous active margin opening the PSCS by rifting and oceanic crust developed from magma-poor rifting to subsequent seafloor spreading in the Paleogene. It is not clear how the inherited sub continental mantle played a role in the unusual rifting style of the SCS, whose upper crust was extremely stretched for a large time span and was sustained near sea level during the entire duration of the rifting process. The large Jurassic and Cretaceous granitic bodies conditioned the location of the extension via large detachments and normal faults; so that the present day morphology of the sea floor still reflects the location of the granites on which large reefal platforms developed. The mid Miocene cessation of subduction in the PSCS created shortening which jammed its sediments on the NE margin of Borneo, thus generating sub-aerial conditions for the NW Borneo wedge. The resulting erosion created the large deltas starting from the end of the Early Miocene. Excess of sediment loading in the deltas induced gravity tectonics.\nAll these events created favorable setting for oil and gas prospectivity; the rifting conditions with very shallow to fluvio-lacustrine environment over a long time was suitable for organic matter, reef developments, and basins with granite-derived sand deposits, and the FTB and gravity tectonics developed in the South.",

            "abstract": "After a wildfire in forested terrain, erosion is typically much greater than background forest erosion. This is due to changes in soil erodibility and water infiltration that follow wildfire. Many prior studies have documented the changes in erosional magnitude following wildfire, but this study examines how the erosion/deposition is spatially distributed. This is only possible due to the use of terrestrial LiDAR, which allows us to track centimeter-scale changes in soil depth. With terrestrial LiDAR data we are able to show how erosion and depositional patterns change over time as the landscape recovers from the wildfire disturbance. These high-resolution data represent a critical step forward for efforts to understand the sources/sinks of erosion after wildfire.\nThis study was conducted on a hillslope burned by the 2010 Fourmile Canyon wildfire approximately 15 km west of Boulder, CO. The first LiDAR survey was conducted within 3 weeks of the wildfire and before any significant rainstorms. Four more LiDAR surveys were conducted over a two-year period. These surveys were conducted before and after large rainstorms, so that the erosional effect of large rainstorms could be observed. The changing patterns of erosion/deposition over time were observed by differencing the topographic datasets created from each LiDAR survey.\nOur results show a hysteresis in the geomorphic change. The erosional response after rainstorms was strongly influenced by the previous erosional events and pre-existing site morphology. The overall erosion pattern is patchy because much of the erosion is locally interrupted by immobile objects such as boulders, bedrock, or trees. Over the entire study period we documented that the volume of sediment eroded from hillslopes was nearly twice as high as volume eroded from convergent areas; however, when the erosion is expressed as a yield per unit area the yield from convergent areas was greater than the yield from hillslope areas.",

Research vessel “Pourquoi Pas?” sailed on 15 May from Lisbon, Portugal to Greenland to arrive in Newfoundland, Canada on 30 June 2014. The North Atlantic Current carries the warm subtropical waters northward. They are progressively cooled and eventually reach the formation regions of the North Atlantic Deep Waters in the Labrador and Greenland Seas. This water mass movement drives the Meridional Ocean Circulation and Earth climate. Ongoing climate change makes this a zone of particular interest. Previous OVIDE cruises along the same transect gathered valuable data to investigate temporal changes. This zone also receives atmospheric deposition from Europe and North America where industrial Hg emissions peaked in the 1970s. Here we investigate how climate may impact mercury’s marine biogeochemical cycle, how anthropogenic mercury makes its way into the ocean interior and whether the temporal evolution of mercury emissions is traceable in water masses of different ages. Total mercury was sampled using an ultra-trace clean rosette and determined on board in a class100 clean container following the US EPA 1631 method. Along the >4500km-transect we established full-depth total mercury profiles on 31 stations totaling 530 data points. Average total mercury concentrations were 0.58±0.20pM and showed a general decreasing trend westwards and increased with depth.",

            "abstract": "To sustain growing food demand and increasing standard of living, global water withdrawal and consumptive water use have been increasing rapidly. To analyze the human perturbation on water resources consistently over large scales, a number of macro-scale hydrological models (MHMs) have been developed in recent decades. However, few models consider the interaction between terrestrial water fluxes, and human activities and associated water use, and even fewer models distinguish water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Here, we couple a global water demand model with a global hydrological model and dynamically simulate daily water withdrawal and consumptive water use over the period 1979-2010, using two re-analysis products: ERA-Interim and MERRA. We explicitly take into account the mutual feedback between supply and demand, and implement a newly developed water allocation scheme to distinguish surface water and groundwater use. Moreover, we include a new irrigation scheme, which works dynamically with a daily surface and soil water balance, and incorporate the newly available extensive global reservoir data set (GRanD). Simulated surface water and groundwater withdrawals generally show good agreement with reported national and sub-national statistics. The results show a consistent increase in both surface water and groundwater use worldwide, with a more rapid increase in groundwater use since the 1990s. Human impacts on terrestrial water storage (TWS) signals are evident, altering the seasonal and inter-annual variability. This alteration is particularly large over heavily regulated basins such as the Colorado and the Columbia, and over the major irrigated basins such as the Mississippi, the Indus, and the Ganges. Including human water use and associated reservoir operations generally improves the correlation of simulated TWS anomalies with those of the GRACE observations.",

Extreme rainfall has been increasing and is expected to continue to increase in the future. Droughts have been increasing in some regions and are projected to become more intense in most areas due to increases in evaporation. On certain aspects of precipitation and storms, strong statements were not made because of uncertainties in the science. Projections of flooding are uncertain because of the complexities of seasonal timing of extreme rainfall increases, counteracting influence of decreased soil moisture, and the interactions of climate changes with watershed characteristics. While droughts may increase in intensity in most areas, there are uncertainties in northern areas where precipitation may increase. Winter storm characteristics are likely to change but there are competing influences of increased temperatures, northward shift in tracks, and increases in atmospheric water content.",

            "abstract": "The SE Asian, Indian and Indonesian-Australian monsoonal subsystems are closely inter-linked, but show substantial differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation, mainly due to contrasting land-sea distribution and high latitude control. We explore changes in these subsystems in relation to high latitude climate variability on suborbital and orbital timescales, focusing on the last deglaciation and the long-term Miocene evolution. Our main proxies are δ18O and Mg/Ca based salinity and temperature reconstructions in combination with sedimentary and geochemical runoff signatures. Key issues are the synchroneity of monsoonal precipitation changes in relation to northern and southern hemisphere insolation and the response of individual subsystems to atmospheric CO2 and global ice volume variations.\nIn contrast to northern hemisphere monsoonal records, the deglacial intensification of the Australian summer monsoon paralleled southern hemisphere climate evolution. We hypothesize that intensification of the summer heat low over the Australian continent through enhanced greenhouse forcing accentuated the southward pull of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Additional forcing mechanisms including the variability of the Walker circulation and Indian Ocean Dipole, the heat and moisture transfer from the tropical Indian Ocean and deglacial sea-level changes remain highly debated.\nHigh-resolution Miocene records from the South China Sea (ODP Site 1146) indicate that the latitudinal displacement of the ITCZ also impacted the long-term development of the SE Asian summer monsoon. Antarctic ice growth episodes at 14.6, 14.2, 13.9, and 13.1 Ma coincided with surface warming and freshening, implying high sensitivity of tropical rain belts to the inter-hemispheric temperature gradient. However, comparable records of the long-term evolution of the Indian and Indonesian-Australian monsoonal subsystems that would allow testing of this hypothesis are still missing. High-resolution sedimentary archives recently recovered during IODP Expedition 346 (Asian Monsoon) and to be drilled during IODP Exp 353 (Indian Monsoon) will enable direct comparison of the three monsoonal subsystems and reconciliation of linkages between marine and land records.",

            "abstract": "Although most faults are surrounded by a halo of fractured rock known as a damage zone, it is not clear what role damage zones play during the seismic cycle on mature faults. Here, we present a superbly-located foreshock-mainshock-aftershock sequence surrounding the November 8, M5 Prague Oklahoma earthquake, which demonstrates most aftershocks are located within the damage zone surrounding the fault. The 2011 Prague, Oklahoma sequence included three M5+ earthquakes along three different faults over a three-day period. The November 8th event was third in the sequence and captured with an array of nine seismometers with ~2 km spacing, allowing for precise event location. We located more than 1000 foreshocks and aftershocks within a 14 hour time window, and relocated these aftershocks using waveform cross correlation and HypoDD. Because of the location precision, we can use these events to investigate spatial and temporal complexity of the foreshock and aftershock sequences.\nFirst, we compare the aftershock distribution to fracture distributions within damage zones surrounding faults. The aftershock sequence localizes to a reasonable damage zone thickness given the rupture length of the event, according to previously documented scaling between fault length and damage zone thickness. Furthermore, the aftershock density is constant within the fault zone, but falls off precipitously outside of the damage zone. Most aftershocks in this sequence occur within the first hour after the mainshock, and there is some indication of temporal migration of aftershocks away from the fault. Finally, foreshock activity along this fault was limited to the intersection with the fault that had hosted a M5.7 earthquake two days prior. Because this earthquake is potentially linked to fluid waste disposal, we interpret our results in terms of hydraulic pressure changes during the foreshock-mainshock-aftershock sequence.",

            "abstract": "Changing the structure of soil biogeochemical models to represent coupling between microbial biomass and carbon substrate pools could improve predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks. So-called “microbial models” with this structure make very different predictions from conventional models based on first-order decay of carbon substrate pools. Still, the value of microbial models is uncertain because microbial physiological parameters are poorly constrained and model behaviors have not been fully explored. To address these issues, we developed an approach for inter-comparing microbial and conventional models. We initially focused on soil carbon responses to microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and temperature. Three scenarios were implemented in all models at a common reference temperature (20°C): constant CUE (held at 0.31), varied CUE (-0.016°C-1), and 50% acclimated CUE (-0.008°C-1). Whereas the conventional model always showed soil carbon losses with increasing temperature, the microbial models each predicted a temperature threshold above which warming led to soil carbon gain. The location of this threshold depended on CUE scenario, with higher temperature thresholds under the acclimated and constant scenarios. This result suggests that the temperature sensitivity of CUE and the structure of the soil carbon model together regulate the long-term soil carbon response to warming. Compared to the conventional model, all microbial models showed oscillatory behavior in response to perturbations and were much less sensitive to changing inputs. Oscillations were weakest in the most complex model with explicit enzyme pools, suggesting that multi-pool coupling might be a more realistic representation of the soil system. This study suggests that model structure and CUE parameterization should be carefully evaluated when scaling up microbial models to ecosystems and the globe.",

Not only do stratigraphic sections from these basins extend back millions of years, many of the intervals represented contain high-resolution material of decadal resolution or better. East African lake basins remain sparsely sampled however, with only a few long and continuous records available. Our ability to image the lakes using seismic reflection methods greatly exceeds our opportunities for coring and drilling however; assessing stratal relationships observed in the geophysical data permits powerful inferences about past hydrologic changes. With intensive hydrocarbon exploration work underway in East Africa, industry well data can also help constrain and ground truth basin histories.\nSubstantial spatio-temporal hydrologic variability is observed in East African basins over the past 200 kyr. Paleohydrological changes in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene are now well constrained in the northern hemisphere East African topics, with widespread aridity and in some cases lake desiccation observed during Heinrich Event 1. A climate recovery followed in the northern hemisphere East African tropics, with the early Holocene African Humid Period a time of positive water balance across most of the rift valley. The paleohydrology of southern hemisphere tropical East Africa is more equivocal, for instance with negligible draw-down of Lake Malawi at HE1.\nWhereas these late Pleistocene events represent substantial climate reorganizations, severe droughts during the middle-late Pleistocene (150-65 kyr BP) were far more intense, and produced much more severe drawdowns of Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika. Scientific drill cores, kullenberg cores, and extensive seismic reflection data sets from Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika provide indisputable evidence for lowstands of -500m and -600 m respectively. Climate changes that lowered the levels of the large lakes several hundred meters, or desiccated them completely, were regional in extent and would have undoubtedly impacted our early ancestors and early modern humans, as well as drowning and burying ancient sites of early modern human occupation.",

The CO2 also contains trace amounts of noble gases, used by previous authors and this study to identify the migration direction and quantify mass of CO2 dissolved. We present a simple analytical model and experimental verification showing that noble gases in even trace amounts will not move uniformly with a migrating gas plume in the crust. Due to varying degrees of solubility in groundwater, the more volatile gases will tend to enrich at the front of the migrating CO2 plume. This effect can be used to improve interpretations of subsurface noble gas concentration gradients.",

            "abstract": "For several decades, Earth observations (EO) have been employed to monitor agriculture, including crop area, type, condition, and yield forecasting processes. However, the EO data required to consistently derive these informational products at multiple scales had not been well-defined. Responding to this dearth, we have articulated spatially explicit EO requirements with a focus on moderate resolution (10-70m) active and passive remote sensors, and evaluated current and near-term missions’ capabilities to meet these EO requirements. These spatially explicit requirements incorporate cropland location, growing season timing, and cloud cover information, establishing the revisit frequency required to yield reasonably clear views within 8 or 16 days. A comparison of these requirements with hypothetical constellations formed from current/planned moderate resolution optical EO missions shows that to return a scene at least 70% clear within 8 or 16 days, 46-55% or 10-32% of cropped areas, respectively, require a revisit more frequent than 8 days, with is more frequent than Landsat 7 & 8 combined can deliver. Supplementing Landsat 7 & 8 with missions from different space agencies leads to an improved capacity to meet requirements, with Resourcesat-2 providing the largest incremental improvement in requirements met. Globally, no single mission/observatory can consistently meet all 8 or 16 day requirements throughout the year. Meanwhile, the only way to meet a majority of these requirements is through coordination of multiple missions. Gaps exist in persistently cloudy regions and periods, highlighting the need for data coordination and for consideration of active microwave EO for agricultural monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The Mesozoic suturing of the Blue Mountains province to North America was accompanied by a complex history of magmatism that ultimately culminated in the formation of the Idaho batholith. The oceanic terranes of the Blue Mountains were most likely assembled offshore in the Late Jurassic and accreted to North America in the Early Cretaceous, probably south of their current latitude. Suturing was followed by a renewal of subduction outboard of the Blue Mountains, leading to tonalitic and trondhjemitic magmatism in the eastern portion of the province from about 130 to 110 Ma. Additional compositionally diverse magmatism within the suture occurred from about 110 to 100 Ma and included the reworking of crustal material from both sides of the suture. This resulting mid-Cretaceous intrusive suite was collapsed by dextral transpressional deformation from ~102 to 92 Ma, leading to the formation of the western Idaho shear zone and transporting the Blue Mountains to their present latitude. During the later stages of WISZ deformation, continental arc magmatism migrated east of the WISZ and produced the early metaluminous phases of the Idaho batholith. By 90 Ma, a large metaluminous continental arc connecting to the Sierra Nevada in the south and Coast Mountains in the north existed in Idaho, but subsequent crustal thickening on the continental side of the WISZ led to pervasive crustal melting in two pulses between ~83 and 54 Ma, which obliterated much of the earlier magmatic history of the batholith. Further magmatism occurred in the Eocene in response to changing plate boundary conditions and onset of extension.",

            "abstract": "We use a data assimilation scheme coupled to a global climate model (GCM) to investigate the radiative impact of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of Mars. Temperature profiles from Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) are assimilated directly into the GCM. The water ice opacity profiles are used to build a four-dimensional time-space map of water ice clouds, which is then used by the GCM to produce the radiative forcing associated with clouds. This procedure allows clouds to be inserted into the model at the correct time and location, producing the most realistic state from which to analyse cloud radiative effects. The resulting data set allows a detailed study of the atmospheric state that is not possible using observations or models alone. The results show that tropical clouds have a greater impact on the local atmosphere than polar hood clouds, increasing diurnally-averaged temperatures at the 10 Pa level by around 10–15 K. The small radiative impact of the polar hood clouds may be caused by limitations of the MCS retrieval algorithm, meaning optically thick near-surface clouds are not retrieved. Tropical clouds also strengthen the meridional overturning circulation, leading to increased temperatures in the polar warmings by around 6–8 K, and increased temperatures in the tropics by around 2 K due to increased dust loading. The positions and wind speeds of the tropical and high-latitude jets are also modified through changes to the meridional temperature gradients. Work is ongoing to couple the assimilation of ice opacities to a model including an active water cycle.",

Despite considerable inter-annual variations, a frontal system can be inferred between shelf, continental slope and central Eurasian Basin waters in the upper 100 m of the water column along the continental slope. Net sea-ice melt is consistently found at the continental slope. However, the sea-ice meltwater signal is independent from the local retreat of the sea-ice edge and appears to be advected from upwind locations.\nIn addition to the along-slope frontal system at the continental shelf break, a strong gradient is identified on the Laptev Sea shelf at ~122-126°E with an eastward increase of riverine and sea-ice related brine water contents. These waters cross the shelf break at ~140°E and feed the Low Salinity Halocline Water (LSHW, salinity S<33) in the upper 50 m of the water column. High silicate concentrations in Laptev Sea bottom waters may lead to speculation about a link to the local silicate maximum found within the salinity range of ~33 to 34.5, typical for the Lower Halocline Water (LHW) at the continental slope. However brine signatures and nutrient ratios from the central Laptev Sea differ from those observed at the continental slope. Similar to the advection of the sea-ice melt signal along the Laptev Sea continental slope the nutrient signal at 50-70 m water depth within the LHW might also be fed by advection parallel to the slope. Thus, our analyses suggest that advective processes from upstream locations play a significant role in the meltwater distribution and halocline formation in the northern Laptev Sea.\nInter-annual variations within the properties of LHW are further investigated.",

In this work we present the first results on the use of multi-sensor remote sensing data to estimate AGB over three test sites in southern Mexico. In order to develop a set of AGB retrieval algorithms, we firstly compared different SAR parameters (e.g. multi-polarized backscatter intensities and interferometric coherence) obtained from ALOS PALSAR sensor and Landsat imagery with field-based AGB estimates using empirical regressions and analyzed the relationships between them. The next steps of the work will be development of a two‑stage up‑scaling approach: firstly, to enlarge the cal/val data, we propose to estimate AGB along airborne LiDAR (from G-LiHT sensor) transects using field-based AGB and LiDAR height metrics. With LiDAR-based AGB we will then calibrate SAR parameters in a non‑parametric model (e.g., randomForest) to create AGB maps over the study areas. An overall aim of the study is the analysis of capabilities and limitations of SAR data for AGB mapping and the investigation of the potential synergistic use of SAR, LiDAR and optical systems.The proposed monitoring tool will facilitate quantitative estimations in loss of carbon storage and support the selection of terrestrial (e.g. tropical dry forests, shrublands) sites for conservation priorities with high value for the national carbon budget.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen is an essential element for life and the maintenance of all ecosystems. For many ecosystems, both aquatic and terrestrial, nitrogen is the element most likely to limit the amount and rate of production. But just as ecosystems can suffer from too little nitrogen, they are also sensitive to too much nitrogen, which leads to eutrophication and structural changes in food webs. Thus the processes by which nitrogen is removed are as critical to our understanding of ecosystem function as are those by which it is added. Nitrogen loss processes in the open ocean have been the focus of research and discovery in recent years. Long thought to be dominated by the bacterial respiratory process of denitrification, N loss is now also known to occur by anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). We now understand that the ratio of the two processes is controlled by the quality and quantity of organic matter supplied to the anoxic waters of the ocean’s major oxygen deficient zones. Coastal environments are also major sites of N loss but excess N loading from land often ameliorates the direct dependence of anammox and denitrification on organic matter composition. The ratio is important partly because of side products: Denitrification is a significant source and sink for nitrous oxide (N2O), while anammox has no significant contribution to N2O biogeochemistry. With the anthropogenic flux of CFCs at least mostly under control, N2O emissions to the atmosphere are the greatest contribution to ozone destruction, and they also contribute to greenhouse warming. Both anthropogenic and natural sources contribute to N2O emissions, and natural sources are sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Our direct measurements of N2O production and consumption in the ocean agree with modeling results that have implicated multiple microbial processes and complex physical and biological control of N2O fluxes in the ocean.",

            "abstract": "Landscape fires play an important role in savannah ecosystem dynamics and are an important source of emissions of (greenhouse) gases and aerosols. Within the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project these fires are monitored using MODIS satellite data which now provides more than a decade of continuous observations. Africa is nowadays responsible for about 70% of global burned area and about 50% of fire carbon emissions, affecting regional air quality and global atmospheric composition.\nAlthough it has been reported that fire activity varies according to climatic and anthropogenic influences, much remains unclear about the drivers of the spatial distribution of fire activity over the African continent and its temporal dynamics. Resolving the drivers of this spatiotemporal variability is crucial to understand the future role of fire on the African continent. We developed a model to account for variations in fire activity due to climate, and investigated the role of sea surface temperatures on rainfall patterns and thus fire dynamics. Spatial variation and trends in cropland extent were used to improve understanding of underlying trends caused by socio-economic changes.\nOver 2001-2012, satellite observations indicate strong but opposing trends in the African hemispheres. Changes in precipitation, driven by the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which changed from El Niño to la Niña dominance over the study period, contributed substantially to the upward trend over southern Africa. This shift also contributed to the downward trend in northern Africa, but here rapid demographic and socio-economic developments contributed equally. Given the economic perspective of Africa and the oscillative nature of ENSO, future African savannah burned area will likely decline. Using MACC and GFED emissions estimates we expect that in the long term this decrease may be so substantial that forests may take over savannas as the main source of global fire emissions.",

            "abstract": "When crystals grow in liquids the composition of their outermost layer will reflect that of the host with which they are in equilibrium and will therefore record the liquid composition, pressure and temperature..\nFollowing separation from their sources, magmas differentiate. This change in liquid composition is driven largely by crystallisation in response to cooling or decompression. Other open system processes such as mixing and contamination are common. These can lead to abrupt changes in trace element and isotopic composition, accompanied by petrographic features, such as dissolution surfaces or zones of melt inclusions.\nWhere such careful mineral-scale studies have been performed, the prevalence of open system processes is clear. In many cases these are shown by core-rim isotopic variations. Crystal-scale compositional variations in the context of whole rock compositions and petrography have allowed us to show crustal assimilation even from regions of supposedly oceanic crust such as the Lesser Antilles.\nIn tandem with tracking magma evolution, core-rim analyses of appropriate crystals have also provided diffusion profiles which reflect timescales of magmatic processes. A key point, long recognised by Bruce Marsh, is that in situ geochemical data should be considered in a petrographic context in order to gain the most (and most credible) insights on the workings of magma systems from hand specimen to whole volcano/pluton scales: The petrographic microscope is not dead yet\nIdentification of magmatic processes from in situ scrutiny allows us to synthesise the architectures and inner workings of magma systems. The evidence for interaction among magmas in many systems is compelling and suggests that many exist as stacked dike-sill arrangements with wall-rock focussed crystal growth and mush zones. These are consistent with many of the systematics suggested some time ago by Bruce Marsh",

A significant part of the magma produced in the Earth’s mantle solidifies at depth and this limits our capability of determining magma fluxes, which, in turn, compromises our ability to establish a link between global heat transfer and large-scale geological processes. Using thermal modelling in combination with high precision zircon dating we show that populations of zircon ages provide an accurate mean to retrieve magma fluxes. The characteristics of zircon age populations vary significantly and systematically as function of the flux and total volume of magma accumulated at depth. This new approach provides results that are identical to independent determinations of magma fluxes and volumes of magmatic systems. The analysis of existing age population datasets by our method highlights that porphyry-type deposits, plutons and large eruptions each require magma input over different timescales at characteristic average fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The principal method for constraining the thermal and chemical structure of the Earth’s mantle and for tracing the chemical anomalies potentially caused by subduction is the interpretation of seismic observations based on phase equilibria and mineral physics models. In this context, garnet mineral elastic properties are critical since they form major components of both mafic and ultramafic rocks in the upper mantle and transition zone, and are in fact the main mineral host for Al2O3 and CaO throughout these regions.\nThe elastic properties of single crystals of majoritic garnet (Mg3.24Al1.53Si3.23O12 and Mg3.01Fe0.17Al1.68Si3.15O12) have been experimentally determined as a function of density, temperature and composition under hydrostatic conditions up to ~30 GPa and ~600 K in an externally heated diamond anvil cell. High pressure and temperature structural refinements using single-crystal X-ray diffraction data in combination with measurements of acoustic velocities provided fundamental insights into the interatomic forces and compression mechanisms controlling garnet elasticity.\nEnd-member garnet thermo-elastic properties were fitted using the experimental data collected on the two samples with mixed compositions. The end member properties were then combined to determine the elasticity of complex garnet solid solutions. Acoustic velocities and densities of mafic, harzburgitic and lherzolitic bulk compositions in the Earth’s transition zone and uppermost lower mantle have been then calculated taking into account the phase relations along a typical mantle adiabat. These models are then compared with seismic reference models over the same depth interval to constrain the possible thermal and chemical conditions of these regions. The results indicate that slab units are likely to accumulate and potentially create enduring chemical and thermal anomalies at the base of the transition zone.",

            "abstract": "V.M. Goldschmidt (1933) first suggested the use of Quaternary glacial till and loess to determine the average composition of the upper continental crust (UCC). We extend this approach back in time through the geochemical study of glacial diamictites from intervals of continental glaciation in the Paleozoic, Neoproterozoic, Paleoproterozoic, and Mesoarchean.\nThe diamictites record fundamental changes in the bulk composition of UCC through time, with the largest change occurring at the end of the Archean. Post-Archean diamictites have progressively lower Eu/Eu* and concentrations of 1st row transition metals (Sc, Cr, V, Ni, Co) and higher Th and U concentrations. δ18O whole-rock values steadily increase through the Precambrian, with average values of 6.0 ± 1.6, 8.3 ± 0.4, 12.3 ± 0.9 per mil for the Mesoarchean, Paleoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic, respectively. All of these trends are consistent with production of a progressively more evolved UCC, which may reflect changes in the composition of primary crustal melts, as well as a change in the nature of intracrustal differentiation. Subtle increases in Lu/Hf through time imply the continual addition of juvenile crust from an increasingly depleted mantle reservoir, consistent with continuous continental growth rather than an Armstrong-like no-growth model, and suggesting that intracrustal differentiation is unlikely to be the sole driver of the other trends.\nIn addition to these uni-directional trends, Paleoproterozoic diamictites, which are dominated by 2.8 to 2.6 Ga provenance, show unique chemical characteristics (e.g., lowest Nb/Ta and highest La/Lu and Th/Nb). These features may reflect a distinctive geodynamic setting for the Neoarchean period, which was arguably the largest pulse of crustal growth in Earth’s history and was also accompanied by widespread cratonization.",

Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for it; one of them is a dissipation of large-scale variations of solar wind parameters into the thermal energy via turbulent cascades. Shocks, including the planetary bow shocks, represent a component of the solar wind turbulence that carries a most significant portion of a free energy. Consequently, investigations of the shocks from the point of view of turbulence are of a great interest.\nThe BMSW instrument onboard the Spektr-R spacecraft provides a high-time resolution data (31 ms) of the ion flux, velocity, density, and temperature suitable for an analysis of the frequency spectra up to 10 Hz. Based on this high-time resolution, we analyze an evolution of the frequency spectra on MHD and kinetic scales across fast forward low-Mach number shocks as well as changes through the Earth’s bow shock representing high-Mach number reverse shocks. A role of the foreshock processes in this evolution is highlighted. We discuss the upstream and downstream plasma parameters that determine the properties of the turbulence such as spectral slopes and breaks in the frequency spectra.",

After decades of research investment in data collection, theoretical and statistical analysis, and model development we have a number of empirical, statistical, and deterministic models that can predict the evolution of the shoreline, beaches, dunes, and wetlands over time scales of hours to decades, and even predict the evolution of geologic strata over the course of millennia. Comparisons of predictions to data have demonstrated that these models can have meaningful predictive skill. But these comparisons also highlight the deficiencies in fundamental understanding, formulations, or data that are responsible for prediction errors and uncertainty. Here, we review a subset of predictive models of the nearshore to illustrate tradeoffs in complexity, predictive skill, and sensitivity to input data and parameterization errors.

Many analyses of this mega-earthquake have been made based on different types of these data. In this work, we aim to reconcile them into a single better-resolved source model. To do so, we first present a kinematic 3D finite-fault slip joint inversion including an extended amount of complementary data: teleseismic, strong-motion, high-rate GPS, static GPS and tsunami records. The inversion fits all the data very well and reveals a patchy slip distribution with large-slip (up to 64 m) mostly located up-dip of the hypocenter and near the trench. We compare this co-seismic slip model and its time evolution to geophysical observations independent of the earthquake such as the seismicity before and after the earthquake, slab velocity anomalies imaged by tomography, rheological properties of the megathrust revealed by drilling and geological observations in the footwall. In an attempt to reconcile all these observations, we propose a rupture scenario in which the rupture started as a magnitude 7 like earthquake, in a region where events of this size are common. After 40-50s, the rupture reached an asperity locked for a very long time – possibly since the 869 Jogan earthquake – inducing enough stress perturbation to cause its rupture. Its rupture released an enormous amount of stress and lowered the effective friction of the megathrust located up-dip, allowing the footwall to slip with negligible dynamic friction. This scenario would explain the absence of aftershocks in the footwall and the presence of a large normal fault branching from the megathrust to the surface, which is a mark of particularly low friction on the megathrust. This scenario is supported by a stress-drop distribution derived from our inversion, which reveals a very high stress-drop patch correlated with the normal fault and a slab heterogeneity imaged by tomography.",

            "abstract": "In Central Asia, 90 % of the population depend on water stored in glaciers and mountain snow cover. Accelerated melting can be induced by the deposition of e.g., mineral dust and black carbon that reduce the surface albedo. Data on source regions and chemical characteristics of snow impurities are however scarce in Central Asia.\nWe studied aerosol deposited between summers of 2012 and 2013on three different glaciers in the Kyrgyz Republic. Samples were taken from two snow pits on the glacier Abramov in the northern Pamir and from one snow pit on Ak-Shiirak and Suek in the central Tien Shan. The snow was analyzed for elemental and total organic carbon, major ions and mineral dust. In addition, dissolved organic carbon was speciated by using the Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol spectrometer.\nElevated mineral dust concentrations were found on all glaciers during summer and winter with lower annual average concentrations (20 mg l-1)in the northern Pamir (factor 5 to 6). Correlations between dust tracers varied, indicating different source regions. Average EC concentrations showed seasonal variation in the northern Pamir (> 100 µg l-1 in summer, < 30 µg l-1 in winter) while there was little variation throughout the year in the central Tien Shan (~ 200 µg l-1). Similarly, OC:EC ratios showed no seasonal cycle in that region averaging around 3. On Abramov, the ratio was significantly higher in winter (> 12) than in summer (< 4). The average O:C ratios across all glaciers ranged between 0.65 and 1.09, indicating a high degree of oxygenation which suggests long-range transport of the organic snow impurities. Marker substances such as potassium and mercury and their correlations suggest contribution from biomass burning emissions.\nAtmospheric measurements in August 2013 were conducted to obtain information on background aerosol characteristics in the remote high mountain areas. The average black carbon concentration was 0.26 µg/m³ (± 0.24 µg/m³).",

            "abstract": "The knowledge about the nutrients transport from the vadose zone of onsite wastewater treatment systems (commonly called septic systems) is crucial to protect groundwater quality as 25% of US population uses septic systems to discharge household wastewater. For example, our preliminary data showed that about 47% of applied water was recovered at 60-cm below drainfield of septic systems. This implies that contaminants present in wastewater, if not attenuated in the vadose zone, can be transported to shallow groundwater. This presentation will focus on the biophysical and hydrologic controls on the transport of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the vadose of two conventional (drip dispersal, gravel trench) and an advanced (with aerobic and anaerobic medias) system. These systems were constructed using two rows of drip pipe (37 emitters/mound) placed 0.3 m apart in the center of 6 m x 0.6 m drainfield. Each system received 120 L of wastewater per day. During 20-month period (May 2012 to December 2013), soil-water samples were collected from the vadose zone using suction cup lysimeters installed at 0.30, 0.60, and 1.05 m depth and groundwater samples were collected from piezometers installed at 3-3.30 m depth below the drainfield. A complimentary 1-year study using smaller drainfields (0.5 m long, 0.9 m wide, 0.9 m high) was conducted to obtain better insights in the vadose zone. A variety of instruments (multi-probe sensors, suction cup lysimeters, piezometers, tensiometers) were installed in the vadose zones. Results showed that nitrification controlled N evolution in drainfield and subsequent transport of N plumes (>10 mg/L) into groundwater. Most of the wastewater applied soluble inorganic P (>10 mg/L) was quickly attenuated in the drainfield due to fixation (sorption, precipitation) in the vadose zone (<0.10 mg/L), which was further reduced to <0.05 mg/L in groundwater. The hydrologic controls (primarily rainfall during June-September) facilitated transport of N, but not P, to shallow groundwater. The advanced system was extremely effective as it removed >95% N from wastewater, but was less effective at removing P. This presentation will conclude with importance of better septic system design and soil-based processes in reducing N and P transport to groundwater and protecting water quality in aquifers.",

            "abstract": "Heat transfer through the mantle is carried by convection, which involves plastic flow of the mantle constituents. Among these constituents, (Mg,Fe,Al)(Si,Al)O3 perovskite is known to be the most abundant. This material is deformed at very low strain rate (from 10-12 to 10-16 s-1), and under extreme pressure and temperature conditions (from 30 to 140GPa, 1500 to 4000°C). Its plastic behaviour is challenging to reproduce experimentally, but crucial for a better understanding of the Earth's dynamic.\nThe recent progress in modelling the behaviours of materials, which until now have been mostly used on metals, are applied here on MgSiO3 perovskite (Mg-Pv). We characterize dislocations at the atomic scale, as the first step of a multi-scale modelling approach on Mg-Pv plastic deformation.\nWe model dislocations with [100] and [010] Burgers vectors (described within the Pbnm space group), which are the shortest lattice parameters in the orthorhombic structure. Dislocation cores are determined to be described at various pressures. The resistance to glide of the dislocations is quantified indicating that [100](010) and [010](100) are the easiest slip systems in Mg-Pv over the full pressure range of the lower mantle.\nThe effect of temperature is introduced by assimilating the thermal activation on dislocation lines to vibrations of a string lying into a potential valley. These vibrations allow the dislocation to overcome locally the energy barrier that represents the lattice friction, and then propagates under the effect of stress. With this model, by combining elastic theory of dislocations and calculations at the atomic scale, a first expression of the strain rate produced by dislocation glide is provided.\nLeft figure : Thermally activated propagation of dislocation over the energy barrier\nRight figure : Shape of the crossing dislocation obtained from atomic scale modelling",

            "abstract": "The study of single gas slugs in volcanic conduits has received a large amount of focus within the literature. However, the more complex behaviour associated with the rise and burst of multiple slugs has yet to be considered in detail in a volcanic context. Here we combine observations and analyses of such activity using a three-pronged approach consisting of existing gas mass data collected during rapid slug driven activity at Mt. Etna, scaled laboratory analogue experiments, and computer simulations using the Ansys Fluent® fluid dynamics software. Particular focus was applied to the process of coalescence and wake capture during slug expansion and rise. The results indicate a variety of potential features and relationships, including: promotion of coalescence at distances further than predicted wake lengths, approximate maximum gas volume fraction and minimum magma viscosity values for the occurrence of stable multi-slug activity, and in the laboratory regimes a series of linear trends are associated with overall gas volume fraction and burst volume. A previously observed phenomenon at Mt. Etna, whereby larger slug bursting events are subject to a longer repose period prior to the following event, than smaller events, is also evident in the lab setting. By combining all acquired and modelled data, we derive an approximate relation, using existing formulae for slug base rise speed (Viana et al. 2003) and wake length (Campos and Guedes de Carvalho, 1988), to describe a minimum repose period which is likely to follow the burst of a slug at the surface. The outlined work has significant fluid dynamic implications for possible magma and conduit properties which can allow multi-slug activity at volcanic targets.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of planetary interiors is intrinsically connected to the behavior and properties of silicate melts at high pressures and temperatures. Our work comes as a complement to existing data expanding the pressure, temperature, and compositional ranges.\nWe used the V.A.S.P. code to perform NVT Molecular Dynamics simulations on two basic compositions: Mg2SiO4 and MgSiO3. All calculations are done within augmented planar wave formalism of the Density Functional Theory. Supercells of 160 atoms clino-enstatite and 112 atoms forsterite were melted at 5000K and then cooled and thermalized, using the Nose-Hoover thermostat, at temperatures more representative of Earth’s interior (3000 and 4000K). The pressure range of our investigations spans from 0 to approximately 160GPa. Since important properties, density and magnetism, are dependent on the presence of iron we also created (Fex-1,Mgx)SiO3 and (Fex-1,Mgx)2SiO4melts from the thermalized pure compositions by replacing the desired amount of magnesium atoms with iron. Because other transitional elements present similar behavior as iron, and nickel is an important element in the core, compositions containing different amounts of nickel were also created by adding extra Ni atoms in the system.\nWe analyze in detail the behavior with pressure of the density, clustering and coordination, total magnetization, and thermodynamical parameters of the melts.\nOur results indicate that changes in the structure and magnetic moment of the Forsterite melt begin at relatively low pressure. As an application of our data to the Earth’s present deep interior we analyzed in great detail various possible mixtures of Fe bearing melt and solid mantle in an attempt to fit the density estimated for the Ultra Low Velocity Zones.",

            "abstract": "A number of recent studies have highlighted the observational evidence of a coupling between temperature and neutral wind to study the midnight brightness of 630.0 nm nightglow, which is usually related to midnight temperature maximum (MTM) effect. Thus, in this study, we calculate the volume emission rate of the 630.0 nm nightglow to investigate the influence of neutral temperature and meridional neutral wind. We utilize the SAMI2 model which involves the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter model (MSIS) and the Horizontal Wind Model (HWM) to simulate the charged and neutral species at 630.0 nm nightglow emission layer. The result shows that the neutral wind is more efficient to affect the emission rate of nightglow than temperature. It is found that a returning point shows up as the temperature changes. A returning point means the production rate of OI(1D) approximates to the loss rate of it. From the observations by ISUAL payload onboard the FORMOSAT-2 satellite, we frequently find the similar patterns during the selected seasons. Through the studies, it is also found the emission rate of OI(1D) could be expressed by the ratio [O+][O2]/[O].",

            "abstract": "Since over 200 years a number of studies debate the origin of the black or red, up to 250 µm thick coatings on desert rocks, referred to as rock varnish. The main components of varnish are poorly crystallized Mn and Fe oxides and clay minerals. Both biological and geological processes have been suggested for the genesis.\nWe used a combination of 200 nm-femtosecond LA-ICP-MS, focused ion beam (FIB) slicing and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy – near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS) for the high-spatial-resolution analysis of rock varnish from different locations (Negev, Israel; Knersvlakte, South Africa; Death Valley and Mojave Desert, California). Femtosecond LA-ICP-MS was used for the quantitative determination of major and trace element concentrations. In-situ measurements were conducted on thick sections with the advantages of non-matrix matched calibration, low ablation depth of ~10 µm for laser spot sizes of 10-40 µm and low detection limits of trace elements (< 0.01 – 1 µg g-1). Our results demonstrate that elements, such as Mn, Co, Pb, Ni and Cu, are highly enriched in varnish relative to the upper continental crust (up to a factor of 1000). Differences between varnishes from the various locations can be observed especially for the Mn/Fe (0.4-25.6), Mn/Ba (3-363) and Ni/Co (0.03-1.8) ratios. The REE patterns differ with LaN/YbN = 2-14 and positive Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce* = 1.1 – 9.1).\nTo study the internal structures of varnish, 100 – 200 nm thick FIB slices were prepared to perform mappings of Fe, Mn, O, N, CO3, K, Ca, and C at the nm scale. In addition, the oxidation stages of Mn and Fe were identified. Banded internal structures of Mn and organic C can be observed in some samples, and cavities that are partly filled by C and Mn rich material. Some coatings tend to incorporate bigger dust grains (> 1 µm), while others only show very fine grained material (< 0.1 µm). The results of the combined microanalytical techniques give us detailed insights that can be a further step to unravel the genesis of rock varnish.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation by Kalman filter of the radiation belts observations requires specification of poorly known relevant error statistics that need to be identified to provide the accurate reconstruction of the radiation belt dynamics. Identification of error statistics in data assimilation is of particular importance for radiation belt models, since large uncertainties of the observations and the model may cause the failure of data assimilation solution and lead to false conclusions about the state and evolution of radiation belts. In this study, we develop the identification technique of unknown model and observation errors for the successive assimilation of multiple-satellite observations characterized by large variety of observation error statistics. Further improvement and the accuracy increase of PSD reconstruction is demonstrated by the implementation of the backward smoothing procedure applied to the forward Kalman filter estimates.",

            "abstract": "The large disaster earthquakes had often occurred in the Nankai Trough with a great Tsunami event. In order to reduce a great deal of damage to coastal area from both strong ground motion and tsunami generation, it is necessary to understand rupture synchronization and segmentation of the Nankai megathrust earthquake. In the eastern Nankai Trough, it is known to be formed complicated structure by subducting Zenisu ridge. However, there are only old seismic profiles by Nakanishi et al. (1998) and Takahashi et al. (2002). It is difficult to evaluate the record of seismoturbidite in the sediments from old seismic data. Therefore we planned new survey around the Zenisu ridge in order to obtain the high resolution structure.\nJapan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology carried out new multi-channel seismic reflection (MCS) surveys over 1,000 km of line length from Kii Peninsula to Izu Peninsula in 2012 using tuned airgun array of 7,800 cu.in. and 6 km long streamer with 444 ch hydrophones.\nWe obtained five MCS lines along NW-SE direction and two MCS lines along NE-SW direction. Every profiles show the clear reflection from sediments, the top of oceanic crust and crustal structure. The reflectors from Moho discontinuity are identified in some survey lines. The sediments on the Shikoku Basin between the Nankai Trough and the Zenisu ridge have no deformation by subduction. On the other hand, the sediments of the southeastern edge of the Zenisu ridge indicate the compression structure by subduction. These results show the effect of the crustal deformation is stopped by the front of the Zenisu and/or paleo-Zenisu ridge. The lateral variations of sediment and basement along the Nankai Trough are also appeared in NE-SW survey line before subduction. Some convex structure of the basement in these variations are corresponds to the magnetic anomaly by Le Pichon et al. (1996). It is important to understand the incoming structure for the evaluation of rupture boundary.",

            "abstract": "India is one of the highly flood prone countries in the world. National flood commission has reported that 400,000 km² of geographical area is prone to floods, constituting to twelve percent of the country’s geographical area. Despite the reoccurrences of floods, India still does not have a proper flood warning system. Probably this can be attributed to the lack of trained personnel in using advanced techniques. Frequent flood hazards results in damage to livelihood, infrastructure and public utilities. India has a potential to develop an early warning system since it is one of the few countries where satellite based inputs are regularly used for monitoring and mitigating floods. However, modeling of flood extent is difficult due to the complexity of hydraulic and hydrologic processes during flood events. It has been reported that numerical methods of simulations can be effectively used to simulate the processes correctly. Progress in computational resources, data collection and development of several numerical codes has enhanced the use of hydrodynamic modeling approaches to simulate the flood extent in the floodplains.\nIn this study an attempt is made to simulate the flood in one of the sub basins of Godavari River in India using hydrodynamic modeling techniques. The modeling environment includes MIKE software, which simulates the water depth at every grid cell of the study area. The runoff contribution from the catchment was calculated using Nebdor Afstromnings model. With the hydrodynamic modeling approach, accuracy in discharge and water level computations are improved compared to the conventional methods. The results of the study are proming to develop effective flood management plans in the basin. Similar studies could be taken up in other flood prone areas of the country for continuous modernisation of flood forecasting techniques, early warning systems and strengthening decision support systems, which will help the policy makers in developing management plans and policies.",

            "abstract": "During megathrust earthquakes, great ruptures are accompanied by large scale mass redistribution inside the solid Earth and by ocean mass redistribution due to bathymetry changes. These large scale mass displacements can be detected using the monthly gravity maps of the GRACE satellite mission. In recent years it has become increasingly common to use the long wavelength changes in the Earth's gravity field observed by GRACE to infer seismic source properties for large megathrust earthquakes, such as the Mw ~ 9 2004 Sumatra-Andaman, 2010 Maule (Chile) and 2011 Tohoku-Oki (Japan) events. In Broerse et al. (2011) we examined the effect of the presence of an ocean above the rupture on long wavelength gravity changes and showed it to be of the first order.\nHere we revisit the implementation of an ocean layer through the sea level equation and compare the results with approximated methods that have been used in the literature.\nOne of the simplifications usually lies in the assumption of a globally uniform ocean layer. We show that especially in the case of the 2010 Maule earthquake, due to the closeness of the South American continent, the uniform ocean assumption causes errors up to 57% for modeled peak geoid height changes (expressed at a spherical harmonic truncation degree of 40). In addition, we show that when a large amount of slip occurs close to the trench, horizontal motions of the ocean floor play a mayor role in the ocean contribution to gravity changes. Using a slip model of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake that places the majority of slip close to the surface, the peak value in geoid height change increases by 50% due to horizontal ocean floor motion.\nWhen GRACE observations are used to determine earthquake parameters such as seismic moment or source depth, the uniform ocean layer method introduces large biases, depending on the location of the rupture with respect to the continent. The same holds for interpreting shallow slip when horizontal motions are not properly accounted for in the ocean contribution. In both cases the depth at which slip occurs will be underestimated.",

            "abstract": "The European Space Agency (ESA) is responding to the need for improved climate data through its Climate Change Initiative (CCI). Space-based observations are exploited to provide long-term measurements of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). In this work, results for the Ice Sheets CCI (\nhttp://www.esa-icesheets-cci.org/\n) are presented. Four parameters of ice sheet mass balance indicators are defined for the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS): Surface Elevation Changes; Ice Velocities; Calving Front Locations; Grounding Line Locations. Here, output from all four parameters is shown, with an emphasis on Surface Elevation Changes.\nAs part of the Ice Sheets CCI, a novel combined repeat track and crossover approach has been implemented for Envisat radar altimetry for the period 2002-2010, which resolves changes along the ice margin, as well as in the ice sheet interior. Non-repeat track data for the last two years of Envisat’s mission are also incorporated, using a different method to the one used for previous years. Furthermore, the results extend back in time through inclusion of ERS-1 and ERS-2 radar altimetry data. This provides a 20-year dH/dt of surface elevation changes covering the Greenland Ice Sheet, as well as five-year running means for the entire period showing regional accelerations and decelerations. These results form the input for the Ice Sheets CCI ECV product. Plans for the upcoming CCI extension include extension of the dH/dt series by CryoSat and Sentinel-3 altimetry.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone (HZ) contributes significantly to whole stream biogeochemical cycling. Biogeochemical reactions within the HZ are often transport limited, thus, understanding these reactions requires knowledge about the magnitude of hyporheic fluxes (HF) and the residence time (RT) of these fluxes within the HZ. While the hydraulics of HF are relatively well understood, studies addressing the influence of permeability heterogeneity lack systematic analysis and have even produced contradictory results (e.g. [1] vs. [2]). In order to close this gap, this study uses a statistical numerical approach to elucidate the influence of permeability heterogeneity on HF and RT.\nWe simulated and evaluated 3750 2D-scenarios of sediment heterogeneity by means of Gaussian random fields with focus on total HF and RT distribution. The scenarios were based on ten realizations of each of all possible combinations of 15 different correlation lengths, 5 dipping angles and 5 permeability variances. Roughly 500 hyporheic stream traces were analyzed per simulation, for a total of almost two million stream traces analyzed for correlations between permeability heterogeneity, HF, and RT.\nTotal HF and the RT variance positively correlated with permeability variance while the mean RT negatively correlated with permeability variance. In contrast, changes in correlation lengths and dipping angles had little effect on the examined properties RT and HF.\nThese results provide a possible explanation of the seemingly contradictory conclusions of recent studies, given that the permeability variances in these studies differ by several orders of magnitude.\n[1] Bardini, L., Boano, F., Cardenas, M.B, Sawyer, A.H, Revelli, R. and Ridolfi, L. “Small-Scale Permeability Heterogeneity Has Negligible Effects on Nutrient Cycling in Streambeds.” Geophysical Research Letters, 2013. doi:10.1002/grl.50224.\n[2] Zhou, Y., Ritzi, R.

            "abstract": "Global distributions and abundances of tropospheric constituents (O3, CH4, NOy, CO, VOCs, NHx, SOx and aerosols) interannually change under the influences of meteorology (transport, temperature, water vapor, clouds, rain, etc.) and emissions from anthropogenic/natural sources and biomass burning. Given the importance of climate effects of these species as short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), there have been increasing number of studies to project future changes in individual constituents and assess impacts of emission reduction in future. Since chemistry climate model is basically used for such purpose, model validation against the observations and precise interpretation/understanding of changing processes in a model are essentially needed. In this study, we investigate interannual variability of tropospheric constituents during the years 2000 to 2013 in a chemistry-aerosol coupled climate model. The base chemical model used in this study is CHASER (Sudo et al., 2002, 2007) coupled with the aerosol model SPRINTARS (Takemura et al., 2006). The CHASER model, also developed in the framework of the MIROC earth system model (MIROC-ESM-CHEM), simulates detailed chemistry in the troposphere and stratosphere with an on-line aerosol simulation including production of particulate nitrate and SOA. We use the NCEP reanalysis data (FNL) for constraining the model’s meteorology. Anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions are specified using the HTAP2 and MAC inventories, respectively. For biogenic VOCs emissions, we employ calculation by the land ecosystem/trace gas emission model VISIT (Ito et al., 2008). Our results show that temporal variability (anomaly) in surface and lower tropospheric ozone very clearly correlates with that in CO especially in NH, indicating principal importance of biomass burning emission in determining near-surface O3 variability; surface PM (PM2.5) in NH also coincides with CO. Changes in middle to upper tropospheric O3, on the other hand, basically respond to variability in transport from the stratosphere and lightning NOx production. It is also demonstrated that temporal variability in tropospheric mean OH is largely controlled by tropospheric abundances of O3, CO, and water vapor.",

            "abstract": "Recent megathrust earthquakes that occurred in Chile (2010) and Japan (2011) revealed a segmentation with depth of the megathrust interface: short period radiations were emitted from the deeper portion of the seismogenic zone (35-55km depth), while large coseismic slip, associated with little short period radiation and responsible for the tsunami generation, occurred on the shallower part of the subduction interface.\nOn April 1, 2014, a Mw 8.2 earthquake occurred close to the city of Pisagua in the central part of the seismic gap of southern Peru - northern Chile. This earthquake occurred in a densely instrumented area in a joint effort between Chilean, French, German and USA institutions. It is therefore an excellent case study to better understand the seismic rupture process on the subduction seismogenic interface. The availability of collocated cGPS and strong motion data (IPOC network: Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile) offers a unique opportunity to study the seismic source, compare the results derived from both type of data and study the variability of the seismic source with the frequency.\nWe perform a detailed comparison of the co-seismic movements registered by cGPS and three-component accelerograms. Then, we carry out a series of inversions to study the kinematic rupture associated with this earthquake. For this purpose, we use the accelerometer (9 stations) and high-frequency GPS (1 Hz, 13 stations) independently and jointly. We use a two-step inversion method proposed by Hernandez et al. (1999), where we use the contribution of GPS in obtaining the static displacement and then carry out the kinematic inversion using the method in frequency domain (Cotton & Campillo, 1995). Finally we study the dependency of the Mw8.2 Pisagua seismic source with the signal frequency. Data are filtered in different frequency bands and then frequency dependent inversions are conducted to explore the segmentation of the seismogenic zone in the area affected by the earthquake. In particular, we aim at testing whether a Mw8.2 earthquake can show a frequency dependency similar to the one observed for megathrust events, characterize this dependency and define segmentation along depth and along strike of the seismogenic zone, compare this segmentation with the one issued from GPS-derived interseismic coupling maps.",

            "abstract": "Predictions of the future climate are based on Earth System Models operating on coarse grids, while the impact of a changing climate on most elements of the terrestrial cryosphere is strongly heterogeneous. This scale discrepancy hampers realistic predictions of the development of permafrost landscapes or glacier mass balances. At the University of Oslo, Norway, meteorologists and glaciologists/permafrost scientists working on the terrestrial cryosphere, have since 2011 collaborated on approaches trying to overcome such scaling problems. For intermediate spatial scales of 1-3 km we use two approaches:\nFirst, we apply the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) to dynamically downscale climate parameters for a period of 10 years. The results are validated against continuous energy balance measurements at Ny-Ålesund and against meteorological and in-situ mass-balance observations from the Austfonna ice cap, both at Svalbard. Those data sets feed into simple permafrost modelling schemes and glacier mass balance models, respectively.\nSecondly, for permafrost we combine multi-temporal remote sensing products and thermal ground modeling, compiling maps of permafrost temperatures and thaw depth. Such a “permafrost re-analysis” has significant potential for validation of large-scale models by delivering a statistical distribution of ground parameters for coarse modeling grid cells.\nHowever, a spatial scale of 1km is still too coarse to resolve the spatial heterogeneity of especially permafrost properties because of the large heterogeneity of e.g. snow cover, but also surfical material and/or vegetation cover. For scales below 1 km we propose to describe this variability in a statistical way by distribution functions rather than a deterministic representation on refined grids. We demonstrate that the concept facilitates modeling of the transition from continuous over discontinuous to sporadic permafrost along the climatic gradient from Svalbard to Southern Scandinavia, which is not possible without subgrid representation of snow depths.\nFinally, we evaluate the possibility to improve simulations of surface energy fluxes also in atmosphere and climate models, through better representation of sub-grid scale variability of variables relevant for atmosphere-cryosphere interactions.",

            "abstract": "Despite 43 years of spacecraft observations (Duxbury et al., 2014), Phobos origin is still a matter of great debate within the scientific community. Two main scenarios have been presented in the last decades: the in situ formation and the asteroidal capture origin. Both approaches present pros and cons that do not uniquely demonstrate the debated moon’s origin; above that, Schmedemann et al. (2014) suggest that Phobos has an ancient cratering surface age of about 4.3-3.7 Ga, dating back to a period where the two proposed origins can be supported.\nWithin such context frame, the work we present suggests a new interpretation of Phobos multiple grooves, which may point at one of the two scenarios.\nPhobos parallel grooves have been debated since their first observation on Viking images in 1976 (Veverka and Duxbury, 1977). Multiple origins have been proposed for their formation i) as the result of Mars tidal stress (Dobrovolskis, 1982); ii) as fractures directly related to the formation of the 9 km Stickney crater (Fujiwara and Asada, 1983) or iii) a formation caused by rolling boulders coming from the Stickney impact crater (Wilson and Head, 1989). Another formation scenario is that the grooves are chains of secondary impacts resulting from primary impact events on Mars (Murray and Iliffe, 2011), but recently Ramsley and Head (2014) indicated that the volume of ejecta coming from Mars to Phobos is insufficient to produce the grooves as secondary craters.\nGrooves are common on asteroids, as presented in 951 Gaspra (Veverka et al., 1994), 243 Ida (Belton et al., 1994), 433 Eros (Thomas et al., (2002), Buczkowski et al., 2008), 21 Lutetia (Massironi et al., 2011), 4 Vesta (Buczkowski et al., 2012). In this work we will show the preliminary results of a novel approach on the analysis of the grooves distribution, suggesting they are the remnants of an ancient parent body from which the moon could have been originated providing important implications on the origin of Phobos.",

Our study represents the first investigation of the correlations between the global distribution of surge-type glaciers and climatic and geometric variables, using a new geodatabase inventorying all surge-type glaciers in the world. The highest densities of surge-type glaciers occur within an optimal climatic envelope bounded by temperature and precipitation. Across all regions with both surge-type and normal glaciers, the former are larger, especially at the cold, dry end of the climatic spectrum. Climate change can also alter the distribution of surge-type glaciers. A species distribution model, Maxent, accurately depicts the major clusters of surge-type glaciers using three variables: temperature, precipitation and glacier area, but under-predicts clusters found outside of the climatically optimal surge zone. We interpret the results in terms of a new enthalpy cycle model. Steady states require a balance between enthalpy gains generated by the balance flux and losses via heat conduction and meltwater discharge. This condition can be most easily satisfied in cold, dry environments (thin, low-flux glaciers, efficient conductive heat losses), and warm, humid environments (high meltwater discharges). Intermediate conditions correspond with the optimal surge zone, where neither heat conduction nor runoff can effectively discharge heat gains, and enthalpy cycling can result.",

            "abstract": "The sensitivity of trees to water availability within their rooting zones is a major determinant of tree and forest health. Yet, we have a poor understanding of subterranean water availability and its fluctuations due to climate. Such shortcomings limit our ability to predict how climatic variability will impact water availability to trees, and corresponding forest health. Understanding of water partitioning within the ‘critical zone’ of riparian areas are particularly lacking, especially in the vulnerable Mediterranean climate regimes. A substantial body of research uses isotope dendrochronology to assess riparian forest-water relations at annual (tree-ring) timescales, which integrate variability in seasonal hydrology. However, the sub-annual variations in water availability have been largely overlooked, which may have important ramifications for riparian ecohydrology.\nWe present a new method for determining the sub-annual hydrologic variability within a floodplain forest using two co-occurring Mediterranean tree species along the Rhône River, southern France. We conducted oxygen isotope (δ18O) analysis of cellulose for 11 microslices within each tree ring to detect sub-annual patterns in δ18O that reflect the variability in hydrological partitioning. We back-calculated the seasonal time series of source waters used by the trees via a mechanistic model. Differences in rooting between the species allow us to constrain fluctuations in water availability and use between the vadose and phreatic zones. The two different species of streamside trees use distinct water sources and their seasonal patterns of water use are also fundamentally different. We develop strong links between these sub-annual patterns of δ18O signatures and the climatic characteristics of the hydrological year. We also present isotopic analyses of source waters from the vadose and phreatic zones, precipitation, and the Rhône to bolster our interpretations of water partitioning.\nThis research provides new insight for disentangling the impacts of seasonal hydrologic variability on ecohydrological processes both in the past and under future climate regimes. These sub-annual fluctuations within the critical zone are likely to have a disproportionate influence on the response of the biosphere to such climatic trends.",

            "abstract": "Dust particles provide an important fraction of the matter composing the interplanetary medium, their mass density at 1 AU being comparable to the one of the solar wind. Among them, dust grains of nanometer size-scale can be detected using radio and plasma wave instruments, because they move at roughly the solar wind speed. The high velocity impact of a dust particle generates a small crater on the spacecraft: the dust particle and the crater material are vaporized. This produces a plasma cloud whose associated electrical charge induces an electric pulse measured with radio and plasma instruments. Since their first detection in the interplanetary medium (Meyer-Vernet et al. 2009), nanodust particles have been routinely measured using STEREO/WAVES instrument (Zaslavsky et al. 2012, Le Chat et al. 2013). From the physical process at the origin of the voltage pulse (Pantellini et al 2013), an effect of the local plasma density is expected. We present the nanodust properties measured using STEREO/WAVES/Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) data between 2007 and 2014, and show the effect of the local plasma density on the measurement. We also, for the first time, present evidence of Coronal Mass Ejection effects on the nanodust flux at 1 AU.",

            "abstract": "The weather conditions from August 2011 to May 2012 produced an extreme drought in the eastern Czech Republic (Moravia), whereas the patterns were nearly normal in its western region (Bohemia). The Southern and Central Moravia regions, which represent the most important agricultural areas, were most affected by the drought. The precipitation totals for the studied period were 50% to 70% of the long-term mean, which was calculated for 1961–2000. In autumn 2011, the total precipitation accounted for 10% to 30% of the long-term mean for most of Moravia, increasing to 30% to 50% in spring 2012. Moreover, 7.5% of the Czech Republic experienced a 100-year drought; 20% of the country experienced a 20-year drought. According to the Palmer Drought Severity Index, the 2012 drought was classified as the worst in the past 130 years. The drought patterns were related to the prevailing high-pressure systems over Central Europe and the occurrence of weather types with different precipitation amounts in Bohemia and Moravia. The most substantial drought effects occurred in the agricultural sector. A decrease in cereal yields was observed in the analyzed production areas in Moravia, which was unprecedented in the past 52 years. Moreover, winter crops were affected more than spring crops. An increased risk of fire occurred due to the drought conditions; the largest forest fire in the past 15 years was recorded during this period. Furthermore, signs of hydrological drought were also reported in rivers. The 2011–2012 drought was compared with the significant droughts in 2000, 2003 and 2007. Austria and Slovakia, which neighbor the Czech Republic, experienced a similar drought. This drought analysis can be used as a scenario for future droughts and their impacts in Central Europe due to the global warming projected by GCMs.\nAcknowledgements:\nThis study was made possible by the generous support of the “Establishment of International Scientific Team Focused on Drought Research” project (no.

            "abstract": "We consider the inertia-free, inviscid model of the dynamo first proposed more than fifty years ago by Taylor as an appropriate model for the dynamical regime of the core. Estimates of the Rossby number and Ekman number for the Earth’s core show that they are both tiny, and thus suggest that this regime is appropriate for the Earth’s core. The resulting balance, termed magnetostrophic balance, must satisfy a special constraint first expounded by J. Bryan Taylor in 1963, namely that the longitudinal component of the Lorentz torque, when averaged over every cylinder coaxial with the rotation axis, must vanish. The technical nature of this constraint has hampered progress for decades. We report on our solutions for this system when mean-field dynamos are considered, in which the action of the small scales can be characterised by an alpha effect. We will reflect on the different characteristics of the solutions compared to dynamos in which viscosity plays a leading role.",

            "abstract": "Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are commonly evaluated on their performance at pressure levels of 1000, 850 and 500hPa. However, due to their improved interaction with the surface and increasing resolution, the GCMs are getting more and more realistic in representing variables at lower levels. For downscaling practices this implies that the near-surface variables might become suitable as predictors in statistical models and might increase the added value of dynamical models. This work performs a height dependent evaluation of six of the Earth System Models (ESMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. The ESMs are evaluated on the representation of the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of wind and temperature in the lowest 1.5km of the atmosphere over Europe, using ERA-Interim reanalysis data as the reference. Results indicate that apart from small-scale biases, the surface wind speed PDFs north of 45°N are well represented by all ESMs. Therefore they can be considered skillful inputs for statistical downscaling practices. In such a way statistical downscaling models might profit from predictors which are more closely related to the predictands. South of 45°N, winds are affected by a large-scale bias originating from errors in the representation of the large-scale circulation, especially during winter. For temperature, near-surface levels as well as upper-atmospheric levels are affected by small-scale and large-scale biases. The latter are adopted by the downscaling models, underlining the importance of model evaluation before downscaling. In general, the height-dependent near-surface evaluation approach that is adopted in this work, gives more insight in the origin of large-scale biases, defines up to which altitude ESMs are influenced by small-scale phenomena and determines the lowest levels for which temperature and wind speed PDFs are suitable input variables for downscaling models.",

            "abstract": "Within the Alpine-Himalaya orogeny belt, the convergence of Arabian–Euraisan collision zone made up the Caucasus mountain belt. The convergence of Arabian-Eurasian Plate is taken up mostly by aseismic shortening and a few on strike-slip faults in the Armenian Highlands, or Lesser Caucasus region. Although the slip rate along the faults in this area are small, they still can generate earthquakes with magnitude up to M=7.5. The 1988 Armenia earthquake, also known as Spitak earthquake, occurred in the western segment of the Pambak-Sevan-Sunik Fault (PSSF). In this study, we focus on the western part of the PSSF and the Alavar Fault which are nearby the Spitak city. As previous studies mentioned, the transition from fault ruptures to folding is associated with a blind thrust that the pattern is not well known. In order to understand the complex structure of this region, we use PS-InSAR technique (Persistent Scatterers Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) and GPS data to detect the recent deformation patterns and the activity of buried structures. The data include L-band radar images collected by the ALOS satellites in ascending orbits between 2006 and 2011 over the study area. Combining with the published focal mechanism and geological data, we try to construct fault planes and an elastic dislocation model to characterize the range of locking depth, interseismic slip rate and slip deficit. The preliminary results provide us insights of how deformation accommodated along the possible hidden branches and how interseismic deformation accumulated along the southern front of Lesser Caucasus. These observations enable us to make the assessment of potential earthquake hazard of this region.",

            "abstract": "Subduction and roll-back of narrow slabs is common in the Mediterranean region and is necessarily accompanied by a lithospheric scale slab edge tear fault or “STEP” (Subduction Transform Edge Propagator). We report on two recent marine geophysical surveys conducted in the Ionian Sea, offshore Eastern Sicily to investigate this type of structure: CIRCEE October 2013 R/V Le Suroit and DIONYSUS October 2014 R/V Meteor. The aim of the CIRCEE survey was to map potentially seismogenic faults offshore eastern Sicily and to seek the surface expression of the STEP fault (through high-resolution 72-channel seismic reflection profiles and swath mapping bathymetry). Strong historical earthquakes have struck this region repeatedly, whose origin in some cases remains unknown (1169, 1542, 1693).\nTwo major crustal scale structures have been proposed as being related to the STEP: the Malta escarpment, and a combined normal-fault and strike-slip-fault system 20-50 km further east, striking roughly N50°W and well imaged by the CIRCEE data. The main objectives of the DIONYSUS deep seismic survey in autumn 2014 are to image the deep structure (crustal thickness, nature of the crust) of this ancient Tethyan age margin (likely a transform margin) and to seek deeper expressions of reactivation (lithospheric scale faulting) related to the slab tear. The internal geometry of the Calabrian subduction zone - the crystalline basement backstop, the slab dip, the accretionary wedge composition (detritic vs. evaporitic) and its thickness, is also a target of the deep seismic survey. To achieve these goals a German-French-Italian wide-angle seismic survey was performed in October 2014 using 60 OBS (30 from Kiel-Geomar and 30 from Ifremer/Univ. Brest) deployed along 4 long profiles, 3 of which are collocated along existing multi-channel seismic lines (Italian CROP profiles) depth processed at Geomar.",

Typical runs contain one billion atoms and run for up to 100 million time-steps. This corresponds to scales of micrometers and microseconds and allows us to resolve similar nucleation rates as probed in some laboratory experiments. In homogeneous vapor-to-liquid nucleation simulations using Lennard-Jones atoms (Diemand et al. JCP 2013) and various water models (ongoing work) we observe a second phase transition form liquid-to-solid in some of the lower temperature runs (see Tanaka et al. JCP 2011 for one such case).\nHere we will describe the crystallisation of these supercooled liquid-like nano-clusters in detail. We will present crystal structure, nucleation and growth rates for a range of temperatures, droplet sizes and interaction potentials and compare with model predictions. Since our liquid nano-droplets are condensing naturally out of the vapour phase, as in clouds and some experiments and industrial processes, we can address some specific questions relevant in these contexts: How does the droplet size, structure and especially its surface affect the freezing process? To what extend does the latent heat from the ongoing condensation onto the droplets surface delay and alter crystallisation? Can frozen nano-clusters grow by direct de-sublimation from the vapour, or is there always a liquid-like surface? And can they form directly without going through a liquid-like proto-cluster stage?",

We developed a simple and high throughput method, which based on DRC-ICP-MS for determination of Pb isotope ratios for discriminating the geographic origin of cigarettes. After acid digestion procedure, the cigarette digested solutions were directly analyzed by ICP-QMS with a DRC pressurized by the non-reactive gas Ne. In the DRC, Ne molecules collision with Pb ions and improves Pb isotope ratios precision 3-fold, which may be due to the collisional dampling smoothes out the ion beam fluctuations. Under the optimum DRC rejection parameter Q (RPq = 0.45), the main matrix components (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe etc.) originating from cigarettes were filtered out. Mass discrimination of 208Pb/206Pb ratio in Ne DRC mode increased 0.3% compared to the standard mode, the mass bias due to the in-cell Ne gas collision can be accurately corrected by NIST 981 Pb isotope standard. This method was verified by a tobacco reference material CTV-OTL-2. Results of 208Pb/206Pb and 207Pb/206Pb were 2.0848 ± 0.0028 (2δ) and 0.8452 ± 0.0011 (2δ) for CTA-VTL-2, which were agreed with the literature values (208Pb/206Pb = 2.0884 ± 0.0090 and 207Pb/206Pb = 0.8442 ± 0.0032). The precision of Pb isotope ratios (208Pb/206Pb and 207Pb/206Pb) for the cigarette samples are ranged from 0.01 to 0.08% (N = 5). It has sufficient precision to discriminate 91 different brand cigarettes originated from four different geographic regions (Shown in Fig).",

Particles analyzed with fluorescence detection in the first chamber were delivered to the second chamber connected in series for detection of incandescence. We analyzed identical particles using the two methods as judged by the time intervals of detection in the two chambers. This tandem analysis system provides information on the mixing state of fluorescent compounds and black carbon in single particles. We performed ground-based measurement of ambient particles in Tokyo during October 26–29, 2012 using this system. We analyzed 43,881 particles with optical diameters greater than 0.4 mm. The fractions of particles with fluorescent composition, black carbon, and a mixture of both were 14.2%, 2.3%, and 0.3%, respectively, which indicates the presence of internal mixtures of black carbon and fluorescent species in the ambient air for the first time. Mixtures of biological materials (estimated from fluorescence patterns) and black carbon were also detected. The fluorescence patterns of single particles with and without black carbon were almost identical, suggesting that particles with both black carbon and fluorescent composition might be formed by aggregation in ambient air.",

            "abstract": "Stomata actively regulate the CO2 concentration inside plant leaves, which co-determines the biochemical rate of photosynthesis. Stomatal behaviour thus controls leaf-level water-use efficiency and the ‘exchange rate’ between the terrestrial carbon and hydrological cycles. Least-cost theory (based on the hypothesis that plants minimize the combined unit costs of maintaining the capacities for water transport and carbon uptake) predicts that (a) long-term mean values of the ci/ca ratio, i.e. the ratio of leaf-internal to ambient CO2 concentration, should be independent of both photon flux density and ca; and (b) these values should vary systematically with growing-season vapour pressure deficit, growth temperature, and atmospheric pressure.\nStable carbon isotope (δ13C) measurements provide an integrated measure of the ci/ca in C3 plants. A number of previous studies have focused on the aridity dependence of δ13C. The temperature dependence seems to have been overlooked, but the elevation dependence has been known for a long time: plants at high elevations have systematically lowered ci/ca, and correspondingly increased photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax). Why this should be is a long-standing puzzle: there are various speculative explanations in the literature, and a certain amount of controversy. By contrast, least-cost theory provides quantitative predictions of all three environmental effects. We have analysed a large (3652) set of δ13C measurements from C3 plants, spanning all latitudes and biomes, and shown that these predictions are quantitatively consistent with environmental dependences that can be shown in the measurements using a generalized linear model.\nThis analysis implies the ability to predict ci/ca ratios for large-scale terrestrial ecosystem modelling. Combined with the long-standing ‘co-ordination hypothesis’ for the control of photosynthetic capacity, least-cost theory provides a basis for a remarkably simple global model for gross primary production.",

            "abstract": "Isotope and elemental studies of mantle rocks and oceanic basalts demonstrate that Earth’s mantle is heterogeneous, comprising distinct components that have experienced isolated long-term evolution, on both global and local scales. In principle, such heterogeneity will control the onset of melting and at least some of the chemical variation seen in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts (MORB) (e.g. [1]). But, the high degrees of melting that generate MORB, together with magma mixing and assimilation, have the effect of homogenising the compositions of lavas erupted at the surface, concealing the true extent of the variability in the mantle source.\nThis study presents high-precision double-spike Pb isotope data for the consituent phases of MORB from a single ridge segment from the FAMOUS region (36°50’N) on the Mid-Atlantic ridge. Separated phases from individual basalts show a remarkable variation in Pb isotope composition, greater than that seen for all samples previously analysed from this ridge segment, and encompassing >70% of the variation seeen globally in MORB. These variations cannot be explained by assimilation of seawater altered oceanic crust or by contamination from the Azores, both of which carry a radiogenic Pb isotope siganture. Rather they indicate mixing between an early extremely unradiogenic melt, from which plagioclase, clinopyroxene and sulphide crystallised, sourced by material showing long-term depletion of U, and a later more radiogenic melt that produced the final glass host. Elemental and isotope data suggest that the source of this early melt was ancient, enriched, with a crust-like chemical signature, producing a relatively volatile-rich melt. This study confirms that signficant information may be preserved in the early crystallising minerals at slow spreading ridges, either phenocryst phases or the melt inclusions that they host (e.g. [2]). Overall, these results suggest that there is a simple relationship between the scale and nature of mantle heterogeneity, the thermal regime of melting, and variations in the chemistry of mantle melts that arise during eruption.\n[1] Stracke, A. & Bourdon, B.

            "abstract": "Throughout the last decades mineral resources, especially rare earth elements, gained a steadily growing importance in industry and therefore as well in exploration. New targets for mineral investigations came into focus and known sources have been and will be revisited. Since most of the mining for mineral resources in the past took place in the upper hundred metres below surface new techniques made deeper mining economically feasible. Consequently, mining engineers need the best possible knowledge about the full spatial extent of prospective geological structures, including their maximum depths. Especially in Germany and Europe, politics changed in terms not to rely only on the global mineral trade market but on national resources, if available. BGR and partners therefore started research programs on different levels to evaluate and develop new technologies on environmental friendly, non-invasive spatial exploration using airborne and partly ground-based electromagnetic methods. Mining waste heaps have been explored for valuable residual minerals (research project ROBEHA), a promising tin bearing ore body is being explored by airborne electromagnetics (research project E3) and a new airborne technology is aimed at to be able to reach investigation depths of about 1 km (research project DESMEX). First results of the projects ROBEHA and E3 will be presented and the project layout of DESMEX will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Absolute ages for planetary surfaces are often inferred by crater densities, and are only indirectly constrained by ages of meteorites. Cratering chronology models are calibrated based on lunar samples, and are transferred towards other planets using crater scaling laws and cratering rate ratios. This transfer often relies on extrapolations. We have shown that the <5 Myrs old and 55-km wide Mojave Crater is the ejection source for the meteorites classified as shergottites [1], and thus allows the calibration of the chronology model of Mars. Shergottites and this crater are linked by their coinciding meteorite ejection ages and the crater formation age, and mineralogical constraints [1]. Thus, the cratering-based age determination method for Mars is now calibrated.\nOur new Martian cratering chronology model is tested against the in situ determined radiometric and exposure ages for a mudstone in Gale crater [3], and the ages found with both methods are identical. Because Mojave formed on 4.3 Gyrs old terrain, the original crystallization ages of shergottites are old, as inferred by Pb-Pb isotope ratios [4-6], and the much-quoted <600 Myrs shergottite ages [e.g., 7] are due to resetting. Martian surface features dated with cratering statistics shifts the absolute age of the oldest terrains of Mars backwards by 200 Myrs.\n",

            "abstract": "The measurement of temperature in the middle atmosphere with Rayleigh-scatter lidars is an important technique for assessing atmospheric change. Current retrieval schemes for these temperature have several shortcoming which can be overcome using an optimal estimation method (OEM). OEMs are applied to the retrieval of temperature from Rayleigh-scatter lidar measurements using both single and multiple channel measurements. Forward models are presented that completely characterize the measurement and allow the simultaneous retrieval of temperature, dead time and background. The method allows a full uncertainty budget to be obtained on a per profile basis that includes, in addition to the statistical uncertainties, the smoothing error and uncertainties due to Rayleigh extinction, ozone absorption, the lidar constant, nonlinearity in the counting system, variation of the Rayleigh-scatter cross section with altitude, pressure, acceleration due to gravity and the variation of mean molecular mass with altitude. The vertical resolution of the temperature profile is found at each height, and a quantitative determination is made of the maximum height to which the retrieval is valid. A single temperature profile can be retrieved from measurements with multiple channels that cover different height ranges, vertical resolutions and even different detection methods. The OEM employed is shown to give robust estimates of temperature consistent with previous methods, while requiring minimal computational time. This demonstrated success of lidar temperature retrievals using an OEM opens new possibilities in atmospheric science for measurement integration between active and passive remote sensing instruments.\nWe are currently working on extending our method to simultaneously retrieve water vapour and temperature using Raman-scatter lidar measurements.",

            "abstract": "We develop an iterative inversion method to estimate surface CO2 fluxes at resolutions up to 0.1 degree using atmospheric CO2 data collected by the global in-situ network and GOSAT. The atmospheric transport model and its adjoint are made by coupling the Eulerian grid model (NIES-TM) to Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART. The inverse model calculates corrections to the prior fluxes at a weekly time step and spatial resolution of the FLEXPART model (1 or 0.1 degrees). The terrestrial biosphere fluxes are simulated with VISIT model at hourly time step using CFSR reanalysis. Ocean fluxes are calculated using a 4D-Var assimilation system of the surface pCO2 observations. In the high resolution mode, prior fluxes of fossil emissions (ODIAC) and biomass burning (GFASv1.1) are given at a model resolution, while ocean and terrestrial ecosystem fluxes are interpolated from a coarser resolution. The surface flux footprints for in-situ and GOSAT observations are simulated with Flexpart. Precalculated flux response functions are then used in forward and adjoint runs of the coupled transport model. We apply the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of the scaled tracer transport operator A=R-1/2HB1/2, where H - tracer transport operator, R and B - uncertainty matrices for observations and fluxes, respectively. The square root of covariance matrix B is constructed by directional splitting in latitude, longitude and time, with exponential decay scales of 500 km on land, 1000 km over oceans and 2 weeks in time. Once right and left singular vectors of ATA are obtained, the prior and posterior flux uncertainties are evaluated. Numerical experiments of inverting the surface CO2 fluxes showed that the high resolution (Lagrangian) part of the flux responses dominates the solution so that patterns from the coarser resolution NIES TM (10x10 degree) are not visible in flux singular vectors and the optimized flux. The reconstruction of the fluxes at highest resolution of 0.1 degree has been tested to complete successfully for shorter time window of 7 months. We demonstrated that application of a coupled tracer transport model in adjoint-based assimilation provides an efficient way to increase resolution of the inverted flux, which can be extended to match current resolution of the global operational forecast models.",

Deglacial (Late Pleistocene) records document pronounced dry and wet spells over tropical South America which are mainly caused by shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) coupled with South American monsoonal activity.\nHere we present a high-resolution foraminiferal Ba/Ca and δ18Oseawater record from a core located within the Orinoco outflow area, that give insights into abrupt changes of the hydrology of the Orinoco catchment area and, furthermore, enables us to reconstruct circulation patterns within the Caribbean during deglacial times. Our data, obtained from the surface-dwelling foraminifera Globigerinoides ruber (pink variety), show a distinct increase in Ba/Ca ratios during the Heinrich 1 (H1) interval, as well as during the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles up to 36 kyr. Based on the multi-proxy evidence we largely attribute the Ba/Ca increase during H1 to enhanced Amazon river run-off, while Orinoco river discharge appears not to be significantly elevated. During Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, the causal mechanism for enhanced Ba/Ca ratios is an insolation-driven shift of the ITCZ and/or enhanced South American summer monsoon activity. Interestingly, the H1 Ba/Ca shows strong similarities in shape and timing to published Ba/Ca data from Florida Straits.This leads us to the assumption that the South American run-off signal is transported directly into the Atlantic Ocean via Yukatan Strait and Florida Strait and therefore alter the salinity budget in the North Atlantic. The results point to immediate high to low latitude feedbacks which might help to re-inforce the weakening of the overturning circulation during Heinrich Events and Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering the timing and magnitude of vertical crustal motions is key to understanding the impact of tectonic uplift on changes in atmospheric circulation, rainfall, and environmental conditions. Uplift of the East African Plateau (EAP) of Kenya has been linked to mantle processes, but paleoaltimetry data are still too scarce to unambiguously constrain plateau evolution and subsequent vertical motions associated with late Cenozoic rifting. Here we assess the fossil remains of a beaked whale (Ziphiidae) from the Turkana region of Kenya, 700 km inland from the present-day coastline of the Indian Ocean. The whale fossil was found at an elevation of 650 m and helps constraining the uplift of the northeastern flanks of the EAP. The Kenyan ziphiid was discovered in fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the extensional Oligo-Miocene Lokichar basin (Mead, 1975) along with terrestrial mammals and freshwater mollusks below a basalt dated at 17.1 ± 1.0 Ma (Boschetto et al., 1992). The unifying characteristics of riverine occurrences of modern marine mammals include sufficient discharge in low-gradient rivers to maintain pathways deep enough to facilitate migration, and the absence of shallow bedrock, rapids and waterfalls. The most likely route, which may have had these characteristics is a fluvial corridor controlled by thermal subsidence of the Cretaceous Anza Rift, which once linked extensional processes in Central and East Africa with the continental margin. The fossil locality and analogies with present-day occurrences of marine mammals in terrestrial realms suggest that the ziphiid stranded slightly above sea level. In combination with 13.5. Ma phonolite flows that utilized eastward-directed drainages away from the EAP the fossil find thus provides the older of only two empirical paleoelevation points that constrain the onset of uplift of the EAP to the interval between approximately 17 and 13 Ma. Topographic uplift of the EAP induced paleoclimatic change from a low-elevation humid environment to highly variable, much drier conditions, which altered biotic communities and drove evolution in East Africa, including that of primates.",

The temperature of the Sea of Japan reached a high in October 2012, and it was found that heating by these very warm waters, despite the small size of the Sea of Japan, overwhelmed the cooling effect of the strongly negative AO and WP in October. Linear regression analyses except the forcing of atmospheric circulations showed that Japan tends to be warm in years when the Sea of Japan is warm. Consequently, the temperature over Japan is statistically controlled by interannual variations of small-scale oceanic phenomena as well as by large-scale atmospheric patterns. Previous studies have ignored such small-scale oceanic influences on island temperatures.",

            "abstract": "We study the effect of statistically distributed heterogeneities that are smaller than the resolution of current tomographic models on seismic waves that propagate through the Earth's mantle at teleseismic distances. Current global tomographic models are missing small-scale structure as evidenced by the failure of even accurate numerical synthetics to explain enhanced coda in observed body and surface waveforms. One way to characterize small scale heterogeneity is to construct random models and confront observed coda waveforms with predictions from these models. Statistical studies of the coda typically rely on models with simplified isotropic and stationary correlation functions in Cartesian geometries.\nWe show how to construct more complex random models for the mantle that can account for arbitrary non-stationary and anisotropic correlation functions as well as for complex geometries. Although this method is computationally heavy, model characteristics such as translational, cylindrical or spherical symmetries can be used to greatly reduce the complexity such that this method becomes practical. With this approach, we can create 3D models of the full spherical Earth that can be radially anisotropic, i.e. with different horizontal and radial correlation functions, and radially non-stationary, i.e. with radially varying model power and correlation functions. Both of these features are crucial for a statistical description of the mantle in which structure depends to first order on the spherical geometry of the Earth. We combine different random model realizations of S velocity with current global tomographic models that are robust at long wavelengths (e.g. Meschede and Romanowicz, 2014, GJI submitted), and compute the effects of these hybrid models on the wavefield with a spectral element code (SPECFEM3D_GLOBE). We finally analyze the resulting coda waves for our model selection and compare our computations with observations. Based on these observations, we make predictions about the strength of unresolved small-scale structure and extrinsic attenuation.",

The growing number of projects related to enhanced geothermal systems, fracking and others has led to the question, which maximum earthquake magnitude can be expected as a consequence of fluid injection. This question is addressed from the perspective of statistical analysis. Using basic empirical laws of earthquake statistics, we estimate the magnitude MT of the maximum expected earthquake in a pre-defined future time window T. A case study of the fluid injection site at Paradox Valley, Colorado, USA, demonstrates that the magnitude m=4.3 of the largest observed earthquake on 27 May 2000 is lying very well within the expectation from past seismicity without adjusting any parameters. Vice versa, for a given maximum tolerable earthquake at an injection site, we can constrain the corresponding amount of injected fluids that must not be exceeded within pre-defined confidence bounds.",

In this study we present Lagrangian diagnostics to quantify changes in the dynamical characteristics of the Arctic sea ice cover from 1979 to 2012 during the transition from a predominantly multi-year to a first-year ice regime. Examined in particular is the evolution in finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs), which monitor the rate at which neighboring particle trajectories diverge, and stretching rates throughout the Arctic. In this analysis we compute FTLEs for the Arctic ice drift field using National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) Polar Pathfinder Daily 25 km EASE-Grid weekly sea ice motion vectors for the annual cycle beginning both from the sea ice minimum in September, and maximum in March. Sensitivity analyses show that maximal FTLEs, or ridges, are robust even with the introduction of significant noise. Probability density functions and mean values of FTLEs show a trend towards higher FTLE values characteristic of increased mixing in the Arctic in the last decade, in keeping with a transition to a weaker, thinner ice cover.",

            "abstract": "The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event at 66 Ma triggered by a meteorite impact is one of the most drastic events in the history of life on the Earth. Many hypotheses have been proposed as killing mechanisms induced by the impact, including global darkness due to high concentrations of atmospheric silicate dust particles, global wildfires, greenhouse warming due to CO2 release, and global acid rain. However, the actual mechanism of extinction remains highly controversial. One of the most important clues for understanding the extinction mechanism is the marine plankton record, which indicates that plankton foraminifera, living in the near-surface ocean, suffered very severe extinction in contrast to the high survival ratio of benthic foraminifera. No proposed extinction mechanism can account for this globally observed marine extinction pattern. Here, we show that SO3-rich impact vapor was released in the K-Pg impact and resulted in the occurrence of global acid rain and sudden severe ocean acidification at the end of the Cretaceous, based on the new results of impact experiments at velocities much higher than previous works (> 10 km/s) and theoretical calculations on aerosol coagulation processes. Sudden severe ocean acidification can account for many of the features of various geologic records at the K?Pg boundary, including severe extinction of plankton foraminifera. This extinction mechanism requires impact degassing of SO3-rich vapor, which is not necessarily found at impact sites other than Chicxulub, suggesting that the degree of mass extinction was controlled greatly by target lithology.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has identified that interspecies variation in leaf wax n-alkane 2H/1H from plants growing at the same geographical location can exceed 100‰. These differences cannot easily be explained by mechanisms that influence the isotopic composition of leaf water. Biochemical processes are therefore likely to drive some of this variability. Currently, however, little is known about the relative importance of different biochemical processes in shaping n-alkane hydrogen isotope composition.\nTo explore this issue, we combined n-alkane δ2H analysis with measurements of: (i) the percentage content of leaf C and N; and (ii) foliar δ15N, from seven plants growing at Stiffkey salt marsh, Norfolk, UK. These species differ biochemically in respect of the protective compounds they produce under salt or water stressed conditions, with monocots generally producing more carbohydrates, and dicots producing more nitrogenous compounds. We found that monocots had higher %C, while dicots had higher %N and 15N-enriched leaf tissue. We identified a systematic relationship between the nature of the dominant protective compound produced (carbohydrate vs. nitrogenous) and n-alkane 2H/1H: species with a greater proportion of carbohydrates have more negative δ2H values.\nThese findings might imply that shifts in the relative contribution of H to pyruvate from NADPH (2H-depleted) and recycled carbohydrates (2H-enriched) can influence n-alkane δ2H. The 2H-depletion of monocot n-alkanes relative to dicots may therefore be due to a greater proportion of NADPH-derived H incorporated into pyruvate because of their enhanced demand for carbohydrates. The production of protective compounds in plant species is a common response to a range of abiotic stresses (e.g. high UV irradiation, drought, salinity, high/low temperature). Species-specific biochemical responses to stress could therefore influence n-alkane 2H/1H across a range of habitats. This study highlights the importance of detailed investigation of interrelated metabolic networks in a range of plants, to further constrain the isotope effects associated with the cycling of H in plant secondary compounds. Such research will be critical to further develop quantitative interpretations of leaf wax biomarker δ2H records in both modern and ancient contexts.",

Some solar storms produce relativistic ions that lead to showers of secondary particles in Earth’s atmosphere and generate signals in ground-based detectors such as neutron monitors at a rate that can be observed above the background due to galactic cosmic rays, hence the term ground-level enhancements (GLEs). In this work we study the January 20, 2005 event, one of the most intense GLEs ever observed. From the bare counter to neutron monitor count rate ratio at South Pole, we estimate a spectral index in rigidity of 5.0. From the Spaceship Earth network, supplemented to comprise 13 polar neutron monitors, we model the time profile of relativistic solar ions impinging on Earth’s atmosphere in the polar regions. We then perform Monte Carlo simulations using a realistic atmospheric model to determine ionization as a function of altitude and time in Earth’s atmosphere. The results will allow us to investigate a possible connection between solar activity and Earth’s climate as mediated by the cosmic ray flux, atmospheric ionization, and cloud formation.

The aim of this study is to provide a fundamental understanding of the hydrology of a Himalayan watershed through the systematic integration of in-situ data in a glacio-hydrological model. We use ground data from the upper Langtang valley in Nepal combined with high resolution satellite data to understand specific processes and test the application of new model components specifically developed. We apply a new model for ablation under debris that takes into account the varying effect of debris thickness on melt rates. A novel approach is tested to reconstruct spatial fields of debris thickness through combination of energy balance modelling, UAV-derived geodetic mass balance and statistical techniques. The systematic integration of in-situ data for model calibration enables the application of a state-of-the art model with many parameters to model glacier evolution and catchment runoff in spite of the lack of continuous long-term historical records. It allows drawing conclusions on the importance of processes that have been suggested as being relevant but never quantified before. The simulations show that 8.7% of total water inputs originate from sub-debris ice melt. 4.5% originate from melted avalanched snow. These components can be locally much more important, since the spatial variability of processes within the valley is high.\nThe model is then used to simulate the response of the catchment to climate change. We show that climate warming leads to an increase in future icemelt and a peak in glacier runoff by mid-century. The increase in total icemelt is due to higher melt rates and large areas that are currently located above the equilibrium line altitude additionally that will contribute to melt. Catchment runoff will not reach below current levels throughout the 21st century due to precipitation increases. Debris covered glacier area will disappear at a slower pace than non-debris covered area. Still, due to the relative climate insensitivity of melt rates below thick debris, the contribution of sub-debris icemelt to runoff will not exceed 10% at all times.",

To understand the role of rivers in the global carbon cycle, the roles of chemical weathering and CO2 release from major rivers must be studied. We investigated three major Himalayan rivers in Bangladesh: the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. Although pCO2 is known to be low in the upper reaches of these rivers owing to active chemical weathering, we observed pCO2 values higher than the atmospheric pCO2 along their lower reaches, where deep soils have developed and where high air temperatures promote active soil respiration. By a simple mixing calculation, we found that seasonal variations of the river water carbonate system are controlled by subsurface water flows. In the rainy season, most of the lowlands are inundated and the contribution of subsurface flow to the river system increases. As a result, the CO2 flux to the atmosphere becomes higher. In future work, more detailed spatial and seasonal investigations are required to clarify the role of rivers in the global carbon cycle and how that role will change under global warming.",

We formulate a profit maximization capacity expansion model that finds the schedule of new supply, demand management and transfer schemes that maintain the annual supply-demand balance and maximize a companies’ profit under the 2010-15 price control process in England. Regulatory incentives for costs savings are also represented in the model. These include: the CIS scheme for the capital expenditure (capex) and incentive allowance schemes for the operating expenditure (opex) . The profit-maximizing investment program (what to build, when and what size) is compared with the least cost program (social optimum). We apply this formulation to several water companies in South East England to model performance and sensitivity to water network particulars.\nResults show that if companies’ are able to outperform the regulatory assumption on the cost of capital, a capital bias can be generated, due to the fact that the capital expenditure, contrarily to opex, can be remunerated through the companies’ regulatory capital value (RCV). The occurrence of the ‘capital bias’ or its entity depends on the extent to which a company can finance its investments at a rate below the allowed cost of capital. The bias can be reduced by the regulatory penalties for underperformances on the capital expenditure (CIS scheme); Sensitivity analysis can be applied by varying the CIS penalty to see how and to which extent this impacts the capital bias effect. We show how regulatory changes could potentially be devised to partially remove the ‘capital bias’ effect. Solutions potentially include allowing for incentives on total expenditure rather than separately for capex and opex and allowing both opex and capex to be remunerated through a return on the company’s regulatory capital value.",

            "abstract": "Faulting in volcanic environment is the result of the interaction of pressurized fluid-filled conduits and cracks with the host rocks. Faulting styles are also influenced by the local and regional tectonic setting. Seismicity in volcanic areas usually shows complex patterns difficult to decipher and there is a need of physics-based models linking observations to the mechanics of fluid-filled sources. Magma-filled dikes often induce abundant seismicity in form of swarms thought to occur close to the propagating tip (or edges, in 3D) of the dike, where stresses are concentrated, and in areas where pre-diking seismicity was high. The spatial distribution and focal mechanisms of the earthquakes bear information on the interaction of the dike stress field and the tectonic setting of the area. Here we use data of the 2000 dike intrusion at Miyakejima volcano (Izu Archipelago, Japan) to study the relation between the shape of the dike and the faulting style of the induced seismicity. We find that the strike and rake angles of the focal mechanisms are correlated with each other and are consistent with the dike shape and optimally- oriented faults according to the expected Coulomb stress changes from the 3D dike-induced stress field. We perform a clustering analysis on the FM solutions and relate them to the dike stress field and to the scaling relationships of the earthquakes. We calculate the frequency-size distribution of the clustered sets finding that focal mechanisms with a large strike- slip component are consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter relation with b-value about 1. Conversely, events with large normal faulting components deviate from the Gutenberg-Richter distribution with a marked roll-off on its right-hand tail suggesting a lack of large magnitude events (M>5.5). This can be interpreted as resulting from a limited thickness or localized weakness of the layer of rock above the dike, where normal faulting is expected.",

            "abstract": "Understanding mechanisms that modify landscapes is essential for risk assessment in tropical islands. Because measurements of erosion rates are critical for understanding landform evolution, the use of cosmogenic isotopes in river sediments and the use of river load geochemistry have grown rapidly in recent years.\nIn this study we aim to estimate erosion rate of an highly eroded drainage area of the Réunion Island and we compare 3 methods of measurment : i) from cosmogenic 3He concentrations [3Hec], ii) from river geochemistry and iii) from landforms reconstruction in order to estimate chemical weathering, mechanical erosion, and to understand the message provided by each method.\nThe basin under invistagation is the Rivière Langevin Canyon, located on the south flank of the Piton de la Fournaise Volcano (PdF). Helium concentrations and isotopic ratios have been measured in olivine rich sands from the Langevin river. [3Hec] have been calculated using: (i) the 3He/4He ratio measured by crushing and (ii) the 3He and 4He concentrations measured by melting the resulting powder. Digital elevation model derivatives and K-Ar geochronological data have been used to reconstruct the PdF morphology and calculate the volume of material eroded over the past 65Ka. Finally, dissolved and suspended loads in Langevin river will be analysed for their major and trace elements contents in order to characterise both chemical and mechanical erosion products. A soil will also be analysed in order to estimate the chemical weathering of the bedrock and to understand soil formation in the studied basin. Initial results indicate 3Hec average erosion rates of 4.9±11.6 mm/yr and 4.7±0.1 mm/yr from PdF morphology reconstruction. Cosmogenic and landform reconstruction results show a reasonable agreement. However, the lack of olivine in the sampled soil rises the question of river sediment olivine sources. Such olivine need to be delivered either by deep-seated catastrophic events either from no-soil sources. In this context, 3Hec in olivine rich sands can be used as a tool for mechanical erosion estimates. Comparison with river geochemistry results in the Langevin river will help understand the coopling between chemical weathering and mechanical erosion and will confirm if olivine can be used as a proxy for mechanical erosion estimation.",

This method is based on the assumption that the variation EHS owns an expected vibration center (mean), which is a linear combination of the two mean values of the two subsample series obtained through separating the original EHS by an optimal splitting point. Besides, considering the impact of sample length on the accuracy of design value estimation, the Bootstrap is applied to analyze the impact of sampling uncertainty on the design value. A large number of bootstrap samples are constructed from the reconstructed EHS, the corresponding design value or quantile is estimated for each bootstrap sample, so that the sampling distribution of design value is constructed, furthermore, the uncertainty of quantile estimation can be quantified.\nKeywords: Hydrological frequency analysis, non-stationary, reconstructing extreme hydrological series, uncertainty assessment, Bootstrap.",

            "abstract": "Projection-based model reduction is one of the most popular approaches used for the identification of reduced-order models (emulators). It is based on the idea of sampling from the original model various values, or snapshots, of the state variables, and then using these snapshots in a projection scheme to find a lower-dimensional subspace that captures the majority of the variation of the original model. The model is then projected onto this subspace and solved, yielding a computationally efficient emulator. Yet, this approach may unnecessarily increase the complexity of the emulator, especially when only a few state variables of the original model are relevant with respect to the output of interest. This is the case of complex hydro-ecological models, which typically account for a variety of water quality processes. On the other hand, selection-based model reduction uses the information contained in the snapshots to select the state variables of the original model that are relevant with respect to the emulator’s output, thus allowing for model reduction. This provides a better trade-off between fidelity and model complexity, since the irrelevant and redundant state variables are excluded from the model reduction process. In this work we address these issues by presenting an exhaustive experimental comparison between two popular projection- and selection-based methods, namely Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Emulation Modelling (DEMo). The comparison is performed on the reduction of DYRESM-CAEDYM, a 1D hydro-ecological model used to describe the in-reservoir water quality conditions of Tono Dam, an artificial reservoir located in western Japan. Experiments on two different output variables (i.e. chlorophyll-a concentration and release water temperature) show that DEMo allows obtaining the same fidelity as POD while reducing the number of state variables in the emulator.",

The thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat of the samples were simultaneously determined using the hot-disk transient method. The thermal conductivity of natural hydrate-bearing sediments decreases slightly with increasing porosity. In addition, the thermal diffusivity of hydrate-bearing sediment decrease as porosity increases. We also used simple models to calculate the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. The results of the distribution model (geometric-mean model) are relatively consistent with the measurement results. In addition, the measurement results are consistent with the thermal diffusivity, which is estimated by dividing the thermal conductivity obtained from the distribution model by the specific heat obtained from the arithmetic mean. In addition, we discuss the relation between the thermal conductivity and mineral composition of core samples in conference.\nAcknowledgments.

            "abstract": "Cloud detection during nighttime poses a real problem to researchers because of a lack of optimum sensors that can specifically detect clouds during this time of the day. Hence, lidars and satellites are currently some of the instruments that are being utilized to determine cloud presence in the atmosphere. These clouds play a significant role in the night weather system for the reason that they serve as barriers of thermal radiation from the Earth and thereby reflecting this radiation back to the Earth. This effectively lowers the rate of decreasing temperature in the atmosphere at night. The objective of this study is to detect cloud occurrences at nighttime for the purpose of studying patterns of cloud occurrence and the effects of clouds on local weather. In this study, a commercial camera (Canon Powershot A2300) is operated continuously to capture nighttime clouds. The camera is situated inside a weather-proof box with a glass cover and is placed on the rooftop of the Manila Observatory building to gather pictures of the sky every 5min to observe cloud dynamics and evolution in the atmosphere. To detect pixels with clouds, the pictures are converted from its native JPEG to grayscale format. The pixels are then screened for clouds by looking at the values of pixels with and without clouds. In grayscale format, pixels with clouds have greater pixel values than pixels without clouds. Based on the observations, 0.34 of the maximum pixel value is enough to discern pixels with clouds from pixels without clouds. Figs. 1a & 1b are sample unprocessed pictures of cloudless night (May 22-23, 2014) and cloudy skies (May 23-24, 2014), respectively. Figs.1c and 1d show percentage of occurrence of nighttime clouds on May 22-23 and May 23-24, 2014, respectively. The cloud occurrence in a pixel is defined as the ratio of the number times when the pixel has clouds to the total number of observations. Fig. 1c shows less than 50% cloud occurrence while Fig. 1d shows cloud occurrence more than what is shown in Fig. 1c. These graphs show the capability of the camera to detect and measure the cloud occurrence at nighttime. Continuous collection of nighttime pictures is currently implemented. In regions where there is a dearth of scientific data, the measured nighttime cloud occurrence will serve as a baseline for future cloud studies in this part of the world.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of land use during the Holocene is crucial to understand impacts of human activity on climate change in preindustrial period. Until now it is still a key issue to reconstruct amount and spatial distribution of prehistoric land use due to lack of data. Most reconstructions are simply extrapolations of population, cleared land amount per person and land suitability for agriculture.\nIn this study, a new quantitative prehistoric land use model (PLUM) is developed based on semi-quantitative predictive models of archeological sites. The PLUM is driven by environmental and social parameters of archeological sites, which are objective evidences of prehistoric human activity, and produces realistic patterns of land use.\nAfter successful validations of the model with modern observed data, the PLUM was applied to reconstruct land use from 8 to 4 ka B.P. in Yiluo and Wei valleys, southern Loess Plateau. Both of them are the most important agriculture origin centers in northern China. Results reveal that about 9% of land areas in both valleys have been used by human activity from 8 to 4 ka B.P., expanding from gentle slopes along the river to hinterlands of the valleys. The land cover was affected by increasing agricultural land use during the middle Holocene.\nThe extensive spreads of land use since 7 ka B.P. in both valleys were driven by the combined impacts of population increase and agriculture development, which was further favored by wet and warm climate conditions during middle Holocene; while the decreasing rates of land use expansions after 5 ka B.P. were mainly induced by improved agriculture technology.\nWith the scaling up of PLUM to larger regional or global levels by a greater use of archeological data, the impact of human land use on global change can be studied more accurately.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall-runoff (RR) model is a key component of any water resource application. There are two types of techniques usually employed for RR modeling: physics based and data-driven techniques. Although the physics based models have been used for operational purposes for a very long time, they provide only reasonable accuracy in modeling and forecasting. On the other hand, the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been reported to provide superior modeling performance; however, they have not been acceptable by practitioners, decision makers and water resources engineers as operational tools. The ANNs one of the data driven techniques, became popular for efficient modeling of the complex natural systems in the last couple of decades. In this paper, the comparative results for conceptual and ANN models in RR modeling are presented. The conceptual models were developed by the use of rainfall-runoff library (RRL) and genetic algorithm (GA) was used for calibration of these models. Feed-forward neural network model structure trained by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training algorithm has been adopted here to develop all the ANN models. The daily rainfall, runoff and various climatic data derived from Bird creek basin, Oklahoma, USA were employed to develop all the models included here. Daily potential evapotranspiration (PET), which was used in conceptual model development, was calculated by the use of Penman equation. The input variables were selected on the basis of correlation analysis. The performance evaluation statistics such as average absolute relative error (AARE), Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) and threshold statistics (TS) were used for assessing the performance of all the models developed here. The results obtained in this study show that the ANN models outperform the conventional conceptual models due to their ability to learn the non-linearity and complexity inherent in data of rainfall-runoff process in a more efficient manner. There is a strong need to carry out such studies to prove the superiority of ANN models over conventional methods in an attempt to make them acceptable by water resources community responsible for the operation of water resources systems.",

            "abstract": "E Sicily and Calabria have been repeatedly struck by destructive historical earthquakes and tsunamis (1693 Catania M7.4, 1908 Messina 7.2). The latter triggered a submarine landslide and turbidity current that ruptured submarine cables. We present the preliminary results of a paleoseismological investigation on a set of deep marine sediment cores from the Ionian Sea acquired during the CIRCEE survey (R/V Le Suroit in Oct. 2013). The objective is to improve our understanding of the chronology and origin of large catastrophic events, which have affected the area. One of the thickest and well known deposits is the up to 10-12 m thick Augias “homogenite” (or megaturbidite) which covers the entire floor of the Ionian abyssal plain and represents a volume of ~100km3. The origin of this deposit once thought to be associated to the Santorini collapse event dated at 3.5 ka (Cita et al., 1996) is enigmatic and more recent work suggests it may have been caused by the 365 AD Crete mega-thrust earthquake (Polonia et al., 2013)\nIn order to better understand the extreme events that led to such deposits in the Ionian abyssal plain and along the Sicily/ Malta slope, our study aims to correlate the megaturbidites observed in the slope and in the deep Ionian basin by CHIRP echosounder profiles and sedimentary facies analysis. Seismic profiles show several superposed acoustically transparent units identified as megaturbidites. The Augias megaturbidite was completely sampled in 6 new cores. An older megaturbidite, possibly the Deeper Transparent Layer (DTL), is also sampled in 3 new cores. Geochemical signatures, thicknesses and grain sizes show wide variability for the same deposit among the cores. For example, the thickness of the Augias deposit varies between 70 cm and 605 cm, and the lithology and sedimentary structures of the base of the deposit is also highly variable, ranging from massive and laminated medium sand to silty-clay. For the two megaturbidites described in the cores, we establish a preliminary stratigraphy based in part on correlations to data described by Polonia et al. (2013). Radiocarbon dating and other work in progress should help to better characterize the megaturbidites, in terms of areal extent, thickness, chemical composition and grain size distribution, and provide new constraints on their origin and transport.",

            "abstract": "The algoritm of a first principles calving-simulation computer-code is outlined and demonstrated. The code is particle-based and uses Newtonian dynamics to simulate ice-fracture, motion and calving. The code can simulate real-size glacier but is only able to simualte individual calving events within a few tens of minutes in duration. The code couples to the Elmer/Ice ice flow-simulation code: Elmer is employed to produce various glacier geomteries, which are then tested for stability using the particle code. In this way it is possible to pin-point the location of calving fronts.\nThe particle simulation code and field observations are engaged to investigate the criticality of calving glaciers. The calving mass and inter-event waiting times both have power-law distributions with the same critical exponents as found for Abelian sand-pile models. This indicate that calving glaciers share characteristics with Self-Organized Critical systems (SOC). This would explain why many glacier found in nature may become unstable as a result of even minor changes in their environment. An SOC calving glacier at the critical point will display so large fluctuations in calving rate that it will render the concept 'average calving rate' more or less useless. I.e. 'average calving rate' will depend on measurement time and always have fluctuaions in the range of 100% more or less independent of the averaging time.",

            "abstract": "Phytoplankton are known to produce volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which contribute to environmental problems such as global warming and decomposition of stratospheric ozone. For example, picophytoplankton, such as Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, are distributed in freshwater and oceans worldwide, accounting for a large proportion of biomass and primary production in the open ocean. However, to date, little is known about the production of VOCs by picophytoplankton. In this study, VOCs production by cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. (NIES-981) was investigated. Synechococcus sp. was obtained from the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES), Japan, and cultured at 24°C in autoclaved f/2-Si medium under 54 ± 3 µE m−2 s−1 (1 E = 1 mol of photons) with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle.\nVOCs concentrations were determined using a purge-and-trap gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (Agilent 5973). The concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl a) were also determined using a fluorometer (Turner TD-700). Bromomethane (CH3Br) and isoprene were produced by Synechococcus sp. Isoprene production was similar to those of other phytoplankton species reported earlier. Isoprene was produced when Chl a was increasing in the early stage of the incubation period (5–15 days of incubation time, exponential phase), but CH3Br was produced when Chl a was reduced in the late stage of the incubation period (30–40 days of incubation time, death phase).",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty is an inherent feature of most scientific endeavours, and many political decisions must be made in the presence of scientific uncertainty. In the case of climate change, there is evidence that greater scientific uncertainty increases the risk associated with the impact of climate change. Scientific uncertainty thus provides an impetus for cutting emissions rather than delaying action. In contrast to those normative considerations, uncertainty is frequently cited in political and public discourse as a reason to delay mitigation. We examine ways in which this gap between public and scientific understanding of uncertainty can be bridged.\nIn particular, we sought ways to communicate uncertainty in a way that better calibrates people’s risk perceptions with the projected impact of climate change. We report two behavioural experiments in which uncertainty about the future was expressed either as outcome uncertainty or temporal uncertainty. The conventional presentation of uncertainty involves uncertainty about an outcome at a given time—for example, the range of possible sea level rise (say 50cm +/- 20cm) by a certain date. An alternative presentation of the same situation presents a certain outcome (“sea levels will rise by 50cm”) but places the uncertainty into the time of arrival (“this may occur as early as 2040 or as late as 2080”).\nWe presented participants with a series of statements and graphs indicating projected increases in temperature, sea levels, ocean acidification, and a decrease in artic sea ice. In the uncertain magnitude condition, the statements and graphs reported the upper and lower confidence bounds of the projected magnitude and the mean projected time of arrival. In the uncertain time of arrival condition, they reported the upper and lower confidence bounds of the projected time of arrival and the mean projected magnitude.\nThe results show that when uncertainty was presented as uncertain time of arrival rather than an uncertain outcome, people expressed greater concern about the projected outcomes. In a further experiment involving repeated “games” with a simulated economy, we similarly showed that people allocate more resources to mitigation if there is uncertainty about the timing of an adverse event rather than about the magnitude of its impact.",

            "abstract": "Mega-thrust earthquakes are anticipated to occur in the Nankai Trough in southwest Japan. In the source areas, we installed seafloor seismic network, DONET (Dense Ocean-floor Network System for Earthquake and Tsunamis), in 2010 in order to monitor seismicity, crustal deformations, and tsunamis. DONET system consists of totally 20 stations, which is composed of six kinds of sensors; strong-motion and broadband seismometers, quartz and differential pressure gauges, hydrophone, and thermometer. The stations are densely distributed with an average spatial interval of 15-20 km and cover near coastal areas to the trench axis.\nObserved data are transferred to a land station through a fiber-optical cable and then to JAMSTEC (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology) data management center through a private network in real time. The data are based on WIN32 format in the private network and finally archived in SEED format in the management center to combine waveform data with related metadata.\nWe are developing a web-based application system to easily download seismic waveform data of DONET. In this system, users can select 20 Hz broadband (BH type) and 200 Hz strong-motion (EH type) data and download them in SEED. Users can also search events from the options of time periods, magnitude, source area and depth in a GUI platform. Event data are produced referring to event catalogues from USGS and JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency). The thresholds of magnitudes for the production are M6 for far-field and M4 for local events using the USGS and JMA lists, respectively. Available data lengths depend on magnitudes and epicentral distances.\nIn this presentation, we briefly introduce DONET stations and then show our developed application system. We open DONET data through the system and want them to be widely recognized so that many users analyze. We also discuss next plans for further developments of the system.",

            "abstract": "The plasmaspheric virtual resonance model has been proposed as one of the source mechanisms for low-latitude Pi2 pulsations. Few studies have used simultaneous multipoint observations in space to examine the spatial structure of Pi2 pulsations both inside and outside the plasmasphere. In this study we show multipoint observations for Pi2 pulsations using the Van Allen Probes (RBSP-A and RBSP-B). We focus on the two events that occurred between 1700 and 2000 UT on March 12, 2013, which were simultaneously observed by Van Allen Probes and Bohyun (BOH, L = 1.35) station in South Korea. By using plasma density measurements, we determined that during this time RBSP-A was located outside the plasmasphere and RBSP-B was located inside it. We found that the poloidal, radial (δBx) and compressional (δBz), magnetic field components, and the azimuthal (Ey) electric field component observed by both RBSP-A and RBSP-B have a high correlation with the H component at BOH for both events. The δBx and δBz oscillations at both RBSP-A and RBSP-B are nearly out of phase with ground Pi2. The Ey -H cross phases at RBSP-A outside the plasmapause and RBSP-B inside the plasmapause are nearly in quadrature for the first Pi2 event. These observations indicate that the Pi2 pulsations exist outside the plasmasphere with a radially standing signature which supports the plasmaspheric virtual resonance model.",

            "abstract": "Since last decade, rapid developments in non-destructive visualization techniques such as X-ray micro-CT provide a tool to directly monitor and study processes at pore scale which previously could only be explored indirectly. Fluid configurations, size distribution of residual clusters, and especially, interface between various phases, which control many transfer processes, can be visualized and quantified with high accuracy. On the other hand, such findings have not been adequately translated into required parameters for modeling, since most experimental attempts have remained case-specified. For example, modeling approaches for mass transfer in multiphase systems still assume single-size spherical bubbles for residual nonwetting phase, while it has been shown that residual clusters are far from being spherical, and have a broad size distribution which usually spans over several orders of magnitude.\nIn this study, we use micro-CT to investigate the relation between nonwetting phase surface area at residual state and structural properties at four different porous media. First, we performed REV analysis to test the validity of our results for both pore-scale (i.e. sub-REV) and continuum-scale (REV). At pore-scale, surface area of individual clusters shows a power-law relation to their volume, with exponents that vary for each porous medium. At continuum scale, however, the total surface area of nonwetting phase was strongly correlated to surface of pore space, regardless of pore size distribution. Our results improve the accuracy of most of available modeling approaches by avoiding simplifying assumptions without adding complexities to the process model. For example, actual cluster size distribution can replace single bubble size at pore scale, and surface areas can be estimated by power-law relationship, without incorporating complex shape of individual clusters. Similar approach can be used at REV-scale, where surface areas can be coupled with medium properties.",

            "abstract": "Along the North Anatolian Fault (Turkey), fault sliding is accommodated both by earthquakes and by aseismic creep. The creep processes develop either as transient (post-seismic or interseismic) sliding or as permanent sliding along zones localized on specific segments of the fault. Creep processes relax the stress and contribute to stress redistribution within the seismogenic zone. They participate to the deformation budget during the seismic cycle, sometimes delaying or on the contrary helping triggering the occurrence of large earthquakes. Identifying the mechanisms controlling creep and their evolution with time and space represents a major challenge for predicting the mechanical evolution of active faults. Our goal is to answer three main questions: How to identify at the outcrop scale permanent creep from transient creep? Is aseismic creep controlled by lithology? How does creep evolve before and after earthquakes? The challenge is to understand which key parameters control the shift from seismic to aseismic deformation, such as the effect of fabric, rock lithology, fault roughness, strain-rate, fluid pressure or stress.\nWe collected samples from a dozen of fresh and well-preserved fault outcrops along creeping and locked segments of the North Anatolian Fault. We used various methods such as microscopic and geological observations, SEM, XRD analysis, strain measurements from image processing approaches in order to quantitatively characterize the amount of deformation and the mechanisms involved. Results show different relationships between lithology and mechanisms of deformation: (i) Along the locked segments of the North Anatolian Fault, in massive limestone, we found evidence of large earthquakes followed by pre- or post-seismic (i.e. afterslip) creep. (ii) Along some creeping segments, we observed gouges with weak clay (saponite) that could accommodate (or have accommodated in the past) large permanent creep. (iii) Along other creeping segments, we observed deformed serpentine bodies attesting of creep episodes, the strain values of which remaining to be evaluated, but also evidences of past earthquakes, suggesting in such areas a mixed-mode of seismic and aseismic deformation.",

            "abstract": "The Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT) constitutes a fundamental shift in Earth's climate system from a 41 ka to a 100 ka periodicity in glacial oscillations. The exact timing and mechanism(s) that caused this change from a low- to high-amplitude glacial variability are still under debate and only recently Pena & Goldstein (2014) suggested that a disruption of the thermohaline circulation at about 900 ka BP and a subsequent change in ocean circulation might have acted as a trigger for the onset of 100 ka glacial-interglacial cycles. Most studies targeting the MPT are based on Atlantic sediment records whereas only few data sets are available from the North Pacific (see e.g. Clark et al., 2006 and McClymont et al., 2013 for reviews).\nIODP Expedition 341 distal deep-water site U1417 in the Gulf of Alaska (subpolar NE Pacific) now provided a continuous sediment record for reconstructing Miocene to Late Pleistocene changes in the sea surface conditions and how these relate to orbital and millennial scale climate variability. Here we present organic geochemical biomarker data covering the 1.5 Ma to 0.1 Ma time interval with special focus on the MPT. Alkenone, sterol, n-alkane and C25 highly branched isoprenoid data are used to reconstruct sea surface temperatures, primary productivity and terrigenous organic matter input (via sea ice, icebergs, meltwater discharge or aeolian transport). In addition, the diatom concentration and the species composition of the diatom assemblage deliver information on changes in palaeoproductivity and nutrient (silicate) availability. A major change in the environmental setting between 1.2 and 0.8 Ma is recorded by the biomarkers. This shift seems to be associated with a significant cooling of the surface waters in the Gulf of Alaska. Matching this shift, a significant change in the main components of the diatom community occurred between 1.2 and 0.8 Ma.\n",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone is a critical ecotone for maintaining the health of river systems due to the exchange of water and nutrients between streams and groundwater. Within riverbeds, hyporheic exchange is generally forced by variation in riverbed topography such as due to bedforms. In the past, a vast majority of research on bedform-driven hyporheic flow has focused on two-dimensional (2D) scenarios, while little has been done on more realistic three-dimensional (3D) situations. We investigated hyporheic exchanged using a sinuous-crested 3D dune which is superimposed with successive crest lines of 2D dunes, and compared it to a 2D dune with similar wavelength and height. These 2D and 3D dunes are depicted in detail in McLean (1997) and Maddux (2003), respectively. A series of modeling studies are conducted both in 2D and 3D with similar open channel Reynolds numbers (Re). Turbulent flow in the water column is simulated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-ω turbulence closure model, and a Darcy flow model is applied for the underlying porous media. These two sets of equations are coupled via the pressure distribution on the sediment-water interface (SWI). Results show that the pressure gradient along the SWI is highly controlled by the spatial structure of bedforms, which consequently determines flow dynamics in the porous media. Hyporheic flux is a function of Re for both 2D and 3D via a power-law trend; however, the hyporheic flux in the 3D dunes is generally higher and much more sensitive to Re. The depth and volume of the interfacial exchange zone of the 3D-bedform driven flow are only slightly different from the 2D situation, showing that the dimensionality of bedform has less impact on the exchanged zone. The mean fluid residence times for both 3D/2D dunes are related to Re by an inverse-power law relationship, they are different at low Re and become similar at higher Re. A 2D idealization seems a reasonable approximation for the more complex 3D situation.",

Late Holocene glacier marginal fluctuations are known from earlier studies, and older, well preserved moraine ridges and glacial landforms have also been mapped and described. Presently, outlet glaciers drain into the valleys Leirufjörður and Reykjarfjörður at the northwest and east side of the ice-cap, respectively. Samples for cosmogenic exposure dating (36Cl) were collected from erratics and striated bedrock in order to date the last deglaciation and to determine ages of terminal moraines.\nPreliminary results suggest that the valleys were still glaciated during the early Holocene. Lateral and terminal moraines at the mouth of Leirufjörður were dated to 9-10 kyr BP, indicating the main outlets of the ice-cap were calving glaciers at that time. Erratics dated to 20-37 kyr BP indicate that at least some coastal capes and plateaux were ice-free much earlier. However, erratics from similar elevations, 300-500 m a.s.l., but located more proximal to the ice cap have average exposure ages about 10 kyr. The 20-37 kyr old erratics could also be older rocks preserved under less active or even cold based ice.",

Knowledge of depth and bottom topography is useful in understanding future distribution of glaciers; the evolution of periglacial morphology and the subglacial drainage pattern. In this investigation, we have estimated the bedrock topography of Gangotri glacier which is located in the Indian part of Central Himalayas. The Gangotri glacier is one of the largest glaciers and has an areal extent of around 140 Km2.It is considered traditionally to be the source of River Ganges which is one of the main source of water for a large population living in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The bottom topography was estimated using the ice thickness and surface elevation. Ice thickness was estimated using an ice flow model, surface velocities and slope. Surface velocities were estimated using sub-pixel correlation of Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery for the years 2009 and 2010. The velocities that were estimated ranged from 14-85 m/a in the upper reaches to 20-30 m/a near the snout. The surface elevation was estimated using ASTER DEM and varied from ~4100 m near the snout to ~6600 m in the upper reaches. The combination of surface elevation and depth was used to estimate spatial distribution of bottom topography. The estimated bottom topography varies from ~3900 to 6100 masl and also shows number of depressions as deep as 50-100m. These depressions are potential sites for the formation of periglacial lakes, influencing future retreat and security of the region.",

A first GPS repetition network was setup and periodically measured since 1993, allowing detecting a deep magma reservoir, quantifying magma flux in conduit and identifying shallow discontinuities around the former crater (Beauducel and Cornet, 1999;Beauducel et al., 2000, 2006). After the 2010 centennial eruption, when this network was almost completely destroyed, Indonesian and Japanese teams installed a new continuous GPS network for monitoring purpose (Iguchi et al., 2011), consisting of 3 stations located at the volcano flanks, plus a reference station at the Yogyakarta Observatory (BPPTKG).\nIn the framework of DOMERAPI project (2013-2016) we have completed this network with 5 additional stations, which are located on the summit area and volcano surrounding. The new stations are 1-Hz sampling, GNSS (GPS + GLONASS) receivers, and near real-time data streaming to the Observatory. An automatic processing has been developed and included in the WEBOBS system (Beauducel et al., 2010) based on GIPSY software computing precise daily moving solutions every hour, and for different time scales (2 months, 1 and 5 years), time series and velocity vectors. A real-time source modeling estimation has also been implemented. It uses the depth-varying point source solution (Mogi, 1958; Williams and Wadge, 1998) in a systematic inverse problem model exploration that displays location, volume variation and 3-D probability map.\nThe operational system should be able to better detect and estimate the location and volume variations of possible magma sources, and to follow magma transfer towards the surface. This should help monitoring and contribute to decision making during future unrest or eruption.",

Phase identification in run products by synchrotron powder diffraction reveals a consistent set of stability relations for the high-pressure, dense hydrous silicate phases D and H. Experiments show that aluminous phase D is stable to ~ 55 GPa. Aluminous phase H becomes stable at ~ 40 GPa and remains stable to higher pressures throughout the lower mantle depth range in both model peridotitic and basaltic lithologies. Preliminary FEG-probe analyses indicate that Phase H is alumina-rich at ~ 50 GPa, with only 5 to 10 wt% each of MgO and SiO2. Variations in ambient unit cell volumes show that Mg-perovskite becomes more aluminous with pressure throughout the pressure range studied, and that Phase H may become more Mg- and Si-rich with pressure. We also find that at pressures above ~ 90 GPa stishovite is replaced in Si-rich compositions by seifertite, at which point there is a corresponding increase in the Al-content of phase H. The melting curves of MASH compositions have been determined using thermal perturbations in power versus temperature curves, and are observed to be shallow with dT/dP slopes of ~ 4K/GPa. Our results show that hydrated peridotitic or basaltic compositions in the lower mantle should be partially molten at all depths along an adiabatic mantle geotherm. Aluminous Phase H will be stable in colder, hydrated subducting slabs, potentially to the core-mantle boundary. Thus, aluminous phase H is the primary vessel for transport of hydrogen to the deepest mantle, but hydrous silicate melt will be the host of hydrogen at ambient mantle temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Ambient noise tomography has provided essential constraints on crustal and uppermost mantle shear velocity structure in global seismology. Recent studies demonstrate that high frequency (e.g., ~ 1 Hz) surface waves between receivers at short distances can be successfully retrieved from ambient noise cross-correlation and then be used for imaging near surface or shallow crustal shear velocity structures. This approach provides important information for strong ground motion prediction in seismically active area and overburden structure characterization in oil and gas fields. Here we propose a new tomographic method to invert all surface wave dispersion data for 3-D variations of shear wavespeed without the intermediate step of phase or group velocity maps.The method uses frequency-dependent propagation paths and a wavelet-based sparsity-constrained tomographic inversion. A fast marching method is used to compute, at each period, surface wave traveltimes and ray paths between sources and receivers. This avoids the assumption of great-circle propagation that is used in most surface wave tomographic studies, but which is not appropriate in complex media. The wavelet coefficients of the velocity model are estimated with an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, and upon iterations the surface wave ray paths and the data sensitivity matrix are updated from the newly obtained velocity model. We apply this new method to determine the 3-D near surface wavespeed variations in the Taipei basin of Taiwan, Hefei urban area and a shale and gas production field in China using the high-frequency interstation Rayleigh wave dispersion data extracted from ambient noisecross-correlation. The results reveal strong effects of off-great-circle propagation of high-frequency surface waves in these regions with above 30% shear wavespeed variations. The proposed approach is more efficient and robust than the traditional two-step surface wave tomography for imaging complex structures. In the future, approximate 3-D sensitivity kernels for dispersion data will be incorporated to account for finite-frequency effect of surface wave propagation. In addition, our approach provides a consistent framework for joint inversion of surface wave dispersion and body wave traveltime data for 3-D Vp and Vs structures.",

            "abstract": "Each decision in natural resources management can generate trade-offs with respect to the provisioning of ecosystem services (ES). If the increase of one ES happens directly or indirectly at the cost of another ES, an attempt to maximize the provision of a single ES will lead to suboptimal results. However, decisions in natural resources management are often made without considering such trade-offs, despite their crucial role toward supporting better decision-making. The research on trade-offs between ES has gained some attention in the scientific community. However, a synthesis on existing knowledge and knowledge gaps is missing so far. We aim at closing that gap by a quantitative review of recent literature on trade-offs of ES. We looked at the pairs of ES that have been studied in ~100 case studies that report on trade-offs between ES. If a case study analyzed more than one ES pair, we looked at all pairwise combinations. We categorized relationships between these pairs of ES into the categories “trade-off”, ”synergy” or “no-effect”. Most pairs of ES had a clear association with one category: the majority of case studies that studied a specific pair of ES identified the same category of relationship between the two ES. Pairs of regulating services were typically synergetic in relationship, whereas provisioning services and regulating services typically showed a trade-off. However, for several pairs of ES we were not able to identify a dominate category of relationship. Our hypothesis is that this relates to either the scale of the analysis, the land system where the analysis took place or the method used to quantify the relationship. The number of case studies for each pair of ES was spread unevenly. This hinders the support for a conclusive statement drawn for the pairs. Our results showed further that the method used to identify the relationship between services had a strong effect on the direction of the effect. This suggests that researchers should consider their method carefully. We believe that our results are of use for the scientific community as well as for practitioners since they provide helpful information about which services to include in ES assessments. Furthermore, they allow a first check if critical trade-offs have been considered in an analysis.",

            "abstract": "We constrain tectonic stresses at IODP Site C0002 in Nankai accretionary prism, SW Japan, using two boreholes drilled under different annular borehole pressures (APRS). The two vertical boreholes (C0002A and C0002F drilled in 2007 and 2012, respectively) are located at the southern margin of Kumano forearc, respectively drilled to depths of 1402 and 2006 mbsf. The two holes were drilled in different drilling modes: riserless drilling for C0002A and riser drilling for C0002F. Both holes were image-logged soon after drill bit penetration using the logging-while-drilling resistivity-at-the-bit tool, from which we detected borehole wall stress indicators (borehole breakouts and drilling-induced tensile fractures (DITFs)). We assume that there should be little difference in tectonic stress between the two drill sites (70 m apart) and between the two time frames (5 years apart). The resistivity images show that the patterns of borehole wall failures are dramatically contrast between the two boreholes, i.e., clear and continuous breakouts and no DITFs in C0002A, whereas intermittent breakouts and DITFs in C0002F, which is due to the difference in APRS between the two holes. Such different APRS and associated distinct borehole wall failure patterns enable us to constrain possible tectonic stress states that can produce observed borehole wall failures for given APRS conditions. Our analysis shows that while the stress states in the forearc sediments are predominantly in favor of normal faulting, those in the deeper accretionary prism are favorable for either strike-slip or reverse faulting although the differential stresses (between least and major horizontal principal stresses) are not significantly large. Throughout the drill depths, the borehole wall failures indicate that the maximum horizontal principal stress direction is NE-SW (perpendicular to subduction direction). However, a series of borehole wall failure zones at 1930-1980 mbsf, if they are breakouts, may indicate a stress rotation to NW-SE, which needs further investigation.",

We study gas phase trapping during imbibition for capillary number from 2×10-7 to 10-6 by X-ray computer tomography (μ-CT) and compare the experimental results with predictions from percolation theory. We found excellent agreement. Percolation theory could explain (i) that the capillary desaturation curves are not dependent on flow rate, (ii) the linear dependence of the total gas surface on gas saturation that is a direct consequence of the linear relationship between cluster surface and cluster volume, which is a prediction from percolation theory for large finite clusters, (iii) the power-like cluster size distribution with an exponent τexp = 2.15 that only deviates by 2% from the theoretical one (τtheor = 2.19), and (iv) that the maximal z-extension of trapped large gas cluster is described by the cut-off correlation length ξB (B – bond number).\nIn order to support the findings from μ-CT-experiments and to study the dynamics of capillary trapping, we conduct visualization experiments using monolayer- and microstructure-models.\nThe Figure shows the residual trapped air (red colored) after water imbibition: left: 2D-cut through a 3D-reconstructed image, right: 3D-slice of a 3D-reconstructed image.",

            "abstract": "Volumetric CO2 storage capacity in brine aquifers is one of the most important factor for large scale CCS projects. The maximum sustainable injection rate or the injectivity is another important criterion which is dependent on many reservoir specific properties including permeability, porosity, formation thickness, areal extent, pressure and relative permeability. Among those parameters, we focused on the residual wetting phase saturation expressed in relative permeability curve. From previous experiments, residual brine saturation is typically between 0.4 and 0.6. Higher displacement efficiency cannot be expected with those values because the displacement efficiency is inversely proportional to the residual oil saturation. Also, it is natural that the end-point relative permeability for CO2 should be low. The reason is that the high CO2-brine interfacial tension disturbs CO2 invasion into small pores. In this study, chemical flooding was assumed with surfactants or intermediate fluid which is miscible with both water and CO2 to reduce the interfacial tension. We didn’t use the chemicals to improve the displacement efficiency all over the field but intend to improve the injectivity at least near the wellbore region swept by the chemicals. Once lower residual brine saturation was achieved, the higher CO2 saturation could be maintained and the better CO2 injectivity was shown. Injection tests using a commercial model showed that the increase of the injectivity was not very high but the enhancement was meaningful.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 15 years, global mean surface temperatures exhibit only a weak trend - widely referred to as a hiatus - compared to the preceding 25-year period. Recent studies have attempted to attribute the hiatus to several causes, e.g., ocean-atmosphere energy exchange mechanisms, stratospheric water vapour, and impacts of volcanic emissions unaccounted for. Recently, the phenomenon has also been analysed in terms of incomplete sampling of the rapidly warming Arctic region.\nWe here examine zonal mean temperature trends in satellite-based tropospheric data sets with a global coverage, and compare them to the HadCRUT4 surface data set. MSU/AMSU data allow us to study tropospheric temperature trend patterns in the pre-hiatus period 1985--1997 relative to the hiatus period 2001--2013. The latter period is also covered by GNSS Radio Occultation (GNSS-RO) measurements from which geopotential heights of isobaric surfaces, and hence mean tropospheric temperatures, can be derived. Omission of successively larger polar regions from the global-mean temperature calculations, in both tropospheric and surface data sets, shows that data gaps at high latitudes can not explain the observed differences between the hiatus and the pre-hiatus period. Leaving out high latitudes leads to an under-estimation of the trend in the global means, but this effect is only a minor contributor to the hiatus phenomenon.Instead, the dominating causes appears to be found at low- and mid-latitudes.",

            "abstract": "A source of Saturn's magnetic 10.7-hour period oscillations has yet to be identified. The oscillations are known to consist of signals with slightly different periods from separate northern and southern sources. Here we present a novel way of examining observations, focusing on signal phase. We show that although the signals are highly periodic they are usually not sinusoidal and that there are differences in both phase structure and polarization between the outer magnetosphere (on the nightside) and the inner dipolar region. Paying particular attention to the deep mid-tail passes of 2006, the contrasting behaviour between the inner and outer regions is clear with approximate sinusoidal behaviour in the dipolar region and a pulse like signal once per cycle in the tail. The latter structure seems to indicate that tail magnetic stress is released impulsively once per cycle in the tail. After equinox, in 2010-11, we find a different picture in the pre-midnight sector. The pre-determined northern and southern frequencies are closer together and apparently show sudden shifts. Our signal reconstruction approach finds instances where it is likely that the narrow band filtering is not able to track completely the basic north and south periods as we find phase jumps indicating unpredicted beats.",

            "abstract": "Surface-wave dispersion measurements based on seismic background signal (ambient noise) are a very effective means to image S-wave velocity at crustal and lithospheric depths. The goal of our study is to integrate new ambient noise data for central Europe with more traditional models of crustal heterogeneity and discontinuity depths. We find that the reference crustal model EPcrust (Molinari and Morelli, 2011) is in good agreement with the large database of one-year-long records of European ambient noise compiled by Verbeke et al. (2012). We use the same data to further improve EPcrust, obtaining a new three-dimensional model of Italian and Alpine crustal structure. We first conduct a linear least squares inversion of the available phase-velocity observations, resulting in a set of Rayleigh-wave phase-velocity maps at periods between 5 and 37 s. At relatively short periods, these maps clearly reflect the surface geology of the region, e.g. low velocity zones at the Po Plain; longer-period maps reveal deeper structures such as Moho topography under Alps and Appennines, and lower crustal anomalies. The phase-velocity maps are next inverted via the Neighbourhood Algorithm to determine a set of one-dimensional shear-velocity models (one per phase-velocity pixel), which are in turn interpolated to build a new three-dimensional model and Moho depth. The reconstructed model shows the low velocity area beneath the Po Plain; the contrast between the low-velocity crust of the Adriatic domain and the high-velocity crust of the Tyrrhenian domain is clearly seen, as well as an almost uniform crystalline crust beneath the Alpine belt. Our results are physically consistent with the information for velocity structure and Moho depth independently obtained by other seismic methods.",

            "abstract": "Lithospheric strength variations modulate, and in turn are modulated by, many key tectonic processes, including rifting, orogeny, and the longevity of cratons. The anisotropy of many geological materials and processes might lead to a natural expectation of widespread anisotropy in lithospheric strength, perhaps especially in areas like cratons, which have long, complex geological histories, and their margins, which often record extremely anisotropic orogenic events. The observed coherence between gravity and topography remains the most popular metric for the analysis of flexural rigidity and its anisotropic directional variations, and, indeed, it is frequently anisotropic. Does this, however, correspond to anisotropy in the actual mechanical strength of the lithosphere? Using coherence, we should only reject the null hypothesis of isotropy when there is significant anisotropy in both the observed coherence and the resulting flexural strength. In addition, the anisotropy should not arise purely from marginal (in the statistical sense) anisotropy in the topography and gravity data themselves.\nIn the last decade or two, new methods to estimate coherence between two-dimensional bivariate fields have been developed, most notably those using multitapers or wavelets. Using synthetic tests on wholly isotropic models, we find widespread spurious anisotropy using both these methods. Using a series of statistical and geophysical tests developed to identify and remove such spurious directionality, our global reanalysis shows sparse evidence for meaningful anisotropy in the mechanical strength of the lithosphere. Although the geological argument for anisotropy in these regions and its role in tectonic cycles remains highly plausible, this anisotropy has not yet been convincingly verified by any cross-spectral method.",

However, clear a role climate science can play, there is also a clear discrepancy in the understanding of how to use the science and associated tools (such as climate models). Despite there being a large body of literature on the science there is clearly a need to provide greater support in how to apply appropriately. However, access to high quality professional development courses can be problematic, due to geographic, financial and time constraints. In attempt to address this gap we independently developed two online professional courses that focused on helping participants use and apply two regional climate models, WRF and PRECIS.\nBoth courses were designed to support participants’ learning through tutor led programs that covered the basic climate scientific principles of regional climate modeling and how to apply model outputs. The fundamental differences between the two courses are: 1) the WRF modeling course expected participants to design their own research question that was then run on a version of the model, whereas 2) the PRECIS course concentrated on the principles of regional modeling and how the climate science informed the modeling process.\nThe two courses were developed to utilise the cost and time management benefits associated with eLearning, with the recognition that this mode of teaching can also be accessed internationally, providing professional development courses in countries that may not be able to provide their own. The development teams saw it as critical that the courses reflected sound educational theory, to ensure that participants had the maximum opportunity to learn successfully. In particular, the role of reflection is central to both course structures to help participants make sense of the science in relation to their own situation.\n\nThis paper details the different structures of both courses, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of each, along with the educational approaches used. We conclude by proposing a framework for the develop of educationally robust online professional development programs that actively supports decision makers in understanding, developing and applying regional climate models.",

            "abstract": "Artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) has been proposed as a mean to mitigate climate change and ocean acidification. Whilst the mitigation potential of this geo-engineering technology may sound promising, it poses environmental risks. Within the Priority Program “Climate Engineering” of the German Science Foundation (DFG), we investigate the mitigation potential of AOA to reduce atmospheric CO2 and counteract the consequences of ocean acidification. We are particularly interested in the residence time of the added alkalinity at the ocean surface because it must stay in the upper ocean in order to increase the oceanic CO2 uptake. The mitigation potential, risks and the unintended consequences of this geo-engineering method are also exhaustively studied. These questions are tackled through the analysis of different alkalinity enhancement scenarios in the state-of-the-art Earth system model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-ESM) in a configuration based on the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Model scenarios are designed so that AOA is performed to keep the atmospheric CO2 concentrations similar to values of the stabilization scenario RCP4.5, while fossil fuel CO2 emissions follow the pathway of the high-CO2 scenario RCP8.5. Alkalinity is added globally into the upper 12 meters of the ocean in different seasons and years. We found that on the time scale of relevance (i.e. from years to decades), season and location are key aspects to take into account in the implementation of AOA. This is because of inhomogeneous vertical mixing of added alkalinity due to the mixed layer depth which is established by the season. We also show that the rate of addition greatly determines impact and outcome of this geo-engineering method. Changes driven by the implementation of this method in the ocean biogeochemistry are also discussed. For instance, the associated changes in the carbon cycle, marine oxygen levels, saturation state of carbonate minerals, nutrient cycles and marine biota.",

            "abstract": "Chironomidae (non-biting midges) is a family of two-winged aquatic insects of the order Diptera. They are globally distributed and one of the most diverse families within aquatic ecosystems. The insects are stenotopic, and the rapid turnover of species and their ability to colonise quickly favourable habitats means chironomids are extremely sensitive to environmental change, notably temperature. Through the development of quantitative temperature inference models chironomids have become important palaeoecological tools. Proxies capable of generating independent estimates of past climate are crucial to disentangling climate signals and ecosystem response in the palaeoecological record. This project has developed the first modern environmental calibration data set in order to use chironomids from the Tropical Andes as quantitative climate proxies. Using surface sediments from c. 60 lakes from Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador we have developed an inference model capable of reconstructing temperatures, with a prediction error of 1-2°C, from fossil assemblages. Here we present the first Lateglacial and Holocene chironomid-inferred temperature reconstructions from two sites in the tropical Andes. The first record, from a high elevation (4153 m asl) lake in the Bolivian Andes, shows persistently cool temperatures for the past 15 kyr, punctuated by warm episodes in the early Holocene (9-10 kyr BP). The chironomid-inferred Holocene temperature trends from a lake sediment record on the eastern Andean flank of Ecuador (1248 m asl) spanning the last 5 millennia are synchronous with temperature changes in the NGRIP ice core record. The temperature estimates suggest along the eastern flank of the Andes, at lower latitudes (~1°S), climate closely resemble the well-established fluctuations of the Northern Hemisphere for this time period. Late-glacial climate fluctuations across South America are still disputed with some palaeoecological records suggesting evidence for Younger Dryas like events. Estimates from quantitative climate proxies such as chironomids will help constrain these patterns and further our understanding of climate teleconnections on Quaternary timescales.",

In the east the slope joints to the Okhotsk Sea deep basins.\nThis continental margin has a complex structural geometry formed by the strike-slip tectonics of the active plate boundary and the deep sea basins formation. Geophysical data in this region show a system of the NS, NE and NW-striking faults in the basement that is covered by sediments of 3-5 km thickness. These faults reflect structure of the strike-slip system at the time of its origin. According to focal mechanism solutions the Sakhalin region is characterized by transition from pure strike-slip motion in the north to compression motion in the south, while Okhotsk Sea deep basins had formed by regional extension. The recent tectonic activity and kinematics of those processes along this continental margin are under discussion\nWe present results of many years research of the upper part of sedimentary cover structure. Bathymetry and seismic data was interpreted using geomorphology and structural geology approach. Based on the results of the research we distinguished recent fault system, including NS, north-east and north-west faults with significant vertical offset. According to faults kinematics we suggest that this system is formed as a surface manifestation of the recent displacement along deep-seated strike-slip faults. While some of them could be connected to reactivation of the faults originated during the deep-basins formation. Obtained data allows us make suggestions about recent tectonic conditions and lithospheric dynamics In the Eastern Sakhalin slope.",

The curvilinear grid finite difference method has been successfully used for seismic wave simulation with free surface topography and earthquake dynamics with complex falut geometry. For seismic wave simulation with topographic sea bottom, we use the curvilinear grid to conform the grid to the sea bottom to avoid artifical scatterings due to stair-case approximation. We solve the acoustic wave equation in the water layer and the elastic wave equation in the solid below the sea bottom. The fluid-solid interface condition is implemented by decomposing velocity and stress components to normal and parallel directions of the sea bottom. The results exhibit high accuracy by comparsion with analytical solutions for flat interfaces and also work very well when the fluid-solid interface is topographic.

Heavy rainfall in short time makes it low elevation area to be susceptible to more flooding than before. According to KMA it is announced as heavy rainfall warning whose precipitation amount is equal to or greater than 150mm per 12 hours. And sometimes, these rainfall events bring out severe disasters such as the case of flooding in Gangnam Station, Daechi Station and landslides which resulted in 20 person death in downtown Seoul on July 27th, 2011. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of heavy precipitation in Seoul. Ultimately it aims to contribute these results to the proper urban planning and management.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this study, the digital topograhic data and weather data in Seoul Metropolitan Area were used to figure out the spatial distribution of summer heavy rainfall. The precipitation data in summer (June to Sep.) season were used to detect the recent changes of temporal and spatial features from 1995 to 2014 (20 years) using Automatic Weather tation (AWS) data in Seoul Metropolitan Area. The precipitation amount in summer during the past 20 years has been on the rise but rainy days have barely changed，which reveals the daily precipitation intensity has increased.\nAfter deriving the characteristic of heavy rainfall, the relationship among precipitation, topography and land uses were interpreted and discussed. This study is to investigate the characteristics of flood prone area by focusing topographic and land use characteristics. Ultimately it contributes to prepare the guideline for flood preventive urban plannig.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in in-situ U-Th/Pb monazite petrochronology allow ages obtained from micron-scale portions of texturally-constrained, individual crystals to be placed directly into a quantitative Pressure-Temperature framework.\nHowever, there remain major unresolved challenges in linking monazite ages to specific deformation events and discerning the effects of deformation on the isotopic and elemental tracers in these phases. Few studies have quantitatively investigated monazite microstructure, and these studies have largely focused only on crystals produced experimentally (e.g. Reddy et al., 2010). The dispersion in age data commonly yielded from monazite U-Th/Pb datasets suggest that monazite dynamically recrystallises during deformation. It remains unclear how this continual recrystallisation is reflected in the monazite crystal structure, and how this subsequently impacts the ages (or age ranges) yielded from single crystals.\nHere, combined laser ablation split-stream analysis of deformed monazite, EBSD imaging and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) phase equilibria modelling is used to quantify the influence of deformation on monazite (re)crystallisation mechanisms and its subsequent effect on the crystallographic structure, ages and trace-element distribution in individual grains. These data provide links between ages and specific deformation events, thus helping further our understanding of the role of dynamic recrystallisation in producing age variation within and between crystals in a deformed rock. These data provide a new dimension to the field of petrochronology, demonstrating the importance of fully integrating the Pressure-Temperature-time-deformation history of accessory phases to better interpret the meaningfulness of ages yielded from deformed rocks.\nReddy, S. et al., 2010.

            "abstract": "An operational hydrological monitoring system will greatly benefit disaster mitigation and water resources management. The operational hydrological models are usually calibrated using retrospective meteorological station data but forced by real-time data from satellite estimates in the operational system. A main challenge is the inconsistency between the retrospective meteorological forcings and real-time forcing data which may introduce bias in real-time hydrological estimates. Here we attempted to correct the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) real-time precipitation by removing the systematic bias between the retrospective precipitation data and the satellite precipitation product. The bias correction was performed at each 0.25 degree grid cell to match the cumulative probability function (CDF) of satellite precipitation with an observation-based precipitation data (IGSNRR precipitation) in the period of March 2000 to December 2010. An independent validation was conducted in 2011-2013 to evaluate the performance of the adjusted satellite product over 10 large river basins in China. The results show that precipitation of the adjusted satellite data agreed well with IGSNRR precipitation while the unadjusted data overestimated precipitation at most basins. The daily precipitation distribution of the adjusted product is closer to the IGSNRR distribution compared to the unadjusted precipitation as expected. Using the adjusted precipitation data, the hydrological model could reproduce better hydrographs than the unadjusted data over all the river basins. In particular, the model forced by the adjusted precipitation can capture the high flow well while the model forced by the unadjusted precipitation significantly overestimated high flow in flooding seasons. Our experiments suggest that the real-time satellite precipitation, after bias-correction, can serve as forcing for hydrological monitoring to generate estimations consistent with the retrospective hydrological simulations.",

            "abstract": "Polythermal glaciers (i.e. glaciers that consist of some combination of both warm and cold ice) are common in the Arctic (e.g. Aschwanden and Blatter, 2005). Recent work (e.g. Rippin et al. 2011; Gusmeroli et al., 2012; Wilson and Flowers, 2013; Wilson et al., 2013) has focussed on how their polythermal structure might change in response to a warming climate. These studies suggest that the nature of future thermal regime change is complex, such that the relative volume of temperate ice in a shrinking glacier may increase or decrease, depending on local geographical, meteorological and hydrological parameters.\nHere, we present a unique data-set from the well-studied glacier Midtre Lovénbreen in Svalbard, which has shown continued and sustained retreat in recent years. We have a network of ground penetrating radar (GPR) lines from this glacier, first surveyed in 2006 and then repeat-surveyed along exactly the same lines in 2012. Despite significant retreat and thinning, our data suggests that minimal changes in thermal regime have taken place over this period, reinforcing previous observations of a significant lag in the rate at which the thermal regime responds to mass balance changes (cf. Rippin et al., 2011). Such a ‘thermal lag’ has implications for evolving hydrological and dynamical behaviour of these glaciers, and also for the future mass balance response. In this paper, we comment on the observed changes and consider the implications for our understanding of future thermal regime evolution.\n",

            "abstract": "Infragravity (IG) waves have received a growing attention over the last decade and they have been shown to partly control dune erosion, barrier breaching, development of seiches in harbors or the circulation on fringing reefs. Although the relevance IG waves in surf and swash zone dynamics is well recognized, their dynamics and effects on tidal inlets and estuaries have not been analyzed. This study investigates the importance of IG waves at Albufeira Lagoon Inlet, a shallow wave-dominated inlet located on the western Coast of Portugal. Water levels and currents were measured synchronously during a two-day field experiment carried out at Albufeira Lagoon Inlet in September 2010. Apart from the tidally induced gravity wave modulations and wave induced setup inside the lagoon, an important IG wave contribution was identified. Low frequency oscillations were noticeable in the free surface elevation records and produced fluctuations of up to 100% in current intensities. While IG waves in the ebb shoal were present during the whole tidal cycle, the absence of IG waves characterized the ebbing tide inside the lagoon. The energy in the IG frequency band gradually increased from low tide to high tide, and disappeared during the ebbing tide. The modeling system Xbeach was applied to hindcast the hydrodynamics during the field experiment period. The model captures the main physics related with the IG wave generation and propagation inside the inlet, and reproduced the IG blocking during the ebb as identified in the measurements. This behavior was explained by the combination of advection and wave blocking induced by opposing tidal currents. Both measurements and numerical results suggested the bound wave release as the dominant mechanism responsible for IG wave generation. The fact that IG waves only propagate at flood tide has strong implications on the sediment balance of the inlet and contribute to inlet infilling under energetic wave conditions. It is expected that IG waves contribute to the shoaling or closure of wave-dominated inlets during winter months, although this hypothesis will have to be verified at other sites.",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric ozone change can influence on tropospheric climate. For example, Sigmond and Fyfe (2010) pointed out the Antarctic sea ice could increase due to the Antarctic ozone hole: Stratospheric cooling due to the ozone hole increases a westerly anomaly of the polar night jet by satisfying the thermal wind balance, and annular mode response increases westerly anomaly near the surface. The increase of the surface westerly intensifies the northward component of the Ekman transport in the ocean and promotes the sea ice transport to lower latitudes. However, the impact of ozone change in paleoclimate has not been investigated in detail. In most of paleoclimate experiments of CMIP5/PMIP3, the distribution of ozone is fixed to the estimated value of 1850 AD despite the ozone distribution depends on the solar radiation distribution as a function of latitude and time (season). This treatment may cause some bias to the simulation results. In this study, therefore, we examine the impacts of forecasted ozone distribution in paleoclimate experiments with an Earth system model. In this presentation, we focus on the Antarctic region in the mid-Holocene (6k year before present, hereafter MH) experiment, where significant impact is obtained.\nWe utilize Japan Meteorological Agency Meteorological Research Institute (JMA-MRI) Earth system model, which is a coupled model of the atmosphere-ocean-aerosol general circulation model of MRI-CGCM3 (Yukimoto et al., 2012) which was used in CMIP5 and the chemistry model of MRI-CCM2 (Deushi and Shibata, 2011). We examine the MH experiment and the preindustrial control experiment under the condition of 1850 AD, both of which are corresponding to CMIP5.\nWe investigated the impact of the ozone variations to climate by the change of orbital parameters of the Earth. The Antarctic sea ice in spring decreases through the deceleration of the westerly jet due to the increase of stratospheric ozone. As a result, temperature anomaly is up to about 1 K near the surface. This result suggests that the ozone distribution consistent with the solar insolation in the targeted era should be used in paleoclimate simulations in order to improve the accuracy of the climate reconstruction in the polar regions.",

            "abstract": "Sub-surface hydrology has a dominant role on the initiation of rainfall-induced landslides, since changes in the soil water potential affect soil shear strength and thus apparent cohesion. Especially on steep slopes and shallow soils, loss of shear strength can lead to failure even in unsaturated conditions. A process based model, HYDROlisthisis, characterized by high resolution in space and, time is developed to investigate the interactions between surface and subsurface hydrology and shallow landslide initiation. Specifically, 3D variably saturated flow conditions, including soil hydraulic hysteresis and preferential flow, are simulated for the subsurface flow, coupled with a surface runoff routine. Evapotranspiration and specific root water uptake are taken into account for continuous simulations of soil water content during storm and inter-storm periods. The geotechnical component of the model is based on a multidimensional limit equilibrium analysis, which takes into account the basic principles of unsaturated soil mechanics. The model is applied to a small catchment in Switzerland historically prone to rainfall-triggered landslides. A series of numerical simulations were carried out with various boundary conditions (soil depths) and using hydrological and geotechnical components of different complexity. Specifically, the sensitivity to the inclusion of preferential flow and soil hydraulic hysteresis was tested together with the replacement of the infinite slope assumption with a multi-dimensional limit equilibrium analysis. The effect of the different model components on model performance was assessed using accuracy statistics and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The results show that boundary conditions play a crucial role in the model performance and that the introduced hydrological (preferential flow and soil hydraulic hysteresis) and geotechnical components (multidimensional limit equilibrium analysis) considerably improve predictive capabilities in the presented case study.",

            "abstract": "Crucial to lava flow hazard assessment is the development of tools for real-time prediction of flow paths, flow advance rates, and final flow lengths. Accurate prediction of flow paths and advance rates requires not only rapid assessment of eruption conditions (especially effusion rate) but also improved models of lava flow emplacement. Here we present the LAV@HAZARD web-GIS framework, which combines spaceborne remote sensing techniques and numerical simulations for real-time forecasting of lava flow hazards. By using satellite-derived discharge rates to drive a lava flow emplacement model, LAV@HAZARD allows timely definition of parameters and maps essential for hazard assessment, including the propagation time of lava flows and the maximum run-out distance. We take advantage of the flexibility of the HOTSAT thermal monitoring system to process satellite images coming from sensors with different spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions. HOTSAT was designed to ingest infrared satellite data acquired by the MODIS and SEVIRI sensors to output hot spot location, lava thermal flux and discharge rate. We use LAV@HAZARD to merge this output with the MAGFLOW physics-based model to simulate lava flow paths and to update, in a timely manner, flow simulations. Thus, any significant changes in lava discharge rate are included in the predictions. A significant benefit in terms of computational speed was obtained thanks to the parallel implementation of MAGFLOW on graphic processing units (GPUs). All this useful information has been gathered into the LAV@HAZARD platform which, due to the high degree of interactivity, allows generation of easily readable maps and a fast way to explore alternative scenarios. We will describe and demonstrate the operation of this framework using a variety of case studies pertaining to Mt Etna, Sicily. Although this study was conducted on Mt Etna, the approach used is designed to be applicable to other volcanic areas around the world.",

            "abstract": "The weakening mechanism of calcite-bearing rocks is still poorly understood though many major earthquakes stroke within carbonate sequences. Insights derive from the laboratory: in experiments performed on calcite-bearing gouges, up to 90% drop in friction is associated to grain size reduction to the nanoscale and the formation of crystal-plastic microstructures suggesting the activation of debated weakening mechanisms (e.g., grain boundary sliding and diffusion creep; nanopowder lubrication). Whatever the case, it is unclear how nanoparticles form and what their role is at the initiation of sliding.\nTo investigate initial fault instability we sheared with a rotary shear apparatus SHIVA pre-cut ring-shaped solid cylinders (50/30 mm ext/int diameter) of Carrara marble (99.9% CaCO3). Rock cylinders were slid for few millimetres(0, 1.5 mm and 5mm) at accelerations (6.5 ms-2) and normal stresses (10 MPa) approaching seismic deformation conditions. Initial slip (<2 mm) was concomitant with large frictional weakening (up to 30% of static friction) and CO2emission.\nMicroanalytical observations (FE-SEM, FIB-SEM and TEM) showed that the experimental slipping zones consisted of (1) defects structures, including dislocations, cleavage surfaces and deformation features such as mechanical twins, partially burden beneath (2) a 2-10 micrometer thick layer of nanograins where pervasive nano-fracturing have occurred preserving the grain shape (pulverization) and (3) reaction products attributable to high pressure and high temperature conditions (i.e. calcite decomposition into amorphous carbon rimming the nanograins). All the above features are typical of shock-induced changes in minerals.\nWe interpret the above observations as follows: pre-existing grain boundaries or newly formed defects are the nuclei for the generation of dislocations and for their pile-up; the fast release of those piles-up in avalanches under rapid stress loading (fast moving dislocations) may explain the origin of such a shock-like behaviour responsible for large initial frictional weakening. The passage of the shock wave induces pervasive nanofracturing with grain size reduction to the nano-scale and an abrupt temperature rise responsible for calcite decarbonation and formation of carbon amorphous material.",

            "abstract": "An evolving pattern of convective circulation within the mantle generates and maintains dynamic topography which is some fraction of observed topography. Spatial variations of dynamic topography are easy to measure within the oceanic realm and it is possible to exploit inventories of seismic reflection and wide-angle data to determine the dynamic topography of the oldest oceanic lithosphere that abuts passive continental margins. Results show that oceanic lithosphere has dynamic topographic anomalies of +/- 1 km with wavelengths of 500-1000 km. These substantial anomalies intersect coastal shelves and so it is expected that the development of these anomalies has affected sequence stratigraphic architecture in important ways. A series of examples will be used to illustrate how sequence stratigraphy can be profoundly influenced by changing patterns of dynamic topography. First, along the West African margin a set of dynamic topographic domes intersect the shelf edge. Onshore, the Neogene growth of these domes is recorded by emergent terraces and by drainage patterns. Offshore, an Oligo-Miocene switch from aggradation to progradation together with a series of younger disconformities have modified stratigraphic architecture along the shelf. Secondly, along the Northwest Shelf of Australia there is evidence for 700 m of dynamic drawdown of the oldest oceanic floor. Regional mapping and backstripping of clinoformal geometries within a Miocene carbonate reef complex shows that there is a dramatic switch from progradation to aggradation which cannot be attributed to glacio-eustatic variations. Instead, this switch appears to reflect growth of dynamic drawdown within the mantle. Finally, the Icelandic plume has controlled vertical motions along fringing North Atlantic margins over the last 60 Ma. Thanks to the intersecting mid-oceanic ridge, there is independent evidence that the temperature structure of this plume has fluctuated through time. These fluctuations are recorded within the detailed sequence stratigraphy of the margins where a series of ephemeral terrestrial landscapes have been mapped. Stratigraphic architecture appears to be an important repository of details about transient convective circulation which are otherwise difficult to obtain.",

Thus, these variables simulated from fifth phase of the Climate Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) models have been compared against Climatic Research Unit (CRU) observed data and projected for the twenty first century under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 emission scenarios. Results for the seven countries under Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have been examined. Six CMIP5 models namely GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2M, GFDL-ESM2G, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC and HadGEM2-ES have been chosen for this study. The study period has been considered is from 1861 to 2100. From this period, initial 145 years i.e. 1861 to 2005 is reference or historical period and the later 95 years i.e. 2005 to 2100 is projected period. The climate change in the projected period has been examined with respect to the reference period. In order to validate the models, the mean annual rainfall and temperature has been compared with CRU over the reference period 1901 to 2005. Comparison reveals that most of the models are able to capture the spatial distribution of rainfall and temperature over most of the regions of BIMSTEC countries. Therefore these model data can be used to study the future changes in the 21st Century. Four out six models shows that the rainfall over Central and North India, Thailand and eastern part of Myanmar shows decreasing trend and Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka shows an increasing trend in both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In case of temperature, all of the models show an increasing trend over all the BIMSTEC countries in both scenarios, however, the rate of increase is relatively less over Sri Lanka than the other countries. Annual cycles of rainfall and temperature over Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand reveals that the magnitudes are more in 2070 to 2100 of RCP8.5. Inter-model comparison show that there are large more uncertainties within the CMIP5 model projections.",

            "abstract": "Medium range soil moisture drought forecast helps in decision making in the field of agriculture and water resources management. Part of skills in medium range drought forecast comes from precipitation. Proper evaluation and correction of precipitation forecast may improve drought predictions. Here, we evaluate skills of ensemble mean precipitation forecast from Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) for medium range drought predictions over India. Climatological mean (CLIM) of historic data (OBS) are used as reference forecast to evaluate GEFS precipitation forecast. Analysis was conducted based on forecast initiated on 1st and 15th dates of each month for lead up to 7-days. Correlation and RMSE were used to estimate skill scores of accumulated GEFS precipitation forecast from lead 1 to 7-days. Volumetric indices based on the 2X2 contingency table were used to check missed and falsely predicted historic volume of daily precipitation from GEFS in different regions and at different thresholds. GEFS showed improvement in correlation of 0.44 over CLIM during the monsoon season and 0.55 during the winter season. Lower RMSE was showed by GEFS than CLIM. Ratio of RMSE in GEFS and CLIM comes out as 0.82 and 0.4 (perfect skill is at zero) during the monsoon and winter season, respectively. We finally used corrected GEFS forecast to derive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, which was used to develop short-term forecast of hydrologic and agricultural (soil moisture) droughts in India.",

            "abstract": "One of the main controls on the intrusion of magma in continental crust is magma buoyancy, which drives ascent through denser rocks and lateral spreading near the contact with ambient rocks of lesser density. The formation of a sizable magma reservoir involves the deformation of host rocks over large characteristic times due to slow viscous relaxation. During and after emplacement, magmas cool and crystallize, inducing significant variations of density and buoyancy which may have a large impact on reservoir dimensions and shape. Different behaviours are predicted depending on the viscosity contrast between magma and host rock, melt buoyancy and total volume of magma. Laboratory experiments with viscous fluids and numerical calculations that account for brittle and ductile deformation of host rocks illustrate the large number of possibilities for reservoir evolution. The most striking result is obtained with a buoyancy reversal due to cooling and crystallization, such that spreading of the reservoir in the horizontal direction slowly segues into sagging accompanied by lateral shrinking. A large range of reservoir shapes can be produced, including funnel-like bodies and tabular bodies capped, or floored, by a few vertical structures. Many of those have natural equivalents. This work suggests that there may be large differences between fully solidified plutons and intrusions and active magma reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Determination of Antarctica’s ice-sheet mass balance (more correctly, mass imbalance) is of paramount concern due to its impact on global sea levels. Monitoring with satellite remote sensing since the early 1990s has demonstrated that the imbalance has become progressively more negative, with losses dominated by the ocean-forced drawdown of ice from West Antarctica into the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. Recent years have hosted unprecedented study and increased understanding of the ice-ocean processes contributing to Amundsen-Sea losses, leaving ocean-forced ice-dynamical losses to the Bellingshausen Sea relatively neglected. We therefore present here, with the aid of dedicated field data in austral season 2009/2010, a detailed assessment of the mass imbalance of Ferrigno Ice Stream (FIS), the dominant contributor of mass directly to the Bellingshausen Sea. We assess mass imbalance using the input-output method for (i) 1992, and (ii) 2010; the temporal markers being defined by the acquisition of the first comprehensive satellite-velocity coverage and the acquisition of the field measurements respectively. Input by snowfall is estimated using existing maps of Antarctic snow accumulation calibrated with 2010-acquired field data in the form of a 20-m ice core recovered at the upper FIS ice divide and englacial layering across the catchment imaged with 500 MHz over-snow radar. Output by discharge across the grounding line requires measurements of ice velocity and depth across a “flux gate.” In 2010, we obtained flux gate measurements directly from the field using DGPS and 2 MHz over-snow radar, and we also refer to satellite-acquired ice-velocity data (MeASUREs) and airborne-acquired ice depths (Operation IceBridge) acquired at a similar time. Output from 1992 is calculated using 1992-acquired satellite ice-velocities (Rignot, 2006) and ice depth retroactively inferred from the 2010-acquired ice depth corrected for 1992-2010 surface elevation loss. We calculate that in 2010 FIS was losing ice at a rate of 3-4 Gt a-1 to the ocean, which was ~20% greater than in 1992. The difference is almost entirely explicable through accelerated flow across the grounding line, forced by oceanic melting.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we incorporated a groundwater exploitation scheme into the land surface model CLM3.5 to investigate the effects of the anthropogenic exploitation of groundwater on land surface processes in a river basin. Simulations of the Haihe River Basin in northern China were conducted for the years 1965–2000 using the model. A control simulation without exploitation and three exploitation simulations with different water demands derived from socioeconomic data related to the Basin were conducted. The results showed that groundwater exploitation for human activities resulted in increased wetting and cooling effects at the land surface and reduced groundwater storage. A lowering of the groundwater table, increased upper soil moisture, reduced 2 m air temperature, and enhanced latent heat flux were detected by the end of the simulated period, and the changes at the land surface were related linearly to the water demands. To determine the possible responses of the land surface processes in extreme cases (i.e., in which the exploitation process either continued or ceased), additional hypothetical simulations for the coming 200 years with constant climate forcing were conducted, regardless of changes in climate. The simulations revealed that the local groundwater storage on the plains could not contend with high-intensity exploitation for long if the exploitation process continues at the current rate. Changes attributable to groundwater exploitation reached extreme values and then weakened within decades with the depletion of groundwater resources and the exploitation process will therefore cease. However, if exploitation is stopped completely to allow groundwater to recover, drying and warming effects, such as increased temperature, reduced soil moisture, and reduced total runoff, would occur in the Basin within the early decades of the simulation period. The effects of exploitation will then gradually disappear, and the land surface variables will approach the natural state and stabilize at different rates. Simulations were also conducted for cases in which exploitation either continues or ceases using future climate scenario outputs from a general circulation model. The resulting trends were almost the same as those of the simulations with constant climate forcing.",

            "abstract": "Roman aqueducts belong to the greatest engineering structures of the ancient world. Recently, carbonate deposits in the remains of aqueduct bridges and channels were recognized as a new proxy for palaeo-environmental changes. These deposits show similar fabric and lamination characteristics as other types of terrestrial carbonates from caves and rivers such as freshwater tufa, and hot spring deposits like travertine.\nWe present a multi-disciplinary study on calcium carbonate deposits from aqueduct sites in Southern France and Turkey, assisted by monitoring studies at aqueduct water sources in Italy of water composition and recent carbonate growth. The microstructure of the deposits shows considerable variation, even along a single aqueduct, mainly due to different climatic regimes, variations in channel type, aqueduct gradient and water velocity. However, downstream samples of several aqueducts show regular laminations associated with a strong δ18O cyclicity that can be interpreted as an effect of seasonal warming and cooling of water in the aqueduct channel. δ13C isotope curves are more complicated but commonly show antithetic cyclicity to δ18O. Deposits from aqueducts in the eastern Mediterranean, at Aspendos and Patara (Southern Turkey), typically show a regular layering of alternating sparite and micrite, which coincides with δ18O cyclicity. This reflects extreme seasonal cyclicity in temperature and rainfall in southern Turkey. However, deposits from the aqueduct of Cahors (Southern France), have cyclicity in δ18O that shows poor correlation with the microstructure and δ13C. This is probably due to the more variable, less seasonal rainfall patterns in southern France.\nCarbonate deposits from ancient aqueducts can serve as a high-resolution data source of palaeoclimate, and to determine the number of years the aqueducts functioned. Besides a regular lamination, most deposits also show single, distinct layers that can be a proxy for extreme weather events or earthquakes.\n ",

            "abstract": "Large industrial centers on permafrost are characterized by a set of geocryological conditions different from natural environment. Thermal state of foundations on permafrost in areas of economic development depends on climate trends and upon technogenic impacts, such as type of impact, area of facility, permafrost temperature and duration of the technogenic pressure. Technogenic degradation of permafrost is evident in most urban centers on permafrost leading to deterioration of geotechnical environment and particularly foundations of buildings and structures. This situation is exacerbated by climate warming in such cities as Vorkuta, Chita, Nerungry, Salekhard and others where temperature rises at a rate of 0.4 – 1.2 oC/decade over the last 40 years. To evaluate impact of climate warming and technogenic factors on permafrost temperature regime and foundation bearing capacity we compared five facilities in Norilsk, the largest city on permafrost. The facilities were selected to represent different parts of the town, different ages of built-up environment and were located in different permafrost and lithological conditions. We found a leading role of technogenic factors relative to climatic ones in dynamics of thermal state of permafrost in urban environment. Climate warming in Norilsk (0.15 oC/decade) was a small contributor, but gave an additional input to deterioration of geotechnical environment on permafrost. At the same time, implementation of engineering solutions of permafrost temperature cooling (such as crawl spaces) result in lowering of permafrost temperature. Field surveys in Yamburg showed that under some facilities permafrost temperature decreased by 1-1.5 C oC over the last 15 years despite pronounced in the region climate warming of 0.5 oC/decade. This shows that despite deterioration of permafrost conditions in the most Arctic regions due to technogenic pressure and climate warming, implementation of adequate engineering solutions allows stabilization of permafrost thermal regime.",

Using global MHD simulations, we investigate the linkage between the MI phase variation on the ground and the magnetospheric negative response to an IP shock. It is revealed that although the two phenomena occur at largely-separated locations, they are physically related and form a response chain. The velocity disturbances near the flanks of the magnetopause cause the magnetic field to decrease, resulting in a dynamo which thus powers the transient field-aligned currents (FACs). These FACs further generates a pair of ionospheric current vortex, leading to MI variations on the ground. For the first time, we report here the intrinsic physically-related chain response of the magnetospheric - and - ground magnetic field to IP shocks.",

            "abstract": "The characterization and parameterization of both sedimentation and aggregation of volcanic particles is necessary for an accurate description of the sink term in numerical models of tephra dispersal used for the evaluation of tephra hazards. Nonetheless, our understanding of particle fallout in various eruptive and atmospheric conditions is still limited mostly due to the lack of direct observations. A comparative investigation of sedimentation and aggregation of volcanic particles is here presented based on field experiments and numerical simulations. Field experiments are based on detailed observations of particle fallout during Vulcanian explosions and ash emissions at Sakurajima volcano (Japan) on August 3, 2013. Column height was up to about 3 km above sea level and the cloud spread with average velocity of about 7 ms-1 toward southeast direction. Aggregates that fell at a distance of about 4 km from the vent were filmed with a high-speed and high-resolution camera before depositing on collection glasses. In order to preserve and analyze particle aggregates with the Scanning Electron Microscope, collecting glasses were covered with a special adhesive tape. Dedicated trays were also used to collect the depositing tephra at five-minute intervals to investigate both accumulation rate and particle size. CILAS grain size analysis showed that mode of particles deposited on the ground decreased with time from 550 μm to 250 μm at the reference location. Aggregate size ranged between 400 and 900 μm (based on video analysis) and they mostly consist of a single or multiple particles acting as nuclei with diameter between 200 and 800 μm coated with ash particles (<90 μm). Also aggregate size decreased with time during fallout and aggregate typology changed from mostly coated particles to ash clusters. Aggregation significantly affected particle residence time in the spreading cloud by changing the associated settling velocity. Based on numerical constraints, aggregates were thought to be formed within the rising plume or at the corner with the horizontal cloud and within 200 seconds of the onset of the eruption.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions produce turbulent, buoyant jets that contain entrained particles. In these flows, turbulent entrainment of ambient air controls the ultimate rise height and spread of the jet. Volcanic jets are a natural example of these dilute particle-gas systems and the particles they contain can strongly control the dynamics of the bulk flow through the coupling between themselves and the surrounding fluid. The metric for the type of particle-fluid coupling is the Stokes number, St, which measures the timescale for the particles inertia against the timescale for the flow field, typically the overturn time of an eddy. We show that particles that are critically coupled to the flow (St=O(1)) change the turbulent structure of the flow by eddy stretching leading to energy cascades which are anisotropic in the horizontal and vertical directions. Crucially, flows laden with such particles carry considerably more energy in the stream-wise direction than particle-free flows which leads to a decrease in entrainment. This behaviour suggests that turbulent entrainment can effectively be shut down under critical St, giving rise to collapsing fountains whereas particle-free flows under the same source conditions would produce buoyant plumes. Changes in entrainment rates in volcanic jets are also manifested in readily observable features such as the rise height. We may therefore infer entrainment rates and their evolution over the course of an eruption from the maximum height and neutral buoyancy level.",

In this study, a wide angled sky imager (GoPro Hero 2) was brought on board M/Y Vasco to detect and quantity cloud occurrence over sea during the 2nd 7SEAS field campaign. The camera is just a part of a number of scientific instruments used to measure weather, aerosol chemistry and solar radiation among others. The data collection started during the departure from Manila Bay on 05 September 2012 and went on until the end of the cruise (29 September 2012). The camera was placed in a weather-proof box that is then affixed on a steel mast where other instruments are also attached during the cruise. The data has a temporal resolution of 1 minute, and each image is 500x666 pixels in size. Fig. 1a shows the track of the ship during the cruise. The red, blue, hue, saturation, and value of the pixels are analysed for cloud occurrence. A pixel is considered to “contain” thick cloud if it passes all four threshold parameters (R-B, R/B, R-B/R+B, HSV; R is the red pixel color value, blue is the blue pixel color value, and HSV is the hue saturation value of the pixel) and considered thin cloud if it passes two or three parameters. Fig. 1b shows the daily analysis of cloud occurrence. Cloud occurrence here is quantified as the ratio of the pixels with cloud to the total number of pixels in the data image. The average cloud cover for the days included in this dataset is 87%. These measurements show a big contrast when compared to cloud cover over land (Manila Observatory) which is usually around 67%. During the duration of the cruise, only one day (September 6) has an average cloud occurrence below 50%; the rest of the days have averages of 66% or higher – 98% being the highest. This result would then give a general trend of how cloud occurrences over land and over sea differ in the South East Asian region. In this study, these cloud occurrences come from local convection and clouds brought about by Southwest Monsoon winds.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can be generated in the equatorial magnetosphere by an anisotropic temperature distribution (T⊥>T∥) of energetic (10-100 keV) ions. They are typically observed in the afternoon sector with a wide L range (L > 7) and occur near the plasmapause. Thus, it has been suggested that the distribution of EMIC wave occurrence in the afternoon sector is associated with the plasmaspheric expansion (i.e., plasmapsheric bulge or plume). Since the plasmapause is further away the earth during times of low geomagnetic activity, it is expected that EMIC wave’s spatial distribution under quiet geomagnetic conditions could be different from that under averaged geomagnetic conditions. In our study we investigate the spatial distribution of EMIC waves during quiet geomagnetic conditions (Kp ≤ 1) in the outer magnetosphere (L > 7) using the magnetic field data from Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft from 2008 to 2009. We also examine the spatial distribution of cold plasma density estimated from THEMIS spacecraft potential data and compare it with EMIC wave occurrence during quiet geomagnetic conditions.",

The presence of type III bursts allows particles detected in situ to be traced back to their associated solar events. This includes high energy ions which are nearly always accompanied by low energy electrons that generate type III bursts. By examining hundreds of type III radio bursts observed by the WAVES instrument on WIND that accompany energetic particle increases, a number of insights into the origins of these particle increases and particle propagation have been obtained and will be discussed. These insights include the presence of flare particles in the majority of particle events and the existence of cross-field transport in the interplanetary medium. A new result is that there are small Fe-rich increases observed by the EPACT instrument on WIND that are not associated with co-temporal flares (i.e., there are no accompanying type III bursts) meaning that the association rate of Fe-rich \"impulsive\" events with coronal mass ejections is more than 90%.",

            "abstract": "The surface mass balance of mountain glaciers is a valuable indicator of climate change. Globally coordinated monitoring efforts have contributed to a comprehensive set of time series documenting variations in glacier-wide mass balance for about a hundred glaciers. However, only few series are longer than twenty years and even less start before the 1980s. Glaciers in the European Alps are most densely covered with mass balance records. However, given the strong differences in the response of individual glaciers as well as the partly poor representativeness of some series for their respective region, more direct information on mass balance variability is required even in the Alps. Furthermore, only a small fraction of the records yields seasonal mass budget components which are of eminent importance for understanding glacier response to shifts in climatic forcing throughout the 20th century. In this study, we present ten new long-term series of glacier-wide seasonal mass balance for glaciers in the Swiss Alps partly starting in the 1950s and continued until today. Previously unpublished and unevaluated measurements of point winter and summer balance form the base of these records. Data was compiled from old archives and from various sources. Most of the in-situ measurements were not intended as full monitoring programs which might explain that these highly valuable data sets were not consistently evaluated so far and were thus unavailable to the scientific community.\nUsing a new technique employing modelling for spatial extrapolation and homogenization of the seasonal point measurements we infer continuous series of area-averaged mass balance. The results are validated against independent decadal ice volume changes from photogrammetric surveys. Five of the new seasonal mass balance series cover more than 50 years and add a substantial amount of information on the dynamics of regional glacier mass change. This will strengthen the worldwide data collection on glacier monitoring, especially during the data-sparse period before the 1980s which is characterized by notable regime changes. We compare our results to existing long-term series and present an updated assessment of mass balance variability and sensitivity throughout the European Alps in connection with external drivers.",

The advance of recent magnetic satellite missions like SWARM and its predecessors like CHAMP offer high resolution measurements while providing a full global coverage. This deserves expansion of the theoretical framework of harmonic synthesis to magnetic gradient tensor components. \nMeasurement setups for Full Tensor Magnetic Gradiometry equipped with high sensitive gradiometers like the JeSSY STAR system can directly measure the gradient tensor components, which requires precise knowledge about the background regional gradients which can be calculated with this extension. In this study we develop the theoretical framework for calculation of the magnetic gradient tensor components from the harmonic series expansion and apply our approach to the IGRF and HDGM. The gradient tensor component maps for entire Earth’s surface produced for the IGRF show low gradients reflecting the variation from the dipolar character, whereas maps for the HDGM (up to degree N=729) reveal new information about crustal structure, especially across the oceans, and deeply situated ore bodies. From the gradient tensor components, the rotational invariants, the Eigenvalues, and the normalized source strength (NSS) are calculated. The NSS focuses on shallower and stronger anomalies. Euler deconvolution using either the tensor components or the NSS applied to the HDGM reveals an estimate of the average source depth for the entire magnetic crust as well as individual plutons and ore bodies. The NSS reveals the boundaries between the anomalies of major continental provinces like southern Africa or the Eastern European Craton.",

            "abstract": "In multiscale systems, scale separation is a major challenge in many industrial applications. The resulting complexity was, in the beginning, dealt with using phenomenological models and macroscopic approaches. Improvements in upscaling methods then allowed deriving macroscopic models from micro-scale transport models, greatly improving the understanding of experimentally observed phenomena. However, the investigation of many problems involving highly nonlinear phenomena (e.g. high-temperature heat transfer, chemistry, high-concentration mass transfer, etc.) remains out of the reach of current upscaling methods, even though the associated physics can be described with reasonable accuracy at the microscopic scale, mainly because the effects of nonlinearity can often not be fully passed from the microscopic scale to the macroscopic one without knowing the state of the medium at the microscopic scale.\nFrom this observation comes the idea of using a multiscale approach to investigate problems requiring exchange of information between scales. While in upscaling, information goes from the micro-scale to the macro-scale, downscaling does the opposite and allows the reconstruction of information in a limited region of the micro-scale, based on macro-scale information. Used together, upscaling and downscaling allow the exchange of information between both scales. This multiscale approach facilitates the investigation of highly nonlinear problems or that of cases with evolving micro-geometry.\nThis presentation first aims at showing the relevance of a multiscale approach for transport in porous media and shows promising results yielded by the downscaling methodology for nonlinear heat transfer.",

            "abstract": "Observation of cliff erosion are often limited to relatively short timescales (a few decades), which are within the timeframe of anthropogenic modification of the coast and may be shorter than the recurrence interval for erosion events. Here we present long-term (centennial-millennial) averaged rates of sea cliff retreat for chalk cliffs in SE England derived from cosmogenic isotopes and coastal morphology. We determine long-term rates of sea cliff erosion from 10Be measured from in situ flint samples collected from three transects across the coastal platform in East Sussex. A numerical model of 10Be accumulation on an evolving coastal profile allows estimation of cliff retreat rate averaged over several hundred years. The model accounts for variation in 10Be accumulation with tides and sea-level rise, and takes into account platform downwear and topographic shielding by adjacent cliffs. Additionally, we use high-resolution (1m) multibeam bathymetry to map the extent of the coastal platform based on the surface texture in order to infer the position of the coast at ~8 ka. The difference in position to the current coastline provides estimates of Holocene-averaged rates of cliff erosion for all chalk cliffed coastline in the region. Comparison to historic records of cliff retreat reveals key similarities and differences between long and short-term signals. In certain locations, there are significant discrepancies (either faster or slower) between historic records and long-term rates of retreat. Each type of discrepancy may be the result of human interaction with the coastal environment, whether that interaction is local or non-local, and it is worthwhile noting that sites of relatively low historic rates of erosion are likely subject to high-magnitude, low-frequency failure events that could have devastating effects on human lives and infrastructure in areas that are considered to be low risk.",

Building on this idea, we developed a new approach to investigate new particle formation in vertical direction using high time-resolution measurements at the ground level alone. The coefficient of variation (CV), i.e., the ratios of standard deviation to mean for number concentration and geometric mean diameter of <100 nm particles (N100, GMD100) in every 30s, is introduced as an indicator to identify horizontal particle transport from vertical particle transport. We first examine the typical ranges of CVs for horizontal and vertical transport of particles, respectively, using the measurement conducted in the summer of 2007 at a semi-urban site in Toronto, Canada. We found that the CVs associated with horizontal transport of particles were 2-10 times smaller than those associated with vertical transport of particles. Thus, we assumed that 1) the higher CVs reflect higher contribution from vertical transport; 2) the lower CVs reflect higher contribution from horizontal transport. We then calculate the N100, GMD55 (GMD of <55 nm particles) and GMD100 corresponding to 5% maximum and 5% minimum CVs for N100 in five NPF events, respectively. Our results inferred that the growth rates of new particles at ground level were 0-30% larger than that at height. The formation rates of new particles at ground level were 0-30% larger than those that at height, except one event in which the formation rate at ground level was 20% lower than that aloft. However, the size of the cases used in this study was small and the findings need more data to further confirm.",

Continuous seismic recordings are transmitted in real-time to the INGV, where we set up an automatic procedure that produces high-resolution earthquakes catalogues (location, magnitudes, 1st motion polarities) in near-real-time.\nA sensitive event detection engine running on the continuous data stream is followed by advanced phase identification, arrival-time picking, and quality assessment algorithms (MPX). Pick weights are determined from a statistical analysis of a set of predictors designed to correctly apply an a-priori chosen weighting scheme.\nThe MPX results are used to routinely update earthquakes catalogues based on a variety of (1D and 3D) velocity models and location techniques.\nWe are also applying the DD-RT procedure which uses cross-correlation and double-difference methods in real-time to relocate events with high precision relative to a high-resolution background catalog. P- and S-onset and location information are used to automatically compute focal mechanisms, VP/VS variations in space and time, and periodically update 3D VP and VP/VS tomographic models.\nWe present results from four years of operation, during which this monitoring system analyzed over 1.2 million detections and recovered ~60,000 earthquakes at a detection threshold of ML 0.5.\nThe high-resolution information is being used to study changes in seismicity patterns and fault and rock properties along the ATF in space and time, and to elaborate ground shaking scenarios adopting diverse slip distributions and rupture directivity models.",

            "abstract": "Meso-scale atmospheric circulations play important role in air pollution transport and local air quality issues. Rapid industrialization and urbanization are leading to increased air pollution. In most of the metro cities, it is necessary to find the dispersion and ground level concentration (GLCs) of the pollutants emitted from the industries. In the present study AERMOD model has been used for simulation of pollutant dispersion over Nagpur, India. This model requires surface and upper air meteorological observations and various PBL parameters with good temporal resolution in the stand alone mode and mostly not available over India. To fill this gap, in the present study uses WRF-ARW model in getting these boundary layer parameters then will be offline coupled with AERMOD dispersion model. In the study we modified a pre-processor coupler for offline these models. High resolution simulations are conducted with triple nested domains having horizontal resolution of 27, 9 and 3 km; 27 vertical levels by using the 1x1 degree NCEP Final Analysis meteorological fields for initial and boundary conditions. In the study, eight fair weather days in winter and pre-monsoon season (January and April 2009). Sensitivity experiments of WRF-ARW model are conducted with two non-local [Yonsei University (YSU), Asymmetric Convective Model version 2 (ACM2)] and three local turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) closure [Mellor- Yamada Nakanishi and Niino Level 2.5 PBL (MYNN2), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), and quasi-normal scale elimination (QNSE)] turbulence diffusion parameterizations to study the evolution of PBL parameters and thermodynamic structure during the study period for providing the better meteorological parameters to AERMOD model. Sensitivity studies of PBL parameterization schemes after validation and statistical analysis reveal that the non-local PBL scheme YSU and local scheme MYJ could capture the characteristic variations of surface meteorological variables, vertical atmospheric structure as seen in observations. These simulations are coupled with AERMOD model is employed to evaluate the dispersion of NOX. After validating with monitored air quality data it is found that the integrated model with YSU followed by MYJ schemes performed better.\nKeywords: WRF, AERMOD, Dispersion, Planetary Boundary Layer",

            "abstract": "The Qaidam Basin is located in the NE Tibetan Plateau, and trapped by the Altyn Tagh Fault system to the northwest, the Qilian Mts. to the northeast and the East Kunlun Mts. – Qiman Tagh to the south. It forms one of the driest regions on earth with severe wind erosion since ca. 3.0 Ma (Heermance et al., 2013).\nWhether the Qaidam Basin is one of the major sources of the Chinese Loess Plateau is still debating: study on U-Pb ages of zircon crystals favored the positive answer (Pullen et al., 2011), whereas chemical and mineralogical analysis (Sun, 2002), together with observation on dust storms over the past 50 years (Sun et al., 2001), preferred the negative one. Kapp et al. (2011) reconciled the two contrasting viewpoints by numerical modeling based on the assumption that the Qaidam Basin underwent strong wind erosion during glacial periods but weak wind erosion even fluvial deposition during interglacial periods. However, no geological evidences have been found to back up the assumption. In this contribution, we reported geological evidence indicating that alternating wind erosion and fluvial deposition do exist in the western Qaidam Basin. The evidence consists of an isolated alluvial fan overlying old yardangs forming prior to the fan. The fan, as well as the underlying old yardangs, is now tens of meters higher than adjacent area which is full of young yardangs, suggesting that the fan was deposited between the two wind erosion events. We obtained high resolution (<10cm) DEM data of the fan and adjacent area by terrestrial LiDAR scanning and the age of the fan by 10Be exposure dating (test in process). We will use the results to calculate the long-term wind erosion rate in the Qaidam Basin, which is the first wind erosion rate obtained from accurate geological evidence. We believe that the result is significant to evaluate the impact of wind erosion on folding inside the basin, and of the global glacial – interglacial cycles on surface processes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.\n",

            "abstract": "We present recent findings on tsunami hazards in the Makran subduction zone (MSZ), NW Indian Ocean, based on the results of tsunami source analyses for two Makran tsunamis of 1945 and 2013. A re-analysis of the source of the 27 November 1945 tsunami in the MSZ showed that the slip needs to be extended to deep waters around the depth contour of 3000 m in order to reproduce the observed tide gauge waveforms at Karachi and Mumbai. On the other hand, coastal uplift report at Ormara (Pakistan) implies that the source fault needs to be extended inland. In comparison to other existing fault models, our fault model is longer and includes a heterogeneous slip with larger maximum slip. The recent tsunami on 24 September 2013 in the Makran region was triggered by an inland Mw 7.7 earthquake. While the main shock and all aftershocks were located inland, a tsunami with a dominant period of around 12 min was recorded on tide gauges and a DART station. We examined different possible sources for this tsunami including a mud volcano, a mud/shale diapir, and a landslide/slump through numerical modeling. Only a submarine slump with a source dimension of 10-15 km and a thickness of around 100 m, located 60-70 km offshore Jiwani (Pakistan) at the water depth of around 2000m, was able to reasonably reproduce the observed tsunami waveforms. In terms of tsunami hazards, analyses of the two tsunamis provide new insights: 1) large runup heights can be generated in the coastal areas due to slip in deep waters, and 2) even an inland earthquake may generate tsunamigenic submarine landslides.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric partitioning between gas and condensed phase of organic molecules is poorly understood, and discrepancies exist between predicted and observed concentrations of secondary organic aerosols. A key problem is the lack of information about thermodynamic properties of semi- and low volatile organic molecules.\nSaturation vapor pressure and the associated temperature dependence (dH) are key parameters for improving predictive atmospheric models. In this work we combine experiments and thermodynamic modeling to investigate these parameters for a series of polyols, so-called sugar alcohols. These polyols are common in the water soluble fraction of atmospheric aerosols.\nIn our experimental system sub-micron particles are generated by nebulization from aqueous solution, and a mono disperse fraction of the aerosol is selected using a differential mobility analyzer. The particles are allowed to evaporate in a laminar flow reactor, and changes in particle size as function of evaporation time are determined using a scanning mobility particle sizer system. In this work saturation vapor pressures of sugar alcohols at several temperatures have been inferred from such measurements using thermodynamic modeling. Results are presented and discussed in context of atmospheric gas to particle partitioning.",

            "abstract": "Many northern hemisphere climate records, particularly those from around the North Atlantic, show a series of rapid climate changes that recurred on centennial to millennial timescales throughout most of the last glacial period. These Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) sequences are observed most prominently in Greenland ice cores, although they have a global signature, including an out of phase Antarctic signal. They consist of warming jumps of order 10°C, occurring in typically 40 years, followed generally by a slow cooling (Greenland Interstadial, GI) lasting between a few centuries and a few millennia, and then a final rapid temperature drop into a cold Greenland Stadial (GS) that lasts for a similar period.\nThe most distinctive feature of D-O cycles is the rapid warming event, often attributed to a sudden change in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Recent work has suggested that AMOC is most easily disrupted by freshwater delivered through the Arctic. We suggest that the proposed AMOC changes may have occurred as part of a natural oscillation, in which runoff from the Laurentide ice sheet into the Arctic is controlled by temperature around the North Atlantic. The Arctic buffers the salinity changes, but under warm conditions, high runoff eventually leads to water entering the North Atlantic with low enough salinity to switch AMOC into its weaker state. Under the colder conditions now prevailing, the Arctic is starved of runoff, and the salinity rises until a further switch occurs. Contrary to many previous studies, this mechanism does not require large freshwater pulses to the North Atlantic. Instead, steady changes in ice-sheet runoff, driven by the AMOC, lead to a naturally arising oscillator, in which the rapid warmings come about because the Arctic Ocean is starved of freshwater. The changing size of the ice sheets would have affected the magnitude and extent of runoff, and we suggest that this may provide a simple explanation for the absence of the events during interglacials and around the time of glacial maxima. Heinrich events, delivering additional freshwater into the Atlantic during a Greenland stadial, play no direct role in this mechanism, but would serve to delay the switch to faster AMOC.",

            "abstract": "The onshore Otway Basin is dominated by normal faults and only minimal strike-slip faulting has been reported. The basin is part of the NW-striking, passive margin that records the break-up of Gondwana and the Antarctic-Australian separation between Late Jurassic and Miocene times. From a 3D seismic cube (ca. 8 km x 7 km x 4 km depth) around the CO2CRC Otway site in SE Australia, we interpreted eight major, Cretaceous and Tertiary stratigraphic horizons (all syn-rift) and over 24 major normal faults.\nDetailed analysis of the fault system in our 3D geological model shows that the area is characterised by southwest-dipping, normal faults that have a listric character in the SW and planar character in the NE. North-dipping, antithetic faults developed secondarily due to movement on the major faults. Syn-sedimentary movement caused fourfold strata thicknesses in the hanging-wall of the faults. Fault offset increases towards the south; up to 800 m in the lower stratigraphy. Most faults, however, die out before the Eocene.\nUsing different techniques we determined that 60% the major faults didn't move in a pure dip-slip fashion, rather the movement contained a component of dextral strike-slip. In particular, juxtaposition maps of the stratigraphic horizons on the fault surfaces shows that in the obliquely-displaced faults the tip-lines of the faults are extremely asymmetric, with one flatly-dipping tip-line and one steep, overturned tip-line. Dip-slip faults demonstrate symmetrical convergence of the tip-lines. However faults with different kinematics are not grouped, but heterogeneously distributed over the model, suggesting strain-partitioning took place. This evidences that faults react differently when the stress field in the passive margin changes direction, but in a way that suggests that they are interacting.",

            "abstract": "The impact of heterogeneity in chemical transport and reaction is not understood in continuum (Darcy/Fickian) models of reactive transport. This is manifested in well-known problems such as scale dependent dispersion and discrepancies in reaction rate observations made at laboratory and field scales [1]. Additionally, this is a source of uncertainty for carbon dioxide injection, which produces a reactive fluid-rock system particularly in carbonate rock reservoirs. A potential cause is the inability of the continuum approach to incorporate the impact of heterogeneity in pore-scale reaction rates. This results in part from pore-scale heterogeneities in surface area of reactive minerals [2, 3].\nWe use x-ray micro tomography to describe the non-normal 3-dimensional distribution of reactive surface area within a porous medium according to distinct mineral groups. Using in-house image processing techniques, thin sections, nitrogen BET surface area, backscattered electron imaging and energy dispersive spectroscopy, we compare the surface area of each mineral phase to those obtained from x-ray CT imagery. In all samples, there is little correlation between the reactive surface area fraction and the volumetric fraction of a mineral in a bulk rock. Berea sandstone was far less heterogeneous and has a characteristic pore size at which a surface area distribution may be used to quantify heterogeneity. In carbonates, heterogeneity is more complex and surface area must be characterized at multiple length scales for an accurate description of reactive transport.\nWe combine the mineral specific surface area characterisation to dynamic tomography, imaging the flow of water and solutes, to observe flow dependent and mineral specific adsorption. The observations may contribute to the incorporation of experimentally based statistical descriptions of pore scale heterogeneity in reactive transport into upscaled models, moving it closer to predictive capabilities for field scale processes.\n",

            "abstract": "Foliations in metapelites belong to the most important tools in structural geology to reconstruct deformation history and kinematics. Since foliations are easily developed and are hard to destroy, multiple foliations, associated with other structures such as folds and boudins, serve as a basis in reconstructing the tectonic history of all metamorphic terrains. Traditionally, such reconstructions assume regionally homogeneous tectonic effects producing distinct generations of structures, which are then labelled D1, D2, D3 etc.\nThe Goantagab Domain in NW Namibia consists of Neoproterozoic pelitic and psammitic metaturbidites with only minor changes in facies, exposed over an area of 80x40km. The rocks were deformed in a transpressive Neoproterozoic to Cambrian tectonic event during the amalgamation of Gondwanaland. Five overprinting foliations can be recognised in the area, but only three are recognisable at any location and no foliation extends over the entire area. Apparently, small variations in kinematic vorticity and other kinematic parameters and in orientation of incremental strain axes lead to local foliation development and to gradients in foliation style. The similarity in field and microstructure of the different foliations, and gradations in their development make a classical approach using D1-D2-D3 labelling problematic. Since the fieldwork area is very well exposed, it is possible to determine which factors lead to local development and destruction of foliations during ongoing ductile deformation. Detailed analysis of the local foliation architecture and history is used to explore new methods in structural geology to handle complex multiple foliations in metamorphic terrains",

            "abstract": "Cold and dense Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is an important component of the global overturning circulation. The majority of AABW forms in three discrete locations around the Antarctic continent, the Weddell Sea (Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean), the Ross Sea (Pacific sector), and the Adélie Depression (~142-145°E, ~66-67°S; Indian sector). Adélie Land Bottom Water (ALBW) is formed as dense shelf waters beneath coastal polynyas, and periodically overspills and is exported to the abyssal ocean. Previous work suggested that this particular water mass not only carries characteristic hydrographic properties, but that it may also carry a distinct radiogenic isotope composition, which would allow tracing local bottom water formation back in time.\nWe here present new results for the Nd isotope composition and concentration of seawater collected during the GIPY6 voyage from Tasmania (Australia) to the Adélie Depression (Antarctica) (SR3 CASO-GEOTRACES transect; March-April 2008). A total of four seawater profiles were sampled at four depths each across the Southern Ocean (48 to 65.5°S) along the 140°E meridian. Seawater was filtered and acidified aboard the Aurora Australis, and analysed back in the home laboratory using pre-concentration on C18 cartridges, 2 stage ion chromatography and NdO+ analysis by TIMS.\nResults confirm a rather homogenous isotopic composition of Circumpolar Deep Waters (eNd = -8.2 to -9.0), but a distinct isotopic fingerprint of ALBW (eNd = -9.3 to -10.5). ALBW contributes up to 2 Sverdrup of AABW annually, and cold temperatures and relatively high oxygen and CFC-rich contents of this water mass correlate with rather negative Nd isotopic compositions. Absolute values are more than two epsilon units lower than the ones observed in Ross Sea bottom water, supporting the idea that the proximity of the old Adélie craton facilitates the formation of a particularly unradiogenic variety of AABW.",

            "abstract": "Mineralogical and petrological changes in subduction zones include transition from altered hydrated rocks (mostly serpentinites) to anhydrous peridotites with the release of fluid. Changes in the valence of iron and other ions capable for electron-exchanges remain poorly constrained during this transition.\nThe approach of this work comprises thermodynamic modeling and experiments based on the use of a piston-cylinder apparatus. We show a series of experiments with the range of temperatures from 550 to 850oC at pressure of 2 GPa, which perform the antigorite dehydration reaction using Fe-bearing antigorite and magnetite as starting material. The experimentally produced mineral phases have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES at the iron K-edge). At each step of serpentinite dehydration reaction we provide the modal abundance of minerals, the amount of releasing water, the chemical compositions of phases and the Fe-oxidation state.\nThe modal abundance of experimental product assemblage changes gradually. Thus, antigorite dominates untill 650 oC and it fully dehydrates after 700 oC. Olivine and enstatite are the most prevailing phases at higher temperatures. However, chlorite, diopside and tremolite are observed during the reaction. Furthermore, olivine and antigorite have been found to change their iron content depending on temperature, which is in consistent with thermodynamic modeling accomplished in the present study.\nAs the reaction progress with the increase of temperature, evolution of iron oxidation state changes. Antigorite containing mostly Fe3+ releases water and breaks down into olivine and enstatite containing Fe2+. The bulk Fe3+/Fetotal ratio decreases rapidly during first steps of the reaction and continue decreasing after antigorite disappearance. In our results we have showed the analyses of Fe valence state in both bulk rocks and separate minerals.\nCharacterizing the evolution of elements’ valence states and dehydration reactions deduce the processes occurring in the subduction zones, such as ore-forming fluids.",

Elevated SO2 emissions from southern East Asia (India, southern China) were detected in the outflow of the Asian Summer Monsoon over the Arabic Sea. Transport and dispersion model simulations and satellite imagery indicate that the polluted air was uplifted by convection close to the Himalayas and in the Gulf of Bengal. The vertical transport of emissions from northern East Asia (Japan, northern China, Korea) occurred in warm conveyor belts associated with cyclones in the northwestern Pacific. The pollution layers observed extent from about 8 km altitude up to 3 km above the thermal tropopause. Simultaneous SO2 and aerosol measurements indicate efficient SO2 conversion to sulfate aerosol during the horizontal transport in the tropopause region to Europe and the Arctic. Implications of the enhanced SO2 and sulfate aerosol in the tropopause region will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The lithosphere of North China Craton (NCC) has undergone significant thinning since the Mesozoic. However, it still remains unclear about the geodynamic causes of the destruction of NCC as well as the patterns of lithospheric deformation. Here we use both ambient noise and earthquake surface wave data from a dense array (with about 200 stations) to investigate the lithospheric structure and azimuthal anisotropy in NCC. Since surface wave tomography can better reveal depth-dependent anisotropy (Yao et al., 2010), it provides essential constraints on deformation patterns at depths and evolution history of the crust and upper mantle in NCC.\nAt short and intermediate periods (e.g., T < 50s), we perform ray-based eikonal tomography (Lin et al., 2009) using phase traveltimes from both ambient noise (T = 5 – 40 s) and earthquake surface wave data (T = 20 – 50 s) since the effect of finite frequency is not very important. However, at long period (T > 50s), the finite frequency effect of surface wave propagation is no longer negligible, therefore we perform Helmholtz tomography (Lin & Ritzwoller, 2011) for earthquake surface wave data with both phase and amplitude information used in the tomography.\nApparent depth-varying azimuthal anisotropy is observed in NCC with very different fast directions in the upper crust and uppermost mantle. Both upper crust and uppermost mantle in NCC exhibit strong azimuthal anisotropy, while much weaker azimuthal anisotropy but strong radial anisotropy (Cheng et al., 2013) exists in the middle-to-lower crust. The fast polarization axes in the upper crust seem to be controlled by the orientations of major fault systems and strikes of mountains and rifts. Deformation of the middle and lower crust is probably affected by the extension and destruction of NCC in late Mesozoic. The fast axes in the upper mantle, as inferred from surface wave tomography and shear wave splitting, seem to be consistent with the absolute plated motion. These results will help us better understand the patterns of deformation in the crust and upper mantle in NCC as well as the causes of the destruction of NCC.",

Consistency in the upper stratosphere, middle stratosphere and lower stratosphere has been examined through the comparison of (a) the monthly zonal mean time series and (b) the monthly zonal mean anomalies based on latitudinal zones (60S-30S), (0-30S), (0-30N), and (30N-60N).\nFor the 8-year overlap period, it has been found that the averages and standard deviations of the differences in monthly zonal mean partial column ozone vary between -1.0% to 2.3% and 0.9% to 2.9% respectively, depending on the latitude band. The differences in monthly zonal mean anomalies also show very good agreement, with standard deviations of less than 1%. The only exception is in the upper stratosphere where the corresponding standard deviations range between 1.6% and 2.1%.\nResults of additional studies will be shown to illustrate further improvement in the agreement between OMI and MLS, after deriving the OMI monthly zonal mean using homogeneous cross-track pixels to avoid the effects due to Row Anomaly which has become significant since January 2009.",

We present the strategy and methods implemented at the Euro-Med Seismological Centre (EMSC) to rapidly collect in-situ observations on earthquake effects from eyewitnesses for reducing uncertainties of rapid earthquake impact assessment. It comprises crowdsourced information (online questionnaires, pics) as well as information derived from real time analysis of web traffic (flashourcing technique), and more recently deployment of QCN (Quake Catcher Network) low cost sensors. We underline the importance of merging results of different methods to improve performances and reliability of collected data.We try to better understand and respond to public demands and expectations after earthquakes through improved information services and diversification of information tools (social networks, smartphone app., browsers adds-on…), which, in turn, drive more eyewitnesses to our services and improve data collection.

            "abstract": "The meteoroid fluence at Mars during the passage of comet C/2013 A1 is predicted by Moorhead et al. (Icarus, 2014) to be 3 - 4 orders of magnitude higher than the sporadic background over a period of about 5400 s. We have applied a Chemical Meteoroid Ablation Model (CABMOD) to explore the impacts of this huge perturbation. Sporadic meteoroids enter the Martian atmosphere at low speeds (< 14 km s-1), which results in incomplete ablation around 75 km and small levels of ionization. In contrast, the Siding Spring particles will enter at 56 km s-1 and completely ablate around 100 km. Most of the ablated metal atoms from the cometary particles will ionize through hyperthermal collisions with CO2 molecules, leading to an enhancement of the electron density around 100 km by a factor of at least 500 which should be easily observable by radio occultation.\nThe major meteoric metals - Fe and Mg - have emission lines falling within the wavelength range of MAVEN’s Imaging UV spectrometer. We have estimated the dayglow intensities of these species by scaling the dayglow radiances measured by terrestrial satellite spectrometers to the reduced solar irradiance at Mars, and using metal atom and ion concentration profiles in the Martian atmosphere from our 1D model (Whalley and Plane, Faraday Disc. 2010). The background intensities of Mg+ (280 nm), Mg (285 nm), Fe (248 nm) and Fe+ (260 nm) are then predicted to be 16.3, 2.5, 1.9 and 0.9 kR, respectively. These atomic lines should be readily observable against the strong molecular emissions from CO (185 and 270 nm) and CO2+ (280 - 300 nm), even before the cometary input produces patches of dayglow orders of magnitude higher in intensity. The conversion of the cometary metal ions into neutral atoms should occur on a timescale of around 10 minutes because of the elevated electron densities, so time-resolved measurements of these emissions would provide a unique test of the chemistry of the lower ionosphere.\nFinally, the cometary metal vapors will recondense into meteor smoke particles. We will explore the role of these particles in condensing CO2 ice clouds in the Martian atmosphere, using results from a novel laboratory ion-trap experiment in which the nucleation and growth of CO2 on nm-sized iron oxide and silicate particles has been observed for the first time.",

            "abstract": "A carbon sequestration strategy was recently proposed in which a forest is sustainably managed, and a fraction of the wood is selectively harvested and stored to prevent decomposition under anaerobic, dry or cold conditions. Because a large flux of CO2 is constantly assimilated into the world’s forests via photosynthesis, partially cutting off its return pathway to the atmosphere forms an effective carbon sink. The live trees serve as a ‘carbon scrubber’ or ‘carbon remover’ that provides continuous sequestration. The stored wood is a semi-permanent carbon sink, but also serves as a ‘biomass/bioenergy reserve’ that could be utilized in the future if deemed more beneficial, for instance, by contributing to supply infrastructure for biomass power generation.\nBased on global forest coarse wood production rate, land availability, conservation, other wood use, and other practical constraints, we estimate a carbon sequestration potential for wood harvest and storage (WHS) 1-3 GtC y-1. The implementation of such a scheme at our estimated lower value of 1 GtC y-1 would imply a doubling of the current world wood harvest rate. This can be achieved by harvesting wood at a modest harvesting intensity of 1.2 tC ha-1 y-1, over a forest area of 8 Mkm2 (800 Mha). To achieve the higher value of 3 GtC y-1, forests need to be managed this way on half of the world’s forested land, or on a smaller area but with higher harvest intensity. However, any successful implementation strategy will need to balance the needs of the local community and environment. It nonethelss provides a novel new addition to a portfolio of existing forest management strategies. We propose ‘carbon sequestration and biomass farms’ with mixed land use for carbon, energy, agriculture, as well as conservation, provided that governance issues are properly dealt with. In another example, the forests damaged by insects, fire, storms such as in the America West could be thinned to reduce fire danger and harvested for carbon sequestration.\nBased on forestry data, We estimate a cost of $10-50/tCO2 for harvest and storage around the landing site. The technique is low tech, distributed, easy to monitor and verify. We compare the potential and cost of WHS with a number of other carbon sequestration methods, and recommend research into WHS as a 'down-to-earth' strategy for climate mitigation.",

Enceladus’ physical rotational libration, a periodic wobble superposed upon its synchronous rotation and driven by the torques resulting from the satellite’s slightly elliptical orbit, provides a means of constraining the interior structure. We use stereogrammetric solutions of control points of Enceladus in Cassini images to test rotation states, calculating the change in the control-point model’s goodness of fit as we vary the predicted physical libration amplitude, and thus constraining Enceladus’ moments of inertia. Our analysis of over 5300 measurements in 340 images indicates a physical libration amplitude of 0.11 deg. This libration amplitude is not consistent with a solid hydrostatic body (for which the amplitude should be about 0.04 deg), but would be consistent with some versions of recent models incorporating global subsurface oceans or non-hydrostatic cores. We will report on our continuing analysis and on the consistency of interior models with the observed physical libration.\n",

            "abstract": "The overall morphology and dynamics of magnetospheric substorms is well established in terms of observed qualitative auroral features and signatures seen in ground based magnetometers. The detailed evolution of a given substorm is captured by typically ~100 ground based magnetometer observations and this work seeks to synthesise all these observations in a quantitative manner. We present the first analysis of the full available set of ground based magnetometer observations of substorms using dynamical networks. SuperMAG offers a database containing ground station magnetometer data at a cadence of 1min from 100s stations situated across the globe. We use this data to form dynamic networks which capture spatial dynamics on timescales from the fast reconfiguration seen in the aurora, to that of the substorm cycle. Windowed linear cross-correlation between pairs of magnetometer time series along with a threshold is used to determine which stations are correlated and hence connected in the network. Variations in ground conductivity and differences in the response functions of magnetometers at individual stations are overcome by normalizing to long term averages of the cross-correlation. These results are tested against surrogate data in which phases have been randomised. The network is then a collection of connected points (ground stations); the structure of the network and its variation as a function of time quantify the detailed dynamical processes of the substorm. The network properties can be captured quantitatively in time dependent dimensionless network parameters and we will discuss their behaviour for examples of ‘typical’ substorms and storms. The network parameters provide a detailed benchmark to compare data with models of substorm dynamics, and can provide new insights on the similarities and differences between substorms and how they correlate with external driving and the internal state of the magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "It is generally believed that compositional convection driven by inner core solidification is the main driver of the geodynamo. Thermal evolution considerations make it likely that compositional convection is also behind the present dynamos of Mercury and Ganymede as well as the early dynamos in the Moon, Mars and smaller solar system bodies. Compositional buoyancy can arise in several different ways, for example, through inner core solidification and FeS flotation with upward mixing and through freezing out and sinking of iron snow near the core-mantle boundary or deeper within the core. The mode of core cooling and freezing depends on conditions of temperature and pressure in the core and the concentration of light elements such as sulfur. Different distributions of compositional buoyancy will give rise to different patterns of core convection and dynamo magnetic fields. We report here the first results of a systematic study of the distribution of compositional buoyancy on the dynamo-generated magnetic fields, with an emphasis on Mars’ core evolution due to iron rain.",

            "abstract": "Despite intensive research over the last 20 years, a number of major research questions remain concerning the sources and properties of road traffic-generated particulate matter. There are major knowledge gaps concerning the composition of primary vehicle exhaust aerosol, and its contribution to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. These uncertainties relate especially to the semi-volatile component of the particles. Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOC) are compounds which partition directly between the gas and aerosol phases under ambient conditions, and include compounds with saturation concentrations roughly between 0.1 and 104 µg m-3. The SVOC in engine exhaust are typically hydrocarbons in the C15-C35 range. They are largely uncharacterised, other than the n-alkanes, because they are unresolved by traditional gas chromatography and form a large hump in the chromatogram referred to as Unresolved Complex Mixture (UCM).\nIn this study, samples were collected from the exhaust of a diesel engine with and without abatement devices fitted. Engine exhaust was diluted with air and collected using both filter and impaction (MOUDI), to resolve total mass and size resolved mass respectively. Particle size distribution was evaluated by sampling simultaneously with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS). 2D Gas-Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass-Spectrometry (GC×GC-ToF-MS) was exploited to characterise and quantify the composition of SVOC from the exhaust emission. The SVOC was observed to contain predominantly n-alkanes, alkyl-cyclohexanes and aromatics; similar to both fresh lubricating oil and fuel. Preliminary results indicate that the contribution of diesel fuel to the exhaust SVOC composition is dominant at high speeds, and a more pronounced contribution from lubricating oil is observed at low speeds. Differences were also observed in the SVOC composition when using different fuel types, engine lubricants, starting temperatures and collecting samples with and without abatement devices fitted. The wealth of compounds identified and quantified in the C15-C35 range included PAH, esters, carboxylic acids, alkanes, alkenes, alcohols and hopanes.",

It also acts as a crossroad for mode and intermediate water masses such as the South Equatorial Countercurrent (SECC) transporting water masses originating from higher latitudes. The SECC flows above the main thermocline and strongly interacts with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). To constrain changes in sea-surface and subsurface water mass dynamics affecting thermocline depth, we reconstruct SST, subSST and salinity conditions using combined δ18O and Mg/Ca signals of surface (Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides sacculifer) and subsurface dwelling (Globorotalia tumida) planktonic foraminifera. Our study is based on RV SONNE SO-225 piston cores retrieved from Manihiki plateau, which is located at the southeastern margin of the WPWP (between ~ 5°S-15°S and 170-160°W). The proxy records cover the last ~ 3 Myr\nSSTMg/Ca remained nearly constant throughout the entire Pleistocene varying between ~30 to 32 (°C), while the subSSTMg/Ca reconstructions reveal pronounced variations from ~10 to 16 (°C). Our results imply that the WPWP thermocline depth has undergone significant vertical movements throughout the Pleistocene. Notably, thermocline depth is continuously decreasing from the early to the late Pleistocene, and coincides with the change from the 41 kyr to a dominant 100 kyr climate periodicity between 1 and 1.7 Ma. We hypothesize that the repeated change in thermocline depth is due to either 1) changes in mode or intermediate water masses advection from Southern Ocean sources via “ocean tunneling”, 2) changes in the tropical Pacific wind regime, and/or 3) changes in the Western Pacific Monsoon sytem.",

An intact and substantial seal formation above a storage reservoir is required for a significant portion of the initial sealing mechanisms believed to occur during carbon dioxide storage operations. Shales are a common seal formation rock types found above numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs, as well as potential saline aquifer storage locations. Shales commonly have very low permeability, however they also have the tendency to be quite fissile, and the formation of fractures within these seals can have a significant detrimental effect on the sealing potential of a reservoir and amount to large areas of high permeability and low capillary pressures compared to the surrounding intact rock. Fractured shales also have an increased current interest due to the increasing development of shale gas reservoirs using hydraulic fracturing techniques.\nThis work shows the observed changes that occur within fractured pieces of reservoir seal shale samples, along with quarry analogues, using an in-situ micro-CT fluid flow imaging apparatus with a Hassler type core holder. Changes within the preferential flow path under different stress regimes as well as physical changes to the fracture geometry are reported. Lattice Boltzmann flow simulations were then performed on the extracted flow paths and compared to experiment permeability measurements. The preferential flow path of carbon dioxide through the fracture network is also observed and compared to the results two-phase Lattice Boltzmann fluid flow simulations.",

Iinuma et al. [2012] derived slip distributions during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake using GPS/Acoustic data and on-land GPS data. The result showed that maximum slip is more than 85 m near the trench axis. The focal area along the Nankai trough extended to the trough axis affected this earthquake by cabinet office, government of Japan.\nWe monitored seafloor crustal deformation along the Nankai trough, Japan. Observation regions are at the eastern end of Nankai trough (named Suruga trough) and at the central Nankai trough. We established and monitored by two sites across the trough at each region. In the Suruga trough region, we repeatedly observed from 2005 to 2013. We observed 13 and 14 times at a foot wall side (SNE) and at a hanging wall side (SNW), respectively. We estimated the displacement velocities with relative to the Amurian plate from the result of repeated observation. The estimated displacement velocity vectors at SNE and SNW are 42±8 mm/y to N94±3˚W direction and 39±11 mm/y to N84±9˚W direction, respectively. The directions are the same as those measured at the on-land GPS stations. The magnitudes of velocity vector indicate significant shortening by approximately 4 mm/y between SNW and on-land GPS stations at hanging wall side of the Suruga Trough. This result shows that the plate interface at the northernmost Suruga trough is strongly locked. In the central Nankai trough region, we established new two stations across the central Nankai trough (Both stations are about 15km distance from trough) and observed only three times, August 2013, January 2014, and June 2014.

            "abstract": "Atmospheric CO2 variability is markedly influenced by biospheric fluxes (photosynthesis and respiration) from the land surface at seasonal, to annual, to decadal time scales. Process models of photosynthesis and respiration have considerable uncertainty as only the sum of these fluxes can be constrained on the bases of atmospheric CO2 measurements alone. An independent proxy for photosynthesis or gross primary productivity (GPP) has recently become available from measurement of solar induced fluorescence (SIF). We report here on the first (to our knowledge) simulations of global atmospheric CO2 concentration driven by GPP estimated from observations of SIF. A baseline model uses satellite derived FPAR, incident solar radiation, temperature, and moisture stress scalars to estimate net primary productivity (NPP). The fluorescence driven model uses only fluorescence from GOME-2 scaled to the mean annual NPP at every grid cell and assumes a constant NPP/GPP ratio. Respiration was modeled identically in the two simulations. This preserves the spatial distribution of production capacity but allows for independent seasonal cycle and interannual variability from the baseline model. The flux models were run at ½ degree monthly resolution for 2007-2012 and fluxes were reaggregated along with fossil fuel and ocean fluxes to 3-hourly, 1 x 1.25 degree resolution for the atmospheric transport model. Here, we compare the model’s skill at predicting CO2 variability at 40 NOAA CO2 flask network sites. The baseline model shows good skill at matching the seasonal cycle at the flask sites but is not as good at producing monthly and interannual anomalies. The fluorescence model shows similar (or even improved) performance even though solar radiation, FPAR, precipitation and temperature effects on GPP are not included in the simulation. The results demonstrate the capability of the fluorescence data to integrate physiological and biophysical controls on GPP into a single measured parameter.",

            "abstract": "Solar wind-magnetospheric disturbances cause enhancements in the energy input to the high-latitude upper atmosphere through particle precipitation and Joule heating. As the upper atmosphere is heated and expanded during geomagnetically disturbed periods, the neutral density in the thermosphere increases at a fixed altitude. Conversely, the thermosphere contracts during the recovery phase of the disturbance, resulting in a decrease of the density. The main objectives of this study are (1) to determine the morphology of the global thermospheric density response to high-latitude forcing, and (2) to determine the recovery speed of the thermosphere density after geomagnetic disturbances. For (1), we use thermospheric density data measured by the Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) satellite during 2000-2010. It is demonstrated that the density enhancement during disturbed periods occurs first in the dayside cusp region, and the density at other regions slowly follows it. The reverse process is observed when geomagnetic activity ceases; the density enhancement in the cusp region fades away first, then the global density slowly goes back to the quiet level. For (2), we analyze EISCAT Svalbard radar and Tromso UHF radar data to estimate thermospheric densities during the recovery phase of geomagnetic disturbances. We attempt to determine the time constant for the density recovery both inside and outside the cusp region.",

            "abstract": "We combine ultraviolet and white-light images obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) to track, in the lower corona, the spatial and temporal evolution of pressure waves and shocks associated with the onset of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). We use ideal geometrical 3-D surfaces to follow with time the location of the global disturbance observed in EUV and white-light images. This fitting technique provides a tracking of the evolution of shocks from the Sun to 20 solar radii.\nWe combine potential field source surface calculations with simple models of the distribution of interplanetary magnetic field lines in the interplanetary medium to determine the magnetic connectivity of the shock with spacecraft located near 1AU. We extract the 3-D shock velocity vector, the shock geometry and, by using empirical functions of temperature and density variations in the corona, the local Alfven speed at the point of magnetic connectivity with STEREO-A, STEREO-B and L1 spacecraft.\nThe properties of the tracked coronal shocks are compared with the properties of SEPs measured in situ. We concentrate on the proton-rich events detected by the near-Earth spacecraft as well as the STEREO spacecraft from 2011 to 2014. We use the onset of solar energetic particle events (SEPs) to determine their release time near the Sun. We show that the shock speed at the point of magnetic connectivity is a determining factor for the intensity of the SEP measured in situ with a steep relation between coronal shock speed and SEP maximum intensity. This analysis naturally removes projection effects associated with single viewpoint analysis presented in previous studies. We discuss how the interplay between the radial dependence of the Alfven speed and the complex topology of magnetic field lines in the corona is likely to control the onset time of SEPs at 1AU. We discuss the successes and challenges faced when interpreting SEP events in terms of the speed and geometry of coronal shocks.",

            "abstract": "In addition to providing the reference absolute scalar measurements on the three Alpha, Bravo and Charlie satellites of the Swarm mission, each Absolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM) can also, and simultaneously, provide independent experimental vector field measurements. These experimental data appear to be of the expected quality (though somewhat less so on Charlie). In addition, comparisons of these measurements with readings from the Vector Field Magnetometer (VFM, located some distance away along the boom and used to produce the nominal Swarm Level1b vector data) show that the mechanical link between both instruments is very stable on all three satellites. These remarkable circumstances make it possible not only to compare the output of the VFM and ASM instruments for cross-validation purposes, but also to compute geomagnetic field models using only ASM scalar and vector mode data, without resorting to VFM data. Such models can then be compared to models computed in exactly the same way from VFM data (using exactly the same data distribution in time and space for both models, which thus only differ by the fact that the data are provided by either the ASM experimental vector mode, or the nominal L1b calibrated VFM data). As we shall illustrate in this presentation, such comparisons provide extremely valuable information. Not only do they show that ASM experimental vector mode data can indeed be used to produce high-degree geomagnetic field models, but they also provide a very interesting perspective on what may be the cause of undesired perturbations on either of the ASM and VFM instruments.",

            "abstract": "Large tectonic freshwater lakes face serious threats to their water quality, biological diversity and endemism through pollution and global warming. Lake Baikal is an important example as anthropogenic stressors (industrial pollution and cultural eutrophication) along with climate change could greatly affect the lake’s unique ecosystem and pristine water conditions. Phosphorus, nitrogen and silica are thought to control phytoplankton development, however recent changes in nutrient impacts on Lake Baikal’s phytoplankton remains unproven. This research aims to investigate the effect of anthropogenic and environmentally-driven changes on this large and biodiverse lake through seasonal sampling of the phytoplankton community (determined by chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments), chemical parameters (total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, silicate, nitrate and other major ions) and vertical profiles of pH, temperature and photosynethetically active radiation. Results show seasonal, vertical and spatial variability in the lake’s phytoplankton biomass and composition with higher summer mixed-layer pigment concentrations in the south basin resulting in higher light attenuation coefficients and lower photic zone depths (R2=0.86, p < 0.05). Redundancy analysis shows that this distribution is primarily influenced by average dissolved organic carbon concentrations within the mixing layer, with the strongest negative correlation between picoplankton biomarkers and dissolved organic carbon concentrations (R2=-0.60, p < 0.05). Geochemical biomarkers (pigments and organic carbon [δ13Corganic]) from several sediment cores place these modern day observations within an historical context and allow the impact of past environmental changes on Lake Baikal’s primary productivity over the last 60 years and natural climate-driven trends in past centuries to be assessed. These results show clear spatial and temporal changes between sites over this interval with greater increases in chlorophylls and their transformation products, along with biomarkers for diatoms, cryptophytes, green algae and cyanobacteria within the south and central basin.",

In this study, we compare different ways to estimate future return levels for heavy rainfall, based on the statistical extreme value theory. Both Peaks over Threshold (POT) and block maxima with the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution will be used and their results compared when linear trends are assumed in the parameters: threshold and scale parameter for POT and location and scale parameter for GEV. But rainfall over the IP is a special variable in that a large number of the values are 0. Thus, the impact of taking this into account is discussed too. Another approach is then tested, based on the evolutions of the mean and variance obtained from the time series of rainy days only, and of the number of rainy days. A statistical test, similar to that designed for temperature in Parey et al. 2013, is used to assess if the trends in extremes can be considered as mostly due to these evolutions when considering only rainy days. The results show that it is mainly the case: the extremes of the residuals, after removing the trends in mean and standard deviation, cannot be differentiated from those of a stationary process. Thus, the future return levels can be estimated from the stationary return level of these residuals and an estimation of the future mean and standard deviation. Moreover, an estimation of the future number of rainy days is used to retrieve the return levels for all days. All of these comparisons are made for an ensemble of high quality rainfall time series observed in the Iberian Peninsula over the period 1961-2010, from which we want to estimate a 20-year return level expected in 2020. The evolutions and the impact of the different approaches will be discussed for 3 seasons: fall, spring and winter.\nParey S., Hoang T.T.H., Dacunha-Castelle D.: The importance of mean and variance in predicting changes in temperature extremes, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, Vol. 118, 1–12, 2013.",

Within this information system, EOST (in Strasbourg) is in charge of collecting real-time permanent broadband seismic waveform, and performing Quality Control on these data. The real-time and validated data set are pushed to the French National Distribution Center (Isterre/Grenoble) to make them publicly available. Furthermore EOST hosts the BCSF-ReNaSS, in charge of the French metropolitan seismic bulletin. This allows to benefit from some high-end quality control based on the national and world-wide seismicity.\nHere we present the real-time seismic data flow from the stations of the French National Broad Band Network to EOST, and then, the data Quality Control procedures that were recently installed, including some new developments.The data Quality Control consists in applying a variety of processes to check the consistency of the whole system from the stations to the data center. This allows us to verify that instruments and data transmission are operating correctly. Moreover, time quality is critical for most of the scientific data applications. To face this challenge and check the consistency of polarities and amplitudes, we deployed several high-end processes including a noise correlation procedure to check for timing accuracy (intrumental time errors result in a time-shift of the whole cross-correlation, clearly distinct from those due to change in medium physical properties), and a systematic comparison of synthetic and real data for teleseismic earthquakes of magnitude larger than 6.5 to detect timing errors as well as polarity and amplitude problems.",

Here an extensive laboratory study was undertaken to assess whether the dispersivity, which traditionally has been considered to be a property of the porous medium, is dependent on colloid particle size and interstitial velocity. A total of 49 colloid transport experiments were performed in columns packed with glass beads under chemically unfavorable colloid attachment conditions. Nine different colloid diameters, and various flow velocities were examined. The breakthrough curves were successfully simulated with a mathematical model describing colloid transport in homogeneous, water saturated porous media.

This signal is one of the main tools for establishing chronostratigraphy and determining the nature of global and local glacial and interglacial cycles. In this study, the focus is on the PF assemblages which are sensitive recorders of climate and water column properties including the degree of water column stratification and trophic levels. In order to reconstruct the climate variability of the last ~90 ka, core MDVAL9501 (980 m water depth), taken by R/V Marion Dufresnae, SE of Cyprus, was studied. A δ18O-Globigerinoides ruber stratigraphy was established and correlated with well-dated (U/Th) speleothem records of Soreq Cave and radiocarbon dates. The sedimentary record in this core covers the last ~90ka. Variations in PF assemblage composition indicate that conditions shifted between two main climatic scenarios. During the last glacial cooler, more aerated, less stratified and more mesotrophic water column persisted with distinct seasonality. This is evident from the occurrence of two deep water dwellers Globorotalia inflata being abundant from 75 to 50 ka BP and G. scitula from 55 to 15 ka BP (with respective SST of 15-16 ºC and 11-13 ºC) and accompanied continuously by the cold water species Neogloboqudrina pachyderma and Globigerina bulloides. Among the \"warm\" water species G. ruber is nearly the only \"survivor\" during the glacial period comprising 25-50% of the assemblage with lower values corresponding to minima in D-O events. During Holocene, water column was warmer, more stratified, mostly oligotrophic with reduced seasonality. The dominating species were G. ruber and other \"warm” water species comprising >75% of the assemblage and occurring in low numbers. An exception are sapropel S1 (early Holocene) and S3 (MIS 5.1) periods, when lower δ18O and highest TOC values prevail with significantly increased numerical abundance of PF, indicating a temporary change to more mesotrophic water-column conditions.",

Water quality forecasting can provide such information, e.g., to protect public health from harmful water quality conditions such as algal blooms or bacterial pollution and to allow the decision makers to respond more quickly to emergency situations such as oil spills for protection of water resources systems. Operational water quality forecasting is a large challenge due to the complexities and large uncertainties associated with various physiobiochemical processes involved. As such, there is an added impetus to utilize real-time observations effectively in the forecast process. In this work, we apply data assimilation (DA) to the Hydrologic Simulation Program – Fortran (HSPF) model to improve accuracy of watershed water quality forecast. The DA technique used is based on maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF).The resulting DA module, MLEF-HSPF, has been implemented in the Water Quality Forecast System at the National Institute of Environmental Research (WQFS-NIER) in Korea.

Understanding its sensitivity to climatic forcing is critical for assessing mass balance of the GrIS. Here we use a high-resolution, three dimensional and time-dependent regional outlet glacier model developed as part of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) forced by climatology datasets from RACMO2 to model present-day state of Jakobshavn Isbræ. Our choice of modelling consists of a forward integration in time (hindcasting) for 1990-2012 with monthly climatic forcing. To assess the modeled mass change, we use observed ice volume change from airborne and satellite laser altimetry from ATM, ICESat, and LVIS during 1997-2013 and convert to mass change. However, the airborne and satellite measurements are conducted few times per year, and may provide yearly mass loss rates only. To assess weekly to monthly scale mass variability, we use measurements of bedrock displacement from permanent GPS sites during 2005-2013. The GPS data provide daily to monthly scale estimates of bedrock displacements caused by the earth’s elastic response to ice mass change from Jakobshavn Isbræ. Additionally, we assess modeled ice velocities (and velocity changes) with observed velocities obtained from measurements of ice motion by satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) data from the RADARSAT-1 satellite.\nOur results show good agreement between modeled and observed mass change and velocity change from weekly to long-term timespan. Both model and observations show huge mass loss anomalies in 2010 and 2012 caused by enhanced melting during summer months.",

            "abstract": "In May 2013, the bottom of Ligeia Mare (LM), Titan, was detected in the active altimetry mode of the Cassini RADAR at a maximum depth of 160 m (Mastroguiseppe et al., 2014). This was the first and, so far, only detection of the floor of an extraterrestrial sea. The difference of amplitude of the surface and bottom echoes was also investigated in order to evaluate losses by absorption in the liquid layer. In this paper, we analyze the passive radiometry data that were acquired concurrently with the active data, in order to provide an independent estimate of the liquid loss tangent and to determine the dielectric constant of both the liquid and the seafloor. We then used these results to convert the radiometry mosaic of LM into a low-resolution bathymetry map.\nFor the last 10 years, the passive radiometer incorporated in the Cassini RADAR has been observing the 2.2-cm wavelength thermal microwave emission from Titan. Its calibration has been recently refined to an unprecedented accuracy of <1% (Janssen et al., this meeting). To date, all LM has been mapped in high-spatial resolution. The 2.2-cm emissivity measured over it is directly related to the depth of the seafloor, the most emissive areas being the deepest and vice-versa.\nComparing the radiometry data acquired in May 2013 to a two-layer model and using as an input the altimetry-derived depth profile, we find that the loss tangent value that best fits data is very low and only slightly smaller than that found by Mastroguiseppe et al. (2014) (3.0±1.0 10-5). This strongly suggests that the sea is composed of pure hydrocarbons with no or few suspended particles. A dielectric constant of 2.9 is inferred for the sea bottom pointing to water ice as its most likely composition rather than organic sediments. Lastly, the dielectric constant of the liquid is found to be <1.7, which, together with the low loss tangent, supports the idea of a methane-dominated composition (rather than ethane, Mitchell et al., submitted).",

            "abstract": "MASCOT, a Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout, will support JAXA’s Hayabusa 2 mission to investigate the C-type asteroid 1999 JU3 (1). The German Aerospace Center (DLR) develops MASCOT with contributions from CNES (France) (2,3). Main objective is to in-situ map the asteroid’s geomorphology, the intimate structure, texture and composition of the regolith (dust, soil and rocks), and the thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties of the surface in order to provide ground truth for the orbiter remote measurements, support the selection of sampling sites, and provide context information for the returned samples. MASCOT comprises a payload of four scientific instruments: camera, radiometer, magnetometer and hyperspectral microscope. C- and D-type asteroids hold clues to the origin of the solar system, the formation of planets, the origins of water and life on Earth, the protection of Earth from impacts, and resources for future human exploration. C- and D-types are dark and difficult to study from Earth, and have only been glimpsed by spacecraft. While results from recent missions (e.g., Hayabusa, NEAR (4, 5, 6)) have dramatically increased our understanding of asteroids, important questions remain. For example, characterizing the properties of asteroid regolith in-situ would deliver important ground truth for further understanding telescopic and orbital observations and samples of such asteroids. MASCOT will descend and land on the asteroid and will change its position two times by hopping. This enables measurements during descent, at the landing and hopping positions #1-3, and during hopping.\nHayabusa 2 together with Mascot will launch beginning of December 2014, arrive at 1999JU3 in 2018 and return samples back to Earth in 2020.\n",

            "abstract": "In 2008 and 2012 two earthquake aftershock sequences occurred on the SE border between Iran and Iraq. Initial locations placed these events on a portion of the Zagros Foredeep Fault that is thought to be largely aseismic. The Mw 5.7 main shock in 2008 had a strike slip mechanism while the 2012 Mw 4.7 main shock had a thrust mechanism. Ground deformation due to the 2008 event was observed using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar. We inverted these InSAR data to find the geometry of the fault and the distribution of slip on the fault plane. Whilst the inversions provide a well-determined fault plane geometry that is consistent with seismological solutions, the geodetic moment is larger than estimates of seismic moment, likely due to significant triggered asesimic slip. We estimated depths for 36 of the 89 earthquakes in the two aftershock sequences either by inverting the surface wave amplitude spectra or by picking the pP depth phase. The estimated depths ranged from 4 -13km. Using these estimated depths and the InSAR inversion results to fix the location of the 2008 main shock we relocated the aftershocks using a joint epicentral determination method. This relocation splits the seismicity into two distinct clusters, with the 2008 seismicity ~20km to the SE of the 2012 cluster. The location of the 2012 cluster suggests it occurred on the Zagros Foredeep Fault. Linear structures can be seen in the relocated 2012 seismicity, which show some time dependence. The majority of the 2012 events all have similar thrust focal mechanisms, and our estimated depths suggest that the 2012 aftershock sequence occurred on a thrust within the sediment cover that does not cut the basement. High resolution satellite imagery has also revealed a right-lateral stream offset in the region of the 2008 earthquake sequence, providing evidence that strike-slip faulting in this area is not blind, in contrast to the majority of faulting in the Simply Folded Belt.",

Ionospheric Langmuir waves may be excited by the bump-on-tail instability generated by impinging beams of electrons traveling parallel to the background magnetic field (B). The Correlation of High-frequencies and Auroral Roar Measurement (CHARM II) sounding rocket was launched into a substorm at 9:49 UT on 17 February 2010, from the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska. The primary instruments included the University of Iowa Wave-Particle Correlator (WPC), the Dartmouth High-Frequency Experiment (HFE), several charged particle detectors, low-frequency wave instruments, and a magnetometer. The HFE is a receiver system which effectively yields continuous (100% duty cycle) electric-field waveform measurements from 100 kHz to 5 MHz, and which had its detection axis aligned nominally parallel to B. The HFE output was fed on-payload to the WPC, which uses a phase-locked loop to track the incoming wave frequency with the most power, then sorting incoming electrons at eight energy levels into sixteen wave-phase bins. CHARM II encountered several regions of strong Langmuir wave activity throughout its 15-minute flight, and the WPC showed wave-lock and statistically significant particle correlation distributions during several time periods. We show results of an in-depth analysis of the CHARM II WPC data for the entire flight, including statistical analysis of correlations which show evidence of direct interaction with the Langmuir waves, indicating (at various times) trapping of particles and both driving and damping of Langmuir waves by particles. In particular, the sign of the gradient in particle flux appears to correlate with the phase relation between the electrons and the wave field, with possible implications for the wave physics.",

            "abstract": "To extensively investigate the upper crustal structure beneath the western segment of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) in Sakarya and the surroundings, a temporary seismic network consisting of 70 stations (with nearly 7km station spacing) was deployed in early May 2012 and operated for 18 months during the Faultlab experiment encompassing both the northern and southern strands of the fault in between the area of 1999 İzmit and Düzce mainshock ruptures. With the help of this new and extensive data set, our main objective is to provide new insights on the most recent micro-seismic activity and the velocity structure beneath the region. Out of 2437 events contaminated by the explosions, we extracted 1344 well located earthquakes with a total of 31595 P and 18512 S phase readings which lead to an avarage Vp/Vs ratio of ~1.82 extracted from the wadati diagram. The enhanced station coverage decreased the magnitude threshold to 0.1 where the horizontal and vertical location errors did not exceed 0.5 km and 2.0 km, respectively. Average RMS values were calculated within the range of 0.05-0.4 seconds. We observed significant seismic activity along both branches of the fault where the depth of the seismogenic zone was confined to 15 km. Focal parameters of 41 earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 1.8 were also determined using both Regional Moment Tensor Inversion and P first arrival time methods. Focal mechanism solutions confirm that Sakarya and its vicinity could be defined by a compressional regime showing a primarily oblique-slip motion character. Furthermore, we selected the earthquakes recorded by at least 8 stations with azimuthal gaps less than 200° for the ongoing tomographic inversion that would enable us to accurately map the complex upper crustal velocity structure with high resolution beneath this segment of the NAFZ.",

Shimabara, Nagasaki prefecture, Japan is an important agricultural district experiencing this problem. In Shimabara, drinking water relies on the groundwater. In this study, groundwater samples were collected at 40 locations such as residents and municipal waterworks wells, springs and rivers from August 2011 to November 2013. NO3-N concentration of 15 samples exceeded 10 mg L-1 (drinking water standard in Japan). Maximum NO3-N concentration was 26.6 mg L-1. Correlation coefficients were calculated between ion components of collected samples (n=277). NO3- had the highest positive correlation with Cl-(r =0.956) and had positive correlation with K+(r=0.679), SO42-(r=0.654) and Ca2+(r=0.593), respectively. The results revealed that Cl- and K+ related to livestock wastes, SO42- related to chemical fertilizers and Ca2+ related to calcareous materials. Main source of NO3- is from livestock wastes. To understand groundwater chemistry in detail, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were carried out. Result from the PCA, chemical characteristics of groundwater was summarized by the first principal component and the second principal component. Both of two principal components reflected nitrate contamination and ion dissolution from aquifer matrix during groundwater flows. Result from the cluster analysis, chemical characteristics of groundwater was classified into four clusters. Nitrate polluted samples into specific cluster and the rest samples were classified into other clusters depending on the original water quality.",

The experiment, focused on a comparison between height and gravity variations, is still ongoing; these uninterrupted time series certainly constitute a most important data base to observe and estimate reliably long-period behaviors but also to derive deeper insights on the nature of the crustal deformation. Almost two decades of continuous GPS observations from two closely located receivers have shown that the coordinate time series are characterized by linear and non-linear variations as well as by sudden jumps. Both over long- and short-period time scales, the GPS height series show signals induced by different phenomena, for example, those related to mass transport in the Earth system. Seasonal effects are clearly recognizable and are mainly associated with the water table seasonal behavior. To understand and separate the contribution of different forcings is not an easy task; to this end, the information provided by the superconducting gravimeter observations and also by absolute gravity measurements offers a most important means to detect and understand mass contributions. In addition to GPS and gravity data, at Medicina, a number of environmental parameters time series are also regularly acquired, among them water table levels. We present the results of study investigating correlations between height, gravity and environmental parameters time series.",

            "abstract": "Due to the influence of methane gas and a thick aerosols haze in the atmosphere, Titan's surface is only visible in 7 spectral atmospheric windows centered at 0.93, 1.08, 1.27, 1.59, 2.01, 2.7-2.8 and 5 microns with the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). The 5 microns atmospheric window constitutes the only one being almost insensitive to the haze scattering and which presents only a reduced atmospheric absorption contribution to the signal recorded by the instrument. Despite these advantages leading to the almost direct view of the surface, the 5 microns window is also the noisiest spectral window of the entire VIMS spectrum (an effect highly dependent on the time exposure used for the observations), and it is not totally free from atmospheric contributions, enough to keep “artefacts” in mosaics of several thousands of cubes due to atmospheric and surface photometric effects amplified by the very heterogeneous viewing conditions between each Titan flyby. At first order, a lambertian surface photometry at 5 microns has been used as an initial parameter in order to estimate atmospheric opacity and surface photometry in all VIMS atmospheric windows and to determine the albedo of the surface, yet unknown, both using radiative transfer codes on single cubes or empirical techniques on global hyperspectral mosaics. Other studies suggested that Titan's surface photometry would not be uniquely lambertian but would also contain anisotropic lunar-like contributions. In the present work, we aim at constraining accurately the surface photometry of Titan and residual atmospheric absorption effects in this 5 microns window using a comprehensive study of relevant sites located at various latitudes. Those include bright and dark (dunes) terrains, 5-microns bright terrains (Hotei Regio and Tui Regio), the Huygens Landing Site and high latitudes polar lakes and seas. The VIMS 2004 to 2014 database, composed of more than 40,000 hyperspectral cubes acquired on Titan, has been decomposed into a MySQL relational database in order to perform the present study looking at both spatial and temporal (seasonal) aspects.",

We investigated the seasonal time-scale performance of RegCM4.3.5 in reproducing observed climatology over the domain of Central Asia by using two different global climate model outputs. For the future climatology of the domain, the regional model predicts relatively high warming in the warm season and northern part of the domain at cold season with a decrease in precipitation almost all part of the domain. The results of our study show that surface temperatures in the region will increase from 3°C up to more than 7°C on average according to the emission scenarios for the period of 2070-2100 with respect to past period of 1970-2000. Therefore, the projected warming and decrease in precipitation and also resultant or associated increased aridity and more frequent and severe drought events very likely adversely affect the ecological and socio-economic systems of this region, which is already characterised with mostly arid and semi-arid climate and ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "The next generation of ESA/NASA heliophysics missions, Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus, will focus on exploring the linkage between the Sun and the heliosphere. These new missions will collect unique data that will allow us to study, e.g., the coupling between macroscopic physical processes to those on kinetic scales, the generation of solar energetic particles and their propagation into the heliosphere and the origin and acceleration of solar wind plasma. Since 2010, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory returns 1.4 TB/day of high-resolution solar images, magnetograms and EUV irradiance data. Within a few years, the scientific community will thus have access to petabytes of multi­dimensional remote­sensing and complex in-situ observations from different vantage points, complemented by petabytes of simulation data.\nAnswering overarching science questions like “How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability and space weather?” will only be possible if the community has the necessary tools at hand. As of today, there is an obvious lack of capability to both visualize these data and assimilate them into sophisticated models to advance our knowledge. A key piece needed to bridge the gap between observables, derived quantities like magnetic field extrapolations and model output is a tool to routinely and intuitively visualize large heterogeneous, multidimensional, time­dependent data sets. As of today, the space science community is lacking the means to do this (i) on a routine basis, (ii) for complex multi­dimensional data sets from various instruments and vantage points and (iii) in an extensible and modular way that is open for future improvements and interdisciplinary usage. In this contribution, we will present recent progress in visualizing the Sun and its magnetic field in 3D using the open-source JHelioviewer framework, which is part of the ESA/NASA Helioviewer Project. Among other features, JHelioviewer offers efficient region-of-interest-based data streaming, metadata and event catalog integration, as well as an interface to access science-quality data. In addition to its usage by the solar physics community, JHelioviewer has already been successfully adapted for application in planetary sciences and medical imaging.",

            "abstract": "Transport by groundwater occurs over the different scales encountered by moving solute plumes. Spreading of plumes is often quantified by the longitudinal macrodispersivity αL (half the rate of change of the second spatial moment divided by the mean velocity). It was found that generally αL is scale dependent, increasing with the travel distance L of the plume centroid, stabilizing eventually at a constant value (Fickian regime).\nIt was surmised in the literature that αL(L) scales up with travel distance following a universal scaling law. Attempts to define the scaling law were pursued by several authors (Arya et al, 1988, Neuman, 1990, Xu and Eckstein, 1995, Schulze-Makuch, 2005), by fitting a regression line in the log-log representation of results from an ensemble of field experiment, primarily those experiments included by the compendium of experiments summarized by Gelhar et al, 1992.\nDespite concerns raised about universality of scaling laws (e.g., Gelhar, 1992, Anderson, 1991), such relationships are being employed by practitioners for modeling multiscale transport (e.g., Fetter, 1999), because they, presumably, offer a convenient prediction tool, with no need for detailed site characterization. Several attempts were made to provide theoretical justifications for the existence of a universal scaling law (e.g. Neuman, 1990 and 2010, Hunt et al, 2011).\nOur study revisited the concept of universal scaling through detailed analyses of field data (including the most recent tracer tests reported in the literature), coupled with a thorough re-evaluation of the reliability of the reported αL values. Our investigation concludes that transport, and particularly αL(L), is formation-specific, and that modeling of transport cannot be relegated to a universal scaling law. Instead, transport requires characterization of aquifer properties, e.g. spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity, and the use of adequate models.",

            "abstract": "Teaching primary and secondary school students (K-12) about science and art, although absolutely critical, can be difficult. Teachers have specific standards or subject matters that they are required to cover and often soils and soil science is not included in that list. We have struggled with ways to bring soil science information to the larger audience as the direct approach meets with resistance due to the time commitments to other standards. Our approach now is to use soils as a media or vehicle to teach key concepts in broad subject areas. We have developed several lesson plans in science, geography, math and art that focus on a concept but use soils to convey it. For example students make “mini” monoliths of a state soil. During this exercise students need to use skills in geography to find where their state soil occurs in their state and in the country. They need to understand colors in order to choose the correct colors to use to make their monolith. Finally, they must understand how scales work in order to make the monolith accurate in terms of horizon depths. Throughout the exercise discussion on my certain colors occur in the soil can be discussed. This discussion can lead to a qualitative understanding of chemistry and biology. This presentation will demonstrate this lesson and several others that have been developed and available through the Soil Science Society of America’s K12 Education Committee and our International Year of Soil website.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the problem of intraplate melt generation with the aim of understanding spatial and temporal relationships between magmatism and extremely slow intraplate deformation. We present numerical models that consider feedback between melt generation and lithospheric deformation and incorporate three different damage mechanisms: brittle damage, creep damage, and melt damage. Melt conditions are calculated with a Gibbs energy minimization method, and the energy equation solved self-consistently for latent heat and shear heating effects. We use an extremely slowly lithosphere extension model (1-1.5 mm/y) to investigate the mechanics leading to intraplate volcanism in a cold lithosphere (~50mW/m2) such as the Harrat Ash-Shaam volcanic field in NW Arabia. We find that the extremely slow extension is a key to a very potent melt transfer mechanism through the lithosphere. The mechanism relies on multiple feedback mechanisms active in the accommodation of strain in the presence of fluids. These are capable of generating melts in the lithosphere/asthenosphere even in regions of relatively low heat flux. Once low degrees of partial melts are generated, the triple feedback between brittle-creep and melt damage leads to high porosity lithospheric-scale shear zones capable of transferring melts and fluids to the surface. Efficient localization in the weaker ductile domains implies that the final pattern of strain distribution is controlled by slow creep from below rather than by brittle deformation from above. Our model provides an explanation for intraplate volcanic provinces, which appear to rely on slowly deforming lithospheres. A significant finding is that slow extension, rather than fast extension, can localize melt damage more effectively in the deeper creeping section of the lithosphere. This finding may have profound implications to the fundamental dynamic control on intraplate volcanism.",

            "abstract": "We have investigated how the Borneo vortex develops over the equatorial South China Sea under cold surge conditions in December during the Asian winter monsoon. Composite analysis using reanalysis and satellite datasets has revealed that absolute vorticity and water vapour are transported by strong cold surges from upstream of the South China Sea to around the equator. Rainfall is correspondingly enhanced over the equatorial South China Sea. A semi-idealized experiment reproduced the Borneo vortex over the equatorial South China Sea during a perpetual cold surge. The Borneo vortex is manifested as a meso-alpha cyclone with a comma-shaped rainband in the northeast sector of the cyclone. Vorticity budget analysis showed that the growth/maintenance of the meso-alpha cyclone was achieved mainly by the vortex stretching. This vortex stretching is due to the upward motion forced by the latent heat release around the cyclone centre. The comma-shaped rainband consists of clusters of meso-beta scale rainfall cells. The intense rainfall in the comma-head (comma-tail) is generated by the confluence of the warmer and wetter cyclonic easterly flow (cyclonic southeasterly flow) and the cooler and drier northeasterly surge in the northwestern (northeastern) sector of the cyclone. Intense upward motion and heavy rainfall resulted due to the low-level convergence and the favourable thermodynamic profile at the confluence zone. In particular, the convergence in the northwestern sector is responsible for maintenance of the meso-alpha cyclone system. At both meso-alpha and meso-beta scales, the convergence is ultimately caused by the deviatoric strain in the confluence wind pattern but is significantly self-enhanced by the nonlinear dynamics.\n",

This Mexican Drought Atlas (MXDA) is based on 251 tree-ring chronologies, including 82 from Mexico and another 169 from the southern U.S. and western Guatemala. Point-by-point principal components regression was used to reconstruct the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for June-August. Calibration and verification statistics were improved over what was previously possible with the North American Drought Atlas, which was based on fewer chronologies only in Mexico. The MXDA will be served on the web with analytical tools for composite, correlation, and congruence analyses. The new PDSI reconstructions provide a more detailed estimation of decadal moisture regimes over the past 2000 years, but are most robust after 1400 AD, when several chronologies are available across Mexico. Droughts previously identified in a subset of chronologies are confirmed and their spatial impact quantified in the new reconstructions. This includes the intense drought of the mid-15th Century described in Aztec legend, the 16th Century megadrought, and “El Año del Hambre”, one of the worst famines in Mexican history. We also use the best replicated portion of the MXDA in the 18th and 19th Centuries to reconstruct moisture anomalies during key time periods of Mexican turmoil (e.g., the Mexican War of Independence).",

In urban systems, urban stormwater runoff containing ON compounds is one source of potentially bioavailable N in water bodies. However, ON characterization and concentrations in urban stormwater are rarely reported or considered for urban stormwater management. We instrumented a 13-hectare residential catchment in Florida’s Tampa Bay area with an ISCO autosampler and collected storm event runoff samples at 15-minute intervals during the 2013 wet season (June to September, n =236). Our objectives were to determine the (1) relative importance of ON compared to inorganic N forms (i.e., NO3- and NH4+) in the runoff, (2) investigate temporal trends in the ON concentrations in runoff, and (3) assess how rainfall depth and intensity affect any temporal trends. Mean concentration of total N in stormwater runoff for the wet season was 1.86 mg/l, of which dissolved and particulate ON were 63%. The dominance of ON in urban stormwater runoff suggests that the ON fraction should also be targeted when stormwater control measures call for N reductions. Particulate ON (PON) displayed a strong seasonal first flush trend as season progressed from June (1.45 mg/l; n =75) to September (0.20 mg/l; n = 28), while dissolved ON (DON) did not display any seasonal trend, with mean monthly concentrations ranging from 0.36 to 0.80 mg/l. A principal component analysis using storm event N concentrations, rainfall depth, and rainfall intensity as variables showed no significant correlation, suggesting that storms of various sizes and intensities can mobilize ON. The seasonal first flush observed for PON in the wet season can provide a window of time for optimal N removal and implies that stormwater best management practices should focus on capturing plant materials earlier in the season.",

The following features are found during seven different periods [Total Period (TP) during 1995-2012, first and second half period during 1995-2003 (P1) and 2004-2012 (P2), Quiet periods during 1995-1997 (Q1) and 2007-2009 (Q2), Active periods during 1998-2006 (A1) and 2010-2012 (A2)]. (1) During 1995-2012 the yearly occurrence frequency is <NMCs>TP = 9.3 for MCs and <NMCLs>TP =10.9 for MCLs. (2) In the quiet periods, <NMCs>Q1,Q2 is higher than <NMCLs> Q1,Q2 (i.e., <NMCs>Q1 > <NMCLs>Q1 and <NMCs>Q2 > <NMCLs>Q2), but <NMCs> Q1,Q2 is lower than <NMCLs> during the active periods (i.e., <NMCs>A1 < <NMCLs>A1 and <NMCs>A2 < <NMCLs>A2). This is probably due to the lower interaction rate between MCs/MCLs and the quiet background solar wind during lower solar active periods in Q1, Q2, and higher interaction rate and highly disturbed background solar wind during the active periods in A1 and A2. (3) The minimum Bz (Bzmin) inside of a MC is well correlated with the intensity of geomagnetic activity, Dstmin (minimum Dst found within a storm event) for MCs (correlation coefficient, c.c. = 0.75 and the fitting function is Dstmin = -1.74+ 7.23 Bzmin), but Bzmin is not well correlated with MCLs (c.c. = 0.57). (4) MCs play a major role in producing geomagnetic storms: the absolute value of the average Dstmin for MCs (<Dstmin>MC = -70 nT) associated geomagnetic storms is two times stronger than that for MCLs (<Dstmin>MCL = -35 nT) due to the difference in the IMF (interplanetary magnetic field) strength. (5) Over the Total Period the SSN is not correlated with <NMCs>TP (c.c. = 0.27), but is well associated with <NMCLs>TP (c.c. = 0.85). Note that the c.c. for SSN vs. <NMCs>P2 is better than that for SSN vs. <NMCLs>P2. (6) Averages of IMF, solar wind speed, and density inside of the MCs are larger than those inside of the MCLs. (7) Average of MC duration (~18.82 hours) is ~20% longer than the average of MCL duration (~15.69 hours).\n*Work of CCW was supported by ONR 6.1 program",

Although K-H vortices have been documented in planetary magnetospheres at the interface of magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasmas, such features at Mercury have been observed exclusively on the dusk side. From a survey of 58 K-H events, we find that these vortices have two distinct sets of behavior separated by the dusk terminator. On the dayside, the wave frequencies measured by MAG are nearly constant at ~0.025 Hz (~40 s period) under a variety of magnetosheath conditions, whereas the wave frequency measured on the nightside is correlated with the strength of the magnetic field near the magnetopause and matches the local Na+ gyrofrequency. The polarization of these waves inside the magnetosphere is distinctly right-handed, consistent with non-linear roll-up of K-H vortices as opposed to the left-handed ion-cyclotron wave mode. During these events, measurements from FIPS reveal strong (~30%) concentrations of Na+ in the nightside plasma sheet adjacent to the magnetopause. The keV energies of these planetary ions provide them with gyroradii that are ~500-1000 km, a scale at which a kinetic description of the K-H instability may be appropriate at Mercury. These data suggest a transition from fluid-scale to kinetic scale K-H vortices from day to night along Mercury’s duskside magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "Surface wave tomography is an important tool to study crust and upper mantle structure as well as seismic anisotropy, therefore providing insights into patterns of deformation in tectonically active regions. As we known, depth sensitivity of surface waves to shear wave speeds varies with period; therefore, we can probe seismic anisotropy at different depths from the inversion of surface wave dispersion data. In this study we use the earthquake surface-wave two-station method to determine the inter-station Rayleigh wave phase velocity dispersion curves in NE Tibet. We use 107 stations in NE Tibet, which are mainly from the INDEPTH-IV project and some regional networks. Rayleigh waves from 628 teleseismic events are analyzed to obtain 16771 dispersion curves in the period band 20-150 s, which are finally used to produce 2619 average inter-station dispersion curves. Then we perform surface wave tomography at various periods to simultaneously obtain phase speed variations and azimuthal anisotropy. The fast directions at different periods and the magnitudes of anisotropy are not alike in different regions. In some region the variation of fast axes with periods is small, possibly implying a vertically coherent deformation pattern there. There are regions with large changes of fast directions with periods, indicating complex deformation patterns in NE Tibet. We observe clear fault-parallel fast axes at intermediate periods, implying that the lithospheric deformation may be controlled by big strike-slip faults regionally in NE Tibet, for instance, the Kunlun fault. In the next step, we are planning to invert for 3-D depth-dependent shear wavespeeds and azimuthal anisotropy from the azimuthally anisotropic dispersion curve at each grid point using a Neighborhood Algorithm. This will provide more direct constraints on depth-dependent deformation patterns in the crust and upper mantle in NE Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Assessing seismic hazards remains one of the most challenging scientific issue in Earth sciences. Deep tectonic processes are classically considered as the only persistent mechanism driving the stress loading of active faults over a seismic cycle. Here we show with a mechanical model that surface processes also significantly influence the stress loading of faults at the timescale of a seismic cycle. Indeed, erosional unloading preceding or associated with a large earthquake increases the rate of inter-seismic Coulomb stress loading on thrust fault planes. Erosion rates of about 1 to 20 mm.yr-1, as documented in Taiwan, can raise the Coulomb stress by 0.1 to 2 bar on the nearby thrust faults over the inter-seismic phase. Our results show that mass transfers induced by surface processes in general can be the dominant mechanism for inter-seismic Coulomb stress loading of faults near the surface. In turn, surface processes can probably trigger shallow seismicity or favor the rupture of deep continental earthquakes up to the surface.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of groundwater recharge is difficult due to inherent rock heterogeneity and multiple space and time scales. The Western Mountain Aquifer (Yarkon-Taninim) of Israel is one of the country's major water resources. In recent years significant differences in water balance were found between actual water assessment and evaluation by different models. These differences could stem from underestimation of the aquifer replenishment, due to lack of knowledge concerning water infiltration through the fractured-porous vadose zone composed of karst limestone and dolomite formations, and its hydrologic connectivity with the underneath phreatic aquifer. The overall aim of this research was to quantify fluxes of deep percolation within the fractured-porous unsaturated zone to assess the natural replenishment of groundwater. Observations and the associated simulations were considered on two different time scales: 1) long-term - multi annual data of groundwater level from 1990 to 2011 with daily precipitation and evapotranspiration – for 9 wells in the study area, and (2) short-time – 30 minute data of groundwater levels from 2011 - 2012 with hourly precipitation and daily evapotranspiration - for 3 wells in the study area. A one-dimensional, dual permeability mathematical model of water flow in a variably saturated, fractured-porous media was applied to simulate water flow. The model was calibrated for each well location using the time series of the monitored groundwater levels. Fair agreement between simulated and observed groundwater levels was obtained. The estimated parameters properly reflect the small and large scale spatial variability in the key flow properties of diverse geological sections. Time lags of groundwater response to precipitation events depend on the thickness and properties of the vadose zone. The observations and numerical model study demonstrated the practical value of this approach for quantifying unsaturated-zone preferential flow in the carbonate aquifer vadose zone with respect to different time scales.",

Given current concerns with the increasing frequency and magnitude of droughts in many regions of the world, especially in the light of expected climate change, drought monitoring and dissemination of early warning information in a timely fashion on a global scale is a critical concern as an important adaptation and mitigation strategy. While a number of nations, and a few continental-scale activities have developed drought information system activities, a global drought early warning system (GDEWS) remains elusive, despite the benefits highlighted by ministers to the Global Earth Observation System of System in 2008.\nIn an effort to begin a process of drought monitoring with international collaboration, the National Integrated Drought Information System’s (NIDIS) U.S. Drought Portal, a web-based information system created to address drought services and early warning in the United States, including drought monitoring, forecasting, impacts, mitigation, research, and education, volunteered to develop a prototype Global Drought Monitoring Portal (GDMP). Through integration of data and information at the global level, and with four continental-level partners, the GDMP has proven successful as a tool to monitor drought around the globe. At a past meeting between NIDIS, the World Meteorological Organization, and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, it was recommended that the GDMP form the basis for a Global Drought Information System (GDIS).\nCurrently, GDIS activities are focused around providing operational global drought monitoring products and assessments, incorporating additional drought monitoring information, especially from those areas without regional or continental-scale input, and incorporating drought-specific climate forecast information from the World Climate Research Programme. Additional GDIS pilot activities are underway with an emphasis on information and decision making, and how to effectively provide drought early warning. This talk will provide an update on the status of GDIS and its role in international drought monitoring.",

These data are combined with published data to estimate the composition of the bulk silicate Moon (BSM). Previous estimates of the volatile element budget of the BSM, constrained by the compositions of mare basalts, are biased to low concentrations due to degassing of volatiles during mare basalt eruption and cooling; lunar picritic glasses, which have very short cooling times, are much less depleted in volatiles compared with mare basalts. The estimated BSM composition for volatile elements, constrained by H2O/Ce ratios and S contents in melt inclusions from orange glass sample 74220, are only moderately depleted compared with the bulk silicate Earth (0.1 – 0.3X BSE) and essentially overlap the composition of the terrestrial depleted MORB source. In a single giant impact scenario for the origin for the Moon, the Moon-forming material experiences three distinct stages of evolution characterized by very different timescales. Impact mass ejection (hours to days) and proto-lunar disk evolution (10s to 100s of years), both produce conditions that separate volatile elements into an atmospheric volume much larger than the Moon-forming magma disk, even under conditions in which hydrodynamic escape of hydrogen is difficult; this inevitably results in accretion of the Moon in a volatile-depleted state while the majority of the vapor surrounding the disk becomes incorporated into the Earth’s atmosphere. Only the extended evolution of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) presents a time window sufficiently long (10-200 Ma), and at the right time (4.30 – 4.50 Ga), for the Moon to gain water during the tail end of accretion. Yet there exists little evidence that the Moon formed in a singular event, as all detailed accretion models predict several giant impacts in the terrestrial planet region in which the Earth forms. It is thus likely that the Moon, like the Earth, experienced a history of heterogeneous accretion, with the possibility that the Moon may have inherited material directly from the Earth prior to the final giant impact.",

This task is a necessary step towards ground motion prediction in earthquake-prone areas with limited instrumental coverage.\nA reliable ground motion prediction based on virtual earthquakes must account for site, path, and source effects. Assessment of site effect mainly depends on near-surface material properties which are relatively well constrained, using geotechnical site data and borehole measurements. Assessment of path effect depends on the deeper geological structure, which is also typically known to an acceptable resolution. Contrarily to these two effects, which remain constant for a given area of interest, the earthquake rupture process and geometry varies from one earthquake to the other. In this study we focus on a finite fault source representation which is both generic and physics-based, for simulating large earthquakes where limited knowledge is available.\nThirteen geometric and kinematic parameters are used to describe the smooth “pseudo-Gaussian” slip distribution, such that slip decays from a point of peak slip within an elliptical rupture patch to zero at the borders of the patch. Radiation pattern and spectral charectaristics of our DSM are compared to those of commonly used finite fault models, i.e., the classical Haskell’s Model (HM) and the modified HM with Radial Rupture Propagation (HM-RRP) and the Point Source Model (PSM). Ground motion prediction based on our DSM benefits from the symmetry of the PSM and the directivity of the HM while overcoming inadequacy for modeling large earthquakes of the former and the non-physical uniform slip of the latter.",

Two descent centers in the upper- and lower-troposphere over Indian Ocean were observed to form during pre-generation stages. The 200hPa descent is caused by 150hPa convergence associated with positive PV inflowing into tropics. And the change of PV can ultimate link to the change of extratropical wave activity flux indicates the importance of extratropical forcing. Meanwhile, the non-clear sky and strong sea surface westerlies leads a high heat loss of eastern Indian Ocean by weakening solar radiation and increased sea surface latent release. The effect of cold underlying sea combined with stronger convective inhabit energy and stable inversion layer is in favor to produce descent in the lower-troposphere. The upper- and lower-descent strengthen and coupled, eventually lead to suppressed convective anomaly generation. Our analysis suggests that the energy propagation of extratropical Rossby waves lead to PV inflowing into tropics might be one of possible triggering mechanisms for primary MJO initiation. This supports a growing number of studies linking extratropical dynamics with the modulation of tropical convective anomalies and highlights the necessary for such processes to be cooperated with lower thermal condition in suppressed convective anomaly generation processes.",

To understand these events, and to judge whether they represent environmental change, we need to compare today's weather to the long-term historical record. Our long-term historical record of the weather is based on the billions of observations, from scientists, explorers, mariners, and others, that have been made, across the world, over the last few centuries.\nMany of these records are still dark: They exist only as hand-written paper documents in various archives and libraries, and are inaccessible to science. As a result our historical weather reconstructions have major gaps, where we do not know how the climate has varied.\noldWeather.org is a citizen science project rescuing these observations. By providing an web interface to scans of paper records, we enable volunteers around the world to contribute to the task of rescuing the observations. So far a community of around 20,000 volunteers have read well over 1 million pages of paper records and contributed millions of recovered weather observations to international climate datasets.\nAs well as learning about past weather, we are also learning what it takes to build a successful volunteer science project in this area: building a community, breaking down the task into manageable steps, feeding back success to the volunteers, and enabling comitted volunteers to take on more responsibilities were all vital to our success. We are currently using those lessons to build a new version of oldWeather that can rescue even more data.",

            "abstract": "Slow earthquakes are a family of phenomena spanning a wide range of seismic moment and duration. This family comprises tectonic tremors, low-frequency earthquakes (LFE), very low-frequency earthquakes (VLFs) and slow-slip events (SSE). Recent studies showed a common spatio-temporal scaling between the different types of slow earthquakes, suggesting that they are different manifestations of a single process. Detecting, locating, and understanding the relation between the seismic energy release associated to the different types of slow earthquakes are fundamental for understanding the dynamics of active deformation processes in the Earth lithosphere.\nHere we further develop the new methodology of Poiata et al. (2013) exploiting the frequency selective coherence of the wave field at dense seismic arrays and local antennas. We investigate a signal-processing scheme based on multi-band higher-order statistics for detecting and locating LFE and tectonic tremor sources, using the backprojection algorithm.\nWe assess the capability and performance of the method on a reference dataset from western Shikoku, Japan, composed of recordings from the Hi-net velocity seismometers, and high-sensitive accelerometers provided by NIED. The results are discussed and compared with locations of tectonic tremors and LFEs from NIED and JMA catalogs, respectively.\nWe then present preliminary results for applying our extended methodology to detection and location of VLFs in the same target area. Thus aiming to demonstrate the capability of the method to provide an integrated framework for detection, location, and analysis of very broadband seismic sources.",

            "abstract": "The concept of data citation is as old as the concept of citation itself. Yet with the birth of digital data, researchers largely stopped formally citing specific data sets. Over the last couple of decades, the data management community has worked to codify data citation practices and associated technologies such as persistent identifiers and automated indices. Nonetheless, digital data sets are rarely cited formally. There are myriad reasons for this, but we believe one problem is that data managers expect too much from data citation and assume false parallels to literature citation. We believe there needs to be a close examination of the purpose as well as practice of data citation, and a careful separation of concerns. We will present some initial ideas and then engage the audience in an open conversation on the topic.",

Greenland ice cores have provided high resolution archives for northern hemisphere climate change over the past glacial cycle. However, accurate comparison between changes in climate and ocean dynamics is hampered by generally low marine sedimentation rates relative to ice accumulation.\nHere we present an ultra-high resolution Nd isotope record, with an average of 164 years between samples, reconstructing past changes in ocean circulation from MIS 6 to the present. The Nd isotope measurements were made on uncleaned planktonic foraminifera, recording bottom water composition changes (Roberts et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2012), on a high sedimentation rate core (average 24 cm/kyr) taken from the Bermuda Rise (33°N, 57°W, 4500m) to the west of the Deep Western Boundary Current. Such high resolution allows for detailed reconstruction of millennial and centennial-scale deep ocean circulation events and statistical comparison with Greenland and Antarctic ice core records as well as other terrestrial climate records.",

            "abstract": "Agriculture and the monsoon are inextricably linked in India. A large part of the steady rise in agricultural production since the onset of the Green Revolution in the 1960’s has been attributed to irrigation. Irrigation is used to supplement and buffer crops against precipitation shocks, but water availability for such use is itself sensitive to the erratic, seasonal and spatially heterogeneous nature of the monsoon. We provide new evidence on the relationship between monsoon changes, irrigation variability and water availability by linking a process based hydrology model with an econometric model for one of the world’s most water stressed countries. India uses more groundwater for irrigation than any other country, and there is substantial evidence that this has led to depletion of groundwater aquifers. First, we build an econometric model of historical irrigation decisions using detailed agriculture and weather data spanning 35 years. Multivariate regression models reveal that for crops grown in the wet season, irrigation is sensitive to distribution and total monsoon rainfall but not to ground or surface water availability. For crops grown in the dry season, total monsoon rainfall matters most, and its effect is sensitive to groundwater availability. The historical estimates from the econometric model are used to calculate future irrigated areas under three different climate model predictions of monsoon climate for the years 2010 – 2050. These projections are then used as input to a physical hydrology model, which quantifies supply of irrigation water from sustainable sources such as rechargeable shallow groundwater, rivers and reservoirs, to unsustainable sources such as non- rechargeable groundwater. We find that the significant variation in monsoon projections lead to very different results. Crops grown in the dry season show particularly divergent trends between model projections, leading to very different groundwater resource requirements.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause is characterized by asymmetry of the plasmas involved. On one side, there is the shocked plasma of the sheath coming from the solar wind, and, on the other, the energetic plasma drifting from the magnetosphere towards the magnetopause. Recent studies have pointed that, in addition to the high-energy (~104 eV) ions from the latter plasma, relevant amounts of positive low-energy ions (with energies below the equivalent spacecraft potential, i.e. below ~5-10 eV) are frequently present on the magnetospheric side of reconnection layer. These ions have small enough gyroradius to ExB drift inside the thin separatrix layer, and can modify processes in the layer. We use Cluster observations near the subsolar point to study the role of these low-energy ions at the magnetopause when reconnection is occurring. The presence of low-energy ions can be detected by observing a local wake electric field caused by a supersonic flow of low-energy ions passed a charged spacecraft. The density of these ions can be estimated by comparing the total density obtained from the plasma frequency or the spacecraft potential with observations by particle detectors of ions with high enough energy to reach the spacecraft. The dataset employed (2008) permits to resolve the current at scales below the ion inertial length (c/ωpi) in the direction normal to the magnetopause. The terms jxB/en, -vxB and  ∇ pe/en are compared in the thin layers with strong En fields observed during the magnetopause crossings. It is clear that the presence of low-energy ions modifies the reconnection process, since in some cases they are able to balance the whole En term via the -vxB drift without the need of jxB/en.",

            "abstract": "The Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya‘aqov (GBY), located in the Hula Valley, northern sector of the Dead Sea transform, stretches along 3.5 km of the Jordan River and its banks. The accumulation of tilted lake-margin sediments interfingered with basalt flows began 1.1 Ma and ended after 0.6 Ma. The excavations (1989–1997) exposed 34 m thick deposits that provide unique data sets on climate, environment, biology, culture and hominin behavior. Hominin presence is known throughout the sequence, providing information on Acheulian technology and cognition along the time trajectory, but the richest sites (15 in number) occur above the M/B Chron Boundary. Reconstructions of paleoenvironment and habitats are based on fossil remains yielding an extremely rich typically Mediterranean biomass of diverse biogeographic origins. Macro and micro organic material (over 140 identified taxa) exhibits a typical Mediterranean environment similar to the extant flora, with few extinctions (20 species). The rich fossil faunal include molluscs, ostracods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, micromammals and medium-sized to large mammals (over 237 taxa), predominantly Palearctic in biogeographic origin. Many of these taxa are still extant, attesting to stable habitats and paleoclimatic conditions. Hominin occupations are documented by thousands of lithic artifacts (flint, limestone and basalt), all assigned to the Large Flake Acheulian culture. These assemblages show a continuous cultural tradition of the same tool kit along the time trajectory. The lithic reduction required developed cognitive abilities and communication abilities, interpreted as language. Evidence of hominin subsistence includes data on carcass processing including extraction of marrow, with a preference for consumption of fallow deer, elephant, hippopotamus and fish. Edible plant remains include nuts, USO, fruits, seeds and vegetables in association with stone artifacts and animal bones. Fire, present throughout, was clearly instrumental in the expansion of diet and is documented spatially. The GBY analyses provide novel evidence for hominin adaptations to a Mediterranean environment and prolonged Levantine Corridor occupations, illustrating the mechanisms of diffusion along the African Great Rift system.",

            "abstract": "The observations of substorm onset phenomena in the magnetosphere and ionosphere are examined to investigate their correlation and to understand the substorm onset mechanism. In particular, we examine the Pi2 wave structure, propagation, frequency in the magnetosphere observed by the THEMIS satellites in the near-Earth plasma sheet and the structure and propagation of the substorm auroral onset arcs. The azimuthal mode number values of the wave-like substorm arcs are found to be in the range of ~ 100 – 260 and decrease with increasing geomagnetic latitude of the substorm auroral arc location. The wave-like arc brightness structures on the substorm auroral arcs tend to move azimuthally westward, but with a few exceptions of eastward movement, during tens of seconds prior to the substorm onset. The movement of the wave-like arc brightness structure is linearly correlated with the phase velocity of the Pi2 δBy pulsations in the near-Earth plasma sheet region. The result suggests that the Pi2 transverse δBy disturbances are related to the intensifying wave-like substorm onset arcs. One plausible explanation of the observations is the kinetic ballooning instability, which has high azimuthal mode number due to the ion gyro-radius effect and finite parallel electric field that accelerates electrons into the ionosphere to produce the wave-like arc structure.",

            "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the short-term temporal pattern of seafloor gas emissions may be largely driven by tidal/barometric pressure fluctuations. However, thermal perturbations in the overlying intermediate waters are a key factor leading to gas hydrate dissociation that liberates methane to feed cold seeps near the updip limit of gas hydrate stability (GHS) on upper continental slopes. Over the past 5 years, studies have documented temperature-driven methane release at intraseasonal to century-long timescales on the West Spitsbergen margin. Our data on the US Arctic margin show that bottom water temperature (BWT) perturbations over ~2.5 months cause the theoretical updip GHS limit to migrate ~1.5 km upslope, a level of dynamism that may manifest as the observed elevated methane concentrations over the upper slope. Given the documented decades-long increase in oceanic heat content due to global warming, it is not surprising that evidence is emerging that upper slope hydrate dissociation is a global, not merely arctic, phenomenon. On the northern US Atlantic margin, most of the ~600 newly-discovered methane seeps mapped between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank occur on the upper continental slope near the updip limit of GHS (505-575 m). A BWT database based on ~35,000 CTD casts reveals subtle along-margin variations in the theoretical updip GHS limit and first-order agreement with the observed onset of seepage. Other historical datasets provide evidence for short-term BWT variations of >1ºC on the upper slope. Hudson Canyon, the largest US Atlantic margin shelf-break canyon, has reversing current patterns that amplify short-term BWT variations, making this location an apt laboratory for study of possible gas hydrate degradation processes. Hudson Canyon surveys conducted in 2014 identified dozens more seeps than the ~50 described in Skarke et al. (Fall Meeting 2013), particularly at the updip limit of GHS At this depth, CTDs show that BWTs were initially within GHS conditions and had warmed outside the GHS limit in <2 days. Such rapid BWT fluctuations have important implications for the upper slope gas hydrate dynamics, variations in the amount of previously-sequestered methane available for release at seeps, and periodic clogging and re-opening of seep conduits as gas hydrate forms and breaks down.",

            "abstract": "The major contribution to global mean sea level (GMSL) change under contemporary climate conditions involves thermal expansion of the ocean and outflow from the land ice, with the latter increasing more rapidly in percentage as a form of ice sheets. Current earth system models (EMS) can constrain thermal expansion with high confidence in projections; however, few of them have been successfully coupled to an ice sheet model (ISM) to incorporate future evolution of ice sheets. In this study, a coupled EMS - ISM is applied to estimate potential range of their contribution to GMSL change over the next several centuries, by simulating the new emission scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Our results indicate that the thermal contribution to GMSL rise still dominants within this century, with up to 0.4 m in the highest CO2 case, and continue to increase for many centuries even after stabilization of CO2. This increase can reach to almost 3.5 m GMSL rise by the end of 25th century in RCP8.5, when equivalent CO2 concentration exceeds 2500 ppm. Nevertheless, over longer time scales, GMSL contribution from ice sheets enhances more dramatically than linearly with increase in temperature and can eventually overweigh thermal contribution after 24th century. This contribution mainly results from a negative surface mass balance (SMB) of Greenland ice sheet and can exceed 4 m GMSL rise in RCP8.5. Projection of Antarctic SMB demonstrates a negative contribution to GMSL rise in all scenarios except RCP8.5, in which it can lead to more than 2 m GMSL rise. Moreover, we emphasize that sea level change contribution from these two effects exhibits substantial regional pattern, which requires more comprehensive attention from the policy makers to make their plan against this issue in the future.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions regularly eject large quantities of ash particles into the atmosphere, which can be deposited via fallout into oceanic environments. Such fallout has the potential to alter pH, light and nutrient availability at local or regional scales. Shallow-water coral reef ecosystems – \"rainforests of the sea\" – are highly sensitive to disturbances, such as ocean acidification, sedimentation and eutrophication. Therefore, ash deposition may lead to burial and mortality of such reefs. Coral reef ecosystem resilience may depend on pioneer bacterial colonisation of the ash layer, supporting subsequent establishment of the micro- and ultimately the macro-community. However, it is currently unknown which bacteria are involved in pioneer colonisation. We hypothesize that physico-chemical properties (i.e., morphology, chemistry, mineralogy) of the ash may dictate bacterial colonisation. We have tested the effect of substrate properties on bacterial diversity and abundance colonising five substrates: i) quartz sand ii) crystalline ash from the Sakurajima volcano (Japan) iii) volcanic glass iv) carbonate reef sand and v) calcite sand of similar grain size - by incubation in a controlled marine mesocosm (coral reef aquarium) under low light conditions for three months. Bacterial communities were screened every month by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis of the 16S-23S rRNA Internal Transcribed Spacer region. Multivariate statistics revealed discrete groupings of bacterial communities on substrates of volcanic origin (ash and glass) and reef origin (three sands). Analysis Of Similarity supports significantly different communities associated with all substrates (p=0.0001), only quartz did not differ from both carbonate and calcite sands. The ash substrate exhibited the most diverse bacterial community and carried the most substrate-specific bacterial operational taxonomic units. Our findings suggest that bacterial diversity and community composition during colonisation of volcanic ash in a coral reef-like environment is controlled by the physico-chemical composition of the substrate. Knowledge on pioneer bacterial colonisation may increase our understanding on the resilience of coral reefs to natural \"catastrophes\", such as volcanic ash fallout.",

            "abstract": "Drought has a major impact on natural and social resources, and is caused by a prolonged deficit in available water. Possible impacts of drought are crop losses, famine, fatalities, power black outs and degraded ecosystems. This shows the need to carefully monitor drought conditions using the appropriate droughts indicators. The indicators should consider differences in drought-generating processes resulting in drought in different components of terrestrial water cycle. The objective of this study is to compare which indicators can be used for monitoring drought in each part of the terrestrial water cycle. A selection of frequently used indicators for different drought types (e.g. SPI for different accumulation periods, PDSI, threshold approach), was used to investigate potential to monitor drought on a global scale. Correlation (R) between indicators was calculated for the major climates and for the whole globe to quantify the unique information content of each indicator and their interchangeability to be used for different drought types. It was found that indicators used to monitor precipitation drought show low correlations (R = 0-0.35) although most of them are calculated in a similar way (e.g. SPI-1 and SPI-3). Indicators for soil moisture drought are more similar (R = 0.2-0.6), while indicators for streamflow drought show the highest correlation (R = 0.5-0.95). Additionally, meteorological drought indicators are not capable to correctly describe soil moisture (R = 0.1-0.6) nor streamflow drought (R = 0-0.4). These findings have implications for drought monitoring systems: (i) for each drought type, which is associated with one or more impacted sectors, a different indicator should carefully be identified; (ii) combined drought indicators are hard to be linked to a specific impact. In addition, studies on trends in drought or projections of future drought should be specific on the drought type to reduce the current confusion in how drought has developed or will develop.",

            "abstract": "Delays of seismic P waves are used to make scans or 3D images of the variations in seismic wave speed in the Earth's interior using the techniques of seismic tomography. Observations of such delays are ubiquitous on the continents but rare in oceanic regions, mostly because of the large cost associated with deploying ocean-bottom seismometers. At the same time, several thousand free-drifting profiling floats measure the temperature, salinity and current of the upper 2000 m of the ocean in the Argo program, but are incapable to record and transmit seismic signals.\nSimons et al. (JGR, 2009) developed the idea to use such floats in order to compensate for the lack of seismic delay observations, especially in the southern hemisphere. We built and tested a prototype of such a seismological sensor using an Apex float from Teledyne Webb Research, a Rafos hydrophone, and electronics developed in collaboration with Osean. Since 2012, these floats have been deployed in the Mediterranean, in the South Indian Ocean, and more recently near the Galapagos islands in the Pacific (see abstract by Nolet et al.).\nA new prototype \" MultiMermaid \" spherical is at present in final phase of validation. Using a 37\" glass sphere, the lithium battery capacity is greatly superior to that of the Mermaid. It has an instrument compartment that allows for multidisciplinary observations (seismic and kHz acoustics, magnetic field, temperature, bathymetry) and will be programmable. The maximum depth will be 3-4 km. Battery consumption by the pump has been reduced, and the durability depends mostly on CPU usage while drifting, amount of data transmitted but should be five years or more. The Multimermaid can serve biologists by providing a global monitoring of whale and dolphin sounds, seismic tomography by providing worldwide coverage of P wave arrival times, and oceanographers by providing ocean temperature, bathymetry and information on deep currents. Based on an ARM-Cortex M4 microprocessor, Multimermaid can accept any new features such as the possibility of a local rapid response network in which the instruments locate themselves while under water, and provided the possibility for users to modify monitoring software after deployment. In order to extend the life time of Multimermaid we are also investigating to add an optional green renewable power source.",

These can be addressed through statistical downscaling or bias correction. Techniques have been developed to address biases at a range of time scales however these are generally applied to individual grid cells. A review of biases in a number of climate models shows that there is a clear spatial structure to the biases. In addition, many hydrological applications introduce additional spatial structure to the analyses. Therefore I propose a spatial model of bias as an extension to existing bias correction approaches. By considering the biases in space, uncertainty in the bias parameters can be reduced. The new method leads to improvements in the bias correction results.

            "abstract": "The Shackleton Site (IODP Expedition 339 Site U1385), located off the West-Portuguese Margin, preserves a continuous high-fidelity record of millennial-scale climate variability for the last several glacial cycles (~1.4 Myr) that can be correlated precisely to patterns observed in polar ice cores. In addition, rapid delivery of terrestrial material to the deep-sea environment allows the correlation of these marine records to European terrestrial climate records. This unique marine-ice-terrestrial linkage makes the Shackleton Site the ideal reference section for studying Quaternary abrupt climate change. The main objective of studying site U1385 is to establish a marine reference section of Pleistocene climate change. We generated millennial-scale dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblage records from the Shackleton Site (IODP Expedition 339) to reconstruct upwelling, sea surface temperature (SST) and productivity across the last two glacial-interglacial cycles. We quantify the validity of dinocyst-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on multivariate statistics on dinocyst assemblages and multi-proxy data from regional core-tops and the last glacial cycle. This allows us to conclude that the strength of the West Iberian Margin upwelling system changed from relatively intense upwelling during the last glacial to upwelling relaxation during the Holocene as a result of reduced (strength of the) Portuguese trade winds. Secondly, SST, productivity/upwelling, strength of Portuguese trade winds and climate on the Iberian Peninsula co-vary on stadial-interstadial timescales and correspond to Greenland stadial-interstadial variability (δ18O). Finally, we will present a long-term paleoceanographic perspective down to ~120 ka.",

            "abstract": "Mermaids have been developed to improve seismic data coverage in the oceanic domain for imaging of the Earth's interior. Though housed in conventional Argo-type floats, hardware and software was developed to analyze acoustic signals and determine whether an earthquake has been recorded, and whether the Mermaid should to come up to the surface and transmit to the satellite. In contrast to the passive Argo floats, Mermaids are essentially floating computers that decide for themselves what to do.\nAfter testing in the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean and improving the concept for more than a year, we recently started two fully scientific experiments using Mermaids. In cooperation with Inocar, we deployed a fleet of 10 Mermaids in May 2014 around the Galapagos islands from the LAE Sirius to study the suspected mantle plume beneath these islands. We are interested in plumes because we do not understand very well how the mantle has retained an almost constant temperature for three or four billion years, an essential condition for life to develop. The depth of mantle plumes is an important unknown, because it may tell us how well the lower mantle is able to transmit heat into the upper mantle.\nA second experiment is taking place in the Ligurian Sea. This basin opened with a rifting phase in late Oligocene. The rifting phase of the Ligurian basin is followed by the Corsica - Sardinia block counterclockwise rotation, but the deeper causes of this are still poorly understood. Three Mermaids are deployed, and re-deployed after drifting too far west, to augment the P arrivals observed for 6 months with 5 OBS’s during the 2008 Grosmarin campaign.\nThe experience obtained with this first generation of Mermaids has led to the development of a new multidisciplinary float (Multimermaid), which is programmable, able to carry up to 8 sensors to a depth of 3000 m, and with a duration of at least five years.",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetic data from Laurentia and Baltica continents suggest fast large oscillations of the virtual geomagnetic poles (VGP) from high to low latitudes during the Ediacaran (635-542 Ma). These data are interpreted in the literature either as oscillations of the Earth magnetic dipole between polar and equatorial positions, or as True Polar Wander (TPW), implying a very fast tumbling of continents and perhaps, of whole Earth. In this study, we try to test these hypotheses by bringing new paleomagnetic data on volcanic series from another continent, the West African Craton (WAC). We have sampled well dated pyroclastic and lava flows from the Ouarzazate and Taroudant groups in the Anti-Atlas, (Morocco). 480 samples from 105 sites were thermally demagnetized in our laboratory. Our preliminary results highlight two major groups of directions, mainly carried by hematite, magnetite also contributing sometimes to the magnetization. The first group consists of a dual polarity high inclination direction that may represent the original magnetization. The observed paleolatitude is compatible with that predicted by the lower Cambrian-Ediacaran apparent polar wander path (APWP) of Gondwana, assuming that the WAC was already accreted to Gondwana at this age. Nevertheless, a complete agreement between our pole and the APWP needs a local rotation of around 80° on a vertical axis. The second group displays a single polarity direction, with a shallow inclination and a south-east declination. This direction is close to the expected direction derived from the Permo-Carboniferous segment of the Gondwana APWP, and may represent a remagnetization acquired during the Kiaman reversed polarity superchron. Our preliminary paleomagnetic results thus display large changes in the VGP position, as also evidenced by others on Baltica and Laurentia. However, their interpretation does not favor TPW episodes or equatorial Earth magnetic dipole during the lower Cambrian-Ediacaran periods, but localized contamination of the original directions by Late Hercynian remagnetizations.",

Since DYNMO monitored the MJO behavior for only a few months, it is important to know how the DYNAMO-recorded characteristics compare to the long-term climatology, such as viewed by TRMM satellite measurements. TRMM observations are also capable of providing the regional variability of the convection as the MJO envelope propagates eastward. The objective of this study is to quantify MJO convective characteristics using 15 years of TRMM satellite measurements over three specific regions affected by the MJO including the CIO, Maritime Continent (MC), and Western Pacific (WP). TRMM data are used to quantify not only the precipitating cloud population categorized by radar echo tops and feature size (as have been previously documented), but also their convective intensity, lightning activity, precipitation structures, bulk microphysical properties, and rainfall contributions. Specifically, the radar, ice scattering (microwave), and lightning observations from TRMM are analyzed for the convective spectrum as a function of MJO stage and geographical location. Furthermore, radar characteristics of MJO events based on TRMM PR are quantitatively compared to that of the shipborne radars deployed during TOGA COARE over the WP and DYNAMO over the CIO.",

            "abstract": "The 2011-2012 eruption at Cordón-Caulle, Chile, afforded the opportunity to observe and measure active rhyolitic lava for the first time. In 2012 and 2013, ~2500 photos were acquired on foot, parallel to flow fronts on the north and north-east of the flow field. Image suites were then processed into 3-D point clouds using Structure-from-Motion Multi-view Stereo (SfM-MVS) freeware. Interpolating these clouds into digital elevation models for dates in 2012–13 enabled analysis of the changing flow field dimensions [1], from which velocity, depth and rheological parameters, e.g.viscosity, could be estimated [see Fig. 1].\nViscosities ranged from 7.5 x109 to 1.1 x1011Pa s, allowing for uncertainties in slope, surface displacement and velocity. Temperatures were modeled using a 1D finite difference method; in concert with viscosities of flow units these values compared well with published non-Arrhenian viscosity models. Derived thermodynamic and force ratios confirmed flow characteristics inferred from the image analyses. SfM-MVS represents an effective method of quantifying and displaying variation in the flow field, indicating several parallels between rhyolite emplacement and that of low-silica lavas.\nInitially channelised lava spread laterally and stagnated due to topography and the influence of the surface crust. Continued effusion resulted in iterative emplacement of breakout lobes, promoting lateral extension of the flow field. Insulation of the flow core by the viscous crust allowed this process to continue after effusion had ceased, creating features comparable to low-silica lavas, despite high viscosity and low effusion rates. This suggests that compound flow emplacement may be described by universal, cross-compositional models encompassing rheological differences of many orders of magnitude.\nTuffen et al. 2013, Nat.

            "abstract": "Accurate stream flow forecasts are critical for reservoir operations for water supply planning. As the world urban population increases, the demand for water in cities is also increasing, making accurate forecasts even more important. However, accurate forecasting of stream flows is difficult owing to short- and long-term weather variations.\nWe propose to reduce this need for accurate stream flow forecasts by augmenting reservoir operations with seawater desalination and wastewater recycling. We develop a robust operating policy for the joint operation of the three sources. With the joint model, we tap into the unlimited reserve of seawater through desalination, and make use of local supplies of wastewater through recycling. However, both seawater desalination and recycling are energy intensive and relatively expensive. Reservoir water on the other hand, is generally cheaper but is limited and variable in its availability, increasing the risk of water shortage during extreme climate events.\nWe operate the joint system by optimizing it using a genetic algorithm to maximize water supply reliability and resilience while minimizing vulnerability subject to a budget constraint and for a given stream flow forecast. To compute the total cost of the system, we take into account the pumping cost of transporting reservoir water to its final destination, and the capital and operating costs of desalinating seawater and recycling wastewater. We produce results for different hydro climatic regions based on artificial stream flows we generate using a simple hydrological model and an autoregressive time series model. The artificial flows are generated from precipitation and temperature data from the Canadian Regional Climate model for present and future scenarios. We observe that the joint operation is able to effectively minimize the negative effects of stream flow forecast uncertainty on system performance at an overall cost that is not significantly greater than the cost of a stand-alone reservoir system.",

            "abstract": "Human activity is known to be increasing the fluxes of many nutrients and trace elements in many river systems. However, the impact of riverine inputs depends not only on the riverine nutrient flux, but also on its retention in estuaries and near shore coastal systems. The retention of nutrients and trace elements in coastal systems depends at least in part on particle water interactions. These interactions in turn depend on the physical configuration of the system which regulates processes such as resuspension and water-sediment interactions. Human activity is massively altering the shape of many estuaries by activities such as reclamation and flood defence. These changes have obvious and well documented ecological impacts. I will show using examples from UK systems how these changes in estuarine “geography” also greatly alter the effectiveness of estuaries as filters for nutrients and trace elements, with the potential to have a major impact on the fluxes of fluvial material to the continental shelf on regional scales. Rising sea levels are beginning to enforce a change of management strategy in coastal systems and this in turn may have major impacts on estuarine nutrient retention.",

Imaging allows the spatial sampling to be improved by up to an order of magnitude when compared to a limb scanning instrument. GLORIA is designed to operate on various high altitude research platforms. The instrument is a joint development of the German Helmholtz Large Research Facilities Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and Research Centre Juelich (FZJ). GLORIA builds upon the heritage of KIT and FZJ in developing and operating IR limb sounders (MIPAS, CRISTA).\nIn Summer 2012, GLORIA was an integral part of the first large missions for the German research aircraft HALO dedicated to atmospheric research, TACTS and ESMVAL. The data span latitudes from 80°N to 65°S and include several tomographic flight patterns that allow the 3-D reconstruction of observed air masses.\nWe provide an overview of the heterogeneous structure of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) as observed over Europe. Retrieved water vapor and ozone are used to identify the tropospheric or stratospheric character of air masses and can thus be used to visualize the multi-species 2-D (and partly 3-D) chemical structure of the UTLS. A highly intricate structure is found consisting often of fine-scale layers extending only several hundred meters in the vertical. These horizontally large-scale structures are thus below the typical vertical resolution of current chemistry climate models.\nTrajectory studies reveal the origin of the filaments to be Rossby wave-breaking events over the Pacific and Atlantic that cause tropical air stemming from the general area of the Asian monsoon to be mixed across the jet-stream into the subtropical lowermost stratosphere.\nThese results demonstrate a rich spatial structure of the UTLS region at the subtropical jet, where the tropopause break is perturbed by breaking Rossby waves. The frequency of such observations seems to indicate that such a highly heterogeneous state is a regular occurrence for the UTLS in summer over Europe. Further tomographic processing of GLORIA data will deliver further 3-D snapshots of stirred filaments.",

We first obtained a 1D minimum model with Velest code in order to obtain an initial model for 3D inversion with 648 well located earthquakes located within the study area. After several 3D inversion trials we decided to create a more adequate initial model for 3D inversion. Choosing the initial model we estimated the 3D P wave velocity model representing the whole region both for land and sea. The results are tested by making Checkerboard , Restoring Resolution and Characteristic Tests, and the reliable areas of the resulting model is defined in terms of RDE, DWS, SF and Hit count distributions. By taking cross sections from the resulting model we observed the vertical velocity change along profiles crossing both land and sea. All the profiles crossing the basins showed that the high velocities of lower crust make extensions towards the basin area which looks like the force that gives a shape to the basins. These extensions of lower crust towards the basins appeared with an average velocity of 6.3 km/s which might be the result of the deformation due the shearing in the region. It is also interpreted that the development of these high velocities coincide with the development of the basins. Thus, both the basins and the high velocity zones around them might be resulted from the entrance of the NAF into the Marmara Sea and at the same time a shear regime was dominated due to the resistance of the northern Marmara Region (Yılmaz, 2010). The seismicity is observed between 5 km and 15 km after the 3D location of the earthquakes. The locations of the earthquakes improved and the seismogenic zone is well determined between 5 km and 15 km. The depths of the pre-kinematic basement and crystalline basement showed great differences under the sea. It is observed that the velocity under sea becomes compatible with land after 8 km.",

            "abstract": "Alumina and silica are major oxides in most crustal rocks. While SiO2 is quite soluble in aqueous fluids at metamorphic conditions, behavior of Al2O3 in crustal metamorphic fluids has been poorly understood. It is known that alumina is dramatically less soluble in aqueous fluids and hence it is difficult to explain the common occurrence of quartz with aluminous minerals in metamorphic veins. In order to understand this complex behavior of alumina, we investigated aluminum speciation in aqueous fluids in equilibrium with corundum using in situ Raman spectroscopy in hydrothermal diamond anvil cells to 20 kbar and 1000 oC. In order to better understand the spectral features of the aqueous fluids, we used first principles simulations based on density functional theory to calculate and predict the energetics and vibrational spectra for various aluminum species that are likely to be present in aqueous solutions. The Raman spectra of pure water in equilibrium with Al2O3 are devoid of any characteristic spectral features. In contrast, aqueous fluids with KOH solution in equilibrium with Al2O3 show a sharp band at ~620 cm-1 which could be attributed to the [Al(OH)4]1- species. The band grows in intensity with temperature along an isochore. In the limited pressure, temperature and density explored in the present study, we do not find any evidence for the polymerization of the [Al(OH)4]1- species to dimers [(OH)2-Al-O2-Al(OH)2]2- or [(OH)3-Al-O-Al(OH)3]2-. This is likely due to the relatively low concentration of Al in the solutions and does not rule out significant polymerization at higher pressures and temperatures. We are also investigating the effect of SiO2 on the solubility of Al2O3 and the relative energetics of formation of pure alumina dimer [(OH)3-Al-O-Al(OH)3]2- vs. the aluminosilicate dimers, [(OH)3-Al-O-Si(OH)3]2- at deep crustal conditions.\nAcknowledgement- MM is supported by the US National Science Foundation grant (EAR-1250477).",

            "abstract": "The peculiar K-shape of Sulawesi has been the subject of geological interest for many years. The east-west trend of the North Arm is commonly considered to have formed by crustal shortening of an intra-oceanic arc built on Eocene ocean crust. However, recent onshore and offshore geological studies suggest an important role for Neogene extension.\nField mapping and dating of the pre-Neogene basement indicates that Sulawesi’s North Arm constitutes more than a simple oceanic arc. Paleogene granites in this region suggest the basement includes either evolved arc crust or continental crust. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of zircons shows that Paleogene granites have few inherited ages whereas Neogene granites contain Palaeozoic and Proterozoic inherited zircon cores, suggesting melting of Australian continental crust. Biostratigraphic dating of Neogene shallow marine sedimentary rocks on land indicates two distinct periods of sedimentation: Middle Miocene and Late Miocene–Pliocene. Field observations and remote sensing interpretation identify two major fault trends: E–W Neogene basin-bounding faults and young NW-SE strike-slip faults.\nOffshore seismic surveys show several major sequences separated by regional unconformities in Gorontalo Bay, south of the North Arm, where there was deposition of more than 6 km of sediments. We correlate the thickest package south of the central North Arm, up to 5 sec TWT, with thick marine reworked volcanic ash deposits of Pliocene age mapped on land in the North Arm, on the Togian Islands in Gorontalo Bay, and in the East Arm of Sulawesi.\nWe interpret the land and offshore record to indicate arc-continent collision and underthrusting of Australian crust in the Early Miocene (c.22 Ma). There were several subsequent episodes of extension. A metamorphic core complex formed on land in the Middle Miocene (c.15 Ma), and later renewed extension was linked to initiation of southward subduction of the Celebes Sea in the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene (c.5 Ma).",

Teleseismic P-to-S receiver functions have been widely used to map the depths of the two discontinuities. In this study, we investigate the resolution of receiver functions in imaging topographic variations of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities based on wave propagation simulations using the Spectral Element Method (SEM). We investigate finite-frequency effects of direct P waves as well as P-to-S converted waves by varying the length scale of discontinuity topography in the transition zone. We show that wavefront healing effects are significant in broadband receiver functions. For example, at a period of 10 to 20 seconds, the arrival anomaly in P-to-S converted waves is about 50% of what predicted by ray theory when the topography length scale is in the order of 400 km. The observed arrival anomaly further reduces to 10-20% when the topography length scale reduces to about 200 km. We calculate 2-D boundary sensitivity kernels for direct P waves as well as receiver functions based on surface wave mode summation and confirm that finite frequency-effects can be properly accounted for. Three-dimensional wavespeed structure beneath seismic stations can also introduce significant artifacts in transition zone discontinuity topography if time corrections are not applied, and, the effects are dependent on frequency.",

The injection of mafic magmas into felsic magma chambers is widely regarded as a key driver in the sudden triggering of what often become highly explosive volcanic eruptions. Understanding the mechanistic chain leading to such hazardous events is the goal of the present study of the morphochemistry of mingled lavas. This study involves the combination of X-ray microtomographic and electron microprobe analyses, to unravel the complex textures and attendant chemical heterogeneities of the mixed basaltic and rhyolitic eruption of Grizzly Lake in the Norris-Mammoth corridor of the Yellowstone Plateau Volcanic Field (YPVF). We observe that both magmatic viscous interfingering and disequilibrium crystallization/dissolution processes provide vital information on the timescale of interaction between the two magmatic components prior to the eruption. Mixed rocks in the YPVF appear to have a complicated history and evolution. Therefore a very considerable amount of chemical analysis was employed here. In addition, X-ray microtomography images show variegated textural features, such as vesicle and crystal distributions, filament morphology, the distribution of enclaves, and further textural features otherwise obscured in a simple 2D analyses. Here most effort was applied to the determination of the characterisation of mixing end members. Nevertheless, analysis of the hybrid portion has led to the unexpected discovery that mixing in the Grizzly Lake system was also characterised by the disintegration/dissolution of mafic crystals into the rhyolitic magma. The results of this study expose the complexity of mixing in natural magmatic systems, identifying several textural reactive factors that must be understood more deeply for our understanding of this potential eruptive trigger to proceed.",

            "abstract": "Microtomography provides detailed 3D internal structures of rocks in micro- to tens of nano-meter resolution and is quickly turning into a new technology for studying petrophysical properties of materials. An important step is the upscaling of these properties as micron or sub-micron resolution can only be done on the sample-scale of millimeters or even less than a millimeter. We present here a recently developed computational workflow for the analysis of microstructures including the upscaling of material properties. Computations of properties are first performed using conventional material science simulations at micro to nano-scale. The subsequent upscaling of these properties is done by a novel renormalization procedure based on percolation theory. We have tested the workflow using different rock samples, biological and food science materials. We have also applied the technique on high-resolution time-lapse synchrotron CT scans.\nIn this contribution we focus on the computational challenges that arise from the big data problem of analyzing petrophysical properties and its subsequent upscaling. We discuss the following challenges:\n1) Characterization of microtomography for extremely large data sets – our current capability.\n2) Computational fluid dynamics simulations at pore-scale for permeability estimation – methods, computing cost and accuracy.\n3) Solid mechanical computations at pore-scale for estimating elasto-plastic properties – computational stability, cost, and efficiency.\n4) Extracting critical exponents from derivative models for scaling laws – models, finite element meshing, and accuracy.\nSignificant progress in each of these challenges is necessary to transform microtomography from the current research problem into a robust computational big data tool for multi-scale scientific and engineering problems.",

            "abstract": "About 30% of the landscape of northern Alberta, Canada is occupied by peatlands, which persist at the low end range of both mean annual precipitation (<500 mm/yr) and mean annual atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition (< 1 kg/ha/yr) across which peatlands are found globally. Ombrotrophic bogs in this region function as a net sink for atmospheric CO2 of over 75 g/m2/yr, taking into consideration changes in CO2 sink strength as a function of time since fire. In addition to fire, a new disturbance is emerging in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of northern Alberta, where development of the oil sands resource has increased atmospheric N deposition to as much as 2.5 kg/ha/yr. To examine the effects of elevated N deposition on bog C cycling, we experimentally applied N (as NH4NO3 solutions) to replicated plots at levels equivalent to 0 (water added with no N), 10, and 20 kg/ha/yr, and controls (no waher, no N added) at five bog sites, aged at 2, 12, 32, 73, and 113 years since fire in 2013 (6 plots per N treatment per site). Understory net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was measured repeatedly throughout the 2013 and 2014 growing season (and in 2011 and 2012 at the most recently burned site) using the closed chamber approach. Using a rectangular hyperbola equation to characterize NEE as a function of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and near-surface air temperature (T), monthly and annual NEE was estimated based on hourly measurements of PAR and T at each site. Across all sites, a general pattern emerged that N additions enhanced the net CO2 sink strength of the bogs, with no effect on ecosystem respiration. Net primary production of Sphagnum fuscum, the dominant peat-forming moss, was not affected by N addition, suggesting that the overall response of NEE to N addition is the result of enhanced growth of ericaceous shrubs. These findings suggest that while elevated N deposition in the AOSR may enhance the strength of the overall CO2 sink of bogs in the short term, in the longer term, increased shrub growth has the potential to shade Sphagnum mosses, compromising the future bog CO2sink strength across the region.",

            "abstract": "Model spin-up is the process through which the model is adequately equilibrated to ensure balance between the mass fields and velocity fields. In this study, an offline 1-D Noah land surface model (LSM) has been used to investigate the impact of soil moisture on the model spin up at Kharagpur, India which is a site in monsoonal region. The model is integrated recursively for 3-years to assess its spin-up behavior. Several numerical experiments are performed to investigate the impact of initial soil moisture and subsequent dry or wet condition on model spin-up. These include simulations with different initial soil moisture content (observed soil moisture; dry soil; moderately wet soil; saturated soil), simulations initialized before different rain conditions (no rain; infrequent rain; continuous rain) and simulations initialized in different seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer/Pre-Monsoon, Monsoon and Autumn). It is noted that the model has significantly longer spin-up when initialized with very low initial soil moisture content than with higher soil moisture content. It is also seen that in general, simulations initialized just before a continuous rainfall event have the least spin-up time. In a region affected by the monsoon, such as Kharagpur, this observation is reinforced by the results from the simulations initialized in different seasons. It is seen that for monsoonal region, the model spin-up time is least for simulations initialized during Summer/Pre-monsoon. Model initialized during the Monsoon has a longer spin-up than that initialized in any other season. It appears that the model has shorter spin-up if it reaches the equilibrium state predominantly via drying process. It is also observed that the spin-up of offline 1-D Noah LSM may be as low as two months under quasi-equilibrium condition if the initial soil moisture content and time of start of simulations are chosen carefully.",

            "abstract": "The recent results obtained from a 6.7 m-long piston-core (MS06), collected 2.3 km offshore Augusta at a water depth of 72 m and made of an almost homogeneous dark gray mud dated back to the last 4500 yrs, stimulated our curiosity in searching for other similar signatures. In fact, quantitative micropaleontological analysis of benthic foraminifera assemblages highlighted 12 anomalous intervals, marked by peaks with high percentages of displaced epiphytic specimens and an increase in the sandy component. These anomalies were generally accompanied by a significant amount of Posidonia remnants, a localized concentration of molluscs and organic-rich bands. Thus, the twelve anomalous peaks were interpreted as the primary effect of tsunami waves (back-wash). Moreover, five out of the twelve anomalous layers were embedded in age intervals encompassing the dates of major tsunamis that hit eastern Sicily (1908, 1693, and 1169) and the broader Eastern Mediterranean (AD 365 Crete and Santorini at about BP 3600).\nSeven additional cores were sampled from the northern part of the Augusta Bay, along a transect 60 to 110 m of water depth, to retrieve the details of the MS06 sequence uppermost part. Four out of the seven new cores were selected and studied. Preliminary dating suggests that the sampled sequence spans ca. 400-500 yrs. Moreover, physical properties, ITRAX X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and grain size analyses point out the presence of a peculiar interval made of Posidonia remnants, coarse sand and shell debris on the two cores closer to the shore. The two far-off cores seem to be more homogenous but a few thin sandy lenses enriched of Posidonia remnant were also recognized. Further detailed micropaleontological analysis and corroboration with instrumental data are still in progress and will help in discriminating single events potentially related to tsunami back-wash.",

            "abstract": "Low clouds have a major impact on the radiative balance of the earth, in particular in tropical areas. The Southern West Africa (SWA) area encounters during boreal summer frequent formations of stratus and/or cumulus clouds over a large extent. These cloud bands, still badly represented in climatic models, can lead to large errors in the estimation of the cloud radiative forcing. Moreover, these cloud bands can evolve or not in cumulus congestus clouds leading to precipitations.\nThe SWA area is characterized by a large diversity of natural and anthropic emissions of gaseous chemical species and aerosol particles. These emissions have a potential large impact on the number concentration and chemical composition of aerosol particles over the SWA zone. This impact is direct through emissions of primary particles, and indirect through the formation of secondary particles from gaseous precursors. A part of these particles will act as cloud condensation nuclei, thus, influencing the cloud microphysics characteristics. In order to improve our understanding of these complex processes, an airborne campaign is planed in summer 2015 over SWA zone in the framework of the European project DACCIWA (Dynamics-aerosol-chemistry-cloud interactions in West Africa).\nTo prepare the campaign and begin to investigate the cloud-chemistry-aerosols interactions, a LES simulation on a case study designed from an AMMA (African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses) case has been performed with the 3D online-chemistry Meso-NH model. The LES simulation captures the chemical segregation due to thermals in the rising convective boundary layer. Comparing simulation with or without cloud chemistry highlights the effect of aqueous phase chemistry on gaseous precursors of aerosol particles.",

            "abstract": "Agadir Canyon is one of the largest submarine canyons in the World, supplying giant submarine sediment gravity flows to the Agadir Basin and the wider Moroccan Turbidite System. While the Moroccan Turbidite System is extremely well investigated, almost no data from the source region, i.e. the Agadir Canyon, are available. Understanding why some submarine landslides remain as coherent blocks of sediment throughout their passage downslope, while others mix and disintegrate almost immediately after initial failure, is a major scientific challenge, which was addressed in the Agadir Canyon source region during Cruise MSM32. We collected ~ 1500 km of high-resolution seismic 2D-lines in combination with a dense net of hydroacoustic data. About 1000 km2 of sea floor were imaged during three deployments of TOBI (deep-towed sidescan sonar operated by the National Oceanography Centre Southampton). A total of 186 m of gravity cores and several giant box cores were recovered at more than 50 stations. The new data show that Agadir canyon is the source area of the world’s largest submarine sediment flow, which occurred about 60,000 years ago. Up to 160 km3 of sediment was transported to the deep ocean in a single catastrophic event. For the first time, sediment flows of this scale have been tracked along their entire flow pathway. A major landslide area was identified south of Agadir Canyon. Landslide material enters Agadir canyon in about 2500 m water depth; the material is transported as debrite for at least another 200 km down the canyon. Initial data suggest that the last major slide from this source entered Agadir canyon at least 130,000 years ago. A large field of living deep-water corals was imaged north of Agadir canyon. To our knowledge, these are the first living cold water corals recovered off the coast of Morocco (except for the Gulf of Cadiz). They represent an important link between the known cold-water coral provinces off Mauritania and in the Gulf of Cádiz.",

            "abstract": "Glaciers and permafrost landforms in high mountain areas are of major importance for storing and providing fresh water for the surroundings, especially in arid or semi-arid areas as Central Asia. Rockglaciers have been traditionally used as landform proxies of the distribution of alpine permafrost. In the northern Tien Shan mountains, the most distinct lobes of >200 rockglaciers that we mapped from satellite imagery occur at minimum elevations between 2500 and 3700 m. However, individual and particularly low-lying lobes extend down to well below 3000 m, and seem difficult to reconcile with regional paleoclimatic fluctuations. To support ground based and satellite imagery estimates on rockglacier advances (1 to 10 m/yr) and to gain information on their morphological characteristics, we present results of terrestrial LiDAR measurements on six rockglaciers in four steep mountain valleys in the Kyrgyz and Kazakh Tien Shan. Having the ability to destabilize, and thus provide massive sediment input from hillslopes, we hypothesize that strong earthquakes may also have influenced the formation or advance of some of the region’s rockglaciers. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the tectonically active area was affected by a series of major earthquakes in the late 19th and earliest 20th centuries, which have subsequently triggered numerous landslides and rock falls. Using lichenometry, we aim to resolve age patterns on lobes of different rockglaciers located both, in the vicinity and distal from large young historic earthquakes. This method has been used successfully to reconstruct glaciation histories, and paleoseismicity. To gain information about and to compare advance histories of the rockglaciers from the relative ages of their lobes, we compiled a dataset of several thousand lichen diameter measurements of different species (e.g., Rhizocarpon geographicum, Aspicilia tianshanica, Lecanora muralis, and Xanthoria elegans). Results show that lichen age patterns vary between the different locations and support the notion that the analyzed Tien Shan rockglaciers do not record climate-driven advances exclusively. We conclude by highlighting a number of constraints that may limit the use of lichenometry for dating rockglacier advances, and scope for future research on seismic triggers.",

The authorization procedure includes assessing the leaching risk of both pesticides and their degradation products to the groundwater. There are shortcomings to the procedure, however, as revealed by the results of the Danish Pesticide Leaching Assessment Programme from the period 1990/2000 to 2012 (app. twelve years). This monitoring program has for this period assessed leaching into groundwater via the variably-saturated zone of 43 pesticides applied in accordance with current regulations on sandy and loamy agricultural fields, and 47 of their degradation products. Three types of leaching scenario were not fully captured by the authorization procedure: i) long-term leaching of degradation products of pesticides applied on potato crops cultivated in sandy soils, ii) leaching of strongly sorbing pesticides after autumn application on loamy soils, and iii) leaching of various pesticides and their degradation products following early summer application on loamy soils. The monitoring data revealed that the authorization procedure was unable to predict leaching scenarios for a number of pesticides in hydrogeological settings dominated by rapid preferential transport via e.g. biopores that bypasses the retardation (sorption and degradation) of the plow layer. Such settings are primarily present in the autumn, but can also occur during the early summer in connection with the formation of a structural seal on the soil surface.",

            "abstract": "Extensive particle-in-cell simulations of fast electron beams injected in a background magnetised plasma with a decreasing density profile were carried out. These simulations were intended to further shed light on a newly proposed mechanism for the generation of electromagnetic waves in type III solar radio bursts [1]. Here recent progress in an alternative to the plasma emission model using Particle-In-Cell, self-consistent electromagnetic wave emission simulations of solar type III radio bursts will be presented. In particular, (i) Fourier space drift (refraction) of non-gyrotropic electron beam-generated wave packets, caused by the density gradient [1,2], (ii) parameter space investigation of numerical runs [3], (iii) concurrent generation of whistler waves [4] and a separate problem of (iv) electron acceleration by Langmuir waves in a background magnetised plasma with an increasing density profile [5] will be discussed. In all considered cases the density inhomogeneity-induced wave refraction plays a crucial role. In the case of non-gyrotropic electron beam, the wave refaction transforms the generated wave packets from standing into freely escaping EM radiation. In the case of electron acceleration by Langmuir waves, a positive density gradient in the direction of wave propagation causes a decrease in the wavenumber, and hence a higher phase velocity vph=ω/k. The k-shifted wave is then subject to absorption by a faster electron by wave-particle interaction. The overall effect is an increased number of high energy electrons in the energy spectrum.\n[1] D.

Significant uncertainties surround each of these processes, especially in forested environments and chemical regimes defined by high isoprene and low NOx. During the 2013 SEAC4RS (Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys) mission, the NASA DC-8 flew a set of four low-level transects over the Ozark Mountains. Known colloquially as the “isoprene volcano,” this region is a dense oak forest with few local anthropogenic emissions. This flight afforded a unique opportunity – perhaps the first ever – to calculate eddy covariance fluxes of a wide suite of reactive gases, including isoprene and its oxidation products, H2O2, ozone and NOx. We demonstrate that synergistic information is gained when fluxes are simultaneously derived for multiple reactive species and at multiple heights in the boundary layer. These measurements can provide quantitative constraints on numerous chemical and physical parameters, including emission rates, oxidant concentrations, reaction branching ratios, deposition velocities and entrainment rates. In some instances, it is also possible to spatially resolve fluxes and derived quantities through application of wavelet transforms. As a near-direct measurement of underlying process rates, airborne flux observations may offer a powerful new tool in future efforts to improve biogenic emissions inventories, photochemical mechanisms and deposition parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "The recent tsunamigenic Tohoku earthquake (2011) strongly affirms, again, after the 26 December 2004, the necessity to open new paradigms in oceanic monitoring. Detection of ionospheric anomalies following the Sumatra earthquake tsunami (e.g., Occhipinti et al. 2006) demonstrated that ionosphere is sensitive to earthquake and tsunami propagation: ground and oceanic vertical displacement induces acoustic-gravity waves propagating within the neutral atmosphere and detectable in the ionosphere. Observations supported by modelling proved that tsunamigenic ionospheric anomalies are deterministic and reproducible by numerical modeling via the ocean/neutral-atmosphere/ionosphere coupling mechanism (Occhipinti et al., 2008). To prove that the tsunami signature in the ionosphere is routinely detected we show here perturbations of total electron content (TEC) measured by GPS and following tsunamigenic eartquakes from 2004 to 2010 (Rolland et al. 2010, Occhipinti et al., 2013, Occhipinti, 2014), nominally, Sumatra (26 December, 2004 and 12 September, 2007), Chile (14 November, 2007), Samoa (29 September, 2009) and the recent Tohoku-Oki (11 Mars, 2011). In addition to GPS/TEC observations close to the epicenter and measured by GEONET network, new exciting measurements in the far-field were performed by Airglow measurement in Hawaii: those measurements show the propagation of the IGWs induced by the Tohoku tsunami in the Pacific Ocean (Occhipinti et al., 2011). Based on the observations close to the epicenter, mainly performed by GPS networks located in Sumatra, Chile and Japan, we highlight the TEC perturbation observed within the first hour after the seismic rupture. This perturbation contains informations about the ground displacement, as well as the consequent sea surface displacement resulting in the tsunami. In this talk we present all this new tsunami observations in the ionosphere and we discuss, under the light of modelling, the potential role of ionospheric sounding in the oceanic monitoring and future tsunami warning system by GPS, Airglow and OTH radar (Coisson et al., 2011).

            "abstract": "The Truckee earthquake (9/12/1966, ML6.0) was a left-lateral event on a previously unrecognized NW-trending fault. The Prosser Creek and Boca Dams sustained damage, and the trace of the suspected causative fault passes near or through the site of the then-incomplete Stampede Dam. Another M6 earthquake occurred along the same general trend in 1948 with an epicenter in Dog Valley ~14 km to the NW of the 1966 epicenter. This trend is called the Dog Valley Fault (DVF), and its location on the ground surface is suggested by a prominent but broad zone of geomorphic lineaments near the cloud of aftershock epicenters determined for the 1966 event. Various ground effects of the 1966 event described by Kachadoorian et al. (1967) were located within this broad zone.\nThe upper shoreface of reservoirs in the Truckee-Prosser-Martis basin are now exposed due to persistent drought. We have examined fault strands in a roadcut and exposed upper shoreface adjacent to the NE abutment of Stampede Dam. These are interpreted to be small-displacement splays associated with the DVF -- perhaps elements of the DVF damage zone.\nWe have used the Seismo-Lineament Analysis Method (SLAM) to help us constrain the location of the DVF, based on earthquake focal mechanisms. Seismo-lineaments were computed, using recent revisions in the SLAM code (bearspace.baylor.edu/Vince_Cronin/www/SLAM/), for the 1966 main earthquake and for the better-recorded earthquakes of 7/3/1983 (M4) and 8/30/1992 (M3.2) that are inferred to have occurred along the DVF. Associated geomorphic analysis and some field reconnaissance identified a trend that might be associated with a fault, extending from the NW end of Prosser Creek Reservoir ~32° toward the Stampede Dam area. Triangle-strain analysis using horizontal velocities of local Plate Boundary Observatory GPS sites P146, P149, P150 and SLID indicates that the area rotates clockwise ~1-2°/Myr relative to the stable craton, as might be expected because the study area is within the Walker Lane transition zone between the Basin and Range and the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block. If the current seismogenic trace of the DVF is along the ~32° trend, perhaps the more prominent geomorphic lineaments traditionally associated with the DVF are inactive older features that are more strongly expressed on the landscape and that have rotated.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater is a vital natural resource for multiple needs, such as drinking water for the public, industrial processes, hydropower for energy companies, and irrigation for agriculture. In the UK, crop production is the largest in East Anglia, while at the same time the region is also the driest, with average annual rainfall between 560 and 720 mm (1971 to 2000). Many water catchments of East Anglia are reported as over licensed or over abstracted. Therefore, freshwater available for agricultural irrigation abstraction in this region is becoming both increasingly scarce due to competing demands, and increasingly variable and uncertain due to climate and policy changes. It is vital for water users and policy makers to understand how these factors will affect individual abstractors and water resource management at the system level. We present first results of an Agent-based Model that captures the complexity of this system as individual abstractors interact, learn and adapt to these internal and external changes.\nThe purpose of this model is to simulate what patterns of water resource management emerge on the system level based on local interactions, adaptations and behaviours, and what policies lead to a sustainable water resource management system. The model is based on an irrigation abstractor typology derived from a survey in the study area, to capture individual behavioural intentions under a range of water availability scenarios, in addition to farm attributes, and demographics. Regional climate change scenarios, current and new abstraction licence reforms by the UK regulator, such as water trading and water shares, and estimated demand increases from other sectors were used as additional input data. Findings from the integrated model provide new understanding of the patterns of water resource management likely to emerge at the system level.",

            "abstract": "The Lushan eathquake, which epicenter and focal depth were at 30.308° N, 102.888° E, and 14.0 km, is the latest intense earthquake occurring in the southwest section of the Longmenshan fault zone after the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. According to the emergency field observations, the slip distribution of the Lushan earthquake was concentrated at the hypocenter, and did not rupture to the surface(Chen et al, 2013). The rupture history constrained by inverting waveforms showed that the causative fault plane of the Lushan event is apparently not a simple extension of either the Pengguan fault or the Beichuan fault that ruptured during the 2008 Mw 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake. The focal mechanism using the Cut and paste algorithm showed this event occurred on a high dip-angle fault, but its dip angle is not steep enough to rupture the surface. All these research is not independent on the heterogeneous crust structure of the Longmenshan fault zone. A 450 km-long wide-angle reflection/refraction profile executed during September and October 2013. This experiment have provided the best opportunities to obtain better knowledge of seismic structure and properties of crust and uppermost mantle beneath the Southwest Longmenshan fault zone. This seismic profile extends from the west Sichuan Plain, through the Longmenshan Fault zone, and into the west Sichuan Plateau. We observed clear Pg, refraction Phase from the upper crust, Pi1/Pi2/Pi3, reflection/refraction Phase from intra-crust, PmP, reflection from the Moho boundary, and the Pn phase, refraction Phase from uppermost mantle. We present a hybrid tomographic and layered velocity model of the crust and uppermost mantle along the profile. The final velocity model reveals large variations both in structure and velocity, and is demonstrated that a particular model has minimum structure. The model shows the crustal thickness of the region is very variable. The Moho topography varies more than 10km in the southwest Longmenshan fault zone. In particular, the crust appears the thicken in the western Sichuan plateau, where the crust consists of average thick upper-mid crust and thicker lower crust.

This fast tool is achieved based on generalized analytical solutions in compact format derived for a set of two-dimensional advection-dispersion equations coupled with sequential first-order decay reactions in groundwater system. The performance of the developed tool is evaluated by a numerical model using a Laplace transform finite difference scheme. The results of performance evaluation indicate that the developed model is robust and accurate. The developed model is then used to fast understand the transport behavior of a four-member radionuclide decay chain. Results show that the plume extents and concentration levels of any target radionuclide are very sensitive to longitudinal, transverse dispersion, decay rate constant and retardation factor. The developed model are useful tools for rapidly assessing the ecological and environmental impact of the accidental radionuclide releases such as the Fukushima nuclear disaster where multiple radionuclides leaked through the reactor, subsequently contaminating the local groundwater and ocean seawater in the vicinity of the nuclear plant.",

            "abstract": "A complete assessment of climate change projections requires understanding the combined effects of decadal variability and long-term trends and evaluating the ability of models to simulate them. The western Amazon severe droughts of the 2000s were the result of a modest drying trend enhanced by reduced moisture transport from the tropical Atlantic. Most of the WA dry-season precipitation decadal variability is attributable to decadal fluctuations of the north-south gradient (NSG) in Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST). The observed WA and NSG decadal co-variability is well reproduced in Global Climate Models (GCMs) pre-industrial control (PIC) and historical (HIST) experiments that were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report (IPCC-AR5). This suggests that unforced or natural climate variability, characteristic of the PIC simulations, determines the nature of this coupling, as the results from HIST simulations (forced with greenhouse gases (GHG) and natural and anthropogenic aerosols) are comparable in magnitude and spatial distribution. Decadal fluctuation in the NSG also determines shifts in the probability of repeated droughts and pluvials in WA, as there is a 65% chance of 3 or more years of droughts per decade when NSG>0 compared to 18% when NSG<0. The HIST and PIC model simulations also reproduce the observed shifts in probability distribution of droughts and pluvials as a function of the NSG decadal phase, suggesting there is great potential for decadal predictability based on GCMs. Persistence of the current NSG positive phase may lead to continuing above normal frequencies of western Amazon dry-season droughts.",

            "abstract": "Ocean waves activity is a major source of micro-vibrations that travel through the solid Earth, known as microseismic noise and recorded worldwide by broadband seismometers. Storms are accepted to represent an important source of noise in the ocean basins, and thus, microseisms analysis of continuous seismic records can be used to localize the noise sources in the ocean and to follow their variations in space and time. In order to locate and quantify the noise sources in the Indian Ocean, we analyzed one year (2011) of continuous data recorded by permanent seismic stations localized in the Indian Ocean. From the Rayleigh wave polarization analysis performed at each individual stations, we retrieved the number of polarized signals in the time-frequency domain and their back-azimuths. Polarization spectra show that secondary microseisms are more polarized between 6 and 10 s of period. We observe seasonal variations in the number of polarized signals with much more detections during the austral winter. On the other hand, we do not observe seasonal variations in the noise back-azimuth directions, suggesting that the dominating microseismic noise sources are always located in the southernmost Indian Ocean, except for cyclonic episodes that are restricted in space and time. Compared to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, this Indian Ocean property can be explained by its closed geometry on the North and by the absence of large storms in the Northern part of the basin during the boreal winter. We show that the results of this polarization analysis are in good agreement with the expected source areas computed from ocean wave numerical model.",

            "abstract": "Carbonation of peridotite may be an important sink in the global carbon cycle. In some natural systems, 100% carbonation of rocks is attained via reaction-driven cracking processes. Engineered systems that emulate such processes may provide relatively inexpensive CO2capture and storage [1,2].\nVolume changes during fluid-rock reaction lead to stresses in elastic host rocks, known as the “pressure of crystallization”, that can cause fracture. Cracking can maintain or enhance permeability and reactive surface area in a positive feedback mechanism. So far, experiments on peridotite hydration or carbonation have not produced reactive cracking, possibly due to limited reactive surface area in low porosity samples. To address this, we've begun experiments on reaction (1): solid CaO + H2O = solid Ca(OH)2, with a 100% increase in the solid volume and high initial porosities (Φ).\nWe cold-pressed CaO powder to form ~20 mm long cylinders 6 mm in diameter, with initial Φ ranging from 0.36 to 0.53. These cylinders were confined in steel, and compressed with an axial load of 0.1 to 4.2 MPa while water was introduced through a micro-porous frit. Without expansion of the total volume, the reaction would stop when Φ = 0, producing Φ = 0, 2∙Φ∙VCa(OH)2+ (1-2∙Φ)∙VCaO.\nInstead, in all experiments the volume of cylinders increased with time, maintaining Φ > 20%. Experiments were stopped at reaction extents from 82 to 100% and would probably reach 100% at longer durations. The pressure of crystallization for reaction (1) is then > 4.2 MPa. Experiments performed on boreholes containing demolition mortar, largely CaO, demonstrate that this pressure is sufficient to break rocks [3].\nReaction (1) is rapid, which allowed us to perform numerous experiments but at higher axial loads Ca(OH)2 may flow viscously. In the future we plan similar experiments on ground, cold pressed olivine + H2O + CO2. At elevated temperatures, reaction progress in unconfined powders is >80% in a few hours [4].\n1-Kelemen & Hirth EPSL 12; 2-Kelemen et al AREPS 11; 3-Kelemen et al AGUFM 13; 4-Gadikota et al.

However, even the most up-to-date models based on such mechanisms cannot account for the SOA mass observed in the atmosphere, suggesting the existence of other, yet unknown formation processes. The present study shows experimental evidence that particulate phase chemistry produces photo-sensitizers that lead to photo-induced formation and growth of secondary organic aerosol in the near UV and the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as terpenes.\nBy means of an aerosol flow tube reactor equipped with Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), Differential Mobility Analyzer (DMA) and Condensation Particle Sizer (CPC), we identified that traces in the aerosol phase of glyoxal chemistry products, namely imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (IC) are strong photo-sensitizers when irradiated with near-UV. In the presence of volatile organic compounds such as terpenes, this chemistry leads to a fast aerosol growth.\nGiven the potential importance of this new photosensitized growth pathway for ambient OA, the related reaction mechanism was investigated at a molecular level. Bulk and flow tube experiments were performed to identify major products of the reaction of limonene with the triplet state of IC by direct (+/-)ESI-HRMS and UPLC/(+/-)HESI-HRMS analysis. Detection of recombination products of IC with limonene or with itself, in bulk and flow tube experiment ts, showed that IC is able to initiate a radical chemistry in the aerosol phase under realistic irradiation conditions. Furthermore, highly oxygenated limonene reaction products were detected, clearly explaining the observed OA growth. The chemistry of peroxy radicals derived from limonene upon addition of oxygen explains the formation of such low-volatile compounds without any traditional gas phase oxidant.\nThese results demonstrate that, upon ageing, organic aerosols can produce photo-sensitizers which auto-photo-catalyse their SOA growth.",

            "abstract": "The area of Arctic September sea ice has diminished from about 7 million km2 in the 1990s to less than 5 million km2 in 5 of the last 7 years with a record minimum of 3.6 million km2 in 2012. The strength of this decrease is greater than expected by the scientific community, the reasons for this are not fully understood, and its simulation is an on-going challenge for existing climate models. With growing Arctic marine activity there is an urgent demand for forecasting Arctic summer sea ice. Previous attempts at seasonal forecasts of ice extent were of limited skill. However, here we show that the Arctic sea ice minimum can be accurately forecasted from melt pond area in spring. We developed a physical based melt pond model suitable for forecasting the evolution of melt ponds and incorporated this model into the Los Alamos sea ice model CICE. We find a strong correlation between the simulated spring pond fraction and the observed September sea ice extent for the period 1979 to 2013. This is explained by a positive feedback mechanism: more ponds reduce the albedo; a lower albedo causes more melting; more melting increases pond fraction. Our results help explain the acceleration of Arctic sea ice decrease during the last decade. We are able to predict the observed September ice area with a similar degree of skill as the observed ice extent. The choice of the applied SSM/I algorithm (NASA Team or bootstrap) does not materially affect our results. The inclusion of our new melt pond model promises to improve the skill of future forecast and climate models in Arctic regions and beyond.",

The heavy REE to light REE ratio (HREE/LREE) ranges from 4 to 5. Ba concentrations range from 47 to 58 nmol/kg, increasing slightly with depth. These homogeneous signatures do not allow identification of distinct deep water masses.\nThe upper 500 m of the water column close to the Western Svalbard margin including the shelf is relatively warm and saline (T ≤ 5.5°C, S ≤ 35.1) and shares characteristics of Atlantic Water (AW) including low CNd (~15 pmol/kg) and relatively unradiogenic εNd signatures (-12.2±0.2). This water is also characterized by HREE/LREE around 4 and CBa around 50 nmol/kg.\nLow salinity surface waters on the East Greenland shelf have unradiogenic εNd signatures similar to AW (-12.4±0.3) but in contrast to AW high CNd of up to 37 pmol/kg. At the same time the HREE/LREE ratio is relatively low (~3.5) and CBa reaches 73 nmol/kg. This suggests a significant freshwater contribution either from the McKenzie or the Lena rivers. Eastwards of these freshwater-influenced waters (at ~5°W), admixture of a Pacific component characterized by a more radiogenic εNd (-8.8±0.2) and high nutrient concentrations outcropping at surface was detected. Waters of the same origin are present on the East Greenland shelf at about 150 m depth.\nBased on these data we use mass balance calculations to determine the fractions of sea ice meltwater, Eurasian run-off, North American run-off, and Arctic seawater and compare these results with our εNd and REE data.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that plate rheology exerts a dominant control on the shape and velocity of subducting plates. Here, we perform a systematic investigation of the, often disregarded, role of elasticity in slab bending at the trench, using simple, yet fully dynamic, set of 2.5D models where an elastic, visco-elastic or visco-elasto-plastic plate subducts freely into a purely viscous mantle. We derive a scaling relationship between the bending radius of visco-elastic slabs and the Deborah number, De, which is the ratio of Maxwell time over deformation time. We show that De controls the ratio of elastically stored energy over viscously dissipated energy and find that at De exceeding 10-2, it requires substantially less energy to bend a visco-elastic slab to the same shape as a purely viscous slab with the same viscosity (90% less for De=0.1). Elastically stored energy at higher De facilitates slab unbending and hence favours retreating modes of subduction, while trench advance only occurs for some cases with De<10-2. We use our scaling relation to estimate apparent Deborah numbers, Deapp, from a global compilation of subduction-zone parameters. Values range from 10-3 to >1, where most zones have low Deapp<10-2, but a few young plates have Deapp>0.1. Slabs with Deapp ≤ 10-2 either have very low viscosities, ≤10 times mantle viscosity, or they may be yielding, in which case our apparent Deborah number may underestimate actual De by up to an order of magnitude. If a significant portion of the low Deapp slabs yield, then elastically stored energy may actually be important in quite a large number of subduction zones. Interestingly, increasing Deapp correlates with increasing proportion of larger seismic events (b-value) in both instrumental and historic catalogues, indicating that increased contribution of elasticity may facilitate rupture in larger, less frequent earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The sources and excitation of the Earth’s hum are current subjects of debate. Here, we propose an alternative approach to map power spectral density of hum sources. We are currently processing IRIS continuous seismic data spanning the last 10 years to obtain a cross-correlation dataset. The amplitude-independent phase cross-correlation provides correlation stacks that converge relatively rapidly and without the application of additional preprocessing such as spectral whitening. We calculate monthly stacks of approx. daily broadband geometrically normalized ‘classic’ and phase cross-correlations. These can be recombined into ‘seasonal’ stacks of several months. Also, they can be restacked by month over several years, so as to investigate long-term average behavior during different months. Although these correlation functions retain no absolute amplitude information, observational evidence from our data shows that the relative amplitudes of the causal and acausal branch differ between certain station pairs, indicating a preferential direction of wave propagation. We intend to use this directional characteristic to investigate source distribution of continuous seismic motions. In a first step, we project the measurements of amplitude asymmetry back along the station-station path using very simplified sensitivity kernels. These kernels can be obtained numerically or by using analytical 2-D Green’s functions for homogeneous media. We expect to obtain global maps of source regions for different seasons. In a further step (not to be presented here), the observations will be inverted for the geographical distribution of source power spectral density. We target hum as first example application, while the method could also be applied to other types of continuous seismic motion. The goal of our study is to obtain a global hum source map, which might benefit our understanding of the excitation mechanisms of hum.",

            "abstract": "Woody debris (WD) is an essential structural and functional component of forest ecosystems, and plays very significant roles for the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients. Coarse woody debris (CWD) is considered to be the major part in forest WD and it is primarily composed of logs, snags, stumps and large branches, while fine woody debris (FWD) mainly consists of small twigs.\nComposition, spatial distribution and carbon storage of WD have been studied in plateau-type karst evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest in Tianlong Mountain of central Guizhou Province. Results showed that the carbon storage of WD in karst forests was less than non-karst forests. The major components of WD were fallen trees and snags with 10-20 cm in diameter. Fallen trees and snags with diameter greater than 20 cm were the smallest part of WD. The situation of WD in this region reflects the structural characteristics of WD in mid-late stage of plateau-type karst evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest succession.\nThe potential contribution of WD to the regional carbon cycle, and its relationship with climate change were finally discussed. The WD (especially CWD) plays an important role in the carbon cycle of karst forest. Forest WD production and decay rates may partially depend on climatic conditions, the accumulation of CWD and FWD carbon stocks in forests may be correlated with climate.\nKey words: woody debris, karst forests, carbon storage, spatial distribution, CWD, FWD.",

            "abstract": "Topo-Iberia has been a large-scale Spanish project running from 2007 to 2013 that integrated more than 150 researchers on Earth Sciences. One of its key assets was the management of an observatory platform, named IberArray, aimed to provide new geophysical datasets (seismic, GPS, MT) to constrain the structure of Iberia with unprecedented resolution. The IberArray seismic pool was composed by 70+ BB stations, covering the study area in 3 deployments with a site-density of 60km x 60km. The data base holds ~300 sites, including the permanent networks in the area. Hence it forms a unique seismic database in Europe that allow for multiple analyses to constrain the complex geodinamics of the Western Mediterranean. A summary of new results coming from different techniques is presented here. The SKS splitting analysis has provided a spectacular image of the rotation of the fast velocity direction along the Gibraltar Arc. In central and northern Iberia, the fast polarization directions are close to EW, consistently with global mantle flow models considering contributions of surface plate motion, density variations and net lithosphere rotation. Those results suggest an asthenospheric origin of the observed anisotropy related to present-day mantle flow. Receiver functions have revealed the crustal thickness variations beneath the Rif and southern Iberia, including a crustal root beneath the Rif. The Variscan Iberian massif shows a flat Moho discontinuity, while the areas reworked in the Alpine orogeny show a slightly thicker crust. Beneath N Iberia, the imbrication of the Iberian and Eurasian crusts results in complex receiver functions. Depths exceeding 45 km are observed along the Pyrenean range, while the crust thins to values of 26-28 km close to the Atlantic coasts. The geometry of the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities has been investigated using novel cross-correlation/stacking techniques. Ambient noise tomography allows to identify the main sedimentary basins and to discriminate between the Variscan and the Alpine reworked areas. Local body-wave tomography in North Morocco has improved the location of the small magnitude events on the area and the details of the crustal structure. Teleseismic tomography has confirmed, using an independent data set, the presence of a high-velocity slab beneath the Gibraltar Arc.",

A [001](010)-type CPO pattern of wadsleyite was recently reported by deformation experiments on wadsleyite at pressure-temperature conditions of the MTZ (Kawazoe et al., 2013; Ohuchi et al., 2014). However, [001] dislocations have been rarely reported in wadsleyite in the literature (cf. Cordier, 2006). To reconcile the wadsleyite CPO pattern with its slip systems, dislocation microstructures of a [001](010)-textured wadsleyite have been investigated in weak-beam dark-field imaging in a transmission electron microscope. 1/2<101> partial dislocations on the (010) plane are characterized with [100] dislocations on the (010) plane and 1/2<111> dislocations. The former partial dislocations are extended on the (010) stacking fault as a glide configuration (i.e. Shockley-type stacking faults with 1/2<101> replacement vectors). The [001] slip on the (010) plane occurs by glide of the dissociated dislocations on a sub-oxygen close packing plane, which is consistent with the reported CPO in water-poor conditions.",

The impacts of climate change are represented as the function of vulnerability for the period of 1980-2010. There are two steps in this research. Firstly, regional climate modeling is conducted for obtaining to the climatic parameters, namely total precipitation and mean air temperature. We focus on the role of those climatic variables on the crop yield. The projections were performed according to the scenarios of IPCC, namely RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5. According to the regional model results, it is seen that there will be an increase up to the 4 °C in mean air temperatures of Turkey for the period of 2020 – 2050 with respect to the period of 1970 – 2000 and also precipitation climatology of Turkey shows a decrease up to 1.2 mm/day. In the second part of the study, climatic parameters are combined and interpreted together through the panel data analysis and we examined that how the variables representing the climate change impacts have an influence on the crop yield in the some crucial regions for the crop production of Turkey. According to the model results, estimated risks for crops in the panel data analysis differ from each other resulting from increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall and we examined the all of those differences over the crops.",

PP-SESAME will thus allow to determine the water ice content in the near-surface and to monitor its diurnal and orbital variations thus providing essential insight on the activity and evolution of the cometary nucleus.\nThe PP-SESAME instrument is derived from the quadrupole array technique. A sinusoidal electrical current is sent into the ground through a first dipole, and the induced electrical voltage is measured with a second dipole. The complex permittivity of the material is inferred from the mutual impedance derived from the measurements. In practice, the influence of both the electronic circuit of the instrument and the conducting elements in its close environment must be accounted for in order to best estimate the dielectric constant and electric conductivity of the ground. To do this we have developed a method called the “capacity-influence matrix method”.\nA replica of the instrument was recently built in LATMOS (France) and was tested in the frame of a field campaign in the giant ice cave system of Dachstein, Austria. In the caves, the ground is covered with a thick layer of ice, which temperature is rather constant throughout the year. This measurement campaign allowed us to test the “capacity influence matrix method” in a natural icy environment.\nThe first measurements of the PP-SESAME/Philae experiment should be available in mid-November. In this paper we will present the “capacity-influence matrix method”, the measurements and results from the Austrian field campaign and the preliminary analysis of the PP-SESAME/Philae data.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines nearshore underwater-acoustic channel modeling concepts and compares channel-state information requirements against existing modeling capabilities. This process defines a subset of candidate acoustic models suitable for simulating signal propagation in underwater communications. Underwater-acoustic communications find many practical applications in coastal oceanography, and networking is the enabling technology for these applications. Such networks can be formed by establishing two-way acoustic links between autonomous underwater vehicles and moored oceanographic sensors. These networks can be connected to a surface unit for further data transfer to ships, satellites, or shore stations via a radio-frequency link. This configuration establishes an interactive environment in which researchers can extract real-time data from multiple, but distant, underwater instruments. After evaluating the obtained data, control messages can be sent back to individual instruments to adapt the networks to changing situations. Underwater networks can also be used to increase the operating ranges of autonomous underwater vehicles by hopping the control and data messages through networks that cover large areas. A model of the ocean medium between acoustic sources and receivers is called a channel model. In an oceanic channel, characteristics of the acoustic signals change as they travel from transmitters to receivers. These characteristics depend upon the acoustic frequency, the distances between sources and receivers, the paths followed by the signals, and the prevailing ocean environment in the vicinity of the paths. Properties of the received signals can be derived from those of the transmitted signals using these channel models. This study concludes that ray-theory models are best suited to the simulation of acoustic signal propagation in oceanic channels and identifies 33 such models that are eligible candidates.",

These observations created the observational foundation for new methodologies for coronal plasma diagnostics, i.e., coronal seismology. We have developed a technique to create height-time intensity maps along arbitrary paths on EUV images from different instruments (e.g., STEREO/EUVI and SDO/AIA) in all available channels simultaneously. In this work, we report the first direct observation (along with a comprehensive kinematical characterization) of an arc-shaped wave-like front recorded in several SDO/AIA channels on 2011 July 6. The front is observed to propagate coherently along several pseudo-open field lines with origin on a sunspot of active region AR 1243. Wavelet-processed SDO/AIA images make the wave-like disturbances clearly discernible with the naked eye. The intensity disturbances propagate with an average plane-of-sky phase velocity of about 50 km/sec in the 131 Å, 171 Å, 193 Å, 211 Å, 304 Å and 335 Å channels, exhibiting a ~3 min periodicity in all cases. Its origin could be tracked down to a higher-than-average intensity point inside the umbra of the corresponding spot (i.e., an umbral dot) as observed in the 1600 Å and 1700 Å SDO/AIA channels. The intensity of the source oscillates in phase with the wave-like phenomenon observed in the other channels.",

The proliferation of fish farm structures coupled with excessive feeding caused the deterioration of water quality in the area that lead to hypoxic condition (<2mg/L) and fish kills. A hydrodynamic model of the area, developed using DELFT3D, showed a residence time of 5-15 days in the northern channel and 25 to 28 days in the southern end. The complex configuration of the coast, which includes narrow channels that serve as bottlenecks, result to the inefficient flushing of the area. This was further aggravated by the presence of fish farm structures that restricted the natural flow of water.\nWater quality was monitored in the mariculture site and a nearby seagrass reserve. Nitrate+nitrite concentration ranged from 0.34 - 4.1 µM, 0.13 – 2.7 µM for phosphate, and 1.7 – 8.8 µM for ammonia. Highest nutrient concentrations were seen near the fish farms. Analysis of nutrients, chlorophyll-a and tss for a tidal cycle showed that these substances were inadequately flushed from the coastal waters. Long residence times and high nutrient loading in the area were ideal conditions for the development of hypoxia.",

The time-dependence is introduced by 1) the Brownian Passage Time (BPT) probability model that is based on a simple physical model of the earthquake cycle, and 2) the fusion of the BPT renewal model with a physical model that considers the earthquake probability perturbation for interacting faults by static Coulomb stress changes We treat the uncertainties in the fault parameters (e.g. slip rate, characteristic magnitude and aperiodicity) of the statistical distribution associated to each examined fault source by a Monte Carlo technique. For a comparison among the results obtained from three different models, we give the probabilities of occurrence of earthquakes Mw > 6.5 for individual fault sources in the Marmara region, over the future 5-10-30 and 50 years, starting on January 1, 2013, considering the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of the Monte Carlo distribution.\nIn order to evaluate the impact of the earthquake probability models to ground motion hazard we attempt to calculate the fault-based probabilistic seismic hazard maps (PSHA) of mean Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) having 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years on rock site condition. We adopted only one Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE) for the active shallow crustal region for assessing the ground shaking hazard in the Marmara region.\nWe observed that the impact of the different occurrence models on the seismic hazard estimate of selected sites is quite high: the hazard may increase by more than 70% or decrease by as much as 70%, depending on the applied model in the selected sites. This difference mostly depends on the time elapsed after the latest major earthquake on a specific fault. We demonstrate that the estimated average recurrence time and the associated magnitude, together with the elapsed time, are crucial parameters in the earthquake probability calculations.",

            "abstract": "At 11:46UT on September 9, 2011, the Wind spacecraft encountered an interplanetary (IP) fast forward shock. The shock was followed almost immediately (~5 minutes) by a short duration (~35 minutes), extremely large density pulse with a density peak of ~100 cm-3. While a sharp increase in the solar wind density is typical of an IP shock downstream, the unusual large density increase prompts a further investigation. After a close examination of other in situ data from Wind, we find the density pulse was associated with (1) a spike in the plasma beta (ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure), (2) multiple sign changes in the azimuthal angle of magnetic field, (3) depressed magnetic field, (4) a small radial component of magnetic field, and (5) a large (>90 degrees) pitch-angle change in suprathermal electrons (>200 eV) across the density pulse. We conclude that the density pulse is the heliospheric plasma sheet and the estimated thickness is ~820,000km. The unusually large density pulse is likely to be a result of the shock compression from behind. This view is supported by our 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The detailed result and implications will be discussed.\n*This work is supported partially by ONR 6.1 program",

Regional and global models are unable to resolve these small scale interactions, while high resolution eddy-resolving models are unable to capture the larger scale dynamics of the atmosphere and can only be run over a limited size domain for a limited time. Here we present results using the high resolution (1km, 0.3km) nested version of the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM) which bridges the scale gap between models. A new microphysics scheme, Cloud and AeroSol Interactive Microphysics (CASIM) is coupled to a chemistry and aerosol scheme (GLOMAP-mode) which allows for fully interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics.\nResults showing the effect of volcanic aerosol from the slowly degassing Kilauea volcano, Hawaii on trade wind cumuli will be presented. The presence of a subtropical high pressure in the summer allows the study of aerosol-cloud interactions in a uniform unpolluted marine background environment without the complications of anthropogenic pollution. Satellite data has shown that cumulus clouds affected by the volcanic plume had smaller cloud droplets, reduced precipitation efficiency, increased cloud amount and higher cloud tops. Other researchers have hypothesised that that the observed changes in cloud properties cannot be explained by the orographic effect of the island or the sea surface temperature anomaly. We present results using CASIM in the UM at high resolution to systematically compare the relative effects of dynamical and aerosol-cloud interactions. Initial results show that the orography of the island does not have a significant impact on the cumulus cloud further downwind from the island but there is an effect in the immediate vicinity of the island. Initial results also indicate that 1km resolution is not high enough to resolve small cumulus cloud.",

            "abstract": "Given the vast areas of mid ocean ridge flanks, even small chemical changes dues to fluid-rock interaction on the flanks may significantly influence global geochemical cycles. A conductive heat flow anomaly associated with hydrothermal circulation in ocean crust exists until on average 65Ma, but it is not known whether the thermal signature is accompanied by continued fluid-rock chemical exchange. Constraining the duration of fluid-rock chemical exchange is critical for calculating robust chemical fluxes associated with ridge flank hydrothermal circulation. Calcium carbonate veins form during relatively late-stage hydrothermal alteration and can be used to estimate the duration of ridge flank hydrothermal circulation.\nLA-MC-ICP-MS U/Pb geochronology provides a novel and independent approach to date calcium carbonate veins, and is advantageous over using the seawater Sr isotope curve that is in part non-unique and requires assumptions about the contribution of MORB Sr from fluid-rock exchange. LA-MC-ICP-MS U/Pb analyses have been undertaken on a suite of calcium carbonate veins from a range of basement ages (1.6 – 170 Ma), spreading rates and sediment thickness.\nPreliminary results indicate that the temperature of formation of calcium carbonate veins place a strong control on achieving a successful U/Pb isochron. This is likely related to the temperature dependent geochemical evolution of basement fluids due to fluid-rock reaction, and the partitioning of U and Pb into calcite/aragonite. Successful U/Pb isochrons have been achieved for a range of crustal ages and spreading rates, and indicate that calcium carbonate precipitation occurs within 25Myrs of crustal formation. This is substantially shorter than 65Ma, the average extent of the conductive heat flow anomaly, and will allow for more robust estimates of the contribution of hydrothermal chemical fluxes to global geochemical cycles.",

            "abstract": "Organic rich sediments, indicators of low bottom water oxygen, are often enriched in trace metals. Their concentrations in such sediments are thus used to probe past Earth surface conditions. Enrichment mechanisms are difficult to distinguish from concentrations alone, however. A range of processes fractionate metal stable isotopes, offering the potential to unpick these controls.\nThe Black Sea is the classic modern analogue for past euxinia. Deep euxinic waters (dissolved sulfide ≤380mM) underlie a surface oxic layer and redoxcline at 80-250m. It is an ideal starting point to explore the behaviour of metal stable isotopes in low oxygen conditions. We report water column and sedimentary Zn and Ni data. A maximum in dissolved Zn (~3nM) occurs at the upper boundary of the redoxcline, probably reflecting cellular uptake above and sulfide co-precipitation below. Water column dissolved Ni concentrations remain within a narrow range throughout (9-12nM), with subtle variations in the redoxcline associated with Fe-Mn cycling and interaction with sulfide. Significant Zn and Ni isotopic variation (ca 1.5‰) is observed associated with these concentration variations. In the strongly sulfidic deep waters, Zn and Ni are homogeneous and isotopically heavy: [Zn] = 0.40 ± 0.05nM, δ66Zn = 0.96 ± 0.05‰, [Ni] = 10.7 ± 0.7nM, δ58Ni = 1.86 ± 0.16‰ (n=6, 1sd), suggesting preferential removal of light isotopes to the particulate phase.\nSediments underlying oxic waters show no authigenic enrichment and isotope ratios close to crustal values (δ60Ni ~ 0.2‰, δ66Zn ~ 0.3‰). In contrast, Ni and Zn are enriched in sediments underlying the euxinic portion of the water column (by factors of 2-3). Authigenic Ni isotope values are light (δ60Niauth = 0.30 ± 0.21‰, n=13, 1sd) compared to the deep Black Sea water column, consistent with removal of light isotopes to the particulate phase. This may reflect sorption to Mn oxides, or co-precipitation with sulfide. Authigenic Zn isotope values in these sediments are also light (δ66Znauth = 0.57 ± 0.07‰) compared to the deep Black Sea dissolved pool. Unlike Ni, however, removal of Zn is close to quantitative. This is seen in low Zn concentrations in deep waters and in the similarity of the euxinic sedimentary Zn isotopic composition to the likely dominant input, open ocean seawater (at ~0.5‰).",

However, the Giant Panda lacks genes for the enzymes needed to digest cellulose, the core component of bamboo. Thus, it is hypothesized that the cellulolytic digestion necessary for maintaining the Giant Panda diet is carried out by microbial symbionts in the panda gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota is used as surrogate index for gut microbiota since the Giant Panda is listed by the World Conservation Union as a Threatened Species. Two bacterial isolates with potential cellulolytic activity were isolated from Giant Panda fecal samples and cultured on selective media CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) agar and CMC-Congo Red agar using various methods of inoculation. After incubation, clearance zones around colonies were observed and used as qualitative assays for cellulose digestion. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was completed and species identification was done based on the BLAST result of 16S rRNA sequence obtained using Sanger sequencing. Once the cellulase activity is confirmed, genomic DNA of the bacteria will be extracted and used for whole genome shotgun sequencing. Illumina next generation sequencing platform will be adopted as it yields high-throughput information, providing a better understanding of cellulose digestion and the molecular genetic pathways to renewable sources of biofuels.\nResearchers have identified multiple cellulose-digesting microbes in the Giant Panda gut, but few have applied such bacteria in converting cellulose into glucose to create biofuel. Cellulosic ethanol, a biofuel, is produced through the fermentation of lignocellulosic biomasses. This anaerobic process is aided by cellulose-digesting enzymes. Certain microbes, such as those present in the Giant Panda gut, can produce enzymes that cleave the glycosidic bonds of cellulose (C6H10O5) into glucose molecules (C6H12O6), which can then be fermented into ethanol in the presence of yeast (C6H12O6 → 2C2H5OH + 2CO2), producing cellulosic biofuel. Our aim is to identify cellulose-digesting microbes and test their ability to produce biofuels efficiently. The Renewable Fuels Association estimates that ethanol fuel can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 44% and reduce CO tailpipe emissions by up to 30%.",

            "abstract": "At continental sites of serpentinization, high concentrations of reduced gases (e.g., H2, CH4) are frequently found in association with highly-alkaline groundwater. Identification of the process(es) responsible for the generation of methane—as well as the source(s) of C & H—in these environments has been challenging. The difficulty is due to both the wide range of processes (microbial, thermal, abiotic) that could be involved, and the limited number of parameters that are accessible to currently-available analytical technologies (e.g., δ13C, δD).\nThe recent development of a new technique based on tunable infrared laser spectroscopy [1] has enabled the fully-resolved quantification of four isotopologues of methane: 12CH4, 13CH4, 12CH3D, and 13CH3D, a doubly-substituted (“clumped”) isotopologue. We used this technique to measure 13CH3D in gases sampled from continental sites of serpentinization, in order to provide independent constraints on C–H bond-forming processes involved in the generation of the methane found in these systems. Our study sites are hosted in ultramafic units that are presently undergoing serpentinization. These include The Cedars peridotite body (Calif., USA) [2], the Coast Range Ophiolite Microbial Observatory (Calif., USA) [3], and the Chimaera seep (Tekirova Ophiolite, Turkey) [4].\nPreliminary measurements indicate that Δ13CH3D (the deviation of the abundance of 13CH3D from the stochastic distribution) in methane sampled from these sites spans nearly the entire range of thermodynamically-predicted values, from >+5‰ (13CH3D-based apparent equilibrium temperature < 45 °C) to ~0‰ (Tapparent → ∞). The new 13CH3D data is complemented by conventional geochemical analyses (e.g., dissolved ions/organics, δ13C, δD) on samples collected during the same field campaigns. Our study demonstrates that the measurement of 13CH3D provides a new dimension of isotopic constraints for unraveling the complex processes controlling the distribution of methane, and the flow of energy and carbon, in areas of active continental serpentinization.\n[1] Ono et al.

            "abstract": "Convection within the Earth's mantle is governed by the Rayleigh number, thought to be in the range of 106-108. Thus mantle convection is predicted to occur in a strongly time-dependent fashion. Regional investigations of the Icelandic plume and the associated V-shaped ridges indicate transient thermal perturbations with amplitudes of 5-30 oC. These perturbations occur in a quasi-periodic fashion, with periods of 3-8 million years. As yet, a coherent link between these observations and a dynamic convective model has not been established. In this study, results of numerical models of the Icelandic plume are presented. First, a kinematic advective-diffusive model is used to investigate the surface response caused by thermal perturbations and to determine plume parameter values. Secondly, a fully dynamical investigation is undertaken to derive a mechanism for the production of periodic perturbations. Two-dimensional, axisymmetric, convection models are presented for different Rayleigh numbers. The point at which the system exhibits periodic behaviour is determined and then investigated for different viscosity dependencies. System responses are analysed using boundary layer theory and stability analysis. We find that the relationship between the time period of the periodic thermal perturbation and the Rayleigh number is in agreement with boundary layer theory.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture storage (S) is a fundamental component of the water cycle and is frequently measured to support hydrological models. Vertical profiles of soil moisture sensors are commonly installed as part of monitoring programs to quantify soil moisture status and fluxes. Similarly, remote sensing from satellites holds the promise of providing global data on near surface soil moisture content. We explore the functional relationships between S and point measurements of soil moisture from instrumented profiles near Boise ID and SCAN sites across the USA. The goal is to define opportunities for efficient verification of S and the limits of remote sensing for soil moisture monitoring. The results commonly show hysteresis between soil moisture point measurements at individual depths and S. When the data are parsed by periods of imbibition and drainage, less complex functional relationships emerge. These differ for soil profiles of uniform texture and duplex soils, and provide guidance on data analysis techniques to parameterize hydrologic models with one or two components for S. The implications for optimizing sensor placement within experimental research sites is discussed.",

During the summer of 2012, almost the entirety of the Greenland ice sheet simultaneously experienced surface melt, including Summit. In this presentation, we will show the spatial distribution of the seasonal and interannual variability of surface skin and surface air temperatures (Ts and Ta) as depicted in the AIRS Version-6 data set for the 12 year period since 2002 to present. We will compare these variability with those obtained from MODIS Ice Surface Temperature (IST), and from two in situ stations at Summit.\nThe comparison between AIRS Ts and MODIS IST is in good agreement within ~3K during the summer season (JJA) except near the coast. The differences are most pronounced during the winter season (DJF), in the south of the Greenland near the coast, as MODIS IST is more than 10K lower than AIRS Ts. The temporal correlation at Summit between two temperature data set is ~0.85 during 10 years of analysis period. Large seasonal dependence on diurnal variability is found over Summit. The most significant diurnal variation is found during warm season (March to August), when interannual variability is low.",

A modern PSHA represents a complex framework which combines different models with several inputs. It is important to understand and assess the impact of these inputs on the model output in a quantitative way. Sensitivity analysis is a valuable tool for quantifying changes of a model output as inputs are perturbed, identifying critical input parameters and obtaining insight in the model behavior. Differential sensitivity analysis relies on calculating first-order partial derivatives of the model output with respect to its inputs; however, obtaining the derivatives of complex models can be challenging.\nIn this study we show how differential sensitivity analysis of a complex framework such as PSHA can be carried out using Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). AD has been successfully applied for sensitivity analyses in various domains such as meteorology or aerodynamics. First we demonstrate the feasibility of the AD methodology by comparing AD derived sensitivities to analytically derived sensitivities for a basic case of PSHA using a simple ground-motion prediction equation. In a second step, we derive sensitivities via AD for a more complex PSHA study using a ground motion attenuation relation based on a stochastic method to simulate strong motion. The presented approach is general enough to accommodate more advanced PSHA studies of higher complexity.",

This increase represents a 16% correction large enough to explain the persistent overestimation of growth rates of historical atmospheric CO2 by Earth System Models. Without this correction, the CFE for global GPP is underestimated by 0.05 PgC yr-1ppm-1.

Having better estimates of these ratios can improve AOT retrievals. Current VIIRS aerosol retrieval algorithm uses constant ratios over the whole globe. We present an investigation of the surface reflectance ratios over the global AERONET sites and demonstrate that we can improve the AOT retrieval by using more accurate surface reflectance ratios. Surface reflectance in the M1, M2, M3, M11 and M5 channels were retrieved at global AERONET sites using AERONET-retrieved AOT. M1/M5, M2/M5, M3/M5, and M11/M5 surface reflectance ratios were then calculated for each site separately. These ratios vary strongly from site to site. This variability is the reason for the biases and standard deviations in the AOT retrieval when a single fixed value of the ratio is used. When instead the individual ratios are used in the AOT retrieval, their statistics (naturally) improve. In order to obtain these ratios without the help of the AERONET AOT, we tested a clear sky method, which assumes a low AOT and looks for the lowest atmospheric corrected M3/M5 ratio over a period of time. The clear sky ratios were obtained for each AERONET sites, which were then applied in land AOT retrieval. The resulting AOT retrievals also showed improvements over those from the original algorithm.",

This article presents the development of a numerical simulator for 1D, compressible, two-phase, three-component, radially symmetric flow using method of lines (MOL) and a 3rd order accurate spacial discretization using a weighted essentially non oscillatory (WENO)scheme. The MOL implementation enables application of the MATLAB ODE-Solver, ODE15s, for time integration. Simulation examples are presented in the context of enhanced gas recovery due to CO$_2$ injection. Following an assumption of constant equilibrium ratios for CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, a ternary flash calculator is developed providing closed-form relationships for exact interpolation between equations of state for CO$_2$-H$_2$O and CH$_4$-H$_2$O binary mixtures.

            "abstract": "Deformation mechanisms within shear zones from various crustal levels must be characterized to develop accurate models of lithospheric rheology. The Cordillera Blanca Shear Zone (CBSZ) in the central Peruvian Andes records changes in temperature, microstructures, and deformation mechanisms that occurred during exhumation through the brittle-ductile-transition during normal-sense slip over the last ~5 m.y. The 100-500-m-thick mylonitic shear zone occupies the footwall of a 200-km-long normal detachment fault, marking the western boundary of the 8 Ma, leucogranodiorite Cordillera Blanca Batholith. Though local variations do occur, including recrystallized quartz veins and local, decimeter- to meter- scale shear zones, the CBSZ follows a general trend of increasing strain towards the detachment. Structurally lowest positions are weakly deformed and transition to protomylonite, mylonite, and ultramylonite at higher positions, truncating at a cataclasite nearest the detachment.\nWe characterize strain using EBSD analyses of quartz lattice preferred orientations and deformation temperatures using quartz and feldspar textures and two-feldspar thermometry of asymmetric strain-induced myrmekite. At the deepest structural positions, feldspar grains record a complex history characterized by bulging recrystallization, myrmekite formation, and brittle fracture, while quartz exhibits dominant grain-boundary migration recrystallization (T> 500 °C) and prism <a> slip. Intermediate samples exhibit more prevalent strain-induced myrmekite, brittle fracture in feldspar, and reaction-associated recrystallization of K-feldspar to mica; quartz records mainly subgrain-rotation recrystallization (400-500 °C) and dominant prism <a> slip with a rhomb <a> component. Shallower positions preserve fewer, smaller, and more rounded feldspar porphyroclasts with no myrmekite, and dominant bulging recrystallization (280-400 °C) in quartz that records prism <a>, rhomb <a>, and some basal <a> slip.",

The amplitudes of the largest PBPs exceed more than four times the amplitudes of the following return strokes or non-return stroke like pulses. This could indicate an abnormally electrified storm and a high occurrence of attempted cloud-to-ground leaders.\nWe measure waveforms of the magnetic-field derivative using a broad-band analyzer with a sampling interval of 12.5 ns coupled with a newly designed magnetic-loop antenna. The analyzed frequency band goes from 5 kHz to 37 MHz. We use numerically integrated waveform records for the analysis of the properties of the trains.\nOur dataset consists of 11 trains of magnetic-field preliminary breakdown pulses measured during one single thunderstorm, which occurred close to Rustrel, France in June 2013 and lasted about four hours. All observed trains of PBPs were followed by very week return strokes or non-return stroke like pulses. The lightning detection networks METEORAGE and EUCLID classified 10 of 11 trains of strong PBPs as a negative cloud-to-ground discharge (1), positive cloud-to-ground discharges (3) or intra-cloud discharges (6). The corresponding return strokes were absent in the list provided by lightning detection networks (7) or classified as negative cloud-to-ground (2) or intra-cloud discharges (2). The discharges were located at distances between 69 and 176 km from the receiving site.\nWe estimate the duration, the number of pulses and the inter-pulse intervals for each individual train. We also estimate the time between the last pulse in the train and the peak of the following return stroke or non-return stroke like pulse. We investigate the variability in the pulse shapes and the differences between the observed trains and the regular trains of PBPs preceding usual negative cloud-to-ground flashes.",

            "abstract": "Tibetan Plateau is the highest elevation and the fastest uplift plateau. The fragile ecology and poor soil development, under the extreme environmental factors coupling freezing and thawing, weathering, and rainfall, provides a lot of materials for erosion. On the other hand, a large amount of runoff from glaciers and melting snows with considerable drop height keeps flushing and transporting the crushed materials. For these reasons, the soil erosion in the region is widely distributed. The erosion processes are complex with multiple forcing sources and the river sediment is of great variability spatially. The spatial distribution of river sediment is able to reflect erosion sources and erosion intensities. Due to the harsh natural environment of the plateau, however, historical hydrological data and observation stations are scarce. Especially, the river sediment records are hardly to track. Therefore, it is necessary to launch the field investigation of sediment distribution in main rivers in the Tibetan Plateau. The Yarlung Zangbo River is the longest river in Tibetan Plateau and the highest river in the world. It flows from west to east across the southern section of the plateau, covering 912,000 km2 basin areas. In the study, field investigation is carried out for sediment distribution along the Yarlung Zangbo River for two years. The investigation involves different elevation segments and main confluences. The data results will be helpful for understanding the temporal and spatial distribution of river sediments and identification of critical erosion areas for further processes-based studies. It will benefit soil erosion classification and the best management practices as well.",

            "abstract": "Classifying catchments represents a significant challenge to hydrology and hydrologic modeling, restricting widespread transfer of knowledge from well-studied sites. Traditionally, catchment classification has focused on identifying important physical, climatological, or hydrologic attributes (to varying degrees depending on application/data availability). Such classification approaches are regularly assessed with regard to their ability to provide suitable hydrologic predictions – commonly via the transfer of hydrologic model parameters from the catchment at which they were fitted to a catchment the classification deemed similar. While intuitive, such an approach makes the implicit assumption that physical similarity begets functional (model parameterization) similarity and ignores the most uncertain aspect of the process – the model itself. Here, we explore catchment classification and parameter transferability of the internally verifiable Catchment Connectivity Model across seven catchments located within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest. Our analysis investigates the roles of model consistency, parameter sensitivity, and catchment structure with regard to catchment classification and introduces the concept of universal donor and universal acceptor catchments.",

            "abstract": "The UNAVCO Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, curates, archives, and distributes geodesy data and products, mainly GPS/GNSS data from 3,000 permanent stations and 10,000 campaign sites around the globe. Although now having core support from NSF and NASA, the archive began around 1992 as a grass-roots effort of a few UNAVCO staff and community members to preserve data going back to 1986. Open access to this data is generally desired, but the Data Center in fact operates under an evolving suite of data access policies ranging from open access to nondisclosure for special cases. Key to processing this data is having the correct equipment metadata; reliably obtaining this metadata continues to be a challenge, in spite of modern cyberinfrastructure and tools, mostly due to human errors or lack of consistent operator training. New metadata problems surface when trying to design and publish modern Digital Object Identifiers for data sets where PIs, funding sources, and historical project names now need to be corrected and verified for data sets going back almost three decades. Originally, the data was GPS-only based on three signals on two carrier frequencies. Modern GNSS covers GPS modernization (three more signals and one additional carrier) as well as open signals and carriers of additional systems such as GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, and QZSS, requiring ongoing adaptive strategies to assess the quality of modern datasets. Also, new scientific uses of these data benefit from higher data rates than was needed for early tectonic applications. In addition, there has been a migration from episodic campaign sites (hence sparse data) to continuously operating stations (hence dense data) over the last two decades. All of these factors make it difficult to realistically plan even simple data center functions such as on-line storage capacity.",

            "abstract": "Induced seismicity typically refers to minor earthquakes and tremors that are caused by human activity that alters the stresses and strains on the Earth's crust. Earthquakes which are smaller magnitude are called micro-earthquakes. Micro-earthquakes could be observed in areas which includes energy technologies that involve injection or withdrawal of fluids from the subsurface. Micro-earthquakes are the result from these kind of process. Geothermal areas are good example of that kind of areas. So we chose Salavatlı geothermal area , Aydın, Turkey to study. In this area, we have working production and injection wells, and these wells are active since 2000.\nThe main aim of this study is to find similar micro-earthquakes with correlation method and to check if they come from same source or location. So the data which was collected from 9 broad-band stations which were installed at the study area, between June 2010 and April 2013 were used for this study. 977 micro-earthquakes were located with SEISAN. 815 of them could be used for the correlation analysis due to quality of the data. GISMO correlation toolbox was used for this process. The duration of waveforms are 10 seconds because the longest micro-earthquake in this study was 8 seconds. We took lower limit as 0.9 for the correlation co-efficient. 34 event of similar waveforms were found.\nWhen we examined location of all micro-earthquakes, we saw that they were scattered over the study area. This might be caused from wrong P or S wave pickings or inadequate crustal velocity model. So, firstly, we decided to check the initial velocity model by using VELEST software. For the VELEST processing 334 best located micro-earthquakes were selected on the base of similiar criterias. After getting minimum 1D velocity model for the study area, all micro-earthquakes were relocated again and then mapped. The location of most of them changed and got better. Then with final 1D velocity model, events of similar waveforms were mapped. An example of the similar waveforms can be seen in the figure. In general, when monthly location of micro-earthquakes were checked, the direction of the injected water from re-injection wells became clearly seen on the seismicity maps.",

            "abstract": "One of the remaining challenges in paleoseismological research is quantification of ancient-earthquake magnitudes, and rupture locations and extent. Such reconstructions require multiple continuous paleoseismic records with excellent temporal and spatial resolution and stable threshold conditions, which can be offered by turbidite records in lakes. Recent, well-documented, great megathrust earthquakes provide an ideal opportunity to calibrate the turbidite record in different types of lakes, and determine which settings are suitable for quantitative paleoseismology. We study the sedimentary impact of the 1960 and 2010 Chilean megathrust earthquakes using 107 short sediment cores in 17 lakes. A combination of image analysis, magnetic susceptibility and grain-size analysis allowed to distinguish two types of lacustrine turbidites (i.e. LT1s and LT2s) from background sediments and other seismically-induced event deposits. LT1s have a composition similar to the hemipelagic background sediments and result from shallow mass wasting on sublacustrine slopes covered by hemipelagic sediments. LT2s have a composition different from the background sediments and can result from delta collapses, floods etc. Comparison of the frequency of all seismically-induced event deposits with local seismic intensities shows that turbidites, and especially LT1s, are most reliable for quantitative paleoseismology. LT1s are almost exclusively triggered by earthquake shaking and they most sensitively record varying seismic intensities. Over all studied lakes, the number of locations with LT1s linearly increases with increasing seismic intensity, starting with no LT1s at intensities just below VI and reaching 100% when intensities are higher than VII½. In 3 lakes that have been studied in higher detail, we found that also a turbidite’s spatial extent and thickness within a certain basin are a function of the local seismic intensity. Hence, these records allow determining the seismic intensity of ancient earthquakes at each lake. Consequently, our multilake turbidite record aids in pinpointing magnitudes, rupture locations, and extent of past subduction earthquakes in South-Central Chile. The consistent results in 17 lakes indicate that many more lacustrine basins worldwide have similar potential.",

            "abstract": "Using high-resolution multibeam bathymetry recently collected by the R/V Falkor, we evaluated the morphology, size, and tsunami-generating potential of a number of large, previously unknown, submarine landslides that excavated sections of the submerged Yucatan Shelf/carbonate platform above the Campeche Escarpment. Landslide evacuations appear to be primarily restricted to the later Cenozoic sections of the margin, removing pelagic sediments deposited above the Cretaceous shallow water carbonates exposed along the face of the escarpment. The largest landslides have evacuated areas of the shelf between 130 and 1,100 km2, possibly removing as much as 70 km3 of material in a single event. Based on the morphology of the evacuated areas, the primary mode of failure appears to be translational and retrogressive, with slide thickness primarily stratigraphically controlled. Displaced material appears to be present within some of the evacuation zones, but because sediments from the Mississippi Fan onlap the base of the Campeche Escarpment, mass-transport deposits from individual landslides have not been identified and therefore run-outs are poorly constrained. The evacuation zones are used to specify the initial conditions for tsunami modeling. Both regional, Gulf of Mexico and near-field simulations are performed to determine the severity and wave-height distribution for six slide scenarios. Preliminary results indicate that the location of maximum wave heights associated with the slide scenarios depend on the direction on down-slope slide movement, although there are significant refraction effects during basin-wide propagation. There is also significant energy dissipation during cross-shelf propagation, with wider shelves lessening the severity of tsunami runup compared to runup at coastal locations adjacent to narrower shelves. Future tsunami hazard assessments in the Gulf of Mexico should account for these large, newly discovered submarine landslides.",

During 49 earthward radial IMF events from years of 2001 to 2009, Cluster satellites have crossed the dayside magnetopause for 11 times. Among them, there are 8 events occurring at mid latitudes. The observed locations of the magnetopause are compared with the widely used magnetopause model (Shue et al., 1998). The model performance exhibits local time asymmetry at mid latitudes. The observed magnetopause contracts in the prenoon while expands in the postnoon. This local time asymmetry is confirmed by GOES magnetic field observations at geosynchronous orbits. The result might confirm the bullet shape magnetopause during radial IMF period. The model-observation differences during radial IMF periods correlate well with the solar wind dynamic pressure at mid-latitudes. The present work has indicated the important role of the IMF cone angle and dipole tilt angle in the modulation of the magnetopause shape at midlatitudes. Larger IMF cone angle or smaller dipole tilt angle can make the southern magnetopause expand further outward.",

It is shown that, we had been theoretically able to image the complex ongoing rupture process, even with some instabilities of fault slips which depend on the detected moment growth rate (see image uploaded). We also investigate the influences of station density and maximum epicentral distance of the network on real-time source imaging.

            "abstract": "Aerosol particles can affect virtually all meteorological variables due to their direct and indirect effects by altering Earth’s energy and water cycles. Heavy loading of aerosols reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching ground, that could lower surface temperature, reduce ocean-land contrast and thus affect monsoon system, whereas solar energy absorbed by aerosols alters atmospheric stability to have a feedback effect on atmospheric dynamics. By altering cloud microphysics and macrophysics, aerosols can also change cloud properties and precipitation frequency and amount. All of these can influence regional weather and climate in a dramatically. We have analyzed ample data from long-term routine measurements, intensive field experiments and global satellite products to study, together with some modeling studies, to study the impact of aerosol on global and regional climate. Particular attention will be given to the findings from our experiments as EAST-AIRE and EAST-AIRC, and DOE ARM Mobile Facility deployment in China where severe air pollution seems to have significantly impeded upon the regional climate and its long-term changes in terms of temperature, precipitation, thunderstorm, fog, atmospheric circulation, etc.",

            "abstract": "Tsunamis’ inundation heights must be accurately and efficiently predicted for a timely evacuation of coastal populations exposed to such hazardous incidents. To achieve this, approximate models have been developed for an efficient estimation of the wave propagation and runup on the world shorelines. The accuracy of these approximate models is yet a matter of dispute in regard to how much dispersion and nonlinearity should be included, and to how well the runup phenomenon is resolved.\nThe linear shallow-water model-equation is widely used for runup predictions because it is computationally efficient. However, its lack of dispersive properties is known to adversely affect the correct prediction of wave height and arrival time. The Boussinesq set of equations considers weak dispersive and nonlinear effects and, despite being computationally more expensive, has a much better accuracy. The balance between dispersive and nonlinear effects is of significant importance for the problem of landslide generated tsunamis because such nonlinear waves have a relatively small horizontal length scale (wave length) compared to the domain of propagation. This renders dispersive effects a lot more pronounced than in the case of earthquake tsunamis.\nHere we compare the runup predictions of a linear shallow-water, Boussinesq (weak dispersion and weak nonlinearity) and fully nonlinear Boussinesq model (weak dispersion, no assumption on nonlinearity) for various landslide tsunami scenarios. The equations are derived in the Lagrangian framework to allow for an accurate calculation of the runup. Contrary to Eulerian models, long-wave models in Lagrangian framework can be arranged to yield a system of partial-differential equations for the vertical and horizontal displacements of the free-surface. These evolutionary equations are then solved using a finite-difference scheme for time integration and spatial differentiation. The effect of a ridge on a long-wave train climbing up a beach is also discussed and specific features are highlighted.",

Some aspects of this complexity can be described statistically only. In order to study the time evolution of field and plasma fluctuations we consider normal, log-normal, kappa and log-kappa probability distributions. We demonstrate that the shape of distributions shows a large variability controlled for example by the level of plasma compression. For the description of large-scale multi-source fluctuations in the solar wind nonlinear multiplicative rather than linear additive processes are needed.

            "abstract": "The destruction of lithospheric plates by subduction is a fundamentally important process leading to arc magmatism and the creation of continental crust, yet subduction initiation and early magmatic arc evolution remain poorly understood. For many arc systems, onset of arc volcanism and early evolution are obscured by metamorphism or the record is deeply buried; however, initial products of arc systems may be preserved in forearc and backarc sedimentary records. IODP Expedition 351 recovered this history from the dispersed ash and pyroclast record in the proximal rear-arc of the northern IBM system west of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge. Drilling at Site U1438 in the Amami Sankaku Basin recovered a thick volcaniclastic record of subduction initiation and the early evolution of the Izu-Bonin Arc. A 160-m thick section of Neogene sediment overlies 1.3 kilometers of Paleogene volcaniclastic rocks with andesitic average composition; this volcaniclastic section was deposited on mafic volcanic basement rocks. The thin upper sediment layer is primarily terrigenous, biogenic and volcaniclastic mud and ooze with interspersed ash layers. The underlying Eocene to Oligocene volcaniclastic rocks are 33% tuffaceous mudstone, 61% tuffaceous sandstone, and 6% conglomerate with volcanic and rare sedimentary clasts commonly up to pebble and rarely to cobble size. The clastic section is characterized by repetitive conglomerate and sandstone-dominated intervals with intervening mudstone-dominated intervals, reflecting waxing and waning of coarse arc-derived sediment inputs through time. Volcanic lithic clasts in sandstones and conglomerates range from basalt to rhyolite in composition and include well-preserved pumice, reflecting a lithologically diverse and compositionally variable arc volcanic source.",

            "abstract": "We present the fourth generation of our Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4). Burned area was derived from satellite-based 500-meter maps (MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product) for the MODIS era and relations with active fire detections from the VIRS and ATSR sensors for the pre-MODIS era as described in the GFED4 burned area dataset. In addition, we added new estimates of contributions in burned area from relatively small fires that were detected by active fire algorithms but not the MCD64A1 product. Modeled fuel consumption was optimized in the modeling framework by adjusting turnover rates and compared reasonably well with measurements at the biome-level. However, discrepancies are still substantial in some biomes, highlighting the difficulty in representing fuel dynamics. For the boreal biome, we used new satellite-derived information to inform combustion completeness and fire-induced tree mortality. In general, fuel consumption (kg C m-2 of burned area) decreased compared to GFED3, especially in regions dominated by herbaceous fuels. This is compensated for by the higher burned area estimates due to the addition of small fire burned area. However, these small fires are difficult to validate at large scales, which adds to our uncertainty. In regions where small fires may play a large role, including the US, Central America, Europe, and parts of Southeast Asia, emissions have increased substantially and are now sometimes twice as high as GFED3 estimates. Global mean annual emissions over 1997-2013 were 2.1 Pg C, 350 Tg CO, and 16 Tg CH4; in general somewhat higher than GFED3 because increases in burned area were larger than decreases in fuel consumption. Interannual variability was especially large in the first years of our record with high emissions in 1997 and 1998 (3.0 and 2.7 Pg C, respectively), while the lowest year in our record was 2000 (1.8 Pg C). Emissions were also relatively low during the latter part of the record with decreasing emissions from fires associated with tropical deforestation and with socio-economic developments in northern hemisphere Africa. Interannual variability was still substantial after 2000 in many regions, especially those with high forest cover, but these regions tended to cancel each other out on a global scale; emissions remained between 1.8 and 2.3 Pg C per year after 2000.",

We choose an intermediate-depth Mw 5.6 southern Mexican earthquake, which is recorded by 190 USArray Transportable Array stations, to probe lateral variations in the thickness and velocity of the mantle transition zone. We find that the triplicated P phases by both 410 and 660 discontinuities (410 and 660) arrive 2 s faster in 342°-348° azimuths and 4 s faster in 351°-360° azimuths than the expected arrival times based on the global 1-D average velocity model. Such faster arrival times can be explained if the topography of 410 and 660 is elevated by <20 km and 20-50 km with respect to the global average depth, respectively. Furthermore, the P phase waveforms at the epicentral distance 18°-21° appear to be more complex, and it cannot be fully explained by the global 1-D model. We plan to carry out forward modeling by computing both 1-D frequency-wavenumber (FK) synthetics and 2-D finite-difference synthetics to fit the arrival times and amplitudes of the complex waveforms. We suspect that the cause of the observed waveform complexity may arise from (1) the change in the discontinuity depth, (2) the presence of low velocity zone above 410 and 660, and (3) variable impedance contrast across the 520 km discontinuity.",

This presentation provides a simple yet useful method to evaluate simulated hydrometeor profiles against the polarimetric radar-retrieved HID data in the specific case study of the Mid-latitude Continental Convective Cloud Experiment (MC3E). The MC3E is the joint NASA-DOE-funded field campaign over the DOE Southern Great Plains (SGP) site, Oklahoma, USA in Spring 2011. We focus on the April 25 case, which observed a strong deep convective system propagating over the SGP site. Colorado State University (CSU) multi-wavelength HID algorithm revealed instantaneous HID profiles and also time-integrated HID diagram separately for shallow, deep stratiform, and deep convective columns. These retrievals are used to evaluate the Weather Research Forecasting model with Spectra-Bin Microphysics (WRF-SBM) [Iguchi et al. 2013]. For this, we have developed a simple emulator of the CSU HID algorithm to consider similar hydrometeor assumptions between the WRF-SBM and CSU HID algorithm. Initial evaluation appears to be reasonable in profiles of shallow and deep stratiform columns between WRF-SBM and CSU HID retrievals, while there is apparent discrepancy in deep convective columns, which is further related to an intuitive assumption in the CSU HID algorithm. Finally feasibility and uncertainties of this approach are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater pumping in excess of recharge (groundwater mining) has lowered the potentiometric surface in Cedar Valley, southwestern Utah, by as much as 114 feet since 1939. Lowering the potentiometric surface (head decline) has caused permanent compaction of fine-grained sediments of the Cedar Valley aquifer. Recently acquired interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) imagery shows that land subsidence is occurring over an ~100 square-mile area, including two pronounced subsidence bowls in the northeastern (Enoch graben) and southwestern (Quichapa Lake area) parts of the valley. A lack of accurate historical benchmark elevation data over much of the valley prevents detailed long-term quantification of subsidence.\nIn response to the land subsidence, earth fissures have formed along the margins of the Enoch graben and north and west of Quichapa Lake. Our initial inventory of Cedar Valley fissures, which relied on aerial-photography analysis, identified 3.9 miles of fissures in 2009. With newly acquired light detection and ranging (LiDAR) coverage in 2011, we more than doubled the total length of mapped fissures to 8.3 miles. Fissures on the west side of the Enoch graben exhibit ongoing vertical surface displacement with rates as high as 1.7 inches/year. The largest Enoch-graben-west fissure has displaced street surfaces, curb and gutter, and sidewalks, and has reversed the flow direction of a sewer line in a partially developed subdivision. Several Cedar Valley fissures are closely associated with, and in some places coincident with, mapped Quaternary faults. While the majority of Cedar Valley fissures are mapped in agricultural areas, continued groundwater mining and resultant subsidence will likely cause existing fissures to lengthen and new fissures to form that may eventually impact other developed areas of the valley.",

            "abstract": "The Dead Sea Transform (DST) is the source for some of the largest earthquakes in the eastern Mediterranean. Several deep and structurally complex sedimentary basins are associated with the DST. These basins are up to 10 km deep and typically bounded by active fault zones.\nThe low seismicity of the DST combined with the limited instrumental coverage of the seismic network in the area result in a critical knowledge gap. Therefore, it is necessary to complement the limited instrumental data with synthetic data based on computational modeling, in order to study the effects of earthquake ground motion in these sedimentary basins.\nWe performed a 2D ground-motion analysis in the Dead Sea Basin (DSB) using a finite-difference code. Results indicate a complex pattern of ground motion amplification affected by the geometric features in the basin.\nTo distinguish between the individual contributions of each geometrical feature in the basin, we developed a semiquantitative decomposition approach. This approach enabled us to interpret the DSB results as follows: (1) Ground-motion amplification as a result of resonance occurs basin-wide due to a high impedance contrast at the base of the uppermost layer; (2) Steep faults generate a strong edge-effect that further ampli- fies ground motions; (3) Sub-basins cause geometrical focusing that may significantly amplify ground motions; and (4) Salt diapirs diverge seismic energy and cause a de- crease in ground-motion amplitude.\nWe address the significance of ground motion amplification due to geometrical focusing via an analytical and numerical study. We show that effective geometrical focusing occurs for a narrow set of eccentricities and velocity ratios, where seismic energy is converged to a region of ±0.5 km from surface. This mechanism leads to significant ground motion amplification at the center of the basin, up to a factor of 3; frequencies of the modeled spectrum are amplified up to the corner frequency of the source.",

The method is based on an estimation of the transfer operator of the particular dynamical system. The detection of almost invariants is posed as a Markov reduction problem with a minimization of the relative entropy, here a measure of the distance between the fine-grained system and the reduced Markov chain. It is implemented using a fast-greedy algorithm from complex network theory.\nTwo applications in different domains of climate science are presented. In the first one, two persistent and recurrent atmospheric flow regimes are identified from a simulation of a barotropic model of the northern hemispheric atmosphere with realistic winter forcing. The regimes correspond to the well-known blocked and zonal circulation regimes of the northern hemisphere. Secondly, the algorithm is applied to a correlation network estimated from 140 years of sea surface temperature data to identify spatial patterns of variability. Dominant patterns on interannual to decadal time-scales are found in the tropical Pacific (El Niño-Southern Oscillation), the North Atlantic (the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) and the Indian ocean and West Pacific.",

            "abstract": "Eurasia contributes three quarters of all terrestrial runoff to the Arctic Ocean and contains three out of four major Arctic rivers. River flow is an integrated characteristic reflecting numerous environmental characteristics and processes aggregated over large spatial domains. A significant increase in discharge during low-flow has been observed everywhere in the Eurasian pan-Arctic, while precipitation decreased over the same period. This increase was accompanied by a significant increase in air temperature. Over the permafrost regions climatic warming results in higher ground temperature, a deeper annual thaw propagation, degradation of the ice rich upper permafrost layers, and a longer thaw season. The thicker active layer has more ground water storage and regulating capacity for increased contribution to runoff during low flow periods. Melt water of the excess ground-ice near the permafrost surface also contribute to the increase in river runoff. The deeper active layer delays its freeze-up date in winter and this late active layer freeze-up and increased ground water storage result in greater contribution of subsurface water to the river system, especially in the winter season. Extensive fieldwork and analytical procedures were implemented to quantify the contribution of permafrost to river flow in small rivers of Siberia and to understand its relation to air temperature. The paper focuses on variability of various water inputs to a hydrological system across multiple scales in a series of watersheds located in the transition of tundra to forest landscapes in the Arctic. Stable isotopes of δ18O and D were used used to trace the inputs of various sources (ground ice, snow, precipitation, ground water) in a river flow. Mixing of these sources results in isotopic composition that varies throughout the year. Heavy content of δ18O and D was found during winter season and is attributed to ground water from permafrost taliks. Lighter values in spring are attributed to snow melt. Heavy isotope content during the summer is attributed to evaporation of already heavy summer precipitation.",

At this time we have elaborated and are testing two components, one for long-term monthly operation the Kinneret and the other for determining the purchase of monthly quantities from the five existing desalination plants. In parallel, we are preparing the model for the national system, based on data received from the Planning Division of the Water Authority. In each case, the first phase is a deterministic model that is tested and run under a range of hydrologic conditions, scenarios, economic parameters and management rules. The models are being used to support ongoing decision making by the Water Authority, as they are being tested for stability and ease of use through tailor-made interfaces. In the following phase, one or more approaches and methods for optimizing under uncertainty will be employed. This work encounters challenges of several kinds - uncertainty in water availability, demands, economic functions and parameters, non-linearity and size of the models, and – most important – the imperative of making the models useful and usable in practice by the Water Authority teams at the professional and management levels.\nThe work is conducted by AGAT Engineering for the Operations Division of the Israeli National Water Authority, led by Mr. Zeev Achipaz and aided by Dr. Avichai Haddad.

Collection 6 represents a significant advancement of the Deep Blue aerosol products.\nThe Deep Blue aerosol algorithm was first introduced into the MODIS operational stream for Collection 5.1 (C51). It was originally only applied over bright, non-snow surfaces such as deserts and urban areas and complemented the existing aerosol products that provided retrievals over dark vegetation. However, since then, an enhanced Deep Blue (e-Deep Blue) algorithm has been developed. Now, e-Deep Blue covers all snow-free land surfaces, including both deserts and vegetated regions, by utilizing more dynamic surface reflectance estimation techniques to account for seasonal cycles in vegetation. Cloud screening and aerosol model selection schemes have also been updated. Since the MODIS instrument on Terra continues to degrade, we’ve also applied the latest polarization and response-vs-scan-angle corrections to the MODIS C6 L1B data to improve the performance of the resulting e-Deep Blue aerosol products.\nHere we introduce our latest e-Deep Blue algorithm and C6 data products along with validation against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements for both Aqua and Terra MODIS instruments.",

            "abstract": "A satellite-based water balance method is developed to model global evapotranspiration (ET) through coupling a water balance (WB) model with a machine-learning algorithm (the model tree ensemble, MTE) (hereafter WB-MTE). The WB-MTE algorithm was firstly trained by combining monthly WB-estimated basin ET with the potential drivers (e.g., radiation, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and vegetation index) across 95 large river basins (5824 basin-months) and then applied to establish global monthly ET maps at a spatial resolution of 0.5° from 1982 to 2009. The global land ET estimated from WB-MTE has an annual mean of 593 ± 17 mm for 1982–2009, with a spatial distribution consistent with previous studies in all latitudes but the tropics. The ET estimated by WB-MTE also shows significant linear trends in both annual and seasonal global ET during 1982–2009, though the trends seem to have stalled after 1998. Moreover, our study presents a striking difference from the previous ones primarily in the magnitude of ET estimates during the wet season particularly in the tropics, where ET is highly uncertain due to lack of direct measurements. This may be tied to their lack of proper consideration to solar radiation and/or the rainfall interception process. By contrast, in the dry season, our estimate of ET compares well with the previous ones, both for the mean state and the variability. If we are to reduce the uncertainties in estimating ET, these results emphasize the necessity of deploying more observations during the wet season, particularly in the tropics.",

            "abstract": "Incorporating realistic canopy structure into models of the land surface and ecosystem functioning is important for numerous reasons. In particular it will improve predictions of the quantity and distribution of absorbed shortwave radiation. This in turn results in improved estimates of photosynthesis as well as better forward modelling of satellite observations for the purpose of data assimilation. Typical models use a one dimensional turbid medium representation, but vertically and horizontally varying structure adds significant realism to the canopy. However results from this study demonstrate that care must be taken when incorporating complex canopy schemes as they will likely reveal processes elsewhere in the model that are incorrectly parameterised to compensate for the lack of variability in the original canopy representation.\nThe Geometric Optic Radiative Transfer (GORT) model has previously been used as an observation operator for the Data Assimilation Linked ECosystem (DALEC) model to enable the assimilation of MODIS surface reflectance data. However the GORT model was not used to replace the light interception equations inside DALEC itself. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) predicted by GORT for a given canopy structure and leaf area index (LAI) will likely not be the same as that from DALEC (which uses a simple empirical relationship between fAPAR and LAI) for a corresponding canopy. Furthermore it is not possible to calibrate the DALEC fAPAR equation to fully reproduce the variability of the GORT fAPAR with respect to any given illumination conditions.\nIn this study the GORT model was used in place of the corresponding equations in DALEC. Previous experiments assimilating MODIS reflectance data were then repeated but results in terms of ecosystem scale carbon fluxes were not improved. Furthermore, as greater realism is added into the modelling experiments (for example the inclusion of realistic variation in sun angles) the prediction of carbon fluxes tended to get worse. This is due to biases within the model that compensate for missing processes, in particular accounting for the lack of seasonal variation in fAPAR in the original model formulation. Experiments examining individual parameters in the model highlight where those compensating biases exist.",

            "abstract": "In geophysical applications the boundary element method (BEM) often carries the essential physics in addition to being an efficient numerical scheme. For use of the BEM in a self-gravitating uniform half-space, we made extra effort and succeeded in deriving the fundamental solution analytically in closed-form. A problem that goes deep into the heart of the classic BEM is encountered when we try to apply the new fundamental solution in BEM for deformation field induced by a magma chamber or a fluid-filled reservoir.\nThe central issue of the BEM is the singular integral arising from determination of the boundary values. A widely employed technique is to rescale the singular boundary point into a small finite volume and then shrink it to extract the limits. This operation boils down to the calculation of the so-called C-matrix. Authors in the past take the liberty of either adding or subtracting a small volume. By subtracting a small volume, the C-matrix is (1/2)I on a smooth surface, where I is the identity matrix; by adding a small volume, we arrive at the same C-matrix in the form of I – (1/2)I. This evenness is a result of the spherical symmetry of Kelvin’s fundamental solution employed. When the spherical symmetry is broken by gravity, the C-matrix is polarized. And we face the choice between right and wrong, for adding and subtracting a small volume yield different C-matrices. Close examination reveals that both derivations, addition and subtraction of a small volume, are ad hoc. To resolve the issue we revisit the Somigliana identity with a new derivation and careful step-by-step anatomy. The result proves that even though both adding and subtracting a small volume appear to twist the original boundary, only addition essentially modifies the original boundary and consequently modifies the physics of the original problem in a subtle way. The correct procedure is subtraction.\nWe complete a new BEM theory by introducing in full analytical form what we call the singular stress tensor for the fundamental solution. We partition the stress tensor of the fundamental solution into a singular part and a regular part. In this way all singular integrals systematically shift into the easy singular stress tensor. Applications of this new BEM to deformation and gravitational perturbation induced by magma chambers of finite volume will be presented.",

Its northern termination displays a transcurrent shear zone network, the ~250 km long Além Paraíba-Pádua shear zone, which involves granulites, migmatites and granites facies mylonites deformed in transpression. A detailed microstructural and crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) study of the rock-forming minerals is being undertaken to infer constraints on the rheology of continental crust during the nucleation and development of this shear zone. A variety of mylonites (from protomylonites to ultramylonites) have been analyzed by Electron Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD) in order to determine the CPO of minerals, especially quartz, feldspars, amphibole, pyroxene and biotite. High-grade mylonites often exhibit ribbon-shaped quartz, probably due to high temperature grain boundary migration. They frequently wrap around K-feldspar porphyroclast exhibiting undulose extinction and core-mantle structures that may be related to bulging and/or subgrain rotation recrystallisation. In these HT mylonites, plagioclase is dynamically recrystallized and form fine-grained layers alternating with quartz-ribbons. Hornblende porphyroclasts present strain shadows of opaque mineral. Medium to high-grade mylonites derived from each felsic and mafic granulite and migmatitic gneisses show plagioclase with undulose extinction and deformation twins, quartz grains with both ribbon and porphyroclast shapes (> 3mm in size), orthopyroxene and garnet as porhyroclast and porphyroblast, respectively, and strongly oriented biotite. CPO of quartz indicates that it was deformed through plastic deformation with the activation of prism {a}. Feldspar CPOs show concentrations of [001] close to the lineation, of [010] close to the pole of the foliation and of [100] close to the Y strain axis, suggesting activation of the [001] (010) slip system.",

            "abstract": "We present a novel technique for imaging and data assimilation of the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere. The technique incorporates the SAMI2 model as a physics-based background model for assimilation. The Gauss-Markov Kalman filter technique is used to advance estimates of electron density and background error covariances forward in time. We incorporate regularization techniques in the assimilation algorithm to stabilize the solution in face of limited data perturbation to prevent non-physical altitudinal variation in density estimates due to limited availability of data. The above-the-horizon observations from the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) satellites are utilized in the assimilation algorithm. The estimation results show reasonable agreement with in-situ density measurements of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellites and Van Allen Probes derived densities during geomagnetically quiet and severe storm-time conditions, respectively. The results demonstrate great potential for the use of assimilation of COSMIC above-the-horizon measurements in monitoring and studying the morphology and dynamics of large-scale structures of the electron density in the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere.",

            "abstract": "Neutral sodium is typically easy to detect in active comets around perihelion, due to the very high efficiency of the sodium D transition, and at some comets a distinct neutral sodium tail is observed. The first distinct neutral sodium tail images were apparent in comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) data taken using CoCam [Cremonese et al, 1997], but since this initial detection similar features have been observed at a number of near-Sun comets using the SOHO/LASCO coronagraph. An understanding of the distribution and evolution of neutral cometary sodium may best be developed using a combination of spectra and images in different filters at multiple times throughout a comet’s orbit.\nAt present the source of neutral sodium in comets is unknown, primarily because the evolution of neutral cometary sodium is difficult to intuitively predict due to the Swings and Greenstein effects. Several authors [review presented in Cremonese et al, 1999] have suggested various combinations of sources of neutral sodium in the nuclear region, near-nuclear region, dust tail and ion tail.\nIn order to understand the wide variety of cometary observations of neutral sodium available we have developed the first fully three dimensional, heliocentric distance dependent, versatile Monte Carlo neutral sodium tail model (initially based on a model developed by [Brown et al, 1998]). Our model is known as COMPASS (Cometary Orbital Motion at Perihelion: an Adaptable Sodium Simulation), and incorporates the unintuitive variation in radiation pressure influences on sodium atoms with different heliocentric velocities.\nWe present the initial results of a comparison between COMPASS and observational data. We have found good agreement between the overall morphology of the neutral sodium tail imaged at comet Hale-Bopp and COMPASS, and have begun to extend the study to other comets of interest. We also present a comparison between simulated COMPASS spectra and observations. The versatility of COMPASS allows it to be easily adapted to any other neutral cometary sodium tail observations available.",

            "abstract": "One of the most important processes impacting the mobility of heavy metals in rivers and their hyporheic zones is reversible sorption to sediment. Reversible sorption has been shown to be a temperature dependent process, however the impact of this variability on heavy metal fate and transport, as well as environmental metal concentrations, has not received much attention. In this study we used zinc as an example heavy metal. Previous studies of the impact of temperature on the sorption of zinc on a goethite substrate show a change in partitioning coefficient and thus retardation factor of 10 to over 60 percent with a temperature change from 10 to 25*C, depending on concentration of dissolved zinc in the water. This relationship was extrapolated to estimate the change in reversible sorption of zinc on silicate sand. This change was then utilized within a finite-element model coupling hyporheic fluid flow in porous media with heat transfer and solute transport with reversible sorption to explore the ways in which variations in surface water temperature over varying timescales can drive changes in both zinc sorption and dissolved zinc fluxes at the bedform scale. These linked processes are of fundamental importance when considering the number of different ways in which surface water temperatures can be varied through both human and non-human activities.",

            "abstract": "Mass outbreaks of herbivore insects are known to perturb the functional properties of forests. However, it is less clear how endemic to moderate aboveground herbivory affects the vertical flow of nutrients from tree canopies to the soil. Here, we report on the effects of low to moderate infestation levels of the woolly beech aphid (Phyllaphis fagi L.) on the nutrient dynamics and hydrology of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). In a potted sapling experiment, we followed the vertical dynamics of nutrients via throughfall (TF), stemflow (SF) and litter leachates (LL) collected over ten weeks underneath infested and uninfested control trees.\nAphid infestation amplifies the fluxes of K+, Mn2+ and particulate nitrogen (0.45µm < PN < 500 µm) in TF solution  by 42% for K+, 59% for Mn2+ and 13% for PN relative to the control. In contrast, fluxes of NH4-N and SO4-S diminished during peaking aphid abundance by 26 and 16%, respectively. Differences in canopy-derived dissolved nitrogen and carbon compounds, sulfur (S), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ were < 10%. The effect of aphid abundance on nutrient dynamics was most notable in TF and SF and diminished in LL.\nAphid infestation greatly altered the SF fluxes of DOC, K+, Mn2+, DON and sulfur-species, which were significantly concentrated at the tree base by “funneling” the rainfall through the canopy biomass to the trunk. Normalized to one square meter, water and nutrient fluxes were amplified by a factor of up to 200 compared to TF.\nImaging of leaf surfaces by scanning electron microscopy exhibited notable differences of the surface morphology and microbiology of control, lightly infested, and heavily infested leaves. This observation might point to an aphid-mediated alteration of the phyllosphere ecology triggering the microbial uptake of NH4-N and SO4-S and its transformation to particulate N by magnified biomass growth of the phyllosphere microflora, consequently changing the chemical partitioning and temporal availability of nitrogen.",

            "abstract": "Shear waves splitting (SWS) occurs when polarized shear waves enter an anisotropic medium, and hence provide useful information about the polarization directions and anisotropic intensity. In this study we examine crustal anisotropy in the San Jacinto Fault Zone (SJFZ), using seismic data recorded by five small-aperture linear arrays (BB, RA, SGB, DW and JF) as well as other permanent and temporary seismic networks. Each array contains 7-12 stations with a length at 180-450 m, straddling different segments of the SJFZ, including the Anza seismic gap. We compute delay times and fast directions using the MFAST code (Savage et al., 2010), which is based on the method of Silver and Chan (1991) and cluster analysis (Teanby et al, 2004). Preliminary results from manual S picks of the data recorded by the RA, JF and DW arrays in 2012 show that the fast directions are generally around the north. This is consistent with the regional stress field from focal mechanism inversion. However, we observe clear variations of fast directions across the SJFZ. From the RA01 on the SW to the RA11 on the NE, the fast directions change from NNE to NNW. Similarly, the fast directions change from NNE to NNW between JFS4 on the SW and JFN4 on the NE. Given the small array apertures, such variations likely result from shallow fault structures beneath the arrays, e.g., spatial changes of crack density and preferential alignment. To fully explore the anisotropy patterns in the SJFZ, we plan to expand the SWS analysis to all the five arrays and include all available seismic data. Updated results will be presented in the meeting.",

            "abstract": "The winter of 2013-14 was an extreme one both in Europe and North America. In the UK, for instance, it was by far the wettest winter records dating back to 1910 and was also the wettest winter in the England and Wales precipitation record dating back to 1766. Furthermore, it was exceptionally stormy, with the highst numbers of stations recording gusts of over 60 knots since 1969. In the US, in contrast, winter 2013-14 was one of the coldest on record in parts of the Midwest with several states recording conditions in the coldest 10% since records began in 1895. The immediate cause of these highly anomalous conditions was the regional atmospheric circulation, with intense and persistent negative mean sea level pressure (mslp) anomalies over the North East Atlantic. The pattern of these anomalies resembles the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO - with negative mslp over the mid- to high- latitude North Atlantic and positive mslp over the Sub-Tropics), with the addition of greater-than-usual troughing over Western Europe.\nHere, we will investigate the potential global atmospheric drivers of these highly anomalous conditions. Two putative mechanisms will be examined: firstly, the strong westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) that occurred in winter 2013-14, and secondly, an up-stream influence from the tropical West Pacific via the anomalous circulation patterns that caused the intensely cold winter conditions observed over North America. To test these hypotheses we utilise sets of seasonal-length reforecasts of the 14 winters in the period 1996-2009, with 3 members each year initialised on 1st November from ERAI reanalyses. In these experiments, we perform a linear relaxation of atmospheric winds and temperatures in (i) different parts of the stratosphere, (ii) over the Aleutian region, and (iii) over the tropical West Pacific, towards conditions observed in December-February 2013-14. In addition, we perform a control set without nudging to allow us to remove the influence of the November initial conditions.\nAnalysis from these sets of experiments will be presented to diagnose the effect of the identified remote anomalies on the atmospheric circulation of the North Atlantic-European region, in particular the NAO, with a view to investigating mechanisms for this extreme winter.",

            "abstract": "Gravitational instabilities, such as landslides, avalanches, or debris flows, play a key role in erosional processes and represent one of the major natural hazards in mountainous, coastal, and volcanic regions. Despite the great amount of field, experimental and numerical work devoted to this problem, the understanding of the physical processes at work in gravitational flows is still an open issue, in particular due to the lack of observations relevant to their dynamics. In this context, the seismic signal generated by gravitational flows is a unique opportunity to obtain information on their dynamics and characteristics. Here we present the study of the 1997 Boxing Day landslide that occurred in Montserrat. We accessed the force applied by the landslide to the ground surface responsible of the seismic waves by inverting the seismic waveform recorded (force-time function). This force was then used as a constraint in a bayesian inversion problem where the forward problem is the force-time function calculation obtained by simulating the landslide with the SHALTOP model (mangeney et al., 2007). With this method, we are able to give an estimate of the rheology (friction coefficient) and the initial shape of the collapsing mass. The volume retrieved is very similar to that obtained by field observations. The friction coefficient determined is also similar to that constrained by former studies or to that predicted by empirical laws (Lucas et al., 2014). Furthermore the method permits to give an estimate of the error made on these parameters.",

            "abstract": "The response of lake chemistry to environmental stressors such as climate change or acid deposition is mediated by the landscape setting of the lake and the surrounding catchment. Hydrological delivery of solutes through surface runoff or groundwater can buffer against the impacts of anthropogenic change. Since there is often variability in these processes across a region, lakes will not react uniformly to these regional scale pressures. Understanding the landscape-level controls on lake chemistry will help determine lake sensitivity to future environmental change. Our objective is to classify seepage lakes in terms of their hydrology and landscape characteristics to explain variability in lake chemistry in northern Wisconsin. We present data from synoptic surveys of more than 90 seepage lakes across the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest of northern Wisconsin that ranged in size from 1.6 to 75 ha, conducted in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Seasonal groundwater sampling and precipitation chemistry are used to construct mixing models to quantify hydrological inputs to the lakes. The catchments of these lakes are difficult to delineate, as they are relatively small and at times have significant groundwater input, so we calculate landscape characteristics for fixed buffer zones around the lake. The chemical composition of the lakes varies widely across the landscape; for instance, dissolved organic carbon concentrations range from 2.9 to 39 mg/L, and calcium concentrations range from 0.4 to 5.3 mg/L. To explain this variability, we explore interactions between landscape features and hydrology and suggest a framework by which to classify the chemical composition of these lakes.",

            "abstract": "The process of earthquake rupture nucleation and propagation has been investigated through laboratory experiments and theoretical modelling, but a limited number of observations exist at the scale of earthquake fault zones. Distinct models have been proposed, and whether the magnitude can be predicted while the rupture is ongoing represents an unsolved question. The ability to correctly distinguish a small shock from a large event through the analysis of the first P-wave observation is crucial for risk mitigation actions triggered by earthquake early warning systems. Here we show that the evolution of P-wave peak displacement with time is informative regarding the early stage of the rupture process and can be used as a proxy for the final size of the rupture. In the present study, we measure the peak displacement amplitude of filtered P-wave signals over a progressively expanding P-wave time window, starting from the P-wave onset time, and expanding the time window until the expected arrival of the S-waves. We use a large, high-quality dataset of 43 moderate-to-strong Japanese events, in the magnitude range between 4 and 9. We analyzed more than 7000 three-component waveforms recorded at 1,208 stations, spanning a wide distance range (0-500 km). We study the relationship between the time evolution of the peak displacement and the earthquake magnitude itself to investigate a possible different scaling for small and large events. For the analyzed earthquake set, we found that the initial evolution of peak displacement is different between small and large earthquakes. In particular, we show a rapid initial increase of the peak displacement for small events and a slower growth for larger ones. The figure shows the average values of P-wave peak displacement for some representative events while the insert box shows the expected initial slope of the curves for different magnitudes. This result suggests that the evolution of P-wave peak displacement holds information regarding the early stage of the rupture process and may be a proxy for the final size of the event. Our results indicate that earthquakes breaking in a region with a large critical slip displacement value have a larger probability to grow into a large size rupture than those originating in a region with a smaller critical displacement value.",

The three-parameter CCM is a spatially explicit model structure that has been validated against extensive field observations of hillslope hydrologic connectivity (an internal process simulated by the model) to demonstrate its internal consistency, in addition to a traditional assessment to the external streamflow dynamics. In this study, we sought to examine the regional sensitivity of the CCM parameters. Specifically, we explored the catchment scale variation in model parameterization across seven TCEF watersheds. A diagnostic model calibration analysis was considered where the role of a priori parameter ranges was explored in relation to both external (streamflow) and internal (hydrologic connectivity) model performance. This investigation allowed us to develop a more in-depth understanding of the model structure, its flexibility, its regional sensitivity, and its transferability.",

However, recent reports to this question show completely different conclusions. The calculated density of a pyrolite aggregate with spin crossover-related change in iron partitioning up to 45 GPa compared well with the density in PREM [1]. On the other hand, Murakami et al’s analysis of VS in aggregates with variable amounts of Fp concluded the opposite - the lower mantle is more perovskitic than pyrolitic [2].\nWe investigated thermoelasticity of Fp with first principles DFT+U calculations. The calculated thermoelasticity are in good consitence with the available experimental data on samples with various iron concentrations. The results can well explain discrepancy on softening of the shear modulus of Fp among different experiments[3,4]. We predict velocities of Fp at lower mantle conditions and suggest that pyrolite is a reasonable compositional model for the lower mantle. Our results show the importance of constraining the elastic properties of minerals without extrapolations for analyses of the thermochemical state of this region[5].\n[1] Irifune et al., Science 327, 193 (2010).\n[2] Murakami et al., Nature 485, 90 (2012).\n[3] Crowhurst et al., Science 319, 451 (2008).\n[4] Marquardt et al., Science 324, 224 (2009).\n[5]Wu et al., Phys.

However, high-accuracy forecast of IMF Bz is not available from current heliospheric models. Here we perform a follow-up study of McPherron and Siscoe [2004] to examine the statistical characteristics of interplanetary plasma/magnetic field and probability distribution function of geomagnetic activity indices for strong IMF Bs intervals. It is shown that the occurrence of long-duration, large-amplitude IMF Bs intervals, related with different solar wind transients (such as ICME, SIR), are preceded by and change with a distinctive set of other solar wind/IMF parameters. We find that solar wind speed is positively correlated with geomagnetic indices, and that strong IMF Bs is the key to trigger storm but not necessarily substorm. We also find that solar wind density weakly affects geomagnetic activity, and the response depends on different kinds of solar wind transients that include the strong IMF Bs-events. We also find that magnetospheric ULF waves are induced by both strong southward IMF intervals and solar wind dynamic pressure disturbances.",

Mugearitic Jake_M class rocks have 80-925 ppm Zn (Zn error in APXS accuracy ~16%), which is higher than shergottites (49-90 ppm) [Meyer, 2012] and abraded Adirondack rocks in Gusev Crater (75–117 ppm) [Gellert et al., 2006], but similar to Irvine and Barnhill class rocks in Gusev (230–422 ppm) [Ming et al., 2008]. The source of Jake_M was enriched in Zn, possibly by partial melting of metasomatized mantle [Stolper et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2014]. Relative to Jake_M, most clastic rocks encountered in Gale (sols 0–687) are moderately enriched in Zn (500–1900 ppm). Surface alteration is unlikely to cause elevated Zn because soils have lower Zn (310 to 380 ppm). Excluding soils, veins, very dusty rocks, and high-Ni John Klein rocks, Zn correlates with Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ni (r = 0.83, 0.68, 0.72, and 0.67, respectively). The positive relationships suggest that Zn is mobilized with these metals, possibly precipitating in oxide sedimentary cements with Fe-oxides and/or in the Fe-rich amorphous component. In this subset of rocks, Zn does not correlate with Cl, Br, or S; widespread Zn-halogen salts and Zn-sulfides are unlikely. Notable exceptions are the float rocks Et_Then and Secure, which have high FeO (25–27 wt%) but low Zn (~230–490 ppm) and are interpreted to reflect a distinct cementation or rock coating episode. Two Gale targets <1 m apart at the Kimberly outcrop are highly enriched in Zn, demonstrating the localized nature of Zn enrichments: Windjana drill fines (3430-4680 ppm Zn) have high K2O (3.6 wt%), FeO (~26 wt%), MnO (~0.56 wt%), and Ni (~380 ppm); Stephen (~8150 ppm Zn), interpreted to have a MnO-rich (~4.5 wt%) coating, also has high Ni (~1285 ppm), Cl (~3.2 wt%), and Br (~1850 ppm). An igneous origin of the Zn enrichments in Jake M class rocks is likely, and hydrothermal and/or diagenetic processes probably concentrated Zn in the clastic outcrops. The conditions implied by this model constrain the fluid history and habitability of Gale Crater.",

(2010)\nobserved that the strongest amplifications were observed for tightly clustered aftershocks aligned with the fault dip beneath FAGN thus indicating a fault-guided effect. In a second paper, Calderoni et al. (2012) found that the most efficient trapped waves at FAGN were clustered at the northwestern and southeastern tips of the fault plane responsible for the MW 6.1, L'Aquila earthquake.\nIn this study we examine temporal variations of the fault zone properties analyzing the fault-trapped waves generated by 19 repeaters located at the northwestern tip. Fault-zone trapped waves are particularly suited for this analysis as their amplitude and frequency content depend on the geometry and elastic and anelastic parameters of the fault zone.\nWe observe that efficiency of trapped waves (estimated through spectral ratio amplitudes) sudden increased immediately following the Mw 4.1, March 30 largest foreshock. This increase persists until the occurrence of the mainshock, then amplitude decreases to the background after a hundred of days. Material properties are the most obvious candidates of temporal changes but the concomitant role of rupture directivity was also checked, thanks to the precise information on along-strike directivity of that fault inferred by Calderoni et al.

            "abstract": "An axisymmetric, two-dimensional numerical model has been developed that describes heat and mass transport within crustal magma chambers during repeated intrusion of mafic sills. The model includes mass transport (melt segregation) via buoyancy driven flow of melt along grain boundaries and compaction of the crystalline matrix. Results demonstrate that the majority of the magma chamber is in a mush state at low to moderate intrusion rates, consistent with previous thermal models. However, the melt segregation processes included here lead to periodic formation of high melt fraction (magma) layers within the mush which could be tapped from the chamber to erupt or ascend to a shallower reservoir. Moreover, the magma composition is chemically evolved because melt reacts with the crystal mush as it migrates upwards into cooler regions of the chamber. Eruptible magma is therefore present in the chamber at lower mafic intrusion rates than has been predicted by purely thermal models because (i) segregation causes melt to accumulate in discrete layers and (ii) the evolved magma composition remains liquid at lower temperatures. Moreover, differentiation of the magma is driven primarily by mush processes rather than by fractional crystallisation, as is assumed to dominate in traditional models of liquid-filled magma chambers. Such magma chambers can only be maintained by very high intrusion rates of new mafic material. We will use our new 2D thermo-mechanical code to model the growth of the magma chamber beneath the Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat, which has previously been investigated using a thermal-only model and constraints from seismic refraction data. The model results show that melt segregation leads to decoupling of the maximum temperature and melt fraction. Its addition will therefore provide improved estimates of the dimensions and frequency of successive magma injections into the chamber, as well as shed light on the evolution of potentially eruptible magma and magmatic fluid with time.",

Wherever someone’s own location is, they can be automatically informed when an earthquake has struck just by setting a magnitude threshold and an area of interest. No need to browse the internet: the information reaches you automatically and instantaneously!\nOne question remains: are the provided earthquake notifications always relevant for the public? A while after damaging earthquakes many eyewitnesses scrap the application they installed just after the mainshock. Why? Because either the magnitude threshold is set too high and many felt earthquakes are missed, or it is set too low and the majority of the notifications are related to unfelt earthquakes thereby only increasing anxiety among the population at each new update.\nFelt and damaging earthquakes are the ones of societal importance even when of small magnitude. LastQuake app and Twitter feed (QuakeBot) focuses on these earthquakes that matter for the public by collating different information threads covering tsunamigenic, damaging and felt earthquakes.\nNon-seismic detections and macroseismic questionnaires collected online are combined to identify felt earthquakes regardless their magnitude. Non seismic detections include Twitter earthquake detections, developed by the USGS, where the number of tweets containing the keyword “earthquake” is monitored in real time and flashsourcing, developed by the EMSC, which detect traffic surges on its rapid earthquake information website caused by the natural convergence of eyewitnesses who rush to the Internet to investigate the cause of the shaking that they have just felt.\nWe will present the identification process of the felt earthquakes, the smartphone application and the 27 automatically generated tweets and how, by providing better public services, we collect more data from citizens.",

            "abstract": "While the Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon Emissions (TCRE) demonstrates that near-surface air temperature warming is approximately proportional to cumulative emissions, oceanic heat and carbon uptake and sea level rise are far less easily constrained by this metric. Past work using the GFDL-ESM2G Earth System Model explored the robustness of TCRE across a range of policy-relevant emission rates, including a very low emission rate (2 GtC/yr), a very high emission rate (25 GtC/yr), and the case of ceasing emissions. TCRE varies between 0.76 and 1.04 ºC/TtC over this range of emissions, but this range is small (~12%) compared to the range across CMIP5 models. Here we demonstrate that the timescales of oceanic heat and carbon uptake play an important role in the rate dependence of TCRE. Analysis of the zonal patterns in the air-sea surface fluxes of heat and carbon illustrate important differences between the two that are a function of emissions rate. We find the ultimate fate of anthropogenic heat and carbon in the ocean also depends on the rate of emissions, and particularly, the timescales of oceanic transport. Low emission rates afford the ocean more time to transport heat and carbon throughout the world oceans whereas high emission rates have distinct basin scale differences in their patterns of uptake and storage. These oceanic processes lead to basin scale differences in sea level rise under varying emission rates for the same cumulative emission levels and have important climate adaptation consequences.",

            "abstract": "The associated hazards and opaqueness of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) make it impossible for in-situ thermal or concentration measurements within the currents that would provide critical information on the dynamics of PDCs. The entrainment of ambient air into these currents significantly impacts their runout distance and thermal history. The most efficient mechanism to cool a PDC is through the entrainment of colder, denser ambient air through Kelvin-Helmholtz and lobe-and-cleft instabilities, which are dependent on density stratification in the current and topographic-current interactions. The combination of high-resolution multiphase numerical models in concert with field measurements of PDC deposits allows us to better understand the evolving concentration gradients, instabilities, entrainment of air, and temperatures of PDCs. We employ a three-dimensional multiphase Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian (EEL) model, high-resolution topography, and field data to understand the PDCs that traveled down the Juive Grande quebrada during the 2006 eruption of Tungurahua volcano. The multiphase model allows us to examine PDC dynamics such as particle concentrations, velocities, thermal heterogeneities, and ambient air entrainment. As the PDC propagates, the entrainment coefficient decreases due to enhanced density stratification. The interaction of the current with rugged topography increases the entrainment coefficient. We also calculate the temperature of deposition and breadcrust bomb rind thickness for individual pyroclasts. The individual pyroclasts are tracked as Lagrangian particles in the multiphase model and we employ the breadcrust bomb model (Benage et al., 2014) to calculate the deposition temperature and the formation of the non-vesicular to low vesicularity rinds. The model results are compared to paleomagnetic data and field measurements of rind thickness, respectively. This allows the deposited pyroclasts to be natural thermometers that help constrain the thermal history of the PDCs. Through these field-constrained models we are able to examine the interior of these currents that are otherwise inaccessible.",

            "abstract": "Despite the fact that highway embankments are highly prone to earthquake induced damage, there are not enough studies in the literature concentrated on improving the seismic performance of highway embankments.\nEmbankments which are quite stable under static load conditions can simply collapse during earthquakes due to the destructive seismic loading. This situation poses a high sequence thread to the structural integrity of the embankment, service quality and serviceability.\nThe objective of this study is to determine the effect of the geosynthetic reinforcement on the seismic performance of the highway embankments and evaluate the seismic performance of the geotextile reinforced embankment under different earthquake motions. A 1:50 scale highway embankment model is designed and reinforced with geosynthetics in order to increase the seismic performance of the embankment model. A series of shaking table tests were performed for the identical unreinforced and reinforced embankment models using earthquake excitations with different characteristics. The experimental results were evaluated comparing the unreinforced and reinforced cases. Results revealed that reinforced embankment models perform better seismic performance especially under specificied ground excitations used in this study. Also, the prototype embankment was numerically modelled. It is seen that similar seismic behavior trend is obtained in the finite element simulations.",

            "abstract": "Nitrate (NO3-) is a widespread contaminant of groundwater and surface water across the United States that has deleterious effects to human and ecological health. Legacy contamination, or past releases of NO3-, is thought to be impacting current groundwater and surface water of North Carolina. This study develops a model for predicting point-level groundwater NO3- at a state scale for monitoring wells and private wells of North Carolina. A land use regression (LUR) model selection procedure known as constrained forward nonlinear regression and hyperparameter optimization (CFN-RHO) is developed for determining nonlinear model explanatory variables when they are known to be correlated. Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) is then used to integrate the LUR model to create a LUR-BME model of spatial/temporal varying groundwater NO3- concentrations. LUR-BME results in a leave-one-out cross-validation r2 of 0.74 and 0.33 for monitoring and private wells, effectively predicting within spatial covariance ranges. The major finding regarding legacy sources NO3- in this study is that the LUR-BME models show the geographical extent of low-level contamination of deeper drinking-water aquifers is beyond that of the shallower monitoring well. Groundwater NO3- in monitoring wells is highly variable with many areas predicted above the current Environmental Protection Agency standard of 10 mg/L. Contrarily, the private well results depict widespread, low-level NO3-concentrations. This evidence supports that in addition to downward transport, there is also a significant outward transport of groundwater NO3- in the drinking water aquifer to areas outside the range of sources. Results indicate that the deeper aquifers are potentially acting as a reservoir that is not only deeper, but also covers a larger geographical area, than the reservoir formed by the shallow aquifers. Results are of interest to agencies that regulate surface water and drinking water sources impacted by the effects of legacy NO3- sources. Additionally, the results can provide guidance on factors affecting the point-level variability of groundwater NO3- and areas where monitoring is needed to reduce uncertainty. Lastly, LUR-BME predictions can be integrated into surface water models for more accurate management of non-point sources of nitrogen.",

Mercury is present in the atmosphere mainly in its elemental form (Hg0~98 %), which has a relatively high volatility, low solubility and chemical inertness. Hydrogen sulfide, one of the most abundant gas species in volcanic fluids, is highly poisoning and corrosive.\nIn this study, an innovative real-time method for the measurements of Hg0 and H2S concentrations in air was carried out at La Solfatara Crater, a hydrothermally altered tuff-cone nested in the town of Pozzuoli (Southern Italy), and at Mt. Amiata volcano (Central Italy), where a world-class Hg mining district abandoned in the seventies and a presently-exploited geothermal field for the production of electrical energy occur. The main aims were (i) to test this new methodological approach and (ii) to investigate Hg0 and H2S concentrations and the chemical-physical parameters regulating their spatial distribution in polluted areas.\nA portable Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometer with high frequency modulation of light polarization (Lumex RA-915M) was used in combination with a pulsed fluorescence gas analyzer (Thermo Scientific Model 450i) to measure Hg0 and H2S, respectively. The instruments were synchronized and set at high-frequency acquisition (10 sec and 1 min, respectively). Measurements were carried out along pathways (up to 12 km long) at an average speed of <10 km/h and coupled with GPS data and meteorological parameters. In selected sites, passive samplers were positioned to determine the time-integrated Hg0 and H2S concentrations to be compared with the real-time measurements.\nThe results indicate that this approach is highly efficient and effective in providing reliable and reproducible Hg0 and H2S concentrations and can be used to identify and characterize gas emitters in different environments.",

            "abstract": "We model the formation of the Moon’s Orientale basin from impact to crater collapse using the iSALE hydrocode. Although we use GRAIL and LOLA data to constrain our models, we show that the modeled basin structure reveals more detail than inverse models can predict. Orientale exhibits three concentric topographic rings; the Outer Rook (R=330 km) and Cordillera (R=430 km), which are morphologically consistent with normal fault scarps; and the Inner Rook Ring (R=230 km), which is not. Our numerical models allow us to see, for the first time, how these ring structures form in real time. Shortly after ejecta emplacement, as the transient crater collapses, the Outer Rook fault forms followed by the Cordillera fault, with both faults cutting all the way through the crust. Subsequently, the topographic expression of the Inner Rook Ring is produced in part by the collapse of a central uplift, consistent with previous interpretation that the formation of Inner Rook Ring is analogous to the formation of peak-rings seen in smaller basins. The Inner Rook Ring is then modified by a secondary phase of inward collapse. The resultant basin structure is generally in good agreement with GRAIL derived crustal thickness models. Our modeling reveals that that two inflection points in the GRAIL derived crustal thickness are associated with Moho offsets of a few kilometers, which are the result of slip along the Cordillera and Inner Rook faults. In the future this association may be used to determine where faults are located in older mare filled basins. Our models also show that dilatant bulking is enhanced near the faults. Despite GRAIL’s incredible sensitivity and resolution, localized Moho offsets and density changes associated with faults cannot be resolved by inverse modeling. A direct comparison of the gravity anomalies produced by these localized density features and present-day gravity could constrain the geometry of proposed ring dikes in the Orientale basin.",

            "abstract": "Mountain basins and the headwaters of river basins along the foothills of major mountain ranges are undergoing rapid environmental change due to urban development, land acquisition by investors, population increase, and climate change. Classical water infrastructure in these regions is primarily designed to meet human water demand associated with agriculture, tourism, and economic development. Often overlooked and ignored is the fundamental interdependence of human water demand, ecosystem water demand, water rights and allocation, and water supply. A truly sustainable system for water resources takes into account ecosystem demand along with human infrastructure and economic demand, as well as the feedbacks that exist between them. Allocation policies need to take into account basin resilience that is the amount of stress the system can handle under varying future scenarios. Changes in stress on the system can be anthropogenic in the form of population increase, land use change, economic development, or may be natural in the form of climate change and decrease in water supply due to changes in precipitation. Mapping the water rights, supply, and demands within the basin can help determine the resiliency and sustainability of the basin.\nHere, we present a coupled natural human system project based in the French Broad River Basin, in the Southern Appalachians. In the first phase of the project, we are developing and implementing a coupled hydro-economics modeling framework in the Mills River Basin (MRB), a tributary of the French Broad. The Mills River Basin was selected as the core basin for implementing a sustainable system of water allocation that is adaptive and reflects the interdependence of water dependent sectors. The headwaters of the Mills River are in the foothills of the Appalachians, and are currently under substantial land use land cover (LULC) change pressure for agricultural purposes. In this regard, the MRB is representative of similar headwater basins in regions of complex terrain undergoing similar pressures such as the Andes and Himalayas. First results of the project including a quantitative organigram mapping water availability, water consumption, and the relationships among water stakeholders within the basin will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The transport pathways of water beneath a glacier are subject to change as melt seasons progress due to variability in the balance between basal water pressure and water flux. Subglacial hydrology has been well studied, but the understanding of spatial distribution is less well constrained. Whereas radiogenic isotopic tracers have been traditionally used as proxies to track spatial variability and weathering rates in fluvial and riverine systems, these techniques have yet to be applied extensively to the subglacial environment and may help resolve ambiguity in subglacial hydrology. Research has shown the 143Nd/144Nd values can reflect variation in source provenance processes due to variations in the age of the continental crust. Correlating the 143Nd/144Nd with other radiogenic isotope systematics such as strontium (87Sr/86Sr) provides important constraints on the role of congruent and incongruent weathering processes. Our study presents the application of Nd and Sr systematics using isotopic ratios to the suspended load of subglacial meltwater collected over a single melt season at Lemon Creek Glacier, USA (LCG). The time-series data show an average εNd ~ -6.83, indicating a young bedrock (~60 MYA). Isotopic variation helps track the seasonal expansion of the subglacial meltwater channels and subsequent return to early season conditions due to the parabolic trend towards less radiogenic Nd in June and towards more radiogenic Nd beginning in mid-August. However, the high variability in July and early August may reflect a mixture of source as the channels diverge and derive sediment from differently aged lithologies. We find a poor correlation between 143Nd/144Nd and 87Sr/86Sr (R2= 0.38) along with a slight trend towards more radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr values with time ((R2= 0.49). This may indicate that, even as the residence time decreases over the melt season, the LCG subglacial system is relatively stable and that the bedrock is congruently weathered. Our study suggests that the 143Nd/144Nd is a useful tool for tracking sediment source and hydrological dynamics in the subglacial environment.",

            "abstract": "Since the onset of the industrial revolution, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased by more than 40% (120 ppm) due to anthropogenic activities. While nearly half of these carbon emissions remain in the atmosphere, the ocean has absorbed approximately 30% of the excess CO2. The increase in the ocean aqueous CO2 inventory has resulted in a significant change in seawater chemistry, most notably the decline of mean seawater pH (0.1 units since 1750). Some marine calcifiers, such as planktonic foraminifera, have shown an adverse response to ocean acidification exhibited as a reduction in calcification efficiency. Estimates indicate that planktonic foraminifera are responsible for up to 55% of the total open marine calcium carbonate flux and also serve as low tropic food web members making them an important constituent for chemical and biological processes in the oceans. This study utilizes morphometric (area density) and geochemical (B/Ca) analyses of planktonic foraminifera to calibrate species-specific responses to changes in modern ocean carbonate chemistry. These proxy methods have been applied to down-core records with nearly annual to sub-annual resolution to reconstruct past changes that have occured since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The sediments used for this study were collected in the Santa Barbara Basin within the California Current System (CSS), which has been identified as a region of rapidly increasing ocean acidification due to natural upwelling processes and increasing atmospheric CO2. This study will evaluate the effect of ocean acidification on several species of planktonic foraminifera to improve our understanding of the response of these organisms to modern changes in atmospheric CO2.",

            "abstract": "The Peruvian coast hosts one of the largest upwelling systems leading to a zone of high productivity. The combination of nutrient inputs from upwelled waters and iron input from the continental shelf sediments facilitates phytoplankton growth. However, the high chlorophyll areas are sporadic within the Peruvian zone with alternating iron-replete to iron-limited conditions leading to High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll zones. The lack of iron relative to the high nutrient concentration in these areas of the upwelling system is mainly due to the narrowing of the continental shelf which reduces the supply of sedimentary iron and thus, impacts the biological productivity. During the 2013 U.S. GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT), sediment inputs from the Peruvian continental shelf were traced by radium, a natural radionuclide produced by the decay of sediment-bound thorium isotopes. In situ pumps were deployed to collect large volumes of seawater to map the distribution of radium isotopes in concert with a wide range of trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) across the Peruvian upwelling area. Here, we report vertical profiles of radium (223Ra, 224Ra, 226Ra, 228Ra) along a transitional zone between the coastal and central oceanic waters of the South Pacific up to 110 °W to investigate benthic Ra isotope inputs and the implications for shelf sediment-derived TEI fluxes to the phytoplankton bloom in offshore waters.",

            "abstract": "The static shift is one of the main problems that cause misleads in the magnetotellurics (MT) interpretation. This work presents a study comparing methods for removing the static shift effect from MT data acquired around the Pisagua Fault in Chile (2014). This evaluation considers the methods based on the joint inversion of the subsurface resistivity with the static shift effect and the calibration based on the TDEM data.\nFirst, it was developed a formulation in the data space, following the work of W. Siripunvaraporn (2005), that allows the joint inversion of the resistivity model and the static shift effect. That formulation makes it possible to use any linear representation for removing the static shift in the MT stations. This property permits compare the representation proposed by Sasaki (2004) and the static shift tensor, which use a 2x2 matrix to correct the effect. The last one is suggested to be a better model for 3D MT responses, because it can reproduce the distortion on the phase of MT data.\nTwenty one stations, measuring MT and TDEM methods, were acquired at the east side of the Pisagua town in the North of Chile (figure). In this place, there is an evident scarp on the topography that reveals the existence of an important fault (Pisagua Fault). Also, the Chilean desert at this location is characterized by the presence of shallow nitrate deposits (called “caliche”), whose have an elevated electrical resistance and can produce the static shift effect in the MT stations. For those reasons it was expected that the sector around the Pisagua Fault was an adequate place to evaluate static correction methods, because the data certainly would be distorted by the static shift and a successful correction method should reveal the fault observed at surface.\nThe MT data acquired have mostly a 3D dimensionality (using A. Marti criteria, 2009) and show signs of being static shifted. A 3D inversion of this data, without considering the static shift, results in a poor misfit and the Pisagua fault does not appear in the model obtained. Calibrating the MT data with the TDEM soundings marginally improve the results. Only the joint inversion methods that include static shift effect could obtain models where the Pisagua fault is present and their responses have an adequate misfit with the data.",

            "abstract": "The East African Rift (EAR) shows evidence for active magmatism from the eruption of flood basalts 30 Ma to active volcanism associated with rifting today. Mantle plumes have been invoked as the likely cause. However, the nature of mantle upwelling is debated, with proposed models ranging from a single broad plume, the African Superplume, connected to the LLSVP beneath Southern Africa, to multiple distinct sources of upwelling along the East-Africa Rift.\nWe present a new relative travel-time tomography model that images detailed P-wave velocities below the northern East-African rift from the surface to lower mantle depths. Data comes from 439 stations that cover the area from Tanzania to Saudi Arabia. The aperture of the integrated dataset allows us to image for the first time low-velocity structures of ~ 100-km length scales down to depths of 900 km beneath this region.\nOur images provide evidence of at least two separate low-velocity structures with a diameter of ~200 km that continue through the transition zone and into the lower mantle: the first, and most pronounced, is beneath the Afar Depression, which extends to at least 900 km depth and a second is located beneath the Main Ethiopian Rift that extends to at least 750 km.\nTaking into account seismic sensitivity to temperature and thermally controlled phase boundary topography, we interpret these features as multiple focused upwellings from below the transition zone with excess temperatures of ~ 100-150 K. Such temperatures are also fully consistent with previous petrological and other geophysical estimates. Furthermore, the separate structures could explain differences in geochemistry of erupted magmas along the rift zone, as well as the dynamic topography seen at the surface. Our findings thus support the involvement of multiple plumes in the evolution of the EAR and a direct connection between lower mantle features and the volcanism at the surface.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural field burning plays an important role in atmospheric pollution and climate change. Current air quality simulation exhibits significant error in crop residue burning season. A high quality emission inventory is the foremost requirement for air quality model simulation. The development of such sporadic emission sources emission inventory is always challenging. Currently, satellite-based burned area methodologies specifically calibrated for crop residue burning are limited, whereas the combination of statistical date and satellite date will improve the accuracy of the result. This work aims to develop a higher accuracy emission inventory for agricultural burning in China and analyze its temporal and spatial distributions. Province-specific statistical data, distributed by the Chinese national government were utilized to estimate the total amount of crop residue burning for the year 2012. Specifically, on the basis of China’s realities we applied the latest China’s grain-to-straw ratio and used agriculture mechanization ratio for the first time to calculate the burning amount of crop residue. Based on the newest local experimental emission factors by province and crop type, the total amounts of TSP, PM10, S02, NOX, NH3, CH4, EC, OC, NMVOCs, CO and CO2, emitted from crop residue burning in the field, were estimated. Emissions were allocated to a 40km×40km grid and 10-day interval by MODIS Fire product(MOD/MYD14A1). To reduce the impact of missing fire counts we modified the satellite date by statistical analysis. Our inventory applied the most detailed and latest activity date and improved the problem of satellite products’ limitation for crop residue burning in fields. Our approach provides a more consistent methodology for quantifying the emission of crop residue burning than the previously available method and our emission inventory could meet the need of air quality simulations.",

            "abstract": "Methane stable isotope analysis, coupled with mole fraction measurement, has been used to link isotopic signature to methane emissions from the leading methane sources in the London region, such as landfills and gas leaks. A mobile Picarro G2301 CRDS analyser was installed in a vehicle, together with an anemometer and a Hemisphere GPS receiver, to measure atmospheric methane mole fractions and their relative location. When methane plumes were located and intercepted, air samples were collected in Tedlar bags, for δ13C-CH4 isotopic analysis by CF-GC-IRMS (Continous Flow-Gas Chromatography-Isotopic Ratio Mass Spectroscopy). This method provides high precision isotopic values, determining δ13C-CH4 to ±0.05 per mil.\nThe bulk signature of the methane plume into the atmosphere from the whole source area was obtained by Keeling plot analysis, and a δ13C-CH4 signature, with the relative uncertainty, allocated to each methane source investigated. The averaged δ13C-CH4 signature for landfill sites around the London region is – 58 ± 3 ‰, whereas the δ13C-CH4 signature for gas leaks is fairly constant at -36 ± 2 ‰, a value characteristic of North Sea supply.\nThe Picarro G2301 analyser was installed also on the roof of King’s College London, located in the centre of the city, and connected to an air inlet located 7 meters above roof height. An auto-sampler was connected to the same air inlet and launched remotely when a high nocturnal build up was expected, allowing up to twenty air bags to be collected for methane isotopic analysis over a 24 hour period. The main source contributing to overnight methane build up in central London is fugitive gas, in agreement with inventories.\nFrom the isotopic characterisation of urban methane sources and the source mix in London, the contribution to the urban methane budget and the local distribution of the methane sources given in inventories can be validated.",

In such observations the phosphor persistence in the image intensifier, depending on its characteristic decay time, might lead to a significant distortion of the optical signals recorded by those cameras. In the present work, we analyze observational data obtained using different camera systems to discuss the effects of phosphor persistence on high-speed video observations of sprites, and introduce a deconvolution technique to effectively reduce such effects. The discussed technique could also be used to enhance the high-speed images of other transient optical phenomena in the case when the phosphor persistence has a characteristic decay time that is comparable to the temporal resolution of the cameras required to resolve the phenomena.",

            "abstract": "Hotspot volcanism in locations such as Hawaii and Iceland is commonly thought to be associated with plumes rising from the deep mantle. In theory these dynamic upwellings should be visible in seismic data due to their reduced seismic velocity and their effect on mantle transition zone thickness. Numerous studies have attempted to image plumes [1,2,3], but their deep mantle origin remains unclear. In addition, a debate continues as to whether lower mantle plumes are visible in the form of body wave travel time delays, or whether such delays will be erased due to wavefront healing. Here we combine geodynamic modeling of mantle plumes with synthetic seismic waveform modeling in order to quantitatively determine under what conditions mantle plumes should be seismically visible. We model compressible plumes with phase changes at 410 km and 670 km, and a viscosity reduction in the upper mantle. These plumes thin from greater than 600 km in diameter in the lower mantle, to 200 – 400 km in the upper mantle. Plume excess potential temperature is 375 K, which maps to seismic velocity reductions of 4 – 12 % in the upper mantle, and 2 – 4 % in the lower mantle. Previous work that was limited to an axisymmetric spherical geometry suggested that these plumes would not be visible in the lower mantle [4]. Here we extend this approach to full 3D spherical wave propagation modeling. Initial results using a simplified cylindrical plume conduit suggest that mantle plumes with a diameter of 1000 km or greater will retain a deep mantle seismic signature.\n",

            "abstract": "Root zone soil moisture (0-1m) is an important variable for hydrological and weather forecast models. Its prediction accuracy depends on a good initialization of soil moisture because it regulates the energy and mass balance exchange between land surface and atmosphere. Observations from recent (or near future) soil moisture missions (e.g. SMOS/SMAP) have been (or will be) used in innovative studies to provide high spatial (i.e. 40 km) and temporal resolution (i.e. 3-days) soil moisture estimates from brightness temperature observations. However, these missions are only sensitive to near-surface soil moisture (0–5 cm). In contrast with other routinely available global remote sensing measurements, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provides accurate measurements of the entire vertically integrated terrestrial water storage (TWS) column. GRACE is characterized by low spatial (i.e. 400 km) and temporal (i.e. monthly) resolutions, therefore it requires disaggregation to higher spatial and temporal scales. In this work we have investigated the potential for using TWS and brightness temperature observations to improve root zone soil moisture. We have assimilated GRACE and SMOS observations into the Catchment land surface model, using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System, version 5 (GEOS-5) land surface data assimilation system. The ensemble-based assimilation scheme is used to disaggregate the GRACE observations in space and time (from observation to model resolution scales), and also to vertically decompose the observations into individual land surface moisture components (i.e.: groundwater, surface and root zone soil moisture). Model estimates with and without observations assimilation are compared against independent measurements of groundwater and soil moisture over the Continental U.S. Results suggest that the joint assimilation of GRACE and SMOS data has the potential to improve soil moisture estimates. However, the performance of the assimilation strongly depends on the chosen measurement and model error structures. The optimization of the assimilation technique constitutes a fundamental step toward a multi-variate multi-resolution integrative assimilation system aiming to improve our understanding of the global terrestrial water cycle.",

            "abstract": "The Baltic Sea region in Northern Europe spans different climate and population zones, from a temperate, highly populated, industrialized south with intensive agriculture to a boreal, rural north. It represents an old cultural landscape, and the Baltic Sea itself is among the most intensively studied sea areas of the world.\nBaltic Earth is the new Earth system research network for the Baltic Sea region. It is the successor to BALTEX, which was terminated in June 2013 after 20 years and two successful phases. Baltic Earth stands for the vision to achieve an improved Earth system understanding of the Baltic Sea region. This means that the research disciplines of BALTEX continue to be relevant, i.e. atmospheric and climate sciences, hydrology, oceanography and biogeochemistry, but a more holistic view of the Earth system encompassing processes in the atmosphere, on land and in the sea as well as in the anthroposphere shall gain in importance in Baltic Earth.\nSpecific grand research challenges have been formulated, representing interdisciplinary research questions to be tackled in the coming years. A major means will be scientific assessments of particular research topics by expert groups, similar to the BACC approach, which shall help to identify knowledge gaps and develop research strategies. A major outcome of Baltic Earth will be the update of the BALTEX Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin (BACC II).\nThis new study after 5 years finds the results of BACC I still valid. Climate change can be detected at the regional scale but attribution is still weak. The effect of changing atmospheric aerosol loads and land use change is largely unknown so far and needs further attention in the coming years. For the observed changes in biogeochemical and ecological systems, multiple drivers are at work of which climate change is one. Their relative importance still needs to be evaluated.\nWhen addressing climate change impacts on e.g. forestry, agriculture, urban complexes and the marine and terrestrial environment in the Baltic Sea basin, a broad perspective is needed which considers not only climate change but also other significant factors such as emission changes, demographic, economic as well as land-use changes.",

            "abstract": "Under climate change, atmospheric water content also tends to change. This gives rise to changes in the amount of moisture transferred, clouds and precipitation, as well as in hydrological regime.\nThis work analyzes seasonal climatic characteristics of precipitated water in the Arctic atmosphere, by using 1972-2011 data from 55 upper-air stations located north of 60°N. Regions of maximum and minimum mean values and variability trends are determined. In the summer, water amount is shown to increase in nearly the whole of the latitudinal zone. The comparison with the similar characteristics of reanalysis obtained by the other authors shows a good agreement. Time variation in the atmosphere moisture transport crossing 70°N, which is calculated from observation data, is presented and compared with model results.\nThe work is supported by the joint EC ERA.Net RUS and Russian Fundamental Research Fund Project \"Arctic Climate Processes Linked Through the Circulation of the Atmosphere\" (ACPCA) (project 12-05-91656-ЭРА_а).",

            "abstract": "Alterations to forest canopy structures can have a direct effect on hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in forest ecosystems. Epiphytes act as additional canopy biomass intercepting water, effecting pathways under different micrometeorological conditions and alternating nutrient uptake/releases. Most studies on epiphyte cover have focused on non-vascular epiphytes (e.g., lichen and bryophyte mosses), leaving vascular epiphytes like Tillandsia usneoides L. (Spanish moss) relatively understudied. To fill this gap, we characterized alterations to throughfall water and dissolved ion enrichment/flux to soils by T. usneoides in a Quercus Virginiana Mill. (southern live oak) stand on St. Catherine’s Island. Specifically, we compare throughfall generated from heavy T. usneoides coverage, bare canopy, and a continuum of T. usneoides cover percentages (~400 water & 210 chemistry observations over ~40 storms for each canopy cover category). Findings show T.usneoides acts as a significant water storage agent, significantly reducing throughfall. However, under certain meteorological conditions T. usneoides can become saturated and act as a funneling “hotspot.” Tillandsia usneoides coverage enriched throughfall with primarily dry deposited ions (Na+,Cl-, SO42−, Li+), leached greater Mg2+, Ca2+, reduced NO3- and increased NH4+ concentrations. Dry deposited ion enrichment is likely a result of the moss’ greater surface roughness. It has been shown that epiphytes prefer to leach Mg2+ and Ca2+. Increased NH4+ suggests that the saturated T. usneoides mat likely hosts microbial decomposition of leaf, branch, and bark biomass ensnared in the plant itself. K-means cluster analysis on the storms revealed 4 storm types of the differing meteorological conditions (windy/calm, dry/wet [high/low VPD], high/low intensity, intermittent/consistent), and these throughfall dynamics varied between these storm types. Discussion of future research questions regarding how these throughfall variations may impact ecological communities in the litter, soil, or understory vegetation is also provided.",

            "abstract": "In semi arid ecosystems, extremely low Soil Water Content (SWC) values may limit ecosystem respiration (Reco) to the point of hiding the typical exponential response of respiration to temperature. This work is aimed to understand and model the Reco of an evergreen Mediterranean maquis ecosystem and to estimate the contribution of soil CO2 efflux to Reco.\nThe selected site is located in the center of the Mediterranean sea in Sardinia (Italy). Mean annual precipitation is 588 mm and mean annual temperature is 15.9 °C. Vegetation cover is heterogeneous: 70% covered by shrubs and 30% of bare soil. Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) is monitored with an Eddy Covariance (EC) tower since April 2004. Soil collars were placed underneath the dominant species (Juniperus phoenicea and Pistacia lentiscus) and over the bare soil. Soil CO2 efflux was measured once a month since April 2012. Soil temperature and SWC were monitored continuously at 5 cm depth in 4 different positions close to the soil collars. Six years of EC measurements (2005–2010) and two years of soil CO2 efflux (2012–2013) measurements were analysed. Reco was estimated from the measured EC fluxes at night after filtering for adequate turbulence (u* > 1.5). Reco measurements were then binned into 1°C intervals and median values were first fitted using the Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) method (to determine the dominant trend of the experimental curve) Reco shows an exponential increase with air and soil temperature, until SWC measured at 0.2 m depth remains above 19% vol. Secondly, the coefficients of the selected Lloyd and Taylor (1994) were estimated through the nonlinear least square (nls) method: Rref (ecosystem respiration rate at a reference temperature of 10 °C was equal to 1.65 μmol m-2 s-1 and E0 (activation energy parameter that determines the temperature sensitivity) was equal to 322.46.\nIn addition, bare and drier soils show a reduced response of measured CO2 efflux to increasing temperature than moist under canopy ones. Soil CO2 efflux measurements were binned in 1°C classes. Mean total site CO2 efflux was estimated scaling measurements for percentages of soil cover as 1 μmol m-2 s-1. The mean difference between Reco and CO2 efflux increases linearly with increasing temperatures (R2 = 92%) even if soil efflux remains on average about 38% of Reco.",

The interannual variability features significant seasonality, and wind stress curl anomalies associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation explain the sea level anomaly pattern quite well. The sea level signals from the western Pacific also influence the sea level along the west coast of Luzon Island. By contrast, decadal variability of sea level in the SCS is very similar to that in the western Pacific with large variance found west of Luzon Island. Local atmospheric forcing has a negative contribution to decadal variability of sea level in the SCS, and ocean dynamics appears to be important. Decadal sea level averaged in the SCS is significantly correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (r=0.98), and the linear trends of the basin-mean sea level are greatly affected by the low-frequency variability in the satellite altimeter era.",

            "abstract": "While observational studies demonstrate poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation in the past few decades, the CMIP5 historical simulations generate much weaker trends. One question is whether the weaker trends in the width of the Hadley circulation are caused by inconsistent SST patterns and trends between CMIP5 and observations. Using CMIP5 historical simulations, we study the relationship between SST patterns and the width of the Hadley circulation. It is found that there are close correlations between the climatological width of the Hadley circulation and tropics-extratropics SST contrasts for the CMIP5 models. That is, models with weaker meridional SST contrasts have wider Hadley cells and vice versa. Furthermore, we also carry out similar analyses for trends in SST and the width of the Hadley circulation. Our results show that models with stronger equatorial SST warming generate weak equatorial retreat of the Hadley circulation, whereas models with stronger subtropical/extratropical SST warming generate poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation. These results suggest that model performance in simulating SST patterns and trends has important influences on trends in the Hadley circulation.",

            "abstract": "The CERES project continues to provide the scientific community a wide variety of satellite-derived data products. The flagship products TOA broadband shortwave and longwave observed fluxes, computed TOA and Surface fluxes, as well as cloud, aerosol, and other atmospheric parameters. These datasets encompass a wide range of temporal and spatial resolutions, suited to specific applications. We thus offer time resolutions that range from instantaneous to monthly means, with spatial resolutions that range from 20-km footprint to global scales. The 14-year record is mostly used by climate modeling communities that focus on global mean energetics, meridianal heat transport, and climate trend studies. CERES products are also used by the remote sensing community for their climatological studies. In the last years however, our CERES products had been used by an even broader audience, like the green energy, health and environmental research communities, and others. Because of that, the CERES project has implemented a now well-established web-oriented Ordering and Visualization Tool (OVT), which is well into its fifth year of development. In order to help facilitate a comprehensive quality control of CERES products, the OVT Team began introducing a series of specialized functions. These include the 1- and 2-D histogram, anomaly, deseasonalization, temporal and spatial averaging, side-by-side parameter comparison, and other specialized scientific application capabilities. Over time increasingly higher order temporal and spatial resolution products are being made available to the public through the CERES OVT. These high-resolution products require accessing the existing long-term archive - thus the reading of many very large netCDF or HDF files that pose a real challenge to the task of near instantaneous visualization. An overview of the CERES OVT basic functions and QC capabilities as well as future steps in expanding its capabilities will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Recent analysis of water column backscatter data and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video imagery collected by NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer between 2011 and 2013 revealed methane discharge from the seafloor at over 570 gas seep locations along the northern US Atlantic margin. To the best of our knowledge, such large-scale seepage has not previously been observed on a passive margin outside the Arctic or not spatially associated with a petroleum basin. This seepage has implications for the global carbon cycle, ocean chemistry (e.g., acidification), and in some cases, the climate system. Using data collected by Okeanos Explorer and NOAA’s Deep Discoverer ROV, we combine water column backscatter data with video imagery and seafloor backscatter data to estimate gas flux and constrain the geoacoustic properties of the seabed at methane discharge sites. The total methane flux from the northern US Atlantic margin seeps is conservatively estimated at ~15-90 Mg y-1, based on observations of gas bubble volume, discharge rates, and discharge points per site. However, fewer than 1% of the identified seep sites have been inspected with a ROV, and this estimate is likely to be revised upward as the characteristics of the seeps are further constrained. Another important observation to emerge from our analysis is the lack of spatial correlation between seep sites and the ~5000 pockmarks mapped on the northern part of the US Atlantic margin. In this region, pockmarks, which are often easily identified by geophysical imaging of the seafloor, should not be considered potential target sites for finding undiscovered areas of seepage. Conversely, discrete patches of elevated relative seafloor acoustic backscatter amplitude do appear to be correlated with the spatial distribution of methane seeps, implying anomalous seafloor characteristic at seep loci. This finding is consistent with ROV video observations of authigenic carbonate outcrops and extensive chemosynthetic bivalve communities at seep sites, which create a seafloor substrate with higher acoustic impedance. This result suggests that seafloor acoustic reflectivity data, which are far more commonly collected and archived than water column backscatter data, might be used diagnostically to identify and constrain the distribution of seafloor locations of methane discharge.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, remarkable stable strontium fractionation has been found in many geological and biological processes such as chemical weathering and carbonate precipitation. The stable strontium isotope (δ88/86Sr) compositions in various natural materials have been studied, yet its behavior in river water and sediment remains to be clarified. The Changjiang is the largest river originating from the Tibetan Plateau, and bridges the Eurasian continent and East Asian marginal sea by delivering a large volume of dissolved and particulate materials into the sea. It has complicated tributary system and source rock types and is subject to strong Asian monsoon impacts, which makes it an ideal river for the study of sediment weathering, recycling and source-to-sink transport processes.\nIn this study, spatial and seasonal suspended sediments were collected from the Changjiang mainstream by filtering with 0.45 μm Millipore membrane in the field. The seasonal samples were taken from Datong hydrological station in the lower reaches during a whole hydrological year. All these samples were dissolved with 4N HNO3 to separate them into two different phases: leachate and residue. The stable strontium isotope ratios in these two phases were analyzed using SSB method described in Ma et al. (2013) with MC-ICP-MS. The reference material was SRM 987. The external precision of our method is ±0.013‰ (1SD).\nThe results show that δ88/86Sr values in the residue phase are much higher (0.071−1.172‰) than those in the leachate phase (0.133−0.281‰). Together with major and trace elemental data, we suggest that heavy Sr prefers to enrich in the silicates, rather than carbonate minerals, during the fractionation process. Regular variations of δ88/86Sr are observed in the spatial samples, with the leachates showing overall decreasing trends towards the lower reaches. The values of δ88/86Sr are higher in the flood season than in the dry season. We infer that parent rock types, sediment dynamic sorting and chemical weathering may all contribute to the spatial and seasonal variations of δ88/86Sr in the Changjiang river sediments. More close examinations on stable Sr isotope in the river water and sediments and parent rocks as well are needed.",

Time series of broadband reflectance (e.g., red, green, blue, infrared bands) and derivative vegetation indices (e.g. green chromatic coordinate or GCC) are calculated for regions of interest (ROI) within each image series. These time series form the basis for subsequent analysis, such as spring and autumn transition date extraction (using curvature analysis techniques) and modeling the climate-phenology relationship. Processing is relatively straightforward but time consuming, with some sites having more than 100,000 images available. While the PhenoCam Network distributes the original image data, it is our goal to provide higher-level vegetation phenology products, generated in a standardized way, to encourage use of the data without the need to download and analyze individual images.\nWe describe here the details of the standard image processing procedures, and also provide a description of the products that will be available for download. Products currently in development include an “all-image” file, which contains a statistical summary of the red, green and blue bands over the pixels in predefined ROI’s for each image from a site.

In response to this, an inversion approach, InTEM, was adapted to estimate methane emissions for a region in the South East of the UK (~100 x 150 km). We present results covering a 2-year period (July 2012 - July 2014) in which atmospheric methane concentrations were recorded at 1 - 2 minute time-steps at four locations within the region of interest. Precise measurements were obtained using gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) for all sites except one, which used a PICARRO Cavity Ring-Down Spectrometer (CRDS). These observations, along with the UK Met Office's Lagrangian particle dispersion model (NAME) were used within InTEM to produce the methane emission fields. Emission estimates were produced at varying spatial resolutions, for annual and seasonal time frames . We present results indicating the optimum number of observation sites required for this region, and how this can affect our uncertainty estimates. These results are compared with the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) which is compiled using bottom-up methods and available at 1x1 km resolution. To our knowledge, no inversion technique has been implemented on such a fine spatial resolution. This is a pilot project which, given proof of concept, could be scaled up as an alternative method for producing national scale emission inventories.",

The impact of emissions from passively degassing volcanoes and minor volcanic explosions are particularly poorly constrained.\nWe present systematic satellite measurements of the time-averaged indirect aerosol effect over several years at multiple active and inactive volcanic islands (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, 2000-2013 and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer 2002-2008). Retrievals of aerosol and cloud properties at Kilauea, Yasur and Piton de la Fournaise are rotated about the volcanic vent to be parallel to wind direction, so that average upwind and downwind values can be estimated. The emissions from all three volcanoes, including those from passive degassing, strombolian activity and minor explosions lead to measurably increased aerosol optical depth (<0.1) and decreased cloud droplet effective radius (<8 μm) downwind of the volcanoes. Furthermore, Top of Atmosphere Short Wave flux from NASA’s Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) show downwind perturbations ranging from 10 to 45 Wm-2 within 400 km of degassing volcanoes. Comparison of these observations to cloud properties at isolated islands without degassing volcanoes demonstrates that these patterns are not purely orographic in origin. Our observations of unpolluted, isolated marine settings may capture processes similar to those in the pre-industrial marine atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "This study is meant to explore the information noble gases can provide in glacial environments with respect to glacial meltwater sources, relative source contributions, water residence times, and spatial location where this glacial meltwater originates in the ice sheet. Ultimately, we seek to improve our understanding on the dynamics of these massive ice sheets, critical for the major role they play on climate change. This is possible due to the conservative nature of noble gases and temperature dependency of their concentrations in water in equilibrium with the atmosphere (ASW) allowing for calculation of noble gas temperatures (NGTs) and, under certain assumptions, estimation of the altitude at which glacial meltwater originated. In addition, crustally produced isotopes such as He accumulate in water over time, allowing for estimation of water residence times.\nGlacial meltwater samples were collected and analyzed for noble gas concentrations and isotopic ratios at five different locations in southern Greenland, between sea level and 1221 m. All samples are enriched in He with respect to ASW and are depleted in all other noble gases. Two patterns are apparent. The first one presents a relative Ar enrichment with respect to Ne, Kr, and Xe, a pattern first observed in high-altitude springs in the Galápagos Islands. The second one displays a mass-dependent pattern, a pattern first observed in Michigan rainwater samples. Most samples point to equilibration temperatures at ~0°C and altitudes between 1000 m and 2000 m, values which are consistent with both temperatures and elevations in Greenland. He concentrations vary between 1.1 and 7 times that of ASW and suggest glacial meltwater ages between ~170 and 1150 yrs, a result which is consistent with a preliminary tritium analysis. He isotopes point to surface (precipitation as snow and rainfall) contributions for most samples between ~60% and 90% with a ~10% – 40% crustal contribution from groundwater.",

            "abstract": "An ongoing NASA-funded project has removed a longstanding barrier to accessing NASA data (i.e., accessing archived time-step array data as point-time series) for selected variables of the North American and Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (NLDAS and GLDAS, respectively) and other EOSDIS (Earth Observing System Data Information System) data sets. These time series (“data rods”) are pre-generated or generated on-the-fly (OTF), leveraging the NASA Simple Subset Wizard (SSW), a gateway to NASA data centers. Data rods Web services are accessible through the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (HIS) and the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) but are not easily discoverable by users of other non-NASA data systems.\nThe Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is a logical mechanism for providing access to the data rods, both pre-generated and OTF. There is an ongoing series of multi-organizational GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilots, now in Phase-7 (AIP-7) and with a strong water sub-theme, that is aimed at the GEOSS Water Strategic Target “to produce [by 2015] comprehensive sets of data and information products to support decision-making for efficient management of the world's water resources, based on coordinated, sustained observations of the water cycle on multiple scales.” The aim of this “GEOSS Water Services” project is to develop a distributed, global registry of water data, map, and modeling services catalogued using the standards and procedures of the Open Geospatial Consortium and the World Meteorological Organization. This project has already demonstrated that the GEOSS infrastructure can be leveraged to help provide access to time series of model grid information (e.g., NLDAS, GLDAS) or grids of information over a geographical domain for a particular time interval.\nA new NASA-funded project was begun, to expand on these early efforts to enhance the discovery, search, and access of NASA data by non-NASA users, comprising the following key aspects:\n1. Leverage SSW API and EOS Clearing House (ECHO)\n2. Register data rods services in GEOSS\n3. Develop Web Feature Services (WFS) for data rods\n4. Enhance metadata in WFS\n5. Make non-NASA data visible to NASA users by leveraging SSW\n6. Develop hydrological use cases to guide project deployment and serve as metrics",

            "abstract": "Groundwater models are one of the main tools used in the hydrogeological sciences to assess resources and to simulate possible effects from future water demands and changes in climate. The hydrological inputs to groundwater models can be numerous and can vary in both time and space. Difficulties associated with model construction are often related to extensive datasets and cumbersome data processing tasks. To mitigate these difficulties, a graphical user interface (GUI) is often employed to aid the input of data for creating models. Unfortunately, GUI software presents an obstacle to reproducibility, a cornerstone of research. The considerable effort required to document processing steps in a GUI program, and the rapid obsoleteness of these steps with subsequent versions of the software, has prompted modelers to explicitly write down processing steps as source code to make them ‘easily’ reproducible.\nThis research describes the R package wrv, a collection of datasets and functions for pre- and post-processing the numerical groundwater flow model of the Wood River Valley aquifer system, south-central Idaho. R largely facilitates reproducible modeling with the package vignette; a document that is a combination of content and source code. The code is run when the vignette is built, and all data analysis output (such as figures and tables) is created on the fly and inserted into the final document. The wrv package includes two vignettes that explain and run steps that (1) create package datasets from raw data files located on a publicly accessible repository, and (2) create and run the groundwater flow model. MODFLOW-USG, the numerical groundwater model used in this study, is executed from the vignette, and model output is returned for exploratory analyses. The ability of R to perform all processing steps in a single workflow is attributed to its comprehensive list of features; that include geographic information system and time series functionality.",

            "abstract": "The Mw 7.1 right-lateral strike-slip Hector Mine earthquake occurred on 10/16/1999 and generated an approximately 48 km long surface rupture. The \nLavic Lake fault\n and the central section of the \nBullion fault\nand several lesser faults ruptured, characterized by maximum strike slip of 5.25 ±0.85 m [Treiman, 2002]. As a very remote and un-populated area of the Mojave Desert, southern California, the study area is highly favorable for fault degradation studies with essentially no influence from vegetation or human activity. Airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) are used to evaluate the form and rate of degradation of scarps along the Hector Mine fault rupture, California, USA. Airborne LiDAR data were acquired in 2000 and 2012 and these data were differenced using a newly developed algorithm for point cloud matching, which is improved over prior methods by accounting for scan geometry error sources. Using the bi-temporal data (scrutinizing profiles from 2000 & 2012), parameters for a fault scarp diffusion model are estimated and then a simulation result is generated to predict the evolved landform shape at the time of the 2014 TLS data set. Results are checked against TLS 2014 data collected at five key sites within the maximum slip field study area. In the past, scarp degradation has been mostly investigated using traditional survey methods (e.g., measuring elevations of points in a line perpendicular to the scarp) that require time-consuming field work and tend to introduce bias and variance due to data limitations. Airborne, mobile and terrestrial LiDAR data offer great potential to precisely document and rigorously determine morphologic degradation of fault scarps [Hilley et al., 2010]. In the present study, a unique set of data have been acquired at three points in time across several classic types of fault scarps and offset fault zone features. This allows progress in assessing the fitting of functions and estimating time constants of fault scarp degradation, with potential for widespread utility and significance in paleoseismology.",

            "abstract": "Several new avenues are in place for building and supporting a community of people interested in the art and geoscience connections. Although sessions advocating for art in teaching geoscience have been scattered through geoscience professional meetings for several decades, there is now a sustained presence of artists and geoscientists with their research and projects at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. In 2011, 13 abstracts were submitted and, in 2013, 20 talks and posters were presented at the annual meeting.\nParticipants have requested more ways to connect with each other as well as advocate for this movement of art and science to others. Several words can describe new initiatives to do this: Social, Collaborative, Connected, Informed, Networked, and Included.\nSocial activities of informal dinners, lunches, and happy hour for interested people in the past year have provided opportunity for presenters at AGU to spend time getting to know one another. This has resulted in at least two new collaborative projects. The nascent Bella Roca and more established Geology in Art websites and their associated blogs at www.bellaroca.org and http://geologyinart.blogspot.com, respectively are dedicated to highlighting the work of artists inspired by the geosciences, connecting people and informing the community of exhibits and opportunities for collaboration. Bella Roca with its social media of Facebook (Bella Roca) and Twitter (@BellRocaGeo), is a direct outgrowth of the recent 2012 and 2013 AGU sessions and, hopefully, can be grown and sustained for this community. Articles in professional journals will also help inform the broader geoscience community of the benefit of engaging with artists and designers for both improved science knowledge and communication. Organizations such as Leonardo, the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology, the Art Science Gallery in Austin, Texas also promote networking among artists and scientists with the aim of helping to build new transdisciplinary projects that both engage the public and advance science and art. The inclusion of art/science scholars and practitioners in organizations such as AGU and others will provide visibility, endorsement, and support as new projects are formulated for the benefit of both art and geoscience.",

The highly successful series of the summer schools (commencing 2007) trains a select group of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and university faculty to learn and develop the science of heliophysics as a broad, coherent discipline that reaches in space from the Earth’s troposphere to the depths of the Sun, and in time from the formation of the solar system to the distant future.\nThe first three years of the school resulted in the publication of three textbooks now being used at universities worldwide. Subsequent years have also developed the complementary materials that support teaching of heliophysics at both graduate and undergraduate levels.\nThe textbooks are edited by Carolus J. Schrijver, Lockheed Martin, and George L. Siscoe, Boston University. The books provide a foundational reference for researchers in heliophysics, astrophysics, plasma physics, space physics, solar physics aeronomy, space weather, planetary science and climate science.\nThe Jack Eddy Postdoctoral Fellowship Program matches newly graduated postdoctorates with hosting mentors for the purpose of training the next generation researchers needed in heliophysics.

In the recent few decades, India has been witnessing erratic nature of the Indian summer monsoon, which accounts for about 80% of the total annual rainfall. While there is a large uncertainty in the precipitation projections during the summer monsoon from the regional and global climate models, we need to understand sensitivity of water resources in the Indian sub-continental river basins under the projected future climate. This is particularly important as the Indian sub-continent is one of the most populated regions of the world. We evaluated changes in water budget in the 18 Indian sub-continental basins under the projected future climate using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The VIC model was calibrated and evaluated using the observed streamflow as well as satellite derived evapotranspiration and soil moisture. After the successful calibration and evaluation, we performed a sensitivity analysis for the water balance variables. Finally, we used downscaled and bias corrected climate forcings to develop scenarios of changes in water balance under the future climate. Despite the intermodal variation, Indian basins are projected to experience wetter and warmer climate in future. Results indicate positive changes in evapotranspiration and runoff under the projected future climate; however, increases in total runoff are projected to be significant in most of the basins in the sub-continent.",

The length of both transects was about 700 km. Water depth was 12-63 m, O2 dissolved :5.36-9.55 ml l-1. Along the transects salinity increased from 0.07 to 34.2 psu, while the SPM’ concentration decreased from 10.31 to 0.31 mg/l. Total suspended particulate matter load is more than one order of magnitude higher in the Ob River Estuary comparing to that of the Yenisei River. It has led to a significant difference between the suspended trace metals’ concentrations (µg/l) in water of the two estuaries. With salinity increase along transects Fe susp., Mn susp. and Zn susp. decreased by a factor of 100-500, that has led to a growth of a relative portion of dissolved trace metals followed by their bioaccumulation (Demina et al., 2010). A strong direct correlation between suspended Cu, Fe and SPM mass concentration was found. For the first time along the Yenisei River’ Estuary –the Kara Sea transect a direct positive correlation between Cu suspended and volume concentration of SPM (mg/ml3) was found, that was attributed to contribution of phytoplankton aggregates in the SPM composition. A trend of relationship between content of suspended As and pelitic fraction (2-10 µm) of SPM was firstly found in theses basins also. Study of trace metal speciation in the bottom sediments (adsorbed, associated with Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, organic matter and fixed in the mineral lattice or refractory) has revealed the refractory fraction to be prevailing (70-95% total content) for Fe, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Cr, Cd and Pb. That means that toxic heavy metals were not available for bottom fauna. Mn was predominantly found in the adsorbed and (oxyhydr)oxides geochemically labile forms, reflecting the redox condition change along both transects and within the sedimentary cores. \n",

Satellite observations can provide needed data to support agency decisions with respect to deployment of preventative measures and control resources.\nThe coverage and persistence of open water is one of the primary indicators of conditions suitable for mosquito breeding habitats. This is currently a poorly measured variable due to its spatial and temporal variability across landscapes, especially in remote areas. Here we develop a methodology for monitoring these conditions through optical remote sensing images from Landsat. We pansharpen the images and apply a decision tree classification approach using Random Forests to generate 15 meter resolution maps of open water. In addition, since some mosquitos breed in clear water while others in turbid water, we classify water bodies according to their water color properties and we validate the results using field knowledge. We focus in East Africa where we assses the usefulness of these products to improve prediction of malaria outbreaks.\nPortions of this work were carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",

            "abstract": "TEX86, calculated based on the distribution of isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) from planktonic Thaumarchaeota, is widely used for paleo sea surface temperature reconstruction. Although increasing evidence shows that TEX86 can be affected by multiple environmental variables, little is known about the additional contribution of TEX86-related GDGTs from other planktonic archaeal groups. In this study, we test the hypothesis that GDGTs potentially derived from MG II Archaea affect TEX86 calculations. Analysis of core (C) and intact polar (IP) GDGTs and 454 sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting MG II were performed on suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected along a salinity gradient from the lower Pearl River, its estuary, and the northern South China Sea. The results showed that the community structure varied along the salinity gradient with MG II as the second dominant group in the mixing water and seawater. qPCR data indicated that the abundance of MG II in the mixing water was four to five orders of magnitudes higher than the fresh water and seawater. The Ring Index of archaeal lipids was notably elevated in the Pearl River estuary, which may be attributed to the additional export of cyclopentane moiety-enhanced GDGTs from MG II in the mixing water. Furthermore, a linear correlation was observed between qPCR of MG II and IP-GDGTs derived from phosphate head groups, suggesting that MG II actively produces GDGTs in the water column. These results show strong evidence that MG II synthesizes GDGTs with more cyclopentane moieties, which may bias TEX86 signal derived from GDGTs of Thaumarchaeota. This study highlights that valid interpretation of TEX86 in the geologic record, particularly in coastal oceans, needs to consider the paleo-community structure of planktonic Archaea.",

The estimation of total freeboard is based on the accuracy of local sea level estimations and the footprint size. We used the high density of ATM L1B (~1 m footprint) observations at varying spatial resolutions to assess errors associated with averaging over larger footprints and deviation of local sea level from the WGS-84 geoid over longer segment lengths The ATM data sets allow for a comparison between IceBridge (2009-2014) and ICESat(2003-2009)derived freeboards by comparing the ATM L2 (~70 m footprint) data, similar to the IceSAT footprint. While The average freeboard estimates for the L2 data in 2009 underestimate total freeboard by only 5 cm at 5 km segment lengths the error increases to 49 cm at the 50 km segment lengths typical of IceSAT analyses. Since the error in freeboard estimation greatly increases at the segment lengths used for IceSAT analyses, some caution may be required in comparing IceSAT thickness estimates with later IceBridge estimates over the same region.",

            "abstract": "The rifted Eastern North American Margin (ENAM) provides important clues to the long-term evolution of continental margins. An Eocene (ca. 47-48 Ma) volcanic swarm exposed in the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia and West Virginia, contains the youngest known igneous rocks in the ENAM. These magmas are bimodal in composition, and provide the only window into the most recent deep processes contributing to the post-rift evolution of this margin. We expand on the data presented in Mazza et al., 2014, with new geochemical data that further constrains the magmatic evolution of the ENAM. Using integrated radiogenic isotopic data, petrologic modeling, and regional geomorphology, we determine source domains, melting conditions, and regional implications. Modeling of the melting conditions on primitive basalts yielded an average temperature and pressure of 1412±25°C and 2.32±0.31 GPa, corresponding to a mantle potential temperature of ~1410°C, suggesting melting conditions slightly higher than ambient mantle but not as high as expected from plume activity. When compared with magmas from Atlantic hotspots, the Eocene ENAM samples share isotopic signatures with the Azores and Cape Verde. This similarity suggests the possibility of a large-scale dissemination of similar sources in the upper mantle left over from the opening of the Atlantic. Asthenosphere upwelling related to localized lithospheric delamination is a possible process that can explain the intraplate signature of these magmas that lack evidence of a thermal anomaly. This process can also explain the Cenozoic dynamic topography and rejuvenation of the Central Appalachians. New P- and S-wave tomography using data from EarthScope’s USArray shows that a low-velocity anomaly persists in the upper mantle beneath the Eocene volcanic swarm, indicating that the magmatic event substantially modified regional lithospheric structure. Our geochemical and petrologic constraints will be vital for a comprehensive interpretation of new geophysical data emerging from EarthScope and understanding its implications for the geological evolution of ENAM.",

Inter-seismic upper plate deformation of this part of the subduction zone remains poorly constrained due to lack of availability of spatially well distributed data. Through this study we are reanalyzing the available GPS geodetic data sets collected by various agencies over different times between 1996-2004 to constrain the pre-earthquake convergence values using a consistent reference frame to determine the crustal deformation in the Andaman Nicobar region, to infer strain rates in the overriding plate, how Andaman microplate was moving relative to Indian plate and what was the extent of plate locking. We will also discuss the details on spatial and temporal variations of convergence rates and variations in plate coupling. To quantify the change in coupling, we calculated the interseismic surface deformation using Okada's formulation, in which locked faults are modelled as dislocations in a halfspace. We defined the subduction zone geometry as three elastically deforming blocks (India, Andaman fore-arc, and Sunda) separated by two faults: the West Andaman Fault and the Sumatra-Andaman megathrust. The bennioff-zone dip and orientation is re-defined using the recently relocated epicentral solutions with higher accuracy and from the slip-distribution models constrained from the various co-seismic geodetic offsets reported from the near-field and far-field GPS sites . The rigid-body motion of each block is specified by a pole of rotation. We modelled the variation in coupling by specifying for each node and integrating the slip deficit over the fault surfaces. The West Andaman Fault is modeled as a vertical strike- lip fault, locked to a depth of ~20 km, with a dextral slip.",

Results showed that the total biomass of the forest is 165.4 Mg·hm-2. The aboveground biomass and root biomass are 137.7 Mg·hm-2 and 27.7 Mg·hm-2, respectively. Among the aboveground biomass, the tree layer accounts for 97.76%, which is obviously greater than the shrub layer and herb layer. Larger trees (the diameter at breast height, DBH is between 5 cm and 20 cm) occupies 76.85% of the aboveground biomass, especially the five dominant species(Lithocarpus confinis, Platycarya longipes, Itea yunnanensis, Machilus cavaleriei and Carpinus pubescens). Shrubs and lianas (DBH = 1 cm) account for more than 30% of total shrub and liana biomass, although their individuals are less than 2% of total shrub individuals and 1% of total liana individuals, respectively. The root biomass differs in root diameters, i.e. coarse root > medium root > fine root. Root biomass decreases with the increase of soil depth. Within soil depth of 20 cm, the root biomass is 20.1 Mg·hm-2, which is more than 70% of total root biomass. Within soil depth of 50 cm, the root biomass is 26.7 Mg·hm-2, which is 96.39% of total root biomass.

This is demonstrated using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model in simulations with and without interactive chemistry. Previous studies have attributed similar differences in SH climate change simulations to biases created by the spatial smoothing of specified ozone, i.e., due to prescribing zonal-mean concentrations. We isolate the impact of undersampling the rapid temporal changes in ozone during the seasonal evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole from the impact of prescribing zonal-means, and show that temporal resolution of prescribed ozone is of equal importance to zonal asymmetries.",

            "abstract": "Drawing down carbon from the atmosphere happens in the oceans when marine plants are growing due to the use of carbon dioxide for biological processes and by raising the pH of the water. Macro- and microscopic marine photosynthesizers are limited in their growth by the availability of light and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, iron, etc.) Deep ocean water (DOW), oceanic water from bellow about 1000m, is a natural medium for marine algae, which contains all (except in rare circumstances) necessary components for algal growth and represents over 90% of the volume of the ocean. The introduction of DOW to a tropical or summer sea can increase chlorophyll from near zero to 60 mg per M3 or more.\nThe form of the utilization infrastructure for DOW can roughly be divided into two effective types; the unconstrained release and the open pond system. Unconstrained release has the advantage of having relatively low infrastructure investment and is available to any area of the ocean. The open pond system has high infrastructure costs but enables intensive use of DOW for harvesting macro- and microalgae and sustainable mariculture. It also enables greater concomitant production of DOW's other potential products such as electricity or potable water. However, unlike an unconstrained release the open pond system can capture much of the biomaterial from the water and limits the impact to the surrounding ecosystem.\nThe Tidal Irrigation and Electrical System (TIESystem), is an open pond that is to be constructed on a continental shelf. It harnesses the tidal flux to pump DOW into the pond on the rising tide and then uses the falling tide to pump biologically rich material out of the pond. This biomaterial represents fixed CO2 and can be used for biofuel or fertilizers. The TIESystem benefits from an economy of scale that increases at a rate that is roughly equal to the relationship of the circumference of a circle (the barrier that creates the open pond) to the area of the pond multiplied by the tidal flux on that particular area of the continental shelf. Despite the large construction costs of artificial islands and structures robust enough to withstand the conditions of the continental shelf, the system will become economic as it grows in size. However, extensive research will be required to maximize the output of each subsystem and minimize the risk of pollution.",

            "abstract": "He+ pickup ions are either born from the ionization of interstellar neutral helium atoms inside our heliosphere, the so called interstellar pickup ions, or through the interaction of solar wind ions with small dust particles close to the Sun, the so called inner-source of pickup ions. Until now, most observations of He+ pickup ions were limited to reduced 1D velocity spectra, which are insufficient to study certain characteristics of the He+ Velocity Distribution Function (VDF). It is generally assumed that rapid pitch-angle scattering of freshly created pickup ions quickly leads to a fully isotropic He+ VDF. In the light of recent observations, this assumption has found to be oversimplified and needs to be re-investigated.\nUsing He+ pickup ion data from the PLASTIC instrument on board the STEREO A spacecraft we reconstruct a reduced form of the He+ VDF in 2 dimensions (see figure). The reduced form of the He+ VDF allows us to study the pitch-angle distribution and anisotropy of the He+ VDF as a function of the solar magnetic field, B. Our observations show clear signs of a significant anisotropy of the He+ VDF and even indicates that, at least for certain configurations of B, it is not even fully gyrotropic. Our results further suggest, that the observed velocity and pitch-angle of He+ depends strongly on the solar magnetic field vector, B, the ecliptic longitude, λ\u0015, the solar wind speed, vsw, and the history of B.\nConsequently, we argue that reduced 1D velocity spectra of He+ are insuffi\u000ecient to study quantities like the pitch-angle scattering rate, τ, or the adiabatic cooling index γ.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in the field of subaqueous paleoseismology have provided information about the sedimentation record of earthquakes and about the long-term seismicity of fault systems. In 2013, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology conducted expeditions NT13-02 and NT13-19 to the 2011 Tohoku Mw 9.0 megathrust earthquake and tsunami source, with R/V Natushima in 800-5,900 m water depth. The goal was identifying earthquake-triggered deposits and mapping their spatial and temporal distribution, as a strategy to recognize the sedimentary signature of Tohoku-like events and measure recurrence intervals for seismic hazard assessment. Twenty-four piston cores, 3 to 6 m long, were recovered during the NT13-19 expedition along a 300 km-long portion of the mid-slope terrace. This elongated structure is parallel to the strike of the Japan Trench, and located landward of the frontal prism where deformation is most intense. Faults, sometimes forming steep scarps, define small (5km long) confined basins that were targeted for coring.\nRadioisotopes 137Cs and xs210Pb measured in the cores mark the 2011 Tohoku earthquake-related sedimentation. Detection of 134Cs and enrichment of 137Cs provided a 2011 Fukushima reactor signature, which was found in the upper 5cm of several cores and was buried 10-15cm in others. Very high activities of xs210Pb were measured in the upper half-meter of the majority of the cores providing evidence of very recent depositional events that we are linking to the 2011 earthquake. We envision the shaking by the earthquake fluidized a layer of surface sediment, which then moved downslope and was deposited where surface slope decreased. These sediments also incorporated 137Cs derived from global fallout over the past half century. These deposits can be recognized in the cores because they are homogeneous and lack bioturbation. The thickest ones (~1m) have soft sediment deformation features at their base. Along the mid-slope terrace, they are thicker in the region where maximum 2011 rupture displacement was documented. Several older event horizons separated by bioturbated sediments are recognized in the cores. Usami et al. (2014) used tephra chronology to estimate an average recurrence interval of 100-500 yrs in most cores, although some cores suggest recurrence of 1500-2000 yrs.",

In order to further understand the crustal structure in the region, we present results from receiver function analysis using the permanent seismic stations in the region by applying H-κ stacking algorithm which gives crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio beneath a station. 40 land stations between January 2008 and April 2012, and five cabled Sea Bottom Observatories which were deployed at the end of 2010 by Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institue located between 40.2°-41.2° N and 26.5°-30.5° E were included in the analysis. Approximately 250 teleseismic events from a wide range of epicentral distances with magnitudes greater than Mw 5.5 are used to obtain receiver functions. Furthermore, in order to calculate the receiver functions in time domain iterative deconvolution technique suggested by Ligorria and Ammon (1999) was used. Consequently, the crustal structure of the region has been reasonably defined and compared with the other studies. As a consequence of the receiver function analysis, the Moho depth variation map and Vp/Vs ratio map were plotted. The Moho depth on average is 31 km. There are no sharp changes in the crustal thickness of the Marmara Region except North Marmara Trough where crustal thickness reaching up to 26 km in the same region was not observed. Furthermore, we found overall average Vp/Vs ratio of 1.74, for the region but we obtained low Vp/Vs ratios in the stations located near Çınarcık Basin which varies between 1.64 - 1.74 indicating the effect of basin structure in the area and North Marmara where Vp/Vs ratios vary between 1.60 and 1.70 which is related to the sediment structure of the area. We also acquired higher Vp/Vs ratios between 1.86 and 1.96 in the Western Marmara Region. This can be due to increasing mafic content in this area. Additionally, an attempt has been made to invert the radial receiver function of the station KCTX using iterative linear 1D inversion method in order to compare the Moho depth values with two different techniques.",

            "abstract": "Mediterranean coastal regions are regularly affected by sudden heavy precipitation events leading to very dangerous flash floods. Due to its position and its topographical peculiarities, one of the most affected areas is Liguria, a very complex region located in Northwestern Italy. Three different case studies relative to severe rainfall events recently occurred in Liguria have been considered in the present study. In all selected cases, the formation of a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system over Liguria Sea interacting with local dynamical effects (orographically-induced low-level wind and temperature gradients) played a crucial role in the generation of severe precipitations.\nDifferent sets of simulations of the aforementioned events have been performed using the Advanced Research core of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to investigate the sensitivity of the predicted precipitation field to model resolution and different microphysics parameterization approaches. Specifically, eight microphysics schemes available in WRF have been compared in very high-resolution (1.1 km), convection-permitting simulations. The data set used to evaluate model performances has been extracted from the official regional observing network, composed by about 150 professional WMO-compliant stations. Two different strategies have been exploited to assess the model skill in predicting precipitation: a traditional approach, where matches between forecast and observations are considered on a point-by-point basis, and an object-based method where model success is based on the correct localization and intensity of precipitation patterns. This last method allows to overcome the known fictitious models performance degradation for increasing spatial resolution.\nAs remarkable results of this analysis, a clear role of horizontal resolution on the model performances accompanied by the identification of a family of best-performing parameterization schemes emerge. The outcomes of the study offer important suggestions for operational weather prediction systems under potentially dangerous heavy precipitation events.",

            "abstract": "Critical Zone (CZ) science includes the study of the inter-related chemical, physical, and biological processes happening at the earth surface. CZ science differs from watershed science or other similar initiatives in that it not only incorporates many disciplinary approaches and crosses spatial scales, but it also aims to understand processes occurring at timescales varying from those characterizing fast chemical reactions to the slow responses of surficial systems to tectonic change. Isotope systems are an important tool that can be used to assess processes at different timescales. Some isotopic systems are used as chronometers. Synthesizing isotopic data from different elemental systems to understand processes as complex as weathering at a ridgetop, hillslope transformation, or watershed evolution is a difficult task but is essential toward deciphering the complex coupling that characterizes surficial systems.\nA good example where isotopes are elucidating CZ processes is the analysis of weathering at ridgetops, along hillslopes, and in watersheds. Targetting these three types of study sites at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, we have used Mg, Fe, Li, Ca, Be, Sr, U and other isotopes to understand the effects of weathering in one-dimension (1D), 2D and 3D, respectively. Some of the systems such as Fe yield information about elemental losses due to biogeochemical weathering. Other isotopes such as U yield information about the development of particles from bedrock. In this talk I will synthesize data from many different researchers working at the CZO to show how disparate isotopic data for one set of sites can answer questions of how landforms develop and change. This effort to use many isotopes on the same CZ setting -- which we call \"CZ-tope\" science -- requires sharing of sites, samples, and data in team research. CZ-tope science delineates which processes control which features at each timescale of interest.",

            "abstract": "The Critical Zone (CZ) includes all chemical, physical, and biological processes in our environment. As humans change the CZ, it becomes more important for us to understand how the CZ will respond. The problem with understanding the CZ is that so many different processes are tightly coupled and exhibit threshold behaviors. We therefore have difficulty creating models that accurately describe CZ evolution.\nCZ science targets the development of models to understand these processes. To parameterize the models requires CZ characterization and observatories to measure fluxes of water, energy, solutes, and sediments (WESS). WESS fluxes can then, in turn, be compared to the time-integrated histories of those fluxes that are recorded in soil profiles, sediment deposits, and rocks. By using scenarios of human behavior along with models to cross timescales from minutes to millenia, we will learn to forecast the impacts of anthropogenic activity.\nIn the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, a large team of researchers are developing a suite of models to simulate CZ processes over a range of timescales. At the same time, this team is moving from a paradigm of \"measure everything everywhere\" to \"measure only what we need\" as we scale up from the 0.1 km2 watershed at Shale Hills to the 165 km2 Shavers creek watershed. At Shale Hills, we made densely spaced measurements. In the Shavers creek watershed, we are targetting catenas in sub-catchments of the watershed as well as measurements of the main-branch streams. Sub-catchments were chosen to explore the different lithologies and land use characteristics. Instrumentation is already deployed in one first-order sub-catchment located on Tuscarora sandstone. The next sub-catchment to be instrumented, like Shale Hills, will be located on shale bedrock. Unlike Shale Hills, however, the sub-catchment will host agricultural activity. We are targetting our intensive chemical, physical, and biological measurements on catenas on north- and south-facing hillslopes in recognition of the fact that we cannot measure all locations. By combining our suite of models with these targetted measurements, we will understand regolith distribution so as to allow a greater capacity to simulate WESS fluxes and changes in soils, sediments, and landscapes over a range of timescales.",

These models also assume that the ground-motion variability observed in a global dataset is the same as the variability in ground motion at a single site-source combination. This assumption is referred to as the ergodic assumption.\nNew data give a unique opportunity to remove the ergodic assumption and take into account regional source, path and site specificities. Using recent data analysis performed on the EUROSEISTEST valley (Greece) and global ground-motion datasets (Kiknet, Knet, NGA2 and the European strong-motion databases) we will show the impact of source parameters, site monitoring and site-characterisation on the uncertainty of the ground motion estimates and associated hazard curves.\nOur results suggest that future strong-motion networks should use higher sampling rates (to better evaluate site-specific high frequency attenuations) and record both strong and weak motions (to evaluate single-station sigma). These results also quantify the impact of a better characterisation of source parameters (depth, fault maturity, source to site distances) ans site parameters on ground-motion models.\nWe finally will show how new networks and high-level strong-motion databases may help to built consistent ergodic PSHA at a regional scale and non-ergodic, site specific,  PSHA.",

            "abstract": "The NSF-sponsored DIG Texas Instructional Blueprint project supports the development of online instructional blueprints for a yearlong high school-level Earth science course. Each blueprint stitches together three-week units that contain curated educational resources aligned with the Texas state standards for Earth and Space Science and the Earth Science Literacy Principles. Units focus on specific geoscience content, place-based concerns, features or ideas, or other specific conceptual threads. Five regional teams composed of geoscientists, pedagogy specialists, and practicing science teachers chose unit themes and resources for twenty-two units during three workshops. In summer 2014 three Education Interns (Earth science teachers) spent six weeks refining the content of the units and aligning them with the Next Generation Science Standards. They also assembled units into example blueprints. The cross-disciplinary collaboration among blueprint team members allowed them to develop knowledge in new areas and to share their own discipline-based knowledge and perspectives. Team members and Education Interns learned where to find and how to evaluate high quality geoscience educational resources, using a web-based resource review tool developed by the Science Education Resource Center (SERC). SERC is the repository for the DIG Texas blueprint web pages. Work is underway to develop automated tools to allow educators to compile resources into customized instructional blueprints by reshuffling units within an existing blueprint, by mixing units from other blueprints, or creating new units and blueprints. These innovations will enhance the use of the units by secondary Earth science educators beyond Texas.\nThis presentation provides an overview of the project, shows examples of blueprints and units, reports on the preliminary results of classroom implementation by Earth science teachers, and considers challenges encountered in developing and testing the blueprints.

            "abstract": "Turbulent drag due to the form drag exerted by subgrid obstacles has significant effects on atmosphere. Subgrid-scale turbulent orographic form drag is represented by using parameterization methods in large-scale numerical prediction models. An indirect parameterization scheme, which is originally used in CESM, called the effective roughness length scheme, and a direct scheme called BBW04, which has only been tested in short-term weather forecast models and regional models, were used in the climate prediction model CESM1.0.4. The results show that both indirect and direct scheme have improved the model’s performance in middle and high latitude areas. The two schemes were compared and analyzed based on three aspects: terrain height standard deviation data, scheme equations and differences between indirect and direct parameterization methods. The Analysis indicates that the direct parameterization scheme BBW04 is more reasonable and theoretically convincing than the indirect scheme.",

            "abstract": "Recent results from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) indicate that at least some transitions from northward to southward IMF produce a specific sequence in the development of large-scale Birkeland currents. First, a set of Region 1 and Region 2 currents forms on the dayside restricted to within a few hours of noon. After about 40 minutes, currents strongly intensify on the nightside, first near midnight local time associated with substorm onset, and then progressively further toward the dayside via dawn and dusk. Only after an hour or more after the transition to stronger solar wind forcing, is the complete Region 1, Region 2 current system developed. The results imply that the initial response to a transition from weak to strong forcing is convection into the polar cap and lobes without strong return convection to the dayside from the nightside magnetosphere. Return convection from the nightside begins with substorm onset and progresses to the dayside. This analysis is extended by examining a large number of transitions from prolonged auroral quiescence, associated with northward IMF, to southward IMF and the development of large-scale Region 1/Region 2 Birkeland currents, to assess whether the above progression holds in general. In addition, transition events to particularly intense driving, for example, associated with shocks are examined to assess how this ordering of events may be changed for onsets of particularly intense solar wind forcing.",

            "abstract": "Interactions between ecological systems and the atmosphere are the result of dynamic processes with system memories that persist from seconds to centuries. Adequately capturing long-term biosphere-atmosphere exchange within earth system models (ESMs) requires an accurate representation of changes in plant functional types (PFTs) through time and space, particularly at timescales associated with ecological succession. However, most model parameterization and development has occurred using datasets than span less than a decade. We tested the ability of ESMs to capture the ecological dynamics observed in paleoecological and historical data spanning the last millennium. Focusing on an area from the Upper Midwest to New England, we examined differences in the magnitude and spatial pattern of PFT distributions and ecotones between historic datasets and the CMIP5 inter-comparison project’s large-scale ESMs. We then conducted a 1000-year model inter-comparison using six state-of-the-art biosphere models at sites that bridged regional temperature and precipitation gradients. The distribution of ecosystem characteristics in modeled climate space reveals widely disparate relationships between modeled climate and vegetation that led to large differences in long-term biosphere-atmosphere fluxes for this region. Model simulations revealed that both the interaction between climate and vegetation and the representation of ecosystem dynamics within models were important controls on biosphere-atmosphere exchange.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is a crucial process in space plasmas. At Earth's dayside magnetopause, where the cold dense magnetosheath plasma reconnects with the hot tenuous magnetospheric plasma, reconnection is highly asymmetric. Asymmetric reconnection differs significantly from symmetric reconnection and is not well understood. During magnetic reconnection the separatrix regions, which separate the inflowing and outflowing plasmas, are potentially unstable to a variety of instabilities. Here we report observations of the separatrices of asymmetric reconnection as Cluster crosses the magnetopause close to the subsolar point. The relative motion between the spacecraft and plasma is small enough to resolve spatial changes of the electron distribution in the separatrices over multiple spacecraft spin periods. The electron distributions are shown to be unstable to the electrostatic beam mode and electromagnetic whistler mode. The predicted wave properties are shown to be consistent with observations. The whistler waves are driven by the temperature anistropy caused by a loss of magnetospheric electrons propagating away from the X line, and can be enhanced by the presence of magnetosheath electrons. The whistler waves propagate toward the X line, while the beam mode waves, which potentially lead to the formation of electron solitary waves, propagate away from the X line. The implications for asymmetric reconnection are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The present work focuses on the analysis of post-seismic surface deformation detected in the area of L’Aquila, Central Italy, after the strong earthquake that hit the city and the surrounding villages on April 6th, 2009. The analysis has been carried out thanks to a new dataset of SAR COSMO-SkyMed images covering a time span of 480 days after the mainshock, with the adoption of the Persistent Scatterer Pairs (PSP) approach. This method allows the estimation of surface deformations by exploiting the SAR images at full resolution. In the investigated area two patterns of subsidence have been identified reaching a maximum value of 45 mm in the northeast area of the L’Aquila town. Here the subsidence is mainly ascribable to the post seismic slip release of the Paganica fault and it does not coincide with the maximum measured coseismic subsidence. The time series of the ground deformations also reveal that a large amount of deformation is released in the first three months after the main shock. The second pattern of deformation is centered on the Mt. Ocre ridge, where a detailed photogeological analysis allowed us to identify widespread evidence of morphological elements associated with Deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DGSD). In particular geomorphologic analyses show evidences of lateral spread DGSD-type features, characterized by the tectonic superimposition of carbonatic sequences and transitional pelagic deposits. In this sector, the observed deformation is ascribable not only to the afterslip of the Paganica fault, but also to a gravitative cause. In order to confirm or reject such hypothesis a 2D numerical finite element models considering two cross sections over the Mt. Ocre ridge has been performed. The coseismic and postseimic deformations have been simulated numerically, considering an elastic-perfectly plastic rheology for the constituent rocks. First results show that most of the postseismic deformation is ascribable to the plastic deformation induced by the gravitative rebalancing of the ridge after the coseismic deformation.",

            "abstract": "Previous research has linked wintertime Arctic Oscillation (AO) variability to indices of Siberian snow cover and upward wave activity flux in the preceding fall season. Here, daily data is used to examine the surface and tropospheric processes that occur as the link between snow cover and upward forcing into the stratosphere develops. Spatially, the area of October snow with highest correlations to the mean snow cover index occurs in northwestern Siberia, and is co-located with lagged direct relationships to sea level pressure (SLP) and to lower-stratosphere (100hPa) meridional heat flux. Analysis of daily SLP and 100hPa heat flux shows that in years with high October snow, the SLP is significantly higher from approximately 1 November to 15 December, and the 100hPa heat flux is significantly increased with a two-week lag, from approximately 15 November to 31 December. During Nov-Dec, there are periods with upward wave activity flux extending coherently from the surface to the stratosphere, and these events occur nearly twice as often in high snow years compared to low snow years. The vertical structure of these events is a westward-tilting pattern of high eddy heights, with largest normalized anomalies near the surface in the same region as the snow and SLP changes. These results suggest that high SLP develops in response to the snow cover and this higher pressure, in turn, provides part of the structure of a surface-to-stratosphere wave activity flux event, thus making full events more likely. Implications for improved winter climate forecasts on intraseasonal to seasonal timesscales for the Northern Hemisphere high- and mid-latitudes exist through recognition of these precursor signals.",

            "abstract": "Reducing modeling error is often a major concern of empirical geophysical models. However, modeling errors can be defined in different ways: When the response variable is continuous, the most commonly used metrics are squared (SQ) and absolute (ABS) errors. For most applications, ABS error is the more natural, but SQ error is mathematically more tractable, so is often used as a substitute with little scientific justification. Existing literature has not thoroughly investigated the implications of using SQ error in place of ABS error, especially not geospatially. This study compares the two metrics through the lens of bias-variance decomposition (BVD). BVD breaks down the expected modeling error of each model evaluation point into bias (systematic error), variance (model sensitivity), and noise (observation instability). It offers a way to probe the composition of various error metrics. I analytically derived the BVD of ABS error and compared it with the well-known SQ error BVD, and found that not only the two metrics measure the characteristics of the probability distributions of modeling errors differently, but also the effects of these characteristics on the overall expected error are different. Most notably, under SQ error all bias, variance, and noise increase expected error, while under ABS error certain parts of the error components reduce expected error. Since manipulating these subtractive terms is a legitimate way to reduce expected modeling error, SQ error can never capture the complete story embedded in ABS error. I then empirically compared the two metrics with a supervised remote sensing model for mapping surface imperviousness. Pair-wise spatially-explicit comparison for each error component showed that SQ error overstates all error components in comparison to ABS error, especially variance-related terms. Hence, substituting ABS error with SQ error makes model performance appear worse than it actually is, and the analyst would more likely accept a model with higher bias but more stability. Further, my experiments showed that the two metrics can and will lead to different conclusions about the impacts of certain operations and may suggest different strategies for model improvement. Therefore, SQ error is a poor substitute for ABS error, and the use of the two metrics should be clearly differentiated.",

            "abstract": "Rain on snow (ROS) floods are occurring in many montane catchments in temperate climates in many parts of the world. These flood events have been proven to be notoriously hard to predict due to their complex nature. Furthermore due to predicted higher future winter temperatures and precipitation amounts, the potential for ROS floods will likely increase even more in the coming years. Two ROS events in a 40 km² basin in the southwestern part of Germany (one resulting in a flood with a 20 year return period) were intensively observed and analyzed using data from 30 combined climate and snow observation stations (SnoMoS) within the basin. The data was used to calculate a detailed energy balance and showed the large spatial variability present especially in the turbulent fluxes which dominated the snowmelt energy balance during both events. The observed energy balance components also showed that absolute melt energy amounts were always positive and very similar for forested and open areas indicating that water from snowmelt was available to runoff continuously and from the entire basin throughout the ROS events contributing to the extensive flooding. A spatial analysis of how much water was generated from separate parts of the basin throughout the entire ROS events showed the crucial importance the pre-event snow cover conditions have on the flood formation with the snow cover either acting as an initial buffer or as an accelerant to flood runoff depending on snow temperature and initial snow retention storage capacity. An analysis of 14 additional ROS events observed over a three year period showed that snowmelt contributed on average 48% of total water available for runoff available with a maximum of 68%. Overall the study proved the absolutely crucial importance that the snow cover has on the timing and extent of ROS floods.",

            "abstract": "Recent research suggests that even small scale variations in grain size in the shallow stratigraphy of sandy beaches can significantly influence large-scale morphology change. However, few quantitative studies of variations in shallow stratigraphic layers, as differentiated by variations in mean grain size, have been conducted, in no small part due to the difficulty of collecting undisturbed sediment cores in the energetic lower beach and swash zone. Due to this lack of quantitative stratigraphic grain size data, most coastal morphology models assume that uniform grain sizes dominate sandy beaches, allowing for little to no temporal or spatial variations in grain size heterogeneity. In a first-order attempt to quantify small-scale, temporal and spatial variations in beach stratigraphy, thirty-five vibracores were collected at the USACE Field Research Facility (FRF), Duck, NC, in March-April of 2014 using the FRF’s Coastal Research and Amphibious Buggy (CRAB). Vibracores were collected at set locations along a cross-shore profile from the toe of the dune to a water depth of ~1m in the surf zone. Vibracores were repeatedly collected from the same locations throughout a tidal cycle, as well as pre- and post a nor’easter event. In addition, two ~1.5m deep trenches were dug in the cross-shore and along-shore directions (each ~14m in length) after coring was completed to allow better interpretation of the stratigraphic sequences observed in the vibracores. The elevations of coherent stratigraphic layers, as revealed in vibracore-based fence diagrams and trench data, are used to relate specific observed stratigraphic sequences to individual storm events observed at the FRF. These data provide a first-order, quantitative examination of the small-scale temporal and spatial variability of shallow grain size along an open, sandy coastline. The data will be used to refine morphological model predictions to include variations in grain size and associated shallow stratigraphy.",

Beyond their scientific value as fascinating models of pattern formation, unstable porous-media flows are essential to understanding many natural and man-made processes, including water infiltration in the vadose zone, carbon dioxide injection and storage in deep saline aquifers, and hydrocarbon recovery. Here, we review the pattern-selection mechanisms of a wide spectrum of porous-media flows that develop hydrodynamic instabilities, discuss their origin and the mathematical models that have been used to describe them. We point out many challenges that remain to be resolved in the context of multiphase flows, and suggest modeling approaches that may offer new quantitative understanding.\nIn particular, I will present experimental, theoretical and computational results for: (1) fluid spreading under partial wetting; (2) the impact of wettability on viscously unstable multiphase flow in porous media; (3) capillary fracturing in granular media; and (4) rock dissolution during convective mixing in porous media.",

            "abstract": "Calcium carbonate biomineralization of scleractinian coral recruits is fundamental to the construction of reefs and their survival under stress from global and local environmental change. Establishing a baseline for how normal, healthy coral recruits initiate skeletal formation is therefore warranted. We present a multiscale, microscopic and spectroscopic investigation of skeletal elements deposited by Pocillopora damicornis recruits, from 12 h to 22 days after settlement in aquarium on a flat substrate. Six growth stages are defined, primarily based on appearance and morphology of successively deposited skeletal structures, with the following average formation timescales: A (<24 h), B (24–36 h), C (36–48 h), D (48– 72 h), E (72–96 h), and F (>10 days). Raman and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicate the presence of calcite among the earliest components of the basal plate, which consist of micrometer-sized, rod-shaped crystals with rhom- boidal habit. All later CaCO3 skeletal structures are composed exclusively of aragonite. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy reveals that, externally, all CaCO3 deposits consist of <100 nm granular units. Fusiform, dumbbell-like, and semispherulitic structures, 25–35 mm in longest dimension, occur only during the earliest stages (Stages A–C), with morphologies similar to structures formed abiotically or induced by organics in in vitro carbonate crystallization experiments. All other skeletal structures of the basal plate are composed of vertically extending lamellar bundles of granules. From Stage D, straight fibrils, 40–45 nm in width and presumably of organic composition, form bridges between these aragonitic bundles emerging from the growing front of fusing skeletal structures. Our results show a clear evolution in the coral polyp biomineralization process as the carbonate structures develop toward those characterizing the adult skeleton.",

            "abstract": "The plume height of aerosols is one of the crucial parameters for better assessing the radiative forcing of aerosols. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing technique (both in instrumentation and retrieval algorithms) have allowed for retrieving extinction profile from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) in its operational data processing stream. However, information over broad areas is not readily achieved from CALIOP observations due to its narrow swath width. This study presents a method for retrieving the plume height of UV-absorbing aerosols, such as dust and biomass burning smoke, in a much broader area than CALIOP observations by combining aerosol products from multiple satellite sensors: aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), UV aerosol index (UVAI) from Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), and aerosol total backscatter coefficient from CALIOP. When VIIRS, OMPS, and CALIOP products are available for a certain aerosol event, the presented algorithm retrieves aerosol plume height and single-scattering albedo (SSA). If the CALIOP track misses the aerosol event, it only retrieves the plume height using an assumed SSA. Case studies are presented to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the developed method and shed light on paths to further improving the retrieval accuracy. Comparisons between the retrieved SSA with those of AERONET inversion products support possible use of the SSA climatology derived from the developed algorithm to improve the retrieval accuracy when CALIOP observations are missing.",

            "abstract": "Obtaining knowledge about source parameters in (near) real-time during or shortly after an earthquake is essential for mitigating damage and directing resources in the aftermath of the event. Therefore, a variety of real-time source-inversion algorithms have been developed over recent decades. This has been driven by the ever-growing availability of dense seismograph networks in many seismogenic areas of the world and the significant advances in real-time telemetry. By definition, these algorithms rely on short time-windows of sparse, local and regional observations, resulting in source estimates that are highly sensitive to observational errors, noise and missing data. In order to obtain estimates more rapidly, many algorithms are either entirely based on empirical scaling relations or make simplifying assumptions about the Earth's structure, which can in turn lead to biased results. It is therefore essential that realistic uncertainty bounds are estimated along with the parameters. A natural means of propagating probabilistic information on source parameters through the entire processing chain from first observations to potential end users and decision makers is provided by the Bayesian formalism.\nWe present a novel method based on pattern recognition allowing us to incorporate highly accurate physical modelling into an uncertainty-aware real-time inversion algorithm. The algorithm is based on a pre-computed Green's functions database, containing a large set of source-receiver paths in a highly heterogeneous crustal model. Unlike similar methods, which often employ a grid search, we use a supervised learning algorithm to relate synthetic waveforms to point source parameters. This training procedure has to be performed only once and leads to a representation of the posterior probability density function $p(m|d)$ --- the distribution of source parameters $m$ given observations $d$ --- which can be evaluated quickly for new data.\nOwing to the flexibility of the pattern-recognition based approach, the algorithm can be easily extended to be used with a wide variety of input data, ranging from seismic waveform- to geodetic data. We present a way to deal with noisy observations and missing input data and show how the algorithm could be incorporated into a local earthquake early warning system.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization can alter nutrient cycles due to coupled interactions between society and the environment. This “urban biogeochemistry” both increases the amount of nutrients in stormwater runoff and reduces filtering opportunities before receiving waters. While the export coefficient (EC) and event mean concentration (EMC) are used frequently as scoping level models for nutrient loading, land cover EC and EMC values do not account for spatial variation in hydrological transport processes in the runoff contributing area and dispersal area (CADA). The representation of runoff and filtering likelihoods across landscapes has been developed to identify critical pollutant areas in landscapes. This research seeks to improve scoping level models to account for variation in biogeochemical cycles in urban environments. The CADA weighting framework has been used to represent spatial variation in P loading, and will be modified and enhanced to represent N loading via runoff and filtration likelihoods, including vegetative buffering and denitrification potential. The simplicity of this model will allow for first-order estimates of high N and P loading areas on the landscape using widely available datasets, and will help identify critical areas for management and pollutant reduction. Planners will then be able to adjust land uses within the model to assess the impact of spatial land cover on water quality.",

            "abstract": "Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin is one of the largest unconventional gas resources in the United States. The main public concern associated with hydraulic fracturing of Marcellus shale is that that the quality of underground sources of drinking water (USDW) and surface waters can be compromised due to well casing or grouting failures, creation of new fracture pathways, and improper disposal of produced water. However, this region has a long history of coal mining and oil /gas development and therefore it becomes very important to be able to distinguish if any incidence of water contamination is associated with legacy mining/drilling activities or the newly drilled shale gas wells. In addition, the complex structural regime of the Appalachian makes it difficult to decouple natural migration of deep brines and stray gas along geological faults/ fractures from new pathways created by hydraulic fracturing activities. In order to effectively assess the effect of shale gas development on water quality of this region there is a need 1) to establish the background geochemical signatures of different water sources and, 2) to develop geochemical fingerprints that can track the sources and fates of brines and stray gas in fresh waters. We will present results from several ongoing research projects which demonstrate applicability of stable isotopes as natural tracers to understand changes in hydrologic connections associated with shale gas drilling in this region.",

            "abstract": "Purely compressional electromagnetic waves, also denoted fast magnetosonic waves, equatorial noise, and ion Bernstein modes, can both heat thermal protons and accelerate electrons up to relativistic energies. These waves have been observed both in the near-equatorial region in the inner magnetosphere and in the plasma sheet boundary layer. Although these waves have been observed by various types of satellite instruments (DC and AC magnetometers and electric field sensors), most recent studies have used data from AC sensors, and many have been restricted to frequencies above ~50 Hz. We report here on a survey of ~200 of these waves, based on DC electric and magnetic field data from the EFW double probe and EMFISIS fluxgate magnetometer instruments, respectively, on the Van Allen Probes spacecraft during its first two years of operation. The high sampling rate of these instruments makes it possible to extend observational studies of the lower frequency population of such waves to lower L shells than any previous study. These waves, often with multiple harmonics of the local proton gyrofrequency, were observed both inside and outside the plasmapause, in regions with plasma number densities ranging from 10 to >1000 cm-3. Wave occurrence was sharply peaked near the magnetic equator and occurred at L shells from below 2 to ~6 (the spacecraft apogee). Waves appeared at all local times but were more common from noon to dusk. Outside the plasmapause, occurrence maximized broadly across noon. Inside the plasmapause, occurrence maximized in the dusk sector, in an extended plasmasphere. Every event occurred in association with a positive gradient in the HOPE omnidirectional proton flux in the range between 2 keV and 10 keV. The Poynting vector, determined for 8 events, was in all cases directed transverse to B, but with variable azimuth, consistent with earlier models and observations.",

            "abstract": "For marginal seas open to primary ocean basins, and coastal oceans, it is necessary to prescribe the tidal forcing on the boundaries open to the ocean basin. In many cases, it is this forcing that is more important than the astronomical forcing. The Arabian Gulf is such an example. Here we present results from analysis of sea-level time series collected at four stations (Khiran, Fintas, Salmiya, Subiya; see Figure) along the Kuwaiti coast and currents collected from a bottom mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) at a shelf station (Qaruh). Tides are mixed semi-diurnal with more than 90% of the total tidal amplitude variance explained by the K1, O1, M2, and S2 constituents at all four stations. The K1 and M2 constituents alone contribute >75% variance at each station. A clear pattern of increase of the total tide amplitude along the coast, from south (up to ~1 m amplitude) to north (up to ~2 m amplitude), was observed with the M2 tide contributing from 33% of the total variance at the southern station to 65% at the northern station. Analysis of ADCP current profiles indicates that the U (East-West) and V (North-South) tidal current components reach amplitudes of 0.2 and 0.5 m/s, respectively, throughout the water column. About 90% of the current variance could be explained by the K1, O1, M2, and S2 constituents. Initial results of comparison to three tide prediction models suggest that the predictions that best fit our observations are produced by UK Admiralty TotalTide, then by Xtide, and lastly by OSU's Tidal Prediction Software programs.",

            "abstract": "Stratospheric ozone depletion has played a dominant role in driving Antarctic climate change in the last decades. In order to capture the stratospheric ozone forcing, many coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) prescribe the Antarctic ozone hole using monthly and zonally averaged ozone field. However, the prescribed ozone hole has a high ozone bias and lacks zonal asymmetry. The impacts of these biases on model simulations, particularly on Southern Ocean and the Antarctic sea ice, are not well understood. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of using interactive stratospheric chemistry instead of prescribed ozone on Antarctic and Southern Ocean climate change in an AOGCM. We compare two sets of ensemble simulations for the 1960-2010 period using different versions of the Goddard Earth Observing System 5 – AOGCM: one with interactive stratospheric chemistry, and the other with prescribed monthly and zonally averaged ozone and 6 other stratospheric radiative species calculated from the interactive chemistry simulations.\nConsistent with previous studies using prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations, the interactive chemistry runs simulate a deeper Antarctic ozone hole and consistently larger changes in surface pressure and surface winds than the prescribed ozone runs. The use of a coupled atmosphere-ocean model in this study enables us to determine the impact of these surface trend differences on Southern Ocean circulation and Antarctic sea ice. The larger surface wind trends in the interactive chemistry case lead to larger Southern Ocean circulation trends with stronger changes in northerly and westerly surface flow near the Antarctica continent and stronger upwelling near 60ºS. Using interactive chemistry also simulates a larger decrease of sea ice concentrations. Our results highlight the importance of using interactive chemistry in order to correctly capture the influences of stratospheric ozone depletion on climate change over Antarctic and the Southern Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The global vegetation biomass stores huge amounts of carbon and is thus important to the global carbon budget (Pan et al., 2010). For the past few decades, different observation-based estimates and modeling of biomass in the above- and below-ground vegetation compartments have been comprehensively conducted (Saatchi et al., 2011; Baccini et al., 2012). However, uncertainties still exist, in particular for the simulation of biomass magnitude, tendency, and the response of biomass to climatic conditions and natural and human disturbances. The recently successful coupling of the integrated Earth System Model (iESM) (Di Vittorio et al., 2014; Bond-Lamberty et al., 2014), which links the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), Global Land-use Model (GLM), and Community Earth System Model (CESM), offers a great opportunity to understand the biomass-related dynamics in a fully-coupled natural and human modeling system. In this study, we focus on the systematic analysis and evaluation of the iESM simulated historical (1850-2005) and future (2006-2100) biomass changes and the response of the biomass dynamics to various impact factors, in particular the human-induced Land Use/Land Cover Change (LULCC). By analyzing the iESM simulations with and without the interactive LULCC feedbacks, we further study how and where the climate feedbacks affect socioeconomic decisions and LULCC, such as to alter vegetation carbon storage.\n ",

Here we show that above 30 oN, the strength of the relationship between the interannual variability of growing season NDVI and temperature (partial correlation coefficient RNDVI-GT) has declined substantially between 1982 and 2011, although with a heterogeneous spatial pattern. This decrease of RNDVI-GT is mainly observed in temperate and arctic ecosystems, and this phenomenon also partly reproduced by process-based ecosystem model results. In the northern temperate zone, the decrease of RNDVI-GT coincides with an increase of drought. In the arctic it may be related to a nonlinear response of photosynthesis to temperature, increase of hot extreme days, and shrub expansion over grass-dominated tundra. Our results caution the use of results from interannual time scales to constrain decadal response of plants to ongoing warming.",

            "abstract": "An earth system model has been developed at Beijing Normal University (Beijing Normal University Earth System Model, BNU-ESM). The model is based on several widely evaluated climate model components and is used to study mechanisms of ocean-atmosphere interactions, natural climate variability and carbon-climate feedbacks at interannual to interdecadal time scales. The atmospheric, oceanic, sea ice and land components are based on the Community Atmospheric Model version 3.5 from National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Modular Ocean Model version 4p1 from Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, the Los Alamos sea ice model version 4.1 from Los Alamos National Lab, and the Common Land Model developed at Beijing Normal University, respectively. In this study, results for the CMIP5 historical simulation are evaluated to demonstrate the model’s performance in terms of the mean model state and the internal variability. It is illustrated that BNU-ESM can simulate many observed features of the earth climate system, such as the climatological annual cycle of surface air temperature and precipitation, annual cycle of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature, the overall patterns and positions of cells in global ocean meridional overturning circulation. For example, the globally averaged surface temperature has a bias of -0.17 °C compared with CRU TS 3.1 and HadISST merged datasets over the period of 1976-2005, the globally averaged precipitation has a bias of 0.18 mm/day compared with GPCP observations over the period of 1979-2005. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulated in BNU-ESM exhibits an irregular oscillation between 2 and 5 years with the seasonal phase locking feature of ENSO. In terms of terrestrial carbon cycle, simulated land gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP) and net biosphere production (NEP) are consistent with several observational estimates. Important biases with regard to observations are presented and discussed, including warm SST discrepancies in the major upwelling regions, an equatorward drift of midlatitude westerly wind bands, tropical precipitation bias over the ocean that is related to the double Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and substantial less soil organic carbon stocks simulated in the model.",

            "abstract": "Recent analyses suggest that the velocity of downstream transport of suspended sediment (averaged over long timescales that include periods of transport and storage in alluvial deposits) can be represented as the ratio Ls/T, where Ls is a distance particles move before entering storage and T is the waiting time particles spend in storage before being remobilized. Sediment budget analyses suggest that Ls is 1-100 km in the mid-Atlantic region, while T may be ~103 years, such that particles move 3-5 orders of magnitude slower than the water in the channel. Given the well-known inaccuracy of sediment budgets, independent verification from a tracer study would be desirable. Here, an historic industrial release of mercury is interpreted as a decadal sediment tracer experiment, releasing sediment particles “tagged” with mercury that are deposited on floodplains. As expected, floodplain mercury inventories decrease exponentially downstream, with a characteristic decay length of 10 km (95% confidence interval: 5-25 km) that defines the distance suspended particles typically move downstream before entering storage. Floodplain mercury inventories are not significantly different above and below three colonial age mill dams (present at the time of mercury release but now breached), suggesting that these results reflect ongoing processes. Suspended sediment routing models that neglect long-term storage, and the watershed management plans based on them, may need revision.",

            "abstract": "Mean sea level (MSL) research has generally focussed on quantifying and understanding long-term trends and more recently multidecadal fluctuations in order to provide stakeholders and decision makers with scenarios to be considered for developing sustainable coastal adaptation strategies. However, with the exception of several small island states, extreme sea level events associated with storm surges mostly endanger coastal communities instead of the immediate impact of MSL rise. In this context several studies conducted at global, regional, and local scales suggested that changes in extreme sea levels broadly follow changes in MSL. Many of these studies (especially when relying on global data sets) only focussed on relatively short time periods (~ 40 years), used only one out of a whole range of different approaches available to compare MSL and extreme sea level changes, or concentrated on long-term trends ignoring multidecadal variations.\nHere we use a set of 20 tide gauge records covering the continuous US coastline and the period from 1929 to 2013 to identify long-term trends and multidecadal variations in extreme sea levels relative to changes in MSL. We apply a range of different approaches to assure that the results are robust against the selected methodology. We find significant long-term trends in extreme sea levels above MSL trends for several sites in the southeast and on the west coast and identify six regions with coherent multidecadal fluctuations unrelated to MSL changes. Using non-stationary extreme value analysis we show that the latter caused variations in the 100 year return water levels ranging from ~10 cm to as much as 80 cm across the regions, significantly deviating from the stationary assumption. Identifying and understanding these changes is crucial in order to include the information into coastal design and adaptation processes in addition to long-term changes in MSL.",

We extracted 698 impulsive signals (less than five seconds duration) as well as numerous longer period signals, likely trains or other vehicular noise in the region. Using arrival time differences, we derived three-dimensional incidence vectors of infrasound arrivals by calculating azimuth and inclination angles for a sorted group of 661 well-recorded impulsive signals (179 in 2010, 220 in 2012, 262 in 2013). During this period, impulsive sources arrive at the array from an average azimuth angle of 272.4 degrees. Two main clusters of events can be seen each year: the densest cluster spans the azimuth range 250.96-277.18 degrees, while the second cluster spans 294.33-336.35 degrees. Inclinations for both of these clusters are relatively low, as the main cluster spans 16.1-24.68 degrees and the second spans 4.69-18.44 degrees. The main cluster corresponds to the location of The Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center (EMRTC), which detonates regularly scheduled explosions and is located at an azimuth of 266 degrees with respect to the array. The second cluster lies to the north of the EMRTC range, but the source of these signals is unknown and requires further investigation. Signals associated with other sources, most likely mining explosions, appear each year emanating from south of EMRTC. Additionally, two minor clusters at low azimuth angles and high inclinations are observed, possibly originating from a number of sites including Kirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National Laboratories, and White Sands Missile Range. Waveform cluster analysis suggests distinct waveform similarity associated with specific sources.",

Due to nonlinear responses of land hydrological process to precipitation extremes, runoff can increase exponentially, and on the hard hand, soil water storage may decline. In addition, IPCC AR5 indicates that soil moisture decreases in most areas under the global warming scenario. In this study, we use NCAR Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) to simulate changes in terrestrial available water (TAW, defined as the precipitation minus evaporation minus runoff, and then divided by the precipitation) under global warming. Preliminary results show that the TAW has clear seasonal variations. Compared to previous studies, which do not include the runoff in the calculations of the available water, our estimates on the TAW has much less available water in high latitudes through out the year, especially under extreme precipitation events.",

And what are the factors affecting these probabilities? We utilize machine learning classification methods to define the failure boundary (in the stochastic space) corresponding to a specific threshold of a rare event. The training samples for the classification algorithm are obtained using multilevel splitting and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Once the training of the classifier is performed, a full MC simulation can be performed efficiently using the classifier as a reduced order model replacing the full physics simulator.\nWe apply the proposed method on a standard benchmark for CO2 leakage through an abandoned well. In this idealized test case, CO2 is injected into a deep aquifer and then spreads within the aquifer and, upon reaching an abandoned well; it rises to a shallower aquifer. In current study, we try to evaluate the probability of leakage of a pre-defined amount of the injected CO2 given a heavy tailed distribution of the leaky well permeability. We show that machine learning based approaches significantly outperform direct MC and multi-level splitting methods in terms of efficiency and precision. The proposed algorithm’s efficiency and reliability enabled us to perform a sensitivity analysis to the different modeling assumptions including the different prior distributions on the probability of CO2 leakage.",

Both the primary and the extended mission data have been processed into global models of the lunar gravity field at NASA/GSFC using the GEODYN software. Here we present our latest global model, an expansion in spherical harmonics of degree and order 1080. We discuss this new solution in terms of its power spectrum, its free-air and Bouguer anomalies, its associated error spectrum, and its correlations with topography-induced gravity.\nIn addition to global models we also estimated local gravity adjustments in areas of particular interest such as Mare Orientale and the south pole area. We express gravity in terms of anomalies, and estimate them with respect to a global background model. We apply neighbor-smoothing in our estimation procedure.

            "abstract": "Foreshocks preceding mainshocks in the short-term, ranging from minutes to a few months prior the mainshock, have been known from several decades ago. Understanding the generation mechanisms of foreshocks was supported by seismicity observations and statistics, laboratory experiments, theoretical considerations and simulation results. However, important issues remain open. For example, (1) Why only some mainshocks are preceded by foreshocks and not others? (2) Is the mainshock size dependent on some attributes of the foreshock sequence? (3) Is that possible to discriminate foreshocks from other seismicity styles (e.g. swarms)? To approach possible replies to these issues we reviewed about 400 papers, reports, books and other documents referring to foreshocks as well as to relevant laboratory experiments. We found that the ratio of mainshocks preceded by foreshocks increases with the increase of monitoring capabilities and that foreshock activity is dependent on source mechanical properties and favoured by material heterogeneity. Also, the mainshock size does not depend on the largest foreshock size but rather by the foreshock area. Seismicity statistics may account for an effective discrimination of foreshocks from other seismicity styles. Our literature survey showed that only the last years the seismicity catalogs organized in some well monitored areas are adequately complete to search foreshock activities. Therefore, we investigated for a set of “positive foreshock examples” covering a wide range of mainshock magnitudes from 4.5 to 9 in Japan, S. California, Italy and Greece.

            "abstract": "Quantitative evaluation of how mountain ecosystems respond to climate change requires accurate estimates of temperature at high altitudes. One approach to estimating highland temperature is by extrapolating temperatures from low altitudes, based on previous observations of the actual altitudinal lapse rate of temperature (γlocal). However, our understanding of γlocal is still very limited. Here, we use daily mean, maximum and minimum temperature (Tmean, Tmax, Tmin) data from 523 meteorological stations in mainland China to estimate the spatiotemporal patterns of γlocal. The mean γlocal across the whole country is 5.4 K km-1, with a daytime average of 5.0 K km-1 and a nighttime average of 5.6 K km-1. The patterns of γlocal for Tmean (γlocal(Tmean)) display: 1) a significant spatial difference between southern China and northern China (including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, p<0.05); 2) a distinct seasonal variation, with higher γlocal occurring in summer and lower occurring in winter in most regions. Interestingly, the seasonal variation for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is reversed, with γlocal being lower in summer and higher in winter. In addition, the spatial difference and seasonal variation of γlocal for Tmax and Tmin (γlocal(Tmax) and γlocal(T­min)) show similar patterns to γlocal(Tmean), but slightly diverge from each other. Our results demonstrate that the magnitude of γlocal obviously differs in regional distributions and seasonal variations, and may be a result of the interactions among temperature, atmospheric moisture content and solar radiation. To improve the accuracy of the extrapolation method requires spatial patterns of γlocal rather than just a constant universal value.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric instabilities associated with plasma bubbles in the equatorial region are one of the major space weather impacts, creating scintillation that affects satellite communications and navigation as well as spread-F and propagation effects on lower frequency systems. Coherent scatter radars can be used to detect the presence of irregularities at a scale size corresponding to half the wavelength of the radar when the raypaths are perpendicular to the magnetic field. A number of vertical incidence radars operating in the VHF range near the magnetic equator use this effect to map out vertical irregularity structure in bubbles, while at high latitudes in both the northern and more recently southern hemisphere, HF radars in the SuperDARN network have successfully used refraction along near-horizontal paths to reach perpendicularity with the near-vertical magnetic field and map out ionospheric convection and irregularity structure over fields of view thousands of km across. In the equatorial region, perpendicularity can be obtained anywhere within a near-vertical plane even without refraction, although refraction can be used to achieve long ranges after one or more reflections from the earth’s surface and bottomside ionosphere. This potentially provides a means of detecting and monitoring equatorial plasma bubbles over the oceans from long ranges using a small number of ground-based sites. We discuss the possible echoes that could be detected by such a system, the likely propagation modes and characteristics, and means of obtaining and utilizing elevation angle information to correctly locate distant plasma bubbles.",

            "abstract": "In 2012, a 82 cm long sediment core (Ni2B) was drilled at Nettilling Lake. We use a multi-proxy paleolimnological approach to study the sedimentary records preserved in Nettilling Lake (Baffin Island, Canada) in order to reconstruct the postglacial environmental history of the lake watershed. 31 samples of biogenic silica were purified, their contamination assessed and corrected for and subsequently analysed for the oxygen isotope composition (δ18Odiatom). Additionally, the diatom assemblage from 35 samples was quantified under the light microscope with x 1000 magnification. Our chronology extends to ~ BC 1200 yrs based on radiometric dating 210Pd and 14C from bulk sediment.\nDowncore variations in δ18Odiatom values show a marine-lacustrine transition. The samples from the marine-brackish zone show a higher isotopic composition (27.5‰, 58.5cm depth, ²middle Holocene²) than the samples from the lacustrine section (21.7‰, 1.5cm, 2002 AD). The transition zone can be distinguished by values between these extremes, too (23.4‰, 33cm, ~1240 BC). This likely reflects changes in the water source, from more isotopically enriched marine water in the past to more depleted and cold lacustrine water. The diatom assemblage reflects the same transition. The marine-brackish zone contains polyhalobous-mesohalobous benthic species (e.g. Trachyneis aspera, Gomphonemopsis aestuarii, G. pseudexigua,Cocconeis scutellum) which have a salinity preference between 35‰ to 5‰, indicating a shallow, littoral environment. The transition zone is characterized by a sharp rise of alkaliphilous freshwater benthic taxa (e.g. Staurosirelle pinnata, Staurosira construens, Staurosira brevistriata). The diatom flora of the upper zone is characterized by halophobous planktonic and benthic species (e.g. Cylotella rossii, Cyclotella pseudostelligera, Tabelaria floculosa, Encyonema silesiacum, Nitzschia perminuta).\nThe δ18Odiatom and the diatom assemblage record from Nettilling Lake register changes in the oxygen isotope composition of the lake water. This is the first δ18Odiatom record documenting a marine-lacustrine transition. Records from Nettilling Lake will provide further evidence for the usefulness of δ18Odiatom as an important parameter in multi-proxy paleoclimatic reconstruction.",

Following the ML=5.9 earthquake that struck the Emilia region around Ferrara in Northern Italy on May 20, 2012, a cooperation of Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, OGS, the Comune di Ferrara and the University of Ferrara lead to the reinstallation of a previously existing very broad band (VBB) borehole seismic station in Ferrara and to the deployment of a temporary seismographic network consisting of eight portable seismological stations, to record the local earthquakes that occurred during the seismic sequence. The aim of the OGS intervention was on one hand to extend its real time seismic monitoring capabilities toward South-West, including Ferrara and its surroundings, and on the other hand to evaluate seismic site responses in the area.\nWe will introduce details of the Ferrara VBB borehole station and the OGS temporary seismographic network configuration and installation. We will then illustrate the location capability performances, and finally we will shortly describe seismic site characterization with surface/borehole comparisons in terms of seismic noise, site amplification and resonance frequencies.",

            "abstract": "A new retrieval algorithm has been developed to retrieve both fine and coarse modal aerosol properties from multi-spectral and multi-angular solar polarimetric radiation fields such as those measured by the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) but with additional channels of polarization observations (hereafter AEROENT-type measurements). Most AERONET sites lack the capability to measure light polarization, though a few measure polarization only at 870 nm. From both theory and real cases, we show that adding multi-spectral polarization data can allow a mode-resolved inversion of aerosol microphysical parameters.\nIn brief, the retrieval algorithm incorporates AERONET-type measurements in conjunction with advanced vector radiative transfer model specifically designed for studying the inversion problems in aerosol remote sensing. It retrieves aerosol parameters associated to a bi-lognormal particle size distribution (PSD) including aerosol volume concentrations, effective radius and variance, and complex indices of aerosol refraction. Our algorithm differs from the current AERONET inversion algorithm in two major aspects. First, it retrieves effective radius and variance and total volume by assuming a bi-modal lognormal PSD, while AERONET one retrieves aerosol volumes of 22 size bins. Second, our algorithm retrieves spectral refractive indices for both fine and coarse modes. Mode-resolved refractive indices can improve the estimate of single scattering albedo (SSA) for each mode, which also benefits the evaluation for satellite products and chemistry transport models. While bi-lognormal PSD can well represent aerosol size spectrum in most cases, future research efforts will include implementation for tri-modal aerosol mixtures in situations of cloud-formation or volcanic aerosols.\nApplying the algorithm to a suite of real cases over Beijing_RADI site, we found that our retrievals are overall consistent with AERONET inversion products, but can offer mode-resolved refractive index and SSA. Theoretical analysis indicates that adding polarization can reduce the uncertainty by 50% in the retrieved fine modal aerosol parameters and SSA, although this reduction depends on fine/coarse mode AODs, specifics of instrumentation, and aerosol properties.",

            "abstract": "In the present study we observationally address the role of ionospheric conductivity in the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling in terms of global field-aligned currents (FACs). Solar EUV irradiance changes during a solar cycle, and so does its contribution to the ionospheric conductivity. We statistically examine how, under fixed external conditions, the intensities of the R1 and R2 currents and their demarcation latitude depend on solar activity (F10.7). An emphasis is placed on nightside FACs in the dark hemisphere. The result shows that for fixed ranges of interplanetary electric field, the nightside FACs are more intense for higher solar activity irrespective of their polarities or local times. It is also found that the R1-R2 pair, therefore the auroral oval, moves equatorward as the solar activity increases. For both current intensity and latitude, the dependence on F10.7 is more sensitive at smaller F10.7 and it levels off with increasing F10.7. The intensities of dayside FACs reveal similar F10.7 dependence as expected from the enhancement of the local ionospheric conductance. Interestingly, they also move equatorward with increasing solar activity. It is expected from force balance that as the dayside R1 current becomes more intense with increasing solar activity, the magnetosphere shrinks on the day side and expands on the night side. This configurational change of the magnetosphere presumably affects the energy transport from the solar wind to the magnetosphere, although its details still remain to be understood. We conclude that the ionospheric conductivity actively affects the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

By creating a narrative using multiple datasets, linkages between Earth systems - lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere - can be conveyed. But how effective are digital globes in advancing public literacy in Earth system science? We addressed this question in developing new content for digital globes that interweaves imagery obtained by deep-diving vehicles with global datasets, including a new dataset locating the world's known hydrothermal vents. Our two narratives, \"Life Without Sunlight\" (LWS) and \"Smoke and Fire Underwater\" (SFU), each focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) principles related to geology, biology, and exploration. We are preparing a summative evaluation for our content delivered on NOAA's Science on a Sphere as interactive presentations and as movies. We tested knowledge gained with respect to the STEM principles and the level of excitement generated by the virtual deep-sea exploration. We conducted a Post-test Only Design with quantitative data based on self-reporting on a Likert scale. A total of 75 adults and 48 youths responded to our questionnaire, distributed into test groups that saw either one of the two narratives delivered either as a movie or as an interactive presentation. Here, we report preliminary results for the youths, the majority (81%) of which live in towns with lower income and lower levels of educational attainment as compared to other towns in Massachusetts. For both narratives, there was knowledge gained for all 6 STEM principles and \"Quite a Bit\" of excitement. The mode in responses for knowledge gained was \"Quite a Bit\" for both the movie and the interactive presentation for 4 of the STEM principles (LWS geology, LWS biology, SFU geology, and SFU exploration) and \"Some\" for SFU biology. Only for LWS exploration was there a difference in mode between the interactive presentation (\"A Little\") and the movie (\"Quite a Bit\"). We conclude that our content for digital globes is effective in teaching the STEM principles and exciting viewers about the deep ocean frontier. We attribute this success to the tight collaboration between scientists, educators, and graphic artists in developing the content for public audiences.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this research is to better understand the greenhouse gas balance of land-use transition to bioenergy cropping systems in a UK context. Given limited land availability, addressing the food-energy-water nexus remains a challenge, and it is imperative that bioenergy crops are sited appropriately and that competition with food crops is minimised.\nInitial analyses included an extensive literature review and meta-analysis with a focus on the effects of land-use change to bioenergy on soil carbon and GHGs. This data mining exercise allowed us to understand the current state of the literature and identify key areas of research which needed to be addressed. Significant knowledge gaps were identified, with particular uncertainty around transitions from grasslands and transitions to short rotation forestry.\nA paired site experiment was established on a commercial SRC willow plantation and grassland to measure soil and ecosystem respiration. Initial results indicate that willow was a net sink for CO2 in comparison to grassland which was a net source of CO2. This provides evidence that the GHG balance of transition to SRC bioenergy willow will potentially result in increased soil carbon, in the long-term. The empirical findings from this study have been combined with modelled estimates for the site to both test and validate the ECOSSE model. Initial comparisons show that the model is able to accurately predict the respiration occurring at the field site, suggesting that it is a valuable approach for up-scaling from point sites such as this to wider geographical areas, and for considering future climate scenarios. The spatial modelling outputs will be used to build a modelling tool for non-specialist users which will determine the GHG and soil carbon effects of changing land to bioenergy for UK.\nThis work is based on the Ecosystem Land Use Modelling & Soil Carbon GHG Flux Trial (ELUM) project, which was commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI).",

Upper Indus basin is one of the mega scale river basin in HKH region where snow and glaciermelt runoff is the major contributor to the annual runoff. The hostile climate, remote and extreme rough topography imposes many restraints regarding hydro-meteorological and glaciological observations, leading towards limited understanding of hydrological processes of river basins in this region. It is vital to integrate snow and glacier melt processes in a distributed biosphere hydrological framework to estimate the snow and glacier melt runoff and to quantify the river flow composition (snowmelt, glacier melt and rainfall contribution). An integrated system of distributed biosphere hydrological modeling framework with multilayer energy balance based snow and glaciermelt runoff schemes (WEB-DHM-S model) was implemented at Upper Indus basin (207300 km2) with a spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of an hour. Model input were meteorological forcing from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), APHRODITE precipitation and de-trended gridded air temperature from observations. Simulations were carried out for two hydrological years (2002-2003). Discharge simulation results at multiple gauges showed good agreement with the observed one having Nash efficiency at 0.86. The spatial distribution of snow cover is simulated well as compared to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived eight-day maximum snow-cover extent data (MOD10A2). Model accuracy, overestimation error and underestimation error in snow cover simulation were obtained at 78%, 7% and 15% respectively. Uncertainty in precipitation was the main reason for the biases in seasonal variation of snow pixel errors. The model demonstrated its sound capability in comprehensive simulation of discharge with its flow composition, spatial distribution of snow cover and net mass balance.",

            "abstract": "Climate-change-induced trends towards shrub dominance in subarctic, moss-dominated peatlands will most likely have large effects on soil carbon (C) dynamics through an input of more easily decomposable litter. The mechanisms by which this increase in vascular litter input interacts with the abundance and diet-choice of the decomposer community to alter C-processing have, however, not yet been unraveled. We used a novel 13C tracer approach to link invertebrate species composition (Collembola), abundance and species-specific feeding behavior to C-processing of vascular and peat moss litters. We incubated different litter mixtures, 100% Sphagnum moss litter, 100% Betula leaf litter, and a 50/50 mixture of both, in mesocosms for 406 days. We revealed the transfer of C from the litters to the soil invertebrate species by 13C labeling of each of the litter types and assessed 13C signatures of the invertebrates\nCollembola species composition differed significantly between Sphagnum and Betula litter. Within the ‘single type litter’ mesocosms, Collembola species showed different 13C signatures, implying species-specific differences in diet choice. Surprisingly, the species composition and Collembola abundance changed relatively little as a consequence of Betula input to a Sphagnum based system. Their diet choice, however, changed drastically; species-specific differences in diet choice disappeared and approximately 67% of the food ingested by all Collembola originated from Betula litter. Furthermore, litter decomposition patterns corresponded to these findings; mass loss of Betula increased from 16.1% to 26.2% when decomposing in combination with Sphagnum, while Sphagnum decomposed even slower in combination with Betula litter (1.9%) than alone (4.7%).\nThis study is the first to empirically show that collective diet shifts of the peatland decomposer community from mosses towards vascular plant litter may drive altered decomposition patterns. In addition, we showed that although species-specific differences in Collembola feeding behavior appear to exist, species are very plastic in their diet. This implies that changes in C turnover rates with vegetation shifts, might well be due to diet shifts of the present decomposer community rather than by changes in species composition.",

            "abstract": "Radium is a common, naturally occurring radioactive metal found in many subsurface environments. Radium isotopes are a product of natural uranium and thorium decay, and are particularly abundant within groundwaters where minimal flux leads to accumulation within porewaters. Radium has been used as a natural tracer to estimate submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) [1], where the ratios of various radium isotopes are used to estimate total groundwater flux to and from the ocean [2]. Further, it represents a substantial hazard in waste water produced after hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction [3], resulting in a significant risk of environmental release and increased cost for water treatment or disposal.\nAdsorption to mineral surfaces represents a primary pathway of radium retention within subsurface environments. For SGD studies, it is important to understand adsorption processes to correctly estimate GW fluxes, while in hydraulic fracturing, radium adsorption to aquifer solids will mediate the activities of radium within produced water. While some studies of radium adsorption to various minerals have been performed [4], there is a limited understanding of the surface chemistry of radium adsorption, particularly to iron-bearing minerals such as pyrite, goethite and ferrihydrite. Accordingly, we present the results of sorption experiments of radium to a suite of iron-bearing minerals representative of those found within deep saline and near-surface (freshwater) aquifers, and evaluate impacts of varying salinity solutions through the use of artificial groundwater, seawater, and shale formation brine. Further, we explore the impacts of pyrite oxidation and ferrihydrite transformation to other iron-bearing secondary minerals on the retention of radium. This work lays the groundwork for further study of radium use as a tracer for SGD, as well as understanding mechanisms of radium retention and release from deep aquifer materials following hydraulic fracturing operations.\n[1] Charette, M.A., Buesseler, K.O. & Andrews, J.E., Limnol.

            "abstract": "The geomagnetic polarity reversal is generally considered to occur synchronously around the world, and is commonly used as a time marker. However, in the case of the most recent reversal, the Brunhes-Matuyama (B-M) reversal (~780 ka), comparison of paleomagnetic studies in Chinese loess-paleosol sequences versus marine sediments revealed a marked discrepancy in timing of this event (Tauxe et al., 1996; Zhou and Shackleton, 1999), leading to the debate on uncertainties of paleoclimatic correlation between the Chinese loess-paleosol sequences and marine sediments (Wang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2008; Jin and Liu, 2011). Based on this issue, here we propose to use the cosmogenic 10Be to address this conundrum. 10Be is a long-lived radionuclide produced in the atmosphere by cosmic ray spallation reactions and carried to the ground attached to aerosols. Its atmospheric production rate is inversely proportional to the geomagnetic field intensity (Masarik and Beer, 1999). This allows us to reconstruct past geomagnetic field intensity variations using 10Be concentrations recorded in different sedimentary archives. We carried out the 10Be studies in Luochuan and Xifeng sections in Chinese Loess Plateau, both loess profiles show that 10Be production rate was at a maximum-an indication of the dipole field reversal-at ca. 780 ± 3 ka BP., in paleosol unit S7corresponding to MIS 19. These results have proven that the timing of B-M reversal recorded in Chinese loess is synchronous with that seen in marine records (Tauxe et al., 1996) and reaffirmed the conventional paleoclimatic correlation of loess-paleosol sequences with marine isotope stages and the standard loess timescale as correct. However, it is ~25 ka younger than the age (depth) of the magnetic polarity reversal recorded in these same Chinese loess-paleosol sequences, demonstrating that loess magnetic overprinting has occurred.\n1.Jin, C.S.,et al., 2011,PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCL, 299, 309–317\n2.Liu, Q.S., et al., 2008, EARTH PLANET SC LETT, 275, 1–2,102–110\n3.Masarik, J., and Beer, J., 1999, Jounal of Geophysical Research, 104, 12099-12111.\n4.Tauxe, L., et al., 1996, EARTH PLANET SC LETT, 140, 133–146\n5.Wang, X.S., et al., 2006,PHYS EARTH PLANET IN, 159, 109–117\n6.Zhou, L.P., and Shackleton, 1999,EARTH PLANET SC LETT, 168,117-130",

The details of the development of the electric fields are examined using a global ionosphere-electrodynamics model.

The relationships of the Curl-Free mechanism, the Hall Current Divergence mechanism, and the role of the Equatorial Electorjet region control the magnitude and timing of the Prereversal Enhancement of the zonal electric field as well as its altitude profile above the F region bottomside. Realistic conditions for 'equinox' and 'solstice' solar terminator arrangments are presented.\nThe stability of the low-latitude ionosphere has a demonstrated relationship with the solar terminator alignment [Tsunoda, JGR, 1981].

This, and other facts, have been seen as evidence for a majority Alfvenic turbulence cascade; with a small component (10%) of compressible fluctuations. When one approaches scales on the order of the ion-inertial length and the Larmor radius, this behaviour changes and it is now becoming increasingly evident that the spectral break at these scales is also accompanied by an increase in magnetic compressibility. This has been attributed to a phase change in the physics at these scales -- from fluid to kinetic -- and in particular to the dominant role of the Hall-effect at sub-ion scales. We will be presenting results from the Cluster mission to show how this increase in the compressibility is dependent on the ion plasma beta and what implications this has for the physics at sub-ion scales in the context of prominent theories and models for kinetic plasma turbulence.",

            "abstract": "In Oregon’s Central Coast Range (OCR), dissolved O2 concentrations in at least 10% of stream length frequently dip below state standards set to ensure survival and reproduction of native salmonids. We examined O2 dynamics on 12 OCR rivers during times of the year when standards had been violated. Continuous dissolved O2 data were collected 15 minutes apart over a 24-hour period during spring (May - June) or fall (September - November) 2008 on each river. We modeled O2 dynamics for each river with parameters describing O2 exchange with the atmosphere, production of O2 from gross primary production (GPP), and consumption of O2 by ecosystem respiration (ER) fit to observed data. Average nighttime atmospheric O2 exchange and ER were estimated by regressing interval changes in dissolved O2 concentrations between measurements with corresponding O2 saturation deficits. GPP for each daytime sampling interval was calculated as the difference between O2 saturation deficit and the sum of temperature-corrected reaeration and ecosystem respiration. All regression models developed for estimating night-time reaeration and ER were highly significant (p<0.03; adjusted r2=0.17 - 0.77). GPP ranged from 0.62 to 14.95 mg O2 L-1 d-1, ER ranged from -1.21 mg O2 L-1 d-1, and net daily metabolism (NDM; net O2 flux controlled by biological processes) ranged from -11.64 to 3.75 mg O2 L-1 d-1 across all rivers and seasons. Increased aquatic productivity resulting from adjacent and upstream human activities likely altered dissolved O2 dynamics in these rivers. Through scenario analysis, we found that at one river (Alsea), GPP and ER would need to be reduced by 85 and 73%, respectively, to meet the state standard (95% saturation). Our modeling approach can be connected with management actions across a variety of spatial and temporal scales, ranging from local, riparian-scale manipulations of shading and organic matter input to watershed and regional nutrient and temperature management.",

The channel has previously been identified as one of the most attractive sites in Chile for tidal energy extraction (Garrad Hassan and Partners, 2009); however this statement is based on global model predictions over coarse bathymetric information.\nIn this investigation, the first hydrodynamic characterization of the Chacao channel is carried out in order to assess the hydrokinetic power available and to select the most interesting spots where the first tidal energy extraction devices might be installed in Chile.\nThe Chacao channel hydrodynamic characterization and resource assessment is carried out in two stages: field measurements and numerical hydrodynamic modeling. The first stage involves a 10 m resolution multi-beam bathymetry of the channel, sea-level measurements using 6 tidal gauges distributed over the channel berms, tidal current measurements with 6 ADCPs distributed along the channel, and detailed measurements of turbulence in a specific spot in the channel using the Tidal Turbulence Mooring (TTM) developed by Thomson et al. (2013).\nIn a second stage, numerical hydrodynamic modeling using FVCOM (Chen et al., 2003) was prepared for the entire Chacao channel region, using the field data collected in the first stage for calibration and validation of the model.\nThe obtained results allow us to define suitable sites for marine energy extraction, finding large areas with 30 to 60 m depths where horizontal currents are above 1.5 m/s during 60% of the time of a 28 days tidal cycle, however the high levels of turbulence detected by the TTM indicate the need for more detailed studies on the interesting sites, in order to meet the hydrodynamic aspects related to infrastructure design and the definition of device location and distribution in the flow.\nThis work has been supported by Conicyt/Fondef Project D09i1052 and the Office of Naval Research Global.",

            "abstract": "Self-organizing maps (SOMs) comprise a class of artificial neural networks that aim to organize complex input data through computation of a set of M x N representative maps.\nHere we use an SOM routine\n  to isolate the spatial patterns inherent in daily austral summer (December-January-February or DJF) rainfall over the tropical and southern Pacific Ocean basins from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations as well from an ensemble of models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Applying a 2x2 SOM to all available DJFs from TRMM yields two maps that may be regarded as Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)-active, in which precipitation is more intense over the ITCZ region compared to the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) region, while the remaining maps are SPCZ-dominant. The latter reflect a spatial translation of the SPCZ consistent with the previously described impact of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or analogous low-frequency modes of variability on the SPCZ. Comparing the CMIP5-based SOMs to TRMM reveals some broad similarities in the orientation and extent of large-scale features, as well as spurious features, which point to errors or biases in the models. Because of the pronounced impact of ENSO, we further consider SOMs computed separately for each of the El Niño and La Niña phases. This analysis suggests that while the overall position of the SPCZ is sensitive to the phase of ENSO, within each phase, similar high-frequency changes in SPCZ slope occur. Thus, while the mean position of the SPCZ may be dominantly controlled by ENSO phase, the distinct orientations within the same ENSO phase point to additional controls on SPCZ slope.",

            "abstract": "As geochronological constraints on the timing of the Great Oxidation Event (here defined as the passage of atmospheric oxygen levels through the proposed upper limit of 10-5 of present) have improved, it has become increasingly clear that this event is somehow tied to the tectonic factors that have defined the Archean-Proterozoic boundary for decades, namely the stabilization of continental cratons allowing for the growth of large continents. We have proposed two connections in the past: 1) elevated late Archean mantle plume activity brought oxidized material from the lithospheric graveyard to the upper mantle, reducing the oxygen fugacity of post-Archean volcanism, and 2) that the stabilization of the cratons allowed for a proportional increase in less-reducing, subaerial volcanism at the expense of more reducing, submarine volcanism. Critiques of these two proposals will be addressed in the context of subsequent work by the geosciences community on the geodynamics and geochemistry of the Archean-Proterozoic transition, and a synthetic hypothesis for a tectonic driver for atmospheric oxygenation will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Establishing the timing of northwestern Cordilleran ice sheet (NCIS) advance–retreat cycles in southern Alaska allows for investigation of global synchronicity in glacial-age climate forcing. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 targeted the glacial dynamics of the NCIS in the coastal St. Elias range. Sediment cores from Site U1419 encompass times of global ice advance and retreat from MIS 3 to the present, based on a preliminary age model with 5-kya resolution developed using oxygen isotopes from benthic and planktonic foraminifera and stratigraphic correlation with a previously C-14 dated site survey core (Davies et al., 2011; doi:10.1029/2010PA002051). CT images of cores were used to identify sedimentary facies and relative ice sheet proximity. Six sedimentary facies were identified in the images; massive mud with and without lonestones, laminations with and without lonestones, massive and stratified diamict (>1 clast/cm). Elemental scanning XRF data were used to delineate possible downcore changes in sediment provenance using provenance-sensitive transition metals. Diamict and gravelly mud are the most common facies, indicative of persistent glacial input interpreted as marine-terminating glacial systems. Stratified diamicts are interpreted as periods of maximum ice extent (~18-20 ka), whereas massive mud (~14 ka-present) suggests terminus retreat. Intervals of laminated mud with and without lonestones are interpreted as periods of reduced ice cover, with the most recent (~14.5 kya) coinciding with the Bølling Interstade of northern Europe/Greenland (Davies et al., 2011). Downcore changes in Al-normalized metal XRF counts vary along with sedimentary lithoficies, suggesting changes in sediment provenance that may be related to the quantity of glacigenic sediment delivery to this location.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) systems are capable of providing rapid, high density, 3D topographic measurements of snow surfaces from increasing standoff distances. By differencing snow surface with snow free measurements within a common scene, snow depths and volumes can be estimated. These data can support operational water management decision-making when combined with measured or modeled snow densities to estimate basin water content, evaluate in-situ data, or drive operational hydrologic models. In addition, change maps from differential TLS scans can also be used to support avalanche control operations to quantify loading patterns for both pre-control planning and post-control assessment. However, while methods for computing volume from TLS point cloud data are well documented, a rigorous quantification of the volumetric uncertainty has yet to be presented. Using repeat TLS data collected at the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area in Summit County, Colorado, we demonstrate the propagation of TLS point measurement and cloud registration uncertainties into 3D covariance matrices at the point level. The point covariances are then propagated through a volume computation to arrive at a single volume uncertainty value. Results from two volume computation methods are compared and the influence of data voids produced by occlusions examined.",

The THEMIS all-sky imagers can observe auroras over a wide area with temporal and spacial resolutions higher than spacecraft-borne cameras. This enables us to investigate the timing of auroral development in more detail than before. A few min after the appearance and intensification of an auroral onset arc, it begins to form wave-like structure. Then auroral poleward expansion begins another few min later. THEMIS magnetotail observations clearly show that magnetic reconnection is initiated at X~-20 Re at least 1-2 min before the intensification of auroral onset arc. Then low-frequency waves are excited in the plasma sheet at X~-10 Re 2 min before dipolarization, which is simultaneous with the formation of auroral wave-like structure. Dipolarization begins at the same time as the auroral poleward expansion. These results suggest that near-Earth magnetic reconnection plays some role in the development of dipolarization and auroral onset arc.",

            "abstract": "The Atlas Mountains of Morocco have unusually high topography, with no apparent deep crustal root, and regions of localized Cenozoic alkaline volcanism. Previous seismic imaging and geophysical studies have implied a hot mantle upwelling as the source of the volcanism and high elevation, but the existence and physical properties of such an upwelling are debated. Recent temporary deployments of over 100 broadband seismometers that extended across Morocco as part of the PICASSO, Morocco-Münster, and IberArray experiments along with select permanent stations have provided a dataset to image the detailed mantle and lithospheric structure beneath the Atlas. We present results from S receiver functions (SRF), shear wave splitting, waveform modeling, and geodynamic models that help constrain the tectonic evolution of the Atlas and the localized alkaline volcanism. The receiver functions show that the lithosphere is thin (~65 km) beneath the Atlas, but thickens (~105 km) over a very short length scale at the flanks of the mountains and near the Quaternary volcanoes. These changes in lithospheric thickness also correspond to dramatic decreases in delay times inferred from S and SKS splitting observations. SRFs also indicate a broad, low seismic velocity anomaly (~150 km) below the shallow lithosphere that extends along much of the Atlas and beneath the Anti-Atlas and correlates with the location of Pliocene-Quaternary magmatism. Waveform analysis from the linear array across the Middle and High Atlas constrains the position, shape, and physical characteristics of a localized, low velocity conduit that extends up from the uppermost mantle (~200 km). The shape, position and temperature of the imaged low velocity anomaly, offsets in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, and correlation with mantle flow inferred from shear wave splitting suggest that the unusually high topography of the Atlas Mountains is due to active mantle support.",

            "abstract": "Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) can accurately measure three dimensional surfaces for quantifying fluvial erosion and deposition. Point bars are topographic features that form on the convex bank of a meander. While point bars are considered to be formed by depositional processes, they display features such as chute channels and scour holes that suggest that erosion (due to high flow events) may significantly influence point bar evolution. Through the use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), we observed how a point bar on the White Clay Creek near Newark, Delaware responded to a flood event with a return period of 5-50 years. Pre-flood and post-flood LiDAR scans were completed in April and May of 2014. Scans were referenced to a common coordinate system, vegetation points were removed, and two 0.10 m resolution gridded Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were created. A DEM of Difference (DoD) was created by subtracting the pre-flood DEM from the post-flood DEM. Total deposition was 43.58 m3 and total erosion was 79.15 m3, with a net volumetric change of -35.57 m3 over an area of 630.32 m2. Erosion was dominant on the surface of the scroll bar and on the upstream end of the point bar. The pre-flood surface had a large chute channel adjacent to the scroll bar that was filled in during the storm, particularly on the downstream end. Deposits from the storm also extended the point bar into the river channel on the downstream end of the study site. Our results suggest that 1) sediment deposited on point bars is eroded frequently by flood events; and 2) TLS can provide useful estimates of erosion and deposition. If TLS surveys are repeated through time, sediment residence times in point bars can be quantified. This information is useful for creating accurate sediment budgets and for remediating contamination issues.",

In particular, we quantify the mobile and total metals for which there are health concerns related to unconventional gas exploitation; Fe, Mn, Sr, Ba, As, and Pb. To do this, we sampled the upper 400 feet of Devonian to Pennsylvanian aged bedrock from Marcellus, NY to State College, PA. We used a variation of the U.S. Geological Survey Field Leach Test to assess water reactivity and leaching potential. Al, Zn, and U potentially can be leached from aquifer rocks naturally under acidic conditions, such as where pyrite might oxidize, to above current allowable regulatory values for these metals (2 mg/L, 5 mg/L, and 0.03 mg/L respectively) from some of the clay-rich formations.\nGroundwater analyses from both New York and Pennsylvania show that natural ion exchange occurs along flow paths from ridges to valleys. We find the laboratory cation exchange capacity (CEC) spans what might be expected for illite and chlorite commonly found in these rocks. Given the low surface area of the mineral surfaces of the fractures through which most of the water moves, the observed ion exchange in these rocks is not well understood.\nAlong with this broad scale study area we investigated a Devonian outcrop 4 miles North of Cortland, NY to evaluate small-scale trace metal heterogeneity within a single stratigraphic section. Together these two studies provide important information to determine the extent to which ground water might be naturally high in trace metal composition, either because of geochemical conditions or entrainment of suspended material not removed prior to sampling.",

            "abstract": "The Oman ophiolite is an important natural laboratory for understanding the construction of oceanic crust at fast spreading axes and its subsequent tectonic evolution. Previous paleomagnetic research in lavas of the northern ophiolitic blocks (Perrin et al., 2000, Mar. Geophys. Res.) has demonstrated substantial clockwise intraoceanic tectonic rotations. Paleomagnetic data from lower crustal sequences in the southern blocks, however, have been more equivocal due to complications arising from remagnetization, and have been used to infer that clockwise rotations seen in the north are internal to the ophiolite rather than regionally significant (Weiler, 2000, Mar. Geophys. Res.).\nHere we demonstrate the importance and advantages of sampling crustal transects in the ophiolite in order to understand the nature and variability in magnetization directions. By systematically sampling the lower crustal sequence exposed in Wadi Abyad (Rustaq block) we resolve for the first time in a single section a pattern of remagnetized lowermost gabbros and retention of earlier magnetizations by uppermost gabbros and the overlying dyke-rooting zone. Results are supported by a positive fold test that shows that remagnetization of lower gabbros occurred prior to the Campanian structural disruption of the Moho. NW-directed remagnetized remanences in the lower units are consistent with those used by Weiler (2000, Mar. Geophys. Res.) to infer lack of significant rotation of the southern blocks and to argue, therefore, that rotation of the northern blocks was internal to the ophiolite. In contrast, E/ENE-directed remanences in the uppermost levels of Wadi Abyad imply a large, clockwise rotation of the Rustaq block, of a sense and magnitude consistent with intraoceanic rotations inferred from extrusive sections in the northern blocks. We conclude that without the control provided by systematic crustal sampling, the potential for different remanence directions being acquired at different times may lead to erroneous tectonic interpretation.",

            "abstract": "The removal of two dams on the Elwha River, Washington, is the largest dam-removal project in history. Our research documents the sediment deposition, erosion, and channel changes between the dams following the initial sediment release from the removal of the upstream Glines Canyon Dam. Within the first year following the dam removal, the pulse of coarse sediment and large woody debris propagated downstream well over 6 km below the dam. The sediment deposition and altered channel hydraulics caused lateral channel migration where anabranching channels merge around new mid-channel bars and at large bends in the river channel. Documenting the river channel response to this exceptional sediment pulse could improve models of the impacts of future dam removals on similar gravel-bed rivers.\nWe quantified the sediment flux and channel changes at four field sites 2-6 km downstream of Glines Canyon Dam. Topographic changes were surveyed with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) on an annual basis from August 2012 – August 2014 and the surface sediment distribution was quantified with bimonthly sediment counts. Differencing the annual TLS data yielded an overall increase in sediment throughout the study reach, with a minimum of 20,000 m3 of deposition on bars and banks exposed above the water surface in each 700-m-long TLS survey reach. The surface sediment distribution decreased from ~18 cm to < 1 mm. Large woody debris transported downstream from the former reservoir contributed to the formation of new sand and gravel bars along the channel margin at two sites as well as the longitudinal growth of several bars throughout the study area. The new bar formations have continued to propagate downstream as new sediment and woody debris have been added and remobilized, increasing the complexity of the river channel. By spring 2013, channel features that were present before the dam removal began to re-emerge due to the remobilizing of sediment through the system.",

            "abstract": "Comparisons of the land required for different types of energy are challenging due to the fact that upstream land use of fossil fuel technologies is not well characterized. This research focuses on improving estimates of the life cycle land use of natural gas-fired electricity through the novel combination of inventories of the location of natural gas-related infrastructure, satellite imagery analysis and gas production data. Land area per unit generation is calculated as the sum of natural gas life cycle stages divided by the throughput of natural gas, combined with the land use of the power plant divided by the generation of the power plant. Five natural gas life cycle stages are evaluated for their area: production, gathering, processing, transmission and disposal. The power plant stage is characterized by a thermal efficiency ηth, which converts MegaJoules (MJ) to kilowatt hours (kWh).\nWe focus on seven counties in the Barnett shale region in Texas that represent over 90% of total Barnett Shale gas production. In addition to assessing the gathering and transmission pipeline network, approximately 500 sites are evaluated from the five life cycle stages plus power plants. For instance, assuming a 50 foot right-of-way for transmission pipelines, this part of the Barnett pipeline network occupies nearly 26,000 acres. Site, road and water components to total area are categorized. Methods are developed to scale up sampled results for each component type to the full population of sites within the Barnett. Uncertainty and variability are charaterized.\nWell-level production data are examined by integrating commercial datasets with advanced methods for quantifying estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) for wells, then summed to estimate natural gas produced in an entire play. Wells that are spatially coincident are merged using ArcGIS. All other sites are normalized by an estimate of gas throughput. Prior land use estimates are used to validate the satellite imagery analysis. Results of this research will provide a step towards better quantifying the land footprint of energy production activities and a methodologically consistent baseline from which more robust comparisons with alternative energy choices can be made.",

            "abstract": "Equatorial deep jets (EDJs) are persistent, equatorially-trapped zonal jets found between ~500-2000m depth within one degree of the equator in all ocean basins. EDJs have a baroclinic vertical structure characterized by ‘stacked’ eastward and westward jets oscillating in the vertical with a wavelength of ~500m and amplitudes on the order of 10 cm/s. The spatial structure of the EDJs is strikingly different from that of other geophysical zonal jets such as ocean striations and Jupiter’s banded winds, which are not equatorially trapped and are often considered to be essentially barotropic. It is now well-understood that barotropic zonal jets emerge spontaneously from an instability of differentially-rotating turbulence (Constantinou et al. 2014). In contrast, existing theories for EDJs have been based on quite different dynamics, such as interference of equatorially-trapped waves (Wunsch 1977, McCreary 1984) and instability of mixed Rossby-gravity waves (Hua et al. 2008, Eden et al. 2008). In this work, we propose a new theory for the formation and maintenance of EDJs in which EDJs develop spontaneously from stratified turbulence. Using the stochastically-forced Boussinesq model (Smith 2001, Smith & Waleffe 2002), we show that stacked jets form spontaneously from turbulence due to spectrally-nonlocal interactions between internal gravity waves and the zonal mean flow, and that jet formation can be captured using the mean-field (or ‘quasilinear’) approximation to the dynamics. Using mean field dynamics and an associated second-order statistical closure theory (stochastic structural stability theory, Farrell & Ioannou 2003), we explain how the vertical scale of the EDJs is selected, as well as the role of differential rotation in determining their meridional structure.

            "abstract": "According to the hypothesis of polar synchronization, climate variations of Earth’s poles are connected with a persistent phase lock of π/2 throughout the last glacial period. However, it is not clear yet how the Earth’s two poles communicate with each other, the Thermohaline circulation (THC) being a possible candidate for signal carrier. Here we present a possible way of climate variation propagation through the Atlantic Ocean - likely in the form of heat or thermal wave (Cattaneo’s solution) - based on lagged correlation between an organic carbon climate proxy record from the tropical Atlantic and the south-north polar temperature gradient. We further demonstrate that the speed of such propagation is frequency dependent, of which the wave of the longest period travels the fastest at the speed of ~32 km/year consistent with the estimated speed of the THC. The observed speed – frequency relationship can be successfully modeled as resulting from a propagating dispersive thermal wave initiated by the polar temperature gradient maximum. We show that such heat wave propagation is a potential mechanism to couple and synchronize the polar climates during the last glacial period and to force the occurrence of Heinrich events. To summarize, the polar temperature gradient anomalies are consequence of the π/2 phase lock between the polar climates, which is caused by polar synchronization maintained by the coupling, which is, as the data suggest, in the form of thermal waves. The spikes in organic carbon and the Fe/Ca ratio records in the core GeoB3912-1 can be thought of as snapshots of the passage of strong meteorological wavefronts through the equatorial region. The results strongly suggest that each peak in the organic carbon recorded a half-hemisphere-delayed passage of a wave-like disturbance through the equator carrying the south-north temperature gradient maxima. And each of these occurs within timing error of the Heinrich events H0-H6.",

            "abstract": "Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are common in peat, soil, lakes, rivers and hot springs. To seek the potential biological sources of brGDGTs in geothermal environments, we investigated 65 hot springs in the Yellowstone National Park (USA) and Tengchong (China). Together with previously published data from hot springs in the Great Basin (USA) and Tibet (China), we found that the abundance of brGDGTs tended to peak in springs with pH > 8. This contrasts with previous observations indicating an abundance of brGDGTs in acidic soils and peat bogs, suggesting a different biological source and function for lipids in these environments. In support of this hypothesis, a comparison of Cyclization ratios of Branched Tetraethers (CBT) between hot springs and surrounding soils indicated that more brGDGTs with cyclopentane moieties were produced in alkaline hot springs than in nearby low-temperature soils. Since Acidobacteria (the likely source of brGDGTs in peat bog environments) tend to have low CBT ratios, these data suggest a different source for brGDGTs in hot spring environments. RDA and regression analysis integrating brGDGT compounds and nitrogen species indicate that Bacteria involved in the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle (ammonia oxidation and nitrite reduction) may be related to the production of brGDGTs in terrestrial hot springs. However, direct evidence showing the link between nitrogen-cycling bacteria and brGDGT production has yet to be demonstrated under laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, our study expands the possibility of brGDGT sources into bacterial communities in terrestrial geothermal systems where Acidobacteria are absent or only a minor component.",

            "abstract": "The response of mineral phases to the radiation fields that will be experienced in a geological disposal facility (GDF) for nuclear waste is poorly understood. Phyllosilicates are critical phases in a GDF with bentonite clay as the backfill of choice surrounding high level wastes in the engineered barrier, and clays and micas forming the most important reactive component of potential host rocks. It is essential that we understand changes in mineral properties and behaviour as a result of damage from both α and γ radiation over long timescales. Radiation damage has been demonstrated to affect the physical integrity and oxidation state1 of minerals which will also influence their ability to react with radionuclides. Using the University of Manchester’s newly commissioned particle accelerator at the Dalton Cumbrian Facility, UK, model phyllosilicate minerals (e.g. biotite, chlorite) were irradiated with high energy (5MeV) alpha particles at controlled dose rates. This has been compared alongside radiation damage found in naturally formed ‘radiohalos’ – spherical areas of discolouration in minerals surrounding radioactive inclusions, resulting from alpha particle penetration, providing a natural analogue to study lattice damage under long term bombardment1,2. Both natural and artificially irradiated samples have been analysed using microfocus X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high resolution X-ray diffraction mapping on Beamline I18 at Diamond Light Source; samples were probed for redox changes and long/short range disorder. This was combined with lattice scale imaging of damage using HR-TEM (TitanTM Transmission Electron Microscope). The results show aberrations in lattice parameters as a result of irradiation, with multiple damage-induced ‘domains’ surrounded by amorphous regions. In the naturally damaged samples, neo-formed phyllosilicate phases are shown to be breakdown products of highly damaged regions. A clear reduction of the Fe(III) component has been demonstrated in iron-bearing phyllosilicates in both naturally and artificially damaged samples. Alterations in mineral structure and chemistry will have implications for the phases’ efficiency as a barrier material.\n1. Pattrick, R A D et al., (2013) Min. Mag., 77, 2867–2882. 2.

Field observations were conducted from the onset of snowmelt to the formation of melt ponds at several locations in the Chukchi Sea from May 18 to June 17, 2014. The state and variability of incident, reflected, and transmitted spectral irradiance as well as vector and scalar photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were measured coincident with snow depth and ice thickness. These in situ observations were combined with coincident satellite imagery to describe the radiation budget and solar partitioning at an aggregate scale. Results show decreasing albedo and increasing transmission as melt progressed with trends interrupted by a late season snowfall. Albedo declined steadily from a high of 85% to a low of 53%, while transmitted light available for primary production remained well below 1% prior to snow melt and when highly absorbing algae was present at the bottom of the ice. Comparison of our solar partitioning observations with similar observations in multiyear ice highlights the profound impact changing ice morphology has on solar partitioning of the Chukchi Sea.",

            "abstract": "Within an abiotic-dominated context, geomorphologic patterns and dynamics are single expressions of trade-offs between the physical resistance forces, and the mechanical and chemical forces related to climate and erosion. Recently, however, it has become essential for the geomorphological community to take into account also biota as a fundamental geomorphologic agent acting from local to regional scales. However, while there is a recent flourishing literature about the impacts of vegetation on geomorphic processes, the study of anthropogenic pressure on geomorphology is still at its early stages. Humans are indeed among the most prominent geomorphic agents, redistributing land surface, and causing drastic changes to the geomorphic organization of the landscape (e.g. intensive agriculture, urbanization), with direct consequences on land degradation and watershed response. The reconstruction or identification of artificial or anthropogenic topographies, therefore, provides a mechanism for quantifying anthropogenic changes to the landscape systems in the context of the Anthropocene epoch. High-resolution topographic data derived from the recent remote sensing technologies (e.g. lidar, SAR, SfM), offer now new opportunities to recognize better understand geomorphic processes from topographic signatures, especially in engineered landscapes where the direct anthropic alteration of processes is significant. It is possible indeed to better recognize human-induced geomorphic and anthropogenic features (e.g. road networks, agricultural terraces), and the connected erosion. The study presented here may allow improved understanding and targeted mitigation of the processes driving geomorphic changes during urban development and help guide future research directions for development-based watershed studies. Human society is deeply affecting the environment with consequences on the landscape. It is therefore fundamental to establish greater management control over the Earth’s rapidly changing ecosystems.\nTarolli, P. (2014).

            "abstract": "Since the primary signature of CO2 fluxes at the surface occurs in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), remote sensing measurements of CO2 that can resolve the CO2 absorption in the PBL separate from the total column are more sensitive to fluxes than those that can only measure a total column. The NASA Goddard CO2 sounder is a pulsed, range-resolved lidar that samples multiple (presently 30) wavelengths across the 1572.335 nm CO2 absorption line. The range resolution and line shape measurement enable CO2 mixing ratio measurements to be made in two or more altitude layers including the PBL via lidar cloud-slicing and multi-layer retrievals techniques.\nThe pulsed lidar approach allows range-resolved backscatter of scattering from ground and cloud tops. Post flight data analysis can be used split the vertical CO2 column into layers (lidar cloud-slicing) and solve for the CO2 mixing ratio in each layer. We have demonstrated lidar cloud slicing with lidar measurements from a flight over Iowa, USA in August 2011 during the corn-growing season, remotely measuring a ≈15 ppm drawdown in the PBL CO2. We will present results using an improved lidar cloud slicing retrieval algorithm as well as preliminary measurements from the upcoming ASCENDS 2014 flight campaign.\nThe CO2 absorption line is also more pressure broadened at lower altitudes. Analyzing the line shape also allows solving for some vertical resolution in the CO2 distribution. By allowing the retrieval process to independently vary the column concentrations in two or more altitude layers, one can perform a best-fit retrieval to obtain the CO2 mixing ratios in each of the layers. Analysis of airborne lidar measurements (in 2011) over Iowa, USA and Four Corners, New Mexico, USA show that for altitudes above 8 km, the CO2 sounder can detect and measure enhanced or diminished CO2 mixing ratios in the PBL even in the absence of clouds. We will present these results as well as preliminary measurements from the upcoming ASCENDS 2014 flight campaign, where the CO2 sounder instrument will have a more sensitive detector. We will compare results from the two techniques and discuss the potential of such measurements from space.",

            "abstract": "Paonia Dam and Reservoir are located on Muddy Creek, a tributary of the North Fork Gunnison River in western Colorado. Since dam closure in 1962, the 2002 survey estimates an annual sedimentation rate of 153,000 m3/y, resulting in a 25% loss of total reservoir capacity. Long before sediment levels completely fill the reservoir, the outlet works have recently plugged with sediment and debris, adversely impacting operations, and emphasizing the urgency of formulating an effective sediment management plan. Starting in 2010-2011, operations were changed to lower the reservoir and flush sediment through the outlet works in early spring before filling the pool for irrigation. Even though the flushing strategy through the long, narrow reservoir (~5 km long and 0.3 km wide) has prevented outlet works plugging, a long term plan is needed to manage inflowing and deposited sediment more efficiently. Reclamation’s Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group is leading an effort to study the past and current sediment issues at Paonia Dam and Reservoir, evaluate feasible sediment management alternatives, and formulate a plan for future operations and monitoring. The study is building on previously collected data and the existing knowledge base to develop a comprehensive, sustainable sediment management plan. The study is being executed in three phases:\nPhase 1 consisted of an initial site visit to map and sample existing reservoir bottom sediments, a preliminary site evaluation upstream and downstream of the dam, and establishment of time-lapse photo sites and taking initial ground-based photos.\nPhase 2 includes a bathymetric survey of entire reservoir and 11 km of the river downstream of the dam, continuous suspended sediment monitoring upstream and downstream of the reservoir, and collection of additional core samples of reservoir bottom sediments.\nPhase 3 involves the evaluation of current and past operations and sediment management practices, evaluate feasible sediment management methods, and providing recommendations for future monitoring and sediment management operations. Data collected during Phases 1 and 2 are used in a one-dimensional numerical sediment transport model for evaluating past, current, and potential future sediment management options.",

Efforts have focused on Physical Volcanology in Nicaragua, GPS in Costa Rica, and assessment of Geothermal projects in El Salvador, amongst others. Two years ago a Seismology Lab was established at USF. Personnel now include three Professors, a Post-Doc, and 4 graduate students. Seismic and GPS networks were installed at Telica Volcano, Nicaragua, in 2010 by Roman, LaFemina and colleagues. Data are recorded on site and recovered several times per year at this persistently restless volcano, which has rates of 5 to 1400 low frequency seismic events per day (Rodgers et al., submitted). Proposals have been submitted to install instruments on other Nicaraguan volcanoes, including seismometers, GPS, infrasound, and lightning sensors. This suite of instruments has proven to be very effective to study a range of volcanic processes. The proposals have not been successful to date (some are pending), and alternative funding sources are being explored. One interesting scientific issue is the presence of strong seasonal effects, specifically a pronounced rainy season and dry season and possible interaction between shallow volcanic processes and surface waters. We are also pursuing a variety of studies that are complementary to the instrumental efforts. One such study is examining volcanic earthquake swarms, with the focus to date on identifying diagnostics. One clear pattern is that peak rates often occur early in swarms, whereas the largest M event occurs late. Additional evidence suggests that the seismic source size grows systematically, especially for events with similar waveforms (families). Recognition of such patterns, linked to processes, may help to improve monitoring and better take advantage of instrumental data to reduce vulnerability from eruptions.",

Lightning has now been documented at 154 volcanoes in association with over 400 eruptions, a significant increase from the earlier numbers of 89 volcanoes and 240 eruptions. Lightning and electrification at volcanoes are important because they represent a hazard in their own right, they are a component of the global electrical circuit, and because they contribute to ash particle aggregation and modification within ash plumes. The role of water substance (water in all forms) in particular has not been well studied. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) was determined for 177 eruptions. Eight percent of VEI=3-5 eruptions have reported lightning, and 10 percent of VEI=6, but less than 2 percent of those with VEI=1-2, suggesting consistent reporting for larger eruptions but either less lightning or under-reporting for small eruptions. Ash plume heights (142 observations) show a bimodal distribution with peaks at 7-12 km and 1-4 km. The former are similar to heights of typical thunderstorms and suggest involvement of water substance, whereas the latter suggest other factors contributing to electrical behavior near the vent. The distributions of the latitudes of volcanoes with lightning and eruptions with lightning roughly mimic the distribution of all volcanoes; flat with latitude. Meteorological lightning, on the other hand, is common in the tropics and decreases markedly with increasing latitude as the ability of the atmosphere to hold water decreases poleward. This finding supports the idea that if lightning in large eruptions depends on water substance, then the origin of the water is primarily magma and not entrainment from the surrounding atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Numerical simulations of rupture propagation are used to study both earthquake source physics and earthquake ground motion. Under linear slip-weakening friction, artificial procedures are needed to initiate a self-sustained rupture. The concept of an overstressed asperity is often applied, in which the asperity is characterized by its size, shape and overstress. The physical properties of the initiation zone may have significant impact on the resulting dynamic rupture propagation. A trial-and-error approach is often necessary for successful initiation because 2D and 3D theoretical criteria for estimating the critical size of the initiation zone do not provide general rules for designing 3D numerical simulations. Therefore, it is desirable to define guidelines for efficient initiation with minimal artificial effects on rupture propagation. We perform an extensive parameter study using numerical simulations of 3D dynamic rupture propagation assuming a planar fault to examine the critical size of square, circular and elliptical initiation zones as a function of asperity overstress and background stress. For a fixed overstress, we discover that the area of the initiation zone is more important for the nucleation process than its shape. Comparing our numerical results with published theoretical estimates, we find that the estimates by Uenishi & Rice (2004) are applicable to configurations with low background stress and small overstress. None of the published estimates are consistent with numerical results for configurations with high background stress. We therefore derive new equations to estimate the initiation zone size in environments with high background stress. Our results provide guidelines for defining the size of the initiation zone and overstress with minimal effects on the subsequent spontaneous rupture propagation.",

Hotspot reconstructions and mantle general circulation models indicate these structures have persisted for 100 Ma or longer. Here we demonstrate that time variations in the height of these structures perturbs the thickness of the D\" thermal boundary layer and the heat flow across the core-mantle boundary, thereby altering the rate at which geomagnetic polarity reversals occur in the core. First we show that superplume growth increases the average heat flow on the core-mantle boundary as well as its lateral heterogeneity. We then use numerical dynamos to demonstrate that this increased core-mantle boundary heat flow stimulates magnetic polarity reversals, and conversely, that reduced core-mantle boundary heat flow associated with superplume collapse tends to inhibit polarity reversals. Our results suggest that the long, stable polarity geomagnetic superchrons such as occurred in the Cretaceous, Permian, and earlier in the geologic record may have begun and ended, respectively, by collapse and growth of one or more lower mantle superplumes.",

            "abstract": "Herein we present three recent oceanographic studies performed in the Adriatic Sea (the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea), where Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) method, an unsupervised neural network method capable of recognizing patterns in various types of datasets, was applied to environmental data. The first study applied the SOM method to a long (50 years) series of thermohaline, dissolved oxygen and nutrient data measured over a deep (1200 m) Southern Adriatic Pit, in order to extract characteristic deep water mass patterns and their temporal variability. Low-dimensional SOM solutions revealed that the patterns were not sensitive to nutrients but were determined mostly by temperature, salinity and DO content; therefore, the water masses in the region can be traced by using no nutrient data. The second study encompassed the classification of surface current patterns measured by HF radars over the northernmost part of the Adriatic, by applying the SOM method to the HF radar data and operational mesoscale meteorological model surface wind fields. The major output from this study was a high correlation found between characteristic ocean current distribution patterns with and without wind data introduced to the SOM, implying the dominant wind driven dynamics over a local scale. That nominates the SOM method as a basis for generating very fast real-time forecast models over limited domains, based on the existing atmospheric forecasts and basin-oriented ocean experiments. The last study classified the sea ambient noise distributions in a habitat area of bottlenose dolphin, connecting it to the man-made noise generated by different types of vessels. Altogether, the usefulness of the SOM method has been recognized in different aspects of basin-scale ocean environmental studies, and may be a useful tool in future investigations of understanding of the multi-disciplinary dynamics over a basin, including the creation of operational environmental forecasting systems.",

            "abstract": "Proterozoic metamorphic rocks largely crop out between ~14 and ~17°S along the coast of southern Peru. Previous thermochronological studies in this belt focused on the Late Neogene cooling history and yielded Late Paleozoic to mid-Cretaceous zircon U-Th/He and fission-track ages, and Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene apatite fission-track ages.\nOur study aims at extending the fission-track database in the ~300 km-long, high-grade metamorphic Atico-Mollendo Block (AMB; 15.8-17.1°S), in order to understand the lateral variations of thermochronologic ages along the Pacific coast of southern Peru.\nWe present new apatite and zircon fission-track ages from the AMB and interpret them along with the previously published dates from this block and its surrounding areas. The apatite fission-track data show a longitudinal variation pattern with two localized shifts from younger (60 Ma) to older (~90 Ma) dates, corresponding to the northwestern and southeastern borders of the AMB. These shifts coincide in the field with two major normal fault zones that strike perpendicular to the coast and bound the AMB, and had been understated until now. Given the offsetted ages, the faults were active after 60 Ma, and tilted the AMB down to the NW. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the metamorphic grade of the basement increases towards the SE, and with the deposition between ~55 and 30 Ma of forearc continental deposits (Lower Moquegua Group) that exhibit numerous synsedimentary extensional features. The zircon fission-track age pattern is more complicated but can be interpreted either as (i) reflecting a partial reset of the whole area due to burial during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, or (ii) as the reactivation of an important Carboniferous detachment fault during the ~100–80 Ma interval.\nWe suggest that this coast-parallel Eocene-Oligocene extension accommodated the counterclockwise block rotation of the southern Peruvian forearc that accompanied the inception of the Bolivian Orocline around ~30 Ma.",

The large number of such unstable faces lists rock slope failures as one of the bigger hazard threats in Norway.\nSuccessive studies have revealed presence of permafrost in Norway and a number of the unstable rock slope faces are located in mountain permafrost regions. It is known that thawing permafrost influences the rock-mechanical interplay in the bedrock and can hence play a role in the early stage of destabilization in rock walls. At present, both borehole measurements and several modelling studies for Norwegian mountains clearly indicate increasing ground temperatures during the last decades. As a first step in this study, a numerical study of the sensitivity of permafrost to climatic changes was performed for a number of sites along a latitudinal transect in Norway.\nTogether with the thermal condition, lithology, structure and inclination are important conditions for the force regime in rock walls. In this study, the nature of temperature dependence on rock wall stability has been investigated through numerical modelling and the sensitivity of different factors related to these conditions has been evaluated in terms of stability, including the thermal regime. The focus has been on the initial conditions that are important for typical Norwegian rock wall sites and in particular for the sites where the simulations of the permafrost sensitivity have been performed. The analysis was applied for the Nordnes mountain in northern Norway, which is continuously surveyed due to the possible danger if large rock falls may hit the fjord water body generating tsunamis.",

            "abstract": "Ice cores contain a record of snow precipitation that includes information about past atmospheric circulation and mass imbalance in the polar regions. We present here a novel adjoint method to construct a climatic record by both optimally dating an ice-core and deriving from it a detailed accumulation history. The motivation of our work is the recent application of phase sensitive radar which measures the vertical velocity of an ice column. The velocity is dependent on the history of subsequent snow accumulation, compaction and compression; and it can be incorporated to the inverse problem in order to reduce the uncertainty introduced by ice flow modelling.We first apply our method to synthetic data in order to study its capability and the effect of noise and gaps in the data on retrieved accumulation history. The method is then applied to the ice core retrieved from James Ross Island, Antarctica. We show that the method is robust and that the results depend on quality of the age-depth observations and the derived flow regime around the core site.The method facilitates the incorporation of increasing detail provided by ice-core analysis together with observed full-depth velocity in order to construct a complete climatic record of the polar regions.",

Each spacecraft is equipped with a dual frequency GPS receiver to measure total electron content (TEC) and the S4 scintillation index along raypaths from the receiver to the GPS constellation. Scintillation causing small-scale density irregularities are increasingly observed in the vicinity of large TEC gradients associated with storm enhanced density (SED) regions. Detection of irregularities of the scale that cause GPS and VHF scintillation has previously relied on assumptions about their structural stability and drift speed.

Here we examine the potential causes of these observed ozone trends using hindcast simulations from the GMI chemical transport model (CTM), driven by assimilated MERRA meteorological fields. The GMI hindcast simulation reproduces the morphology of observed trends showing more positive trends during the austral winter months (July-September) than during the summer months (December-February), notably in middle and upper troposphere. The simulations include a stratospheric ozone tracer; analysis of this tracer simulation identified an increase in the stratospheric contribution to tropospheric ozone at Reunion over austral winter months from 1992 to 2011, suggesting that changes in stratospheric ozone contribution play a major role in the observed trend. Noting that Reunion is located at the boundary of subtropical jets, where strong stratosphere troposphere exchange (STE) occurs due to shear and folding, we discuss analyses of the dynamics to examine processes impacting the stratospheric ozone contribution over this region.",

We analyzed sorbed metal concentrations, carbon, nitrogen, and organic matter to document past mining pollution in sediment cores recovered from McCargoe Cove; a long, narrow inlet of Lake Superior on Isle Royale adjacent to a high concentration of ancient copper mines. Concentrations of lead, copper, and potassium increase in the sediments at McCargoe Cove after 1860 AD and between 6500 and 5400 years before 1950 AD or present (yr BP). Metal pollution increases coincide with radiocarbon dates associated with prehistoric copper artifacts and mines. These results, in combination with other lake sediment reconstruction sites located on Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula, demonstrate that from 6500 to 5400 yr BP mining activities are detectable across the Lake Superior region. Interestingly a coherent cessation of lead emissions at multiple study sites after ~5400 yr BP coincides with the onset of dry conditions found in regional paleoclimate proxy records. After ~5000 yr BP, lead concentrations on both Isle Royale and the Keweenaw Peninsula remain at background levels until the onset of modern pollution increases ~1860 AD.",

            "abstract": "Breakup of the polar vortex is a dominant feature of the seasonal transition from winter to summer in the stratosphere, which significantly affects stratospheric O3 concentration and tropospheric weather. Previously several criteria for the vortex breakup have been suggested based on the potential vorticity (PV) and wind speed, however, those mainly have focused on the lower stratospheric vortex of which spatiotemporal evolution and decay are more continuous than those of the upper stratospheric vortex. To find a consistent criterion for the vortex breakup in both the lower and upper stratosphere, the present study defined a polar vortex breakup day as when PV gradient at the polar vortex edge becomes lower than that at the subtropical edge on the area equivalent latitude based on PV. With applying the new definition to the UK Met Office reanalysis data, the breakup days of the Arctic polar vortices on 18 isentropic levels from 450 K to 1300 K were calculated for the period of 1993-2005. In comparison with CH4, N2O and O3 measured by the ILAS and POAM II/III satellite instruments, the breakup days are well consistent with changes in the distribution of such tracers as well as their zonal standard deviations associated with the vortex structure breaking and irreversible mixing. The vortex breakup in the upper stratosphere occurs more or less a month prior to that in the middle and lower stratosphere while the stratospheric final warming events occurs simultaneously in the upper and lower stratosphere.",

            "abstract": "To date, the key drivers behind the recent observed increase in organic carbon (OC) concentrations in surface waters are still controversial. The lack of long-term monitoring data – over centuries and millennia – leaves us with an ambiguous understanding of the past trajectory of OC concentrations in surface waters, and inhibits a better mechanistic understanding of past and a reliable prediction of future changes in OC levels.\nBy using a paleolimnological approach, we reconstructed past lake-water total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in lakes across the boreal landscape of central Sweden. Reconstructions are based on a transfer function between visible near-infrared spectra of surface sediments and the corresponding TOC concentration in the water column. Potential drivers behind changes in TOC were determined by a multi-proxy analysis of one of the studied lake sediment records including organic and inorganic geochemistry as well as biological proxies (pollen, diatoms).\nOur results show a significant decrease in lake-water TOC beginning already ~550 years ago. This decline continued until the mid-20th century when TOC concentrations started to increase again. These dynamics in TOC coincide with changes in proxies indicating catchment disturbance by human activities. The chronology of these changes corresponds to the expansion and decline of a landscape-wide system of summer forest grazing and farming in central Sweden from the 15th century to the turn of the 20th century. Frequent grazing and exploitation of forests and mires reduce aboveground vegetation and physically disturb soils. This further affects the carbon cycling by enhancing carbon turnover, reducing the thickness of organic soils and consequently altering the transport of OC from the catchment to lakes.\nOur findings suggest that recent changes in lake-water TOC in Sweden are strongly associated with historical patterns in land use and not only on-going changes in climate or sulfur deposition.",

            "abstract": "Gridded datasets of Net Ecosystem Exchange derived from eddy covariance and remote sensing measurements provide a means of validating Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP, opposite of NEE) from terrestrial ecosystem models. While most forested regions in the U.S. are observed to be moderate to strong carbon sinks, models not including human or natural disturbances will tend to be more carbon neutral, which is expected of mature ecosystems. We have developed the Terrestrial Ecosystems Model Hydro version (TEM-Hydro) to include both human and natural disturbances to compare against gridded NEP datasets. Human disturbances are based on the Hurtt et al. (2006) land use transition dataset and include transient agricultural (crops and pasture) conversion and abandonment and timber harvest. We include natural disturbances of storms and fires based on stochastic return intervals. Tropical storms and hurricane return intervals are based on Zheng et al. (2009) and occur only along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Fire return intervals are based on LANDFIRE Rapid Assessment Vegetation Models and vegetation types from the Hurtt dataset.\nWe are running three experiments with TEM-Hydro from 1700-2011 for the conterminous U.S.: potential vegetation (POT), human disturbance only (agriculture and timber harvest, LULC), and human plus natural disturbance (agriculture, timber harvest, storms, and fire, DISTURB). The goal is to compare our NEP values to those obtained by FLUXNET-MTE (Jung et al. 2009) from 1982-2008 and ECMOD (Xiao et al., 2008) from 2000-2006 for different plant functional types (PFTs) within the conterminous U.S. Preliminary results show that, for the entire U.S., potential vegetation yields an NEP of 10.8 gCm-2yr-1 vs 128.1 gCm-2yr-1 for LULC and 89.8 gCm-2yr-1 for DISTURB from 1982-2008. The effect of regrowth following agricultural and timber harvest disturbance therefore contributes substantially to the present-day carbon sink, while stochastic storms and fires have a negative effect on NEP. Even though the current NEP reflects the carbon uptake from regrowth, a full carbon accounting would also include the carbon released to the atmosphere during disturbance or carbon lost to decomposition of agricultural or timber products",

            "abstract": "Ex situ remediation of sorbing contaminants in groundwater aquifers is especially difficult due to the tendency of sorbing contaminants to remain attached to the soil matrix. Consequently, in situ remediation, which typically involves injecting a treatment chemical into the aquifer to degrade the contaminant, is a more effective option. To enhance contaminant degradation during in situ remediation, a sequence of injections and extractions of clean water can be performed to increase the contact of treatment chemical and contaminant to enable more reaction. This technique is known as Engineered Injection and Extraction (EIE). In prior work, EIE was simulated for contaminants with varying sorption properties and reaction rates using two heuristically-developed sequences of injections and extractions. These EIE sequences achieved nearly complete contaminant degradation for weakly-sorbing contaminants with fast reaction rates; however, the sequences were much less effective for strongly-sorbing contaminants with slow reaction rates. In this work, we use multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to optimize the design of EIE sequences to determine sequences that achieve high amount of contaminant degradation for strongly-sorbing contaminants with slow reaction rates. We consider both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers.",

            "abstract": "The magnitude of stress in the continental lithosphere, particularly the lithospheric mantle, is highly uncertain and frequently debated, but is critical to understanding continental mechanics. Differential stress can be estimated using paleopiezometry, which is a relationship between dynamically recrystallized grainsize and flow stress. This relationship has been quantified experimentally for a wide range of earth materials, including olivine, quartz, plagioclase, calcite, and numerous metals. The empirical piezometer for olivine (Van der Wal et al., 1993) has been used to estimate stress magnitudes for mantle rocks from several regions worldwide. In contrast, piezometers for other minerals commonly recrystallized in mantle/lower crustal rocks, including orthopyroxene (OPX) and clinopyroxene, are poorly constrained. The two existing OPX piezometers are based on experimental studies and predict OPX grain sizes to be larger than olivine at high stresses. Observations from natural rocks, however, show the opposite relationship: OPX grainsizes are smaller than olivine at high stresses. This study explores the stress–grainsize relationship between dynamically recrystallized OPX and olivine in naturally-deformed peridotites derived from a wide range of pressure–temperature conditions. We measure OPX and olivine grainsizes in banded peridotites that appear to have recrystallized under identical stress conditions and are not mixed. Differential stress is estimated using the well constrained olivine piezometer. We establish a stress(σ)–grainsize(d) relationship for OPX (σ = 406.1d(-.52)) which predicts that recrystallized grains in OPX are smaller than olivine above ~25 MPa (~200 μm), and larger than olivine for stresses below this value. This piezometer can be used to estimate stress magnitudes in rocks in which OPX is one of the primary recrystallized phases, including granulites, pyroxenites and other mantle/lower crustal rocks in which olivine or plagioclase are unsuitable.",

            "abstract": "Exchange processes of energy and matter are the main drivers for the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. These processes depend on the heterogeneity of the land-surface pattern. To study the influence of heterogeneity following questions arise: Which aspects of heterogeneity are important for the atmosphere, and to what extend is the information about the heterogeneity transferred from the surface to higher air layers? To investigate these questions via numerical simulations, it is necessary to describe heterogeneous pattern with metrics and methods. Many indices have been developed which can be applied to any categorized pattern. This presentation gives an overview about metrics describing the main aspects of heterogeneity. The aspects are the information, connectivity, structure, contrast, and anisotropy of a pattern. In addition to this overview, some applications of these metrics are presented to illustrate their performance on both land-surface patterns and the response of the atmosphere to these patterns.",

            "abstract": "California’s commitment (Assembly Bill 32) to reduce total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 requires quantification of current GHG emissions. We present seasonal variation of California’s total CH4 emissions for summer 2013 – spring 2014, using data from a dozen sites covering urban and rural areas of California that include South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB), Central Valley, and San Francisco Bay Area. We apply a Bayesian inverse model to estimate CH4 emissions from discrete regions of California and source sectors by combining atmospheric measurements, upstream background, updated high-resolution prior emission maps developed for California, and predicted atmospheric transport from WRF-STILT. We quantify site-specific model-measurement uncertainties due to transport using simulated and observed meteorology, background estimated from oceanic and aircraft observations, and the prior emissions. In particular, we evaluate predicted transport variables in WRF with networks of surface and upper air observations. Preliminary inversion results during summer of 2013 suggest that state total CH4 emissions are 1.2 – 1.7 times higher than the current CARB inventory. Here, we extend and improve upon earlier analyses to provide a full seasonal cycle of CH4 emissions across all major urban and rural regions in California.",

            "abstract": "Since 2005, graduate students in the Brown University Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Studies have volunteered to teach science to second-grade students at Vartan Gregorian Elementary School in Providence, RI. Initially developed to bring science into classrooms where it was not explicitly included in the curriculum, the graduate student-run program today incorporates the Providence Public Schools Grade 2 science curriculum into weekly, interactive sessions that engage the students in hypothesis-driven science. We will describe the program structure, its integration into the Providence Public Schools curriculum, and 3 example lessons relevant to geology.\nLessons are structured to develop the students’ ability to share and incorporate others’ ideas through written and oral communication. The volunteers explain the basics of the topic and engage the students with introductory questions. The students use this knowledge to develop a hypothesis about the upcoming experiment, recording it in their “Science Notebooks.” The students record their observations during the demonstration and discuss the results as a group. The process culminates in the students using their own words to summarize what they learned.\nActivities of particular interest to educators in geoscience are called “Volcanoes!”, “The “Liquid Race,” and “Phases of the Moon.” The “Volcanoes!” lesson explores explosive vs. effusive volcanism using two simulated volcanoes: one explosive, using Mentos and Diet Coke, and one effusive, using vinegar and baking soda (in model volcanoes that the students construct in teams). In “Liquid Race,” which explores viscosity and can be integrated into the “Volcanoes!” lesson, the students connect viscosity to flow speed by racing liquids down a ramp. “Phases of the Moon” teaches the students why the Moon has phases, using ball and stick models, and the terminology of the lunar phases using cream-filled cookies (e.g., Oreos).\nThese lessons, among many others, bring basic science to life in second grade classrooms. We will be happy to share their story and to make our lesson plans available to a broader audience.",

            "abstract": "The forests-savanna advancement/retraction process seems to play an important role in the global carbon cycle and in the climate-vegetation balance maintenance in the Amazon. To contribute with long term carbon dynamics and assess effectiveness of a protected area in reduce carbon emissions in Brazilian Amazon transitional areas, variations in forest-savanna mosaics biomass and carbon stock within Maraca Ecological Station (MES), Roraima/Brazil, and its outskirts non-protected areas were compared. Composite surface soil samples and indirect methods based on regression models were used to estimate aboveground tree biomass accumulation and assess vegetation and soil carbon stock along eleven 0.6 ha transects perpendicular to the forest-savanna limits. Aboveground biomass and carbon accumulation were influenced by vegetation structure, showing higher values within protected area, with great contribution of trees above 40 cm in diameter. In the savanna environments of protected areas, a higher tree density and carbon stock up to 30 m from the border confirmed a forest encroachment. This pointed that MES acts as carbon sink, even under variations in soil fertility gradient, with a potential increase of the total carbon stock from 9 to 150 Mg C ha-1. Under 20 years of fire and disturbance management, the results indicated the effectiveness of this protected area to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate greenhouse and climate change effects in a forest-savanna transitional area in Brazilian Northern Amazon. The contribution of this study in understanding rates and reasons for biomass and carbon variation, under different management strategies, should be considered the first approximation to assist policies of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) from underresearched Amazonian ecotone; despite further efforts in this direction are still needed.

            "abstract": "Improved spatial representation of within-burn heterogeneity after wildfires is paramount to effective land management decisions and more accurate fire emissions estimates. In this work, we demonstrate feasibility and efficacy of airborne imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral imagery) for quantifying wildfire burn severity, using kernel based image analysis techniques. Two different airborne hyperspectral datasets, acquired over the 2011 Canyon and 2013 Rim fire in California using the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) sensor, were used in this study. The Rim Fire, covering parts of the Yosemite National Park started on August 17, 2013, and was the third largest fire in California’s history. Canyon Fire occurred in the Tehachapi mountains, and started on September 4, 2011. In addition to post-fire data for both fires, half of the Rim fire was also covered with pre-fire images. Fire severity was measured in the field using Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI). The field data was utilized to train and validate our models, wherein the trained models, in conjunction with imaging spectroscopy data were used for GeoCBI estimation wide geographical regions. This work presents an approach for using remotely sensed imagery combined with GeoCBI field data to map fire scars based on a non-linear (kernel based) epsilon-Support Vector Regression (e-SVR), which was used to learn the relationship between spectra and GeoCBI in a kernel-induced feature space. Classification of healthy vegetation versus fire-affected areas based on morphological multi-attribute profiles was also studied. The availability of pre- and post-fire imaging spectroscopy data over the Rim Fire provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of bi-temporal imaging spectroscopy for assessing post-fire effects. This type of data is currently constrained because of limited airborne acquisitions before a fire, but will become widespread with future spaceborne sensors such as those on the planned NASA HyspIRI mission.",

            "abstract": "Simple kinetic equations for runaway electrons inside the high electric field regions of thunderstorms have been developed. These equations are useful in modeling the energy distribution of energetic electrons responsible for Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs). To describe the shapes of the electron energy spectra for a wide range of electric field strengths, the diffusion term responsible for random deviation of electron energy ionization loss from the mean value is added to the kinetic equation. Previous work has shown that the runaway electron energy spectrum can be described by a power-law when the electric field strength is just above threshold. However, the runaway electron spectrum only approaches tens of MeV before being cut off by energy losses from bremsstrahlung emissions, and thus does not offer an explanation of the photon spectrum observed by the AGILE satellite [Tavani et al., 2011]. We find that the diffusion in energy space helps maintain an exponential energy spectrum for electric fields that approach the runaway electron threshold field and allows the possibility for electrons to be accelerated to energies exceeding the electrostatic potential (minus the average drag force) inside the thundercloud. Since this diffusion process depends on the applied electric field strength, we may also gain insight into the typical values that would be found inside thunderclouds. In this presentation, we first show the effects of diffusion on the relativistic runaway electron energy spectrum for several values of the electric field strength. We then demonstrate an analytical method for solving the momentum diffusion-convection transport equation for relativistic runaway electrons. Finally, we will compare the results of this method to our Monte Carlo simulation developed at Florida Institute of Technology [Dwyer, 2003, 2004, 2007]. Using these detailed simulation results, the diffusion coefficients in momentum space for relativistic runaway electron avalanches in air are found for the range of electric field strengths applicable to thunderstorm environments.",

IU stations (CASY, DAV, KIP, KONO, WCI), IC stations (SSE, XAN), and II stations (ALE, DGAR, RPN) were analyzed using a scaling analysis based on data-synthetic comparisons, evaluation of noise levels, assessment of inter-sensor coherence, and polarization analysis. These reports (available from\nhttp://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~ekstrom/Projects/WQC.html\n) highlighted a number of significant problems in GSN data quality, including the frequency-dependent loss of gain in the STS-1 seismometer (Ekström et al., 2006) that has been attributed to the presence of humidity in the electronics, cables, and connectors (Yuki and Ishihara, 2002; Hutt and Ringler, 2011).\nThe reports from the WQC spurred a number of changes in the operation of the GSN, including the adoption of the policy of annual calibrations and the development of new tools and metrics to monitor, evaluate, and communicate data quality. In parallel, the USGS’ Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL) and UCSD’s Project IDA worked with the IRIS Consortium to upgrade GSN stations with new data acquisition systems, to refurbish the STS-1 seismometers with new electronics, and to expand the deployment of secondary broadband sensors.\nWe revisit the 2010 reports, using the tools of the WQC as well as a number of newly developed tools such as the USGS’ Data Quality Analyzer and IRIS’ MUSTANG, and provide an update on GSN data quality. Our initial focus is on CASY and KIP, the first two stations reviewed by the WQC.

            "abstract": "Spaceborne lidar missions, such as ICESat, provide unique observations of forest vertical structure globally. To date several global forest height maps have been produced using GLAS data on board of ICESat. However, 3D information from the full waveform lidar has not been fully utilized, which can further be used to derive highly accurate LAI and VFP products. Here we present the first near-continental LAI and VFP product from GLAS data based on a geometric and radiative transfer model. We first retrived LAI and VFP from ~1.1 million waveforms using a developed recursive method and analyzed its distribution at ecoregion level over Contiguous United States (CONUS). We then assessed its accuracy with different existing remote sensing LAI products. Finally, we explored its relationship with factors from different environmental gradients. Our product exhibits a very good agreement with LAI data sets from airborne lidar data across major forest types (r2 = 0.67, bias = -0.13, and RMSD = 0.75). It also shows a fair correspondence with a 30 m Landsat LAI map produced over CONUS (r2 = 0.18, bias = 0.33, and RMSD = 1.99), reflecting fundamental differences in their retrieval methodologies. In particular, Landsat appears to saturate relative to ICESat at a value of about LAI = 4 or over high forest cover (> 70%). Derived LAI and VFP products also exhibit strong correspondence with environmental factors (e.g. elevation and annual precipitation). Results from this study highlight the capability of spaceborne waveform lidar in measuring vertical foliage structural parameters at continental to global scales and should help improve our understanding of the role vertical canopy structure plays in terrestrial ecosystem dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Observed electron velocity distributions in the solar wind exhibit a variety of non-thermal features which deviate from thermal equilibrium, in the form of temperature anisotropies, suprathermal tails, and field aligned beams. The state close to thermal equilibrium and its departure from it provides a source for spontaneous emissions of electromagnetic fluctuations as for example the whistler cyclotron waves at electron scales. Here we present a comparative analysis of these fluctuations based upon anisotropic plasma modeled with thermal and non-thermal particle distributions. The analysis presented here considers the second-order theory of fluctuations and the dispersion relation of weakly transverse fluctuations, with wave vectors parallel to the uniform background magnetic field, in a finite temperature isotropic thermal bi-Maxwellian and non-thermal Tsallis-kappa-like magnetized electron–proton plasma. Dispersion analysis and stability thresholds are derived for these non-thermal distributions and compared with similar results obtained from PIC simulations using plasma and field parameters relevant to the solar wind environments. Our results indicate that there is a strong dependence between the shape of the velocity distribution function and the topological regions in the frequency-wave number plane in which the spontaneous fluctuations emerge. In the case of non-thermal plasmas there is an enhancement of the fluctuations level due to the effective higher-temperature effects and the excess of suprathermal particles. This feature may be used proxy to identify the nature of electron populations in space plasmas when high resolution particle instruments are not available.",

            "abstract": "Layers of strong geologic contrast within the vadose zone can control recharge and contaminant transport to underlying aquifers. Above the eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer, multiple sedimentary interbeds are interspersed between fractured basalt. These interbeds have a variety of thicknesses and hydraulic properties, and can impede water flow, which allows perched water to collect on the interbeds. The Large-Scale Infiltration Test (LSIT) of 1994 at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) maintained a circular pond, 200 meters in diameter, at a constant head for 20 days. Monitoring wells were arranged in circles of different radii around and within the pond, and perched water levels on a major sedimentary interbed, 55 meters below ground surface, were measured over time. Data showed that water formed a mound on the interbed before seeping through the interbed. Such behavior is consistent with a hypothesis of rapid flow through the fractured basalt being impeded by the sedimentary interbed.\nIn 2014, the USGS, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Energy, used a modified version of a Hantush (1967) equation to model the time-dependent perched water table heights from the LSIT as a function of radial distance from the pond center. The modeled volume change between time-steps and the known inflows to the pond were used in a mass balance to estimate the time-varying volume of water seeping through the interbed. This volume of water, the height of perched water, and the interbed thickness were used in Darcy’s Law to estimate the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the impeding interbed. Results indicate a slightly higher effective conductivity than laboratory measurements of small core samples taken from the interbed, reflecting the presence of fractures or other heterogeneities that facilitate field-scale flow through the interbed. Applied to other locations, this method can improve estimates of recharge and contaminant transport to underlying aquifers.",

            "abstract": "This experimental study examines the effects of clay colloids on the transport of viruses in variably saturated porous media. All cotransport experiments were conducted in both saturated and partially saturated columns packed with glass beads, using bacteriophages MS2 and ΦΧ174 as model viruses, and kaolinite (KGa-1b) and montmorillonite (STx-1b) as model clay colloids. The various experimental collision efficiencies were determined using the classical colloid ﬁltration theory. The experimental data indicated that the mass recovery of viruses and clay colloids decreased as the water saturation decreased. Temporal moments of the various breakthrough concentrations collected, suggested that the presence of clays significantly influenced virus transport and irreversible deposition onto glass beads. The mass recovery of both viruses, based on total effluent virus concentrations, was shown to reduce in the presence of suspended clay particles. Furthermore, the transport of suspended virus and clay-virus particles was retarded, compared to the conservative tracer. Under unsaturated conditions both clay particles hindered the transport of the two viruses considered in this work. Moreover, the surface properties of viruses, clays and glass beads were employed for the construction of classical DLVO and capillary potential energy profiles, and the results suggested that capillary forces play a significant role on colloid retention. It was estimated that the capillary potential energy of MS2 is lower than that of ΦΧ174, and the capillary potential energy ofKGa-1b is lower than that of STx-1b, assuming that the protrusion distance through the water filmis the same for each pair of particles. Moreover, the capillary potential energy is several orders of magnitude greater than the DLVO energy potential.\nFigure 1Schematic illustration of the various concentrations involved in the cotransport experiments for: (a) saturated and (b) unsaturated porous media.",

In this study we propose a new seismic observation system to record a P-wave first-motion polarity. The system consists of a seismometer with a vertical component that price is approximately ten thousand yen and a commercially-supplied IC recorder that price is approximately ten thousand yen.\nIn this study, we conducted a temporary observation of micro-earthquakes for one month from August to September 2012 in the northern Ibaraki prefecture where many normal-faulting type events occur, and we addressed the effectiveness of the seismic observation system. The 29 seismic stations were deployed along a road so that it allows a deployment of many stations for a short time. After collecting the temporary stations, based on the P-wave first motion polarity, we estimated the focal-mechanisms by using HASH program (Hardebeck and Shearer, 2002). As a result, we obtain the 87 focal-mechanisms for micro-earthquakes occurred in the study area.\nTo test the accuracy of the focal mechanisms obtained in this study, we compared those with focal-mechanisms determined by Earthquake Research Institute, The University of Tokyo (ERI) temporary stations. We compared focal-mechanisms determined by ERI and Hi-net stations and focal-mechanisms determined by using IC recorder and Hi-net stations. We compare P axis and T axis for focal-mechanisms determined by ERI and Hi-net stations and determined by using IC recorder and Hi-net stations. As a result, nothing is difference of accuracy about focal-mechanisms between determined by ERI and Hi-net stations and determined by using IC recorder and Hi-net stations, because of P axis T axis has almost same distribution on the focal sphere. We conclude that focal mechanisms determined by using IC recorder stations has almost same accuracy as those determined by a traditional three component seismometer.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake was a huge interplate earthquake, which posed various issues against our previous perceptions on the subduction process. One of the unprecedented ideas is the acceleration of the subducting plate after the earthquake suggested by Heki and Mitsui (2013). They expect that temporal loss of interplate coupling following a huge interplate earthquake will cause acceleration in subducting rate; Onshore GPS observations after the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake also support this hypothesis. However, this is an indirect evidence of the acceleration, and hence direct geodetic evidence is needed to examine this hypothesis. Here, we have challenged to directly detect the subducting rate of the Pacific plate using GPS/Acoustic technique. We show the displacement rate of the site on the Pacific plate, where four times of surveys have been conducted for 1.5 years during Sept., 2012 – Mar., 2014. In each survey, we determine the precise locations of the center of the transponder array. The displacement rate is estimated from the linear regression of time-series of the array positions at four campaigns. This shows clear northwestward movement amount to 17.2±4.3 cm/yr relative to the North American plate. This rate is roughly twice as fast as the global steady motion of 8.3 cm/yr given in MORVAL. However, the observed fast movement can be interpreted not only as the acceleration of the subduction but also as the effect of viscoelastic responses that relax the coseismic elastic deformation. At this moment, we cannot quantitatively distinguish the two interpretations above. According to Heki and Mitsui (2013), the acceleration propagates southern Kuril area. This region would show low effect of viscoelastic relaxation. So, if seafloor observation in this region is conducted, it may reveal the presence or absence of the acceleration. In this presentation, we will show forthcoming seafloor observation data planned to be obtained on this September and discuss on this issue in detail.",

Seamlessly integrating disparate components into scalable, performant architecture requires sound engineering craftsmanship and can often result in increased cost efficiency and accelerated capabilities if software teams focus their creativity on the edges of the problem space. ScienceBase is part of the U.S. Geological Survey scientific cyberinfrastructure, providing data and information management, distribution services, and analysis capabilities in a way that strives to follow this pattern.\nScienceBase leverages open source NoSQL and relational databases, search indexing technology, spatial service engines, numerous libraries, and one proprietary but necessary software component in its architecture. The primary engineering focus is cohesive component interaction, including construction of a seamless Application Programming Interface (API) across all elements. The API allows researchers and software developers alike to leverage the infrastructure in unique, creative ways. Scaling the ScienceBase architecture and core API with increasing data volume (more databases) and complexity (integrated science problems) is a primary challenge addressed by judicious use of custom development in the component architecture.\nOther data management and informatics activities in the earth sciences have independently resolved to a similar design of reusing and building upon established technology and are working through similar issues for managing and developing information (e.g., U.S. Geoscience Information Network; NASA’s Earth Observing System Clearing House; GSToRE at the University of New Mexico). Recent discussions facilitated through the Earth Science Information Partners are exploring potential avenues to exploit the implicit relationships between similar projects for explicit gains in our ability to more rapidly advance global scientific cyberinfrastructure.",

            "abstract": "The Southern Ocean enhanced iron fertilization induced primary productivity can account only for ~40 ppm out of the total 80-100 ppm change in atmospheric CO2 during the last glacial-interglacial transition. Additional mechanism or regions with increased glacial productivity have to be identified to account for the remaining 40-60 ppm change in atmospheric CO2. The Arabian Sea is one of the most productive tropical regions at present. Even though a majority of the past productivity records from the Arabian Sea suggest reduced primary production during the glacial period, contrasting results have been obtained from the eastern Arabian Sea, suggesting a possible role of this region in controlling glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 changes. Here we reconstruct paleo-productivity changes from the eastern Arabian Sea during the past ~32 kyr, from foraminiferal and geochemical studies on a gravity core (SK 237 GC04).\nWe infer that the productivity in the southeastern Arabian Sea was high during the MIS3 with well oxygenated waters. An abrupt decrease in productivity is inferred during early deglaciation and it coincides with Heinrich event (HS-1), suggesting a close relationship between monsoon in the eastern Arabian Sea and the climatic change in North Atlantic. A synchronous productivity collapse in the SEAS during global depleted δ13C event, suggests that the productivity collapse was partially responsible for the depleted δ13C during HS-1. The high glacial productivity as noted in Malabar core as well as a few other cores collected from similar water depths is not noticed in all the cores collected from the southeastern Arabian Sea. It suggests that though the productivity was higher in this region during glacial times but the overall resultant carbon sequestration was confined only to a restricted zone and might not be large enough to substantially alter atmospheric CO2. The productivity was also high during the early Holocene monsoon optimum. A close correspondence between productivity changes and ice-volume corrected δ18O (δ18Osw(iv corr.)), during several intervals in the core, suggests that productivity changes in this region were partially driven by monsoon.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of detrital zircon (DZ) in sedimentary rocks has become a fundamental component of many provenance studies in recent years. In addition to providing information about sediment source regions, DZ analyses help to constrain the maximum depositional age (MDA) of a sample. This is especially informative for sedimentary successions in which other age constraints are limited (e.g., few fossils or ashes). However, this method relies on hefty assumptions about sediment source areas, sediment routing systems, and the adequate representation of coeval volcanic source areas within a sample.\nUpper Cretaceous strata in the Magallanes-Austral retroforeland basin of southern Patagonia record a ~34 million-year history of arc development and retroforeland subsidence. The ~6 km-thick siliciclastic package that fills the foredeep is an upward-shoaling, conformable succession of deep-marine, slope, and shelf deposits sourced primarily from the Andean arc. Deep marine shale units contain abundant ashes that corroborate MDAs established in coeval sandy facies, suggesting continued interconnectivity between the active arc and deep basin. Ashes are rarer in younger, shallow marine to terrestrial facies, but fossil data are abundant and diverse.\nThis study compares DZ data and rich floral/faunal fossil assemblages from fluviodeltaic strata of the Upper Cretaceous Dorotea Formation to determine the reliability of DZ MDAs. DZ data reveal an upward-younging trend within delta plain facies, as well as southward-younging of delta-front clinoforms. DZ MDAs are used to calculate first-order deltaic aggradation and progradation rates, with initial results suggesting that progradation rates were up to an order of magnitude higher than aggradation rates. These results illustrate a progressive loss of accommodation in the northern part of the basin, potentially linked to coeval thrust-front advance.",

To address it, this study carried out a total of 92 simulations and investigated the sensitivity of TC simulation to 24 physical parameters that control the deep convection, shallow convection, turbulence, cloud microphysics and cloud macrophysics processes in Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5). The Reed-Jablonowski TC test case is utilized and run at horizontal resolution of 0.5°×0.5° with 30 vertical levels. The sensitivity is assessed by the uncertainty each parameter exerts on simulated TC while perturbing it from its minimum to maximum with other 23 parameters set to their default value. The uncertainty is characterized by changes on simulated TC intensity (measured by absolute maximum wind speed at 100 m above surface), precipitation rate, shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCF), longwave cloud radiative forcing (LWCF), cloud liquid water path (LWP) and cloud ice water path (IWP), the latter five of which are quantified by their area-weighted value over the tropical cyclone region. Both the relative importance among these 24 physical parameters on TC simulation and the response function describing how they affect the six TC characteristics are quantified. It is found that the simulated TC intensity is most sensitive to the parcel fractional mass entrainment rate in Zhang-McFarlane (ZM) deep convection scheme. Decreasing this parameter enables a change from tropical depression to Category-4 storm. In contrast, other 23 physical parameters cause intensity uncertainty within 10 m/s. The precipitation rate, SWCF, LWP and IWP are also found to receive major impact from parameters in ZM deep convection scheme while the LWCF is dominated by parameters both in ZM deep convection and cloud microphysics scheme. The tunable parameters in University of Washington (UW) moist turbulence scheme, UW shallow convection scheme and cloud macrophysics are found to generally exert minor impact on TC simulation in CAM5. This study sheds light on improving the TC representation in AGCMs by tuning the physical parameters.",

Stacked with harmonic weighting, receiver functions from permanent ocean-island stations display evidence of strong and distinct anisotropy parameters in the underlying crust and in an underplated layer. We conduct analysis for eleven IRIS-GSN stations in the Pacific Ocean, with 211 to 774 seismic events at each station. We observe the prevalence of two-lobed RF amplitude variations with back-azimuth, consistent with tilted-axis anisotropy. With the assumption of a slow-axis hexagonal symmetry, we observe anisotropies in the underlying crust and under-plated crust that are oppositely oriented. Synthetic modeling of representative stations indicate that the strength of anisotropy ~5-10%. The strike of the inferred symmetry axis tends to align with plate motion, with some scatter. At stations in the northwest Pacific i.e. KWAJ, TARA, and WAKE, the symmetry axis aligns with past plate motion. The anisotropy closest to the present-day Hawaiian hotspot, beneath station POHA, aligns almost orthogonal to plate spreading. We attribute the crustal anisotropy to the preferred alignment of dike structures that transported asthenospheric magma toward the seafloor volcanic edifice. Our results argue that the thermal-plume origin for ocean islands must be supplemented by tectonic-stress heterogeneities that allow magma to penetrate the lithosphere via fractures. Magma-transport fractures should align normal to the least-compressive direction, which models predict should align approximately coeval to plate motion.",

            "abstract": "Glacial pCO2 levels were lower than interglacial ones and the Deep Ocean is a strong candidate for storing the excess interglacial CO2. There are two main hypotheses about the glacial storage of atmospheric CO2 in the Deep Ocean and subsequent deglacial outgas/release of CO2 to the atmosphere: i) CO2 was stored in the Southern Ocean and was ventilated through the Antarctic Intermediate (AAIW) and Equatorial Intermediate Waters (EqIW); ii) CO2 was stored in the Deep Pacific and was ventilated through other intermediate waters. A mélange of all these intermediate waters is found in the western equatorial Pacific above the Pacific Deep Water (PDW) converting the region in an ideal setting to investigate these hypotheses.\nDuring RV Sonne Expedition SO228, sea water samples and sediment cores were retrieved off Mindanao and Papua New Guinea at various water depths. Here we present hydrographic and sedimentary data from key locations. CTD temperature, salinity and oxygen as well as seawater δ13C, δ18O and δD from various stations enable to study the modern oceanography in the region. The data allows the identification of various types of intermediate and deep waters and a characterization of water properties that can be used to study these water masses back in time using the sediment cores. The paleoceanographic study will focus on the last 25 kyrs and use benthic stable isotopes and paired planktonic-benthic foraminiferal radiocarbon measurements on two sediment cores off Mindanao at 404 and 848 m water depth and four cores off Papua New Guinea at 845, 1365, 1887 and 2210 m water depth. Preliminary radiocarbon-based age models indicate varying sedimentation rates from 2 to 30 cm/ka for the cores, higher off Mindanao than off Papua New Guinea. The benthic foraminiferal assemblage of the intermediate core at 845 m water depth provides initial indications of shifting water properties at intermediate levels, potentially connected to the inflow of well versus poor ventilated waters, thus encouraging the contention that poorly ventilated deep waters may have been upwelled to these depths.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen is one of the major limiting nutrients in the ocean that prevents biological production and carbon export into the ocean interior, known as the biological carbon pump. The major source and sink processes for the oceanic fixed nitrogen budget, N fixation and denitrification, respectively, are sensitive to climate change. We force an Earth System Climate Model of intermediate complexity that includes three-dimensional modules ocean biogeochemistry and isotopes (MOBI) with boundary conditions from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM: ~21,000 years ago) and show that the nitrogen isotope results are qualitatively consistent with a global sedimentary database. Water column denitrification, which occurs in oxygen minimum zones, decreases by a factor of ~2 due to increased oxygen solubility in the glacial surface ocean that is ~2°C cooler on the global average. Sedimentary denitrification also decreases by a factor of ~2 due more exposed continental shelves from reduced sea level. We conduct experiments showing how N fixation responds in a “Redfield” biogeochemical model with constant elemental stoichiometry (N:P=16) and another “non-Redfield” experiment that includes a higher N:P quota for nitrogen fixers (N:P=40) and preferential remineralization of dissolved organic phosphorus relative to nitrogen (2 times faster). This “non-Redfield” experiment produces a more realistic distribution of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus in the modern ocean and stimulates additional N fixation due to less P limitation of N fixers. It predicts that the oceanic fixed nitrogen inventory during the LGM was ~9% larger than present, whereas the “Redfield” model predicts an increase of only ~5%. Our experiments suggest that the oceanic nitrogen inventory during the LGM was significantly larger than present-day and show the importance of including non-Redfield stoichiometry in marine biogeochemical models when estimating changes to N fixation.",

            "abstract": "About 8-year electron density profile (EDP) data from the COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 satellites radio occultation technique were used to investigate the additional stratification of the F2 (the so-called F3 layer) layer over the equatorial ionosphere on a global scale for both the bottomside and topside ionosphere. The F3 layer was recognized through the altitude differential profile featured by two maxima existing from the selected EDP profile. There were ~35, 000 (bottomside) and 24, 000 (topside) cases of F3 layer selected out of ~1.2 million occultation events at low and equatorial areas during the period of April 2006-Febraury 2014. The statistical results for the bottomside ionosphere resemble that reported in Zhao et al. [2011a], while in the topside the highest occurrence of F3 layer shows a 3-4 hours delay depending on the altitude range of the stratification. The magnetic latitude distribution shows different dependence with a tendency to form a single crest toward high altitude. Also the seasonal variation is weaker in the topside ionosphere compared to the bottomside one, especially in the high altitude. Then we build up an empirical model of the F3 layer occurrence using the bottomside statistics based on EOF decomposition as it gets the inherent characters inside the data set and converges quickly. The model well grasps the main features of the F3 occurrence e.g., the F3 occurrence’s sensitivity on the magnetic latitude. Further, in order to accommodate the ground observation a corrected factor was introduced. As F3 layer is an important phenomenon in the low latitude ionosphere, we have made an attempt to describe its feature with a consecutive function although future work needs to be done for an overall expression of this structure.",

            "abstract": "Gravity field measurements are perhaps the most numerous of the indirect observations relevant to the Moon’s internal structure. Multiple recent missions have mapped the global lunar gravity field, each one improving upon the resolution of the last. The details of the Moon’s deepest structure, including the parameters that define the lunar core, however, were still largely unaddressed by pre-GRAIL gravity measurements, which were not high enough resolution to resolve the tidal coefficients at a sufficient degree of accuracy. Current constraints on core size and state arise from other indirect measurements, including lunar laser ranging, magnetic induction studies, and analyses of elemental abundances in depth-derived mare basalts. These inferences vary widely, but when considered together with structure models derived from the seismic data gathered during the Apollo missions, a schematic of the lunar interior containing a partially molten deepest mantle layer overlying molten outer and solid inner core layers was obtained.\nSeismology provides the most direct constraints on the variables that govern the dynamic properties of the body. However, the GRAIL mission’s high-resolution measurements of the lunar gravity field are being used to constrain the interior structure of the Moon using a “crust to core” approach. GRAIL’s constraints on crustal thickness, mantle structure, core radius and stratification, and core state (solid vs. molten) therefore complement seismic investigations. This work focuses on expanding our knowledge of the Moon’s internal structure using joint gravity and seismic analyses, which will improve constraints on the deep lunar mantle and core.",

            "abstract": "Triplicated phases have already been successfully used to constrain seismic structure of the mantle, especially the discontinuities surrounding the transition zone. However, triplicated phase inversion greatly suffers from laterally heterogeneous mantle structure, which is also a common issue of geophysical inversion problems.\nTo solve this, we propose an I-cubed (isolation, inversion, integration) method to minimize the influence of lateral heterogeneity both in and out of the target region. The first step of this method is to isolate the effect of the lateral inhomogeneity. We deduct the influence of lateral inhomogeneity given by former tomography on the arrivals of the triplicated phases, which leaves a nearly 1-D question for further inversion. The second step is to do the traditional triplicated phase inversion to obtain a 1-D solution. At the final step, we add the deducted deviation from the 1-D earth model in the first step to the 1-D solution in the second step, and obtain a final velocity profile along an inclined line delineated by turning points of triplicated phases.This method is good at both stability and reliability because 1-D requirement of traditional inversion applying triplicated phases is assured, and the contamination of lateral heterogeneity is annihilated to great extent while useful information is kept. To test the robustness of I-cubed method, we apply it to synthetic records. It shows that the I-cubed method can derive better result than the traditional one. ",

            "abstract": "All of the mysterious albedo features on the Moon called “lunar swirls” are associated with magnetic anomalies, but not all magnetic anomalies are associated with lunar swirls [1]. It is often hypothesized that the albedo markings are tied to immature regolith on the surface, perhaps due to magnetic shielding of the solar wind and prevention of normal space weathering of the soil. Although interaction of the solar wind with the surface at swirls is indeed affected by the local magnetic field [2], this does not appear to result in immature soils on the surface. Calibrated spectra from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper [M3] (in image format) demonstrate that the high albedo markings for swirls are simply not consistent with immature regolith as is now understood from detailed analyses of lunar samples [eg 3]. However, M3 data show that the high albedo features of swirls are distinct and quite different from normal soils (in both the highlands and the mare). They allexhibit a flatter continuum across the near-infrared, but the actual band strength of ferrous minerals shows little (if any) deviation [4]. Recent analyses of magnetic field direction at swirls [5] mimic the observed albedo patterns (horizontal surface fields in bright areas, vertical surface fields in dark lanes). When coupled with the optical properties of magnetic separates of lunar soils [6] and our knowledge that the magnetic component of the soil results from space weathering [3,6], we propose a new and very simple explanation for these enigmatic albedo markings: the lunar swirls result from magnetic sorting of a well developed regolith. With time, normal gardening of the soil over a magnetic anomaly causes some of the dark magnetic component of the soil to be gradually removed from regions (high albedo areas) and accumulated in others (dark lanes). We are modeling predicted sorting rates using realistic rates of dust production. If this mechanism is tenable, only the origin of these magnetic anomalies (their magnitude, size, orientation, and depth) remains to be resolved.\nRefs: 1. Blewett, DT et al. 2011, JGR , 116. 2.

            "abstract": "Many studies analyse trends on sea level data with the underlying purpose of finding indications of a long-term change that could be interpreted as the signature of anthropogenic climate change. The identification of a long-term trend is a signal-to-noise problem where the natural variability (the ‘noise’) can mask the long-term trend (the ‘signal’). The signal-to-noise ratio depends on the magnitude of the long-term trend, on the magnitude of the natural variability and on the length of the record, as the climate noise is larger when averaged over short timescales and becomes smaller over longer averaging periods. In this paper we evaluate the time required to detect centennial sea level linear trends and accelerations at global and regional scales. Using model results and tide gauge observations we find that the averaged detection time for a centennial linear trend is 87.9, 76.0, 59.3, 40.3 and 25.2 years for trends of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mm/yr, respectively. However, in regions with large decadal variations like the Gulf Stream or the Circumpolar current these values can increase up to a 50%. The spatial pattern of the detection time for sea level accelerations is almost identical. The main difference is that the length of the records has to be about 40-60 years longer to detect an acceleration than to detect a linear trend leading to an equivalent change after 100 years. Finally we have used a new sea level reconstruction which provides a more accurate representation of interannual variability for the last century in order to estimate the detection time for global mean sea level trends and accelerations. Our results suggest that the signature of natural variability in a 30 year global mean sea level record would be less than 1 mm/yr. Therefore, at least 2.2 mm/yr of the recent sea level trend estimated by altimetry cannot be attributed to natural multidecadal variability.",

            "abstract": "The Hartford basin is an early Mesozoic, fault-bounded half-graben that formed during the breakup of Pangea. Along with other eastern North American rift basins, it has incurred significant post-rift deformation. Previous authors have identified three phases of deformation in the Hartford basin: WNW-ESE extension (rifting), NNE-SSW shortening (basin-parallel inversion), and E-W shortening (consistent with the current state of stress on the eastern North American margin). More recent work from other rift basins suggests a fourth phase of deformation possibly associated with massive volcanic activity shortly after cessation of rifting. Paleostress directions inferred from CAMP dike orientations and large-scale compressive structures in the southern rift basins reflect a NW-SE shortening phase that is seemingly absent from the Hartford, Newark, and Fundy basins of the central segment. If this compressional phase is consistent along volcanic passive margins, it should be recorded in the synrift deposits of the central basins. Our preliminary dataset shows a significant number of faults that are inconsistent with the previous three-phase model of WNW-ESE rifting, NNE-SSW compression, and E-W compression. A paleostress inversion of these incompatible faults reveals a distinct conjugate pattern of strike-slip faults that are indicative of NW-SE compression. This phase is consistent with the basin inversion seen in the southern rift basins. The presence of a NW-SE compressional stage is also consistent with the hypothesis that depicts massive volcanic upwelling that acts to shorten the upper crust after rifting. If this model is consistent along the eastern North American margin, it is likely applicable to volcanic margins around the world.",

            "abstract": "Texas is a highly water-stressed region due to rapid population growth and frequent droughts. Characterizing long-term drought is thus critical for sustainable water use planning. The Standardised Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) is a widely-used drought index as it considers both the supply and demand elements of the water balance and can be used to compare drought characteristics across locations. In this study, bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated (BCSD) temperature and precipitation projections from an ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) earth system models were used to develop the SPEI for 14 major cities spread across different climate divisions of Texas. The SPEI were computed for 12 and 24 month scales for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario for three time periods, 1950-1999 (historic), 2000-2049 (early), and 2050-2099 (latter). Both the SPEI-12 and SPEI-24 show a sharply-declining trend beginning in middle of the 21st century across all locations. The most severe droughts, characterized by the number of consecutive and overall months with SPEI ≤ 1.5, generally occur in the last two decades of the 21st century, particularly in semi-arid locations like El Paso and Laredo and appear to be controlled by potential evapotranspiration (PET). In addition, decreasing trends are observed in annual precipitation in major urban areas such as Austin, San Antonio and Houston. The results of the study highlight the need for proper management of water resources to match the trends in climate, economic and demographic changes.",

            "abstract": "The need for detailed, local scale information about the warming climate has led to the use of ever more complex and geographically realistic computer models as well as the use of regional models capable of capturing much finer details. Another class of methods for ascertaining localized data is known as statistical downscaling, which offers some advantages over regional models, especially in the realm of computational efficiency. Statistical downscaling can be described as the process of linking coarse resolution climate model output to that of fine resolution or even station-level data via statistical relationships with the purpose of correcting model biases at the local scale. The development and application of downscaling has given rise to a plethora of techniques which have been applied to many spatial scales and multiple climate variables. In this study two downscaling processes, bias-corrected statistical downscaling (BCSD) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA), are applied to minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation for the Northern Great Plains (NGP, 40 - 53°N and 95 - 120°W) region at both daily and monthly time steps. The abilities of the methods were tested by assessing their ability to recreate local variations in a set of both spatial and temporal climate metrics obtained through the analysis of 1/16 degree station data for the period 1950 to 2000. Model data for temperature, precipitation and a set of predictor variables were obtained from CMIP5 for 15 models. BCSD was applied using direct comparison and correction of the variable distributions via quadrant mapping. CCA was calibrated on the data for the period 1950 to 1980 using a series of model-based predictor variables screened for increasing skill, with the derived model being applied to the period 1980 to 2000 so as to verify that it could recreate the overall climate patterns and trends. As in previous studies done on other regions, it was found that the CCA method recreated local variations in temperature and precipitation with the highest overall fidelity to the observed data, though both methods captured temperature better than precipitation. This result helps to further refine downscaling methods and processes by narrowing the available methods to those with suitable skill.",

            "abstract": "Different from Taipei, the metropolitan Kaohsiung which is a coastal and industrial city has the major pollution sources from stationary sources such as coal-fired power plants, petrochemical facilities and steel plants, rather than mobile sources. This study was an attempt to conduct a comprehensive and systematical examination of the holiday effect, defined as the difference in air pollutant concentrations between holiday and non-holiday periods, over the Kaohsiung metropolitan area.\nWe documented evidence of a “holiday effect”, where concentrations of NOx, CO, NMHC, SO2 and PM10 were significantly different between holidays and non-holidays, in the Kaohsiung metropolitan area from daily surface measurements of seven air quality monitoring stations of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration during the Chinese New Year (CNY) and non-Chinese New Year (NCNY) periods of 1994-2010. Concentrations of the five pollutants were lower in the CNY than in the NCNY period, however, that of O3 was higher in the CNY than in the NCNY period and had no holiday effect. The exclusion of the bad air quality day (PSI > 100) and the Lantern Festival Day showed no significant effects on the holiday effects of air pollutants.\nShip transportation data of Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau showed a statistically significant difference in the CNY and NCNY period. This difference was consistent with those found in air pollutant concentrations of some industrial and general stations in coastal areas, implying the possible impact of traffic activity on the air quality of coastal areas. Holiday effects of air pollutants over the Taipei metropolitan area by Tan et al. (2009) are also compared.",

            "abstract": "In the early commissioning phase the three Swarm satellites were operated in a pearls on-a-string configuration making noon-midnight transpolar passes. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine the role of the gradient drift instability (GDI) on polar cap patches as they convect from day to night. The most rapid GDI growth times are caused by the kilometer-scale gradients, and these gradients appear as initial structuring that persists during the approximate 90 minutes it takes a patch to cross the polar cap. According to linear theory, the calculated GDI growth times range from 23 s to 147 s in this case study. The GDI growth rates estimated in this study are consistent with recent rocket measurements in the cusp auroral region where the structuring is likely to take place. These results will help constrain future modelling of polar cap patches.",

            "abstract": "We determine the hypocenters and focal mechanisms for earthquakes occurred in Kanto region, Japan between 1885 and 1923. In this period, available seismological data are limited because of sparse station distributions and low quality of data particularly in absolute timing. The number of reported phase arrival times and first-motion polarities of earthquakes are fewer by more than an order of magnitude compared to those from recent earthquakes. This makes it difficult to apply recently-developed techniques in determining source parameters for semi-historical earthquakes. Instead, we try to constrain source parameters by using the template matching technique with S-P times, first-motion polarities, and focal mechanisms of recent earthquakes. To quantify the degree of similarity for hypocentral locations and focal mechanisms, we use the root mean squares differences in S-P times and weighted misfit rate, respectively.\nFor example, root mean squares differences in five S-P times between the 1922 Uraga-channel earthquake and recent earthquakes are small in SW Chiba prefecture. The weighted misfit rates are small for earthquakes with strike-slip focal mechanisms in this region, resulting from the complete matching between fourteen first-motion polarities reported for the 1922 earthquake and radiation pattern for these earthquakes.\nThe number of target earthquakes (M≥6.5) are 30, for which only several S-P times and/or first-motion polarities are available for each earthquake. We use template S-P times of earthquakes from two catalogues; one form the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) with >100,000 events between 1923 and 2011, the other from the Metropolitan Seismic Observation Network (MeSO-net) with >3,000 events between 2008 and 2012. We compile >55,000 focal mechanisms from the five networks (i.e., the Kanto-Tokai observation network, Japan University network, F-net, JMA, and MeSO-net) as template.",

            "abstract": "Ocean salinity and temperature drive the thermohaline circulation and play a key role in the ocean-atmosphere coupling. With the availability of passive L-band (1.4 GHz) space-borne observations, Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) can be monitored globally at weekly time scales. SSS in the polar regions may be used to better constrain deep water formation, and to monitor changes due to freshening by the melting cryosphere. However, SSS remote sensing in the polar oceans is challenging because L-band radiometric observations are less sensitive to salinity in cold waters, SSS retrieval is less accurate for very rough seas and the presence of sea ice, icebergs and land in the radiometer field of view adds complexity to the retrieval process.\nAquarius is a NASA space-borne instrument operating three L-band radiometers. While Aquarius SSS retrievals are performed with a good accuracy in tropical and mid-latitude oceans, a thorough assessment has not been performed in the colder waters of the polar oceans. To assess Aquarius data at high latitudes, we compare them to in-situ measurements from ship cruises. In the northern hemisphere, cruises between Denmark and Greenland are used. In the south, we use cruises in the Austral Ocean between Tasmania and Antarctica. These quality-controlled shipborne measurements (more extensive than the Argo profiling floats which are rare at high latitudes) allow us to assess Aquarius SSS over long transects, repeated weekly or monthly, over the three year period during which Aquarius has been operating. Our results show that significant contamination of SSS retrievals by ice and land are observed, despite the correction for land contamination applied in the Aquarius retrieval algorithm. Such long track comparisons with ship data will help refine the future versions of Aquarius space-borne products. Nonetheless, excluding the data contaminated by land or ice, the agreement with ship data is good. Specifically, the standard deviation is ~0.3 – 0.6 psu on SSS averaged over about 10 days, and a low bias of the order of ~0.25 psu is identified. Moreover, a good agreement of local SSS patterns can be identified between both ship- and space-borne measurements, such as an increase in salinity signal south of Tasmania, or the strong salinity gradient between southeast and southwest Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s climate is inherently variable, but is currently changing at rates unprecedented in recent Earth history. Human activity plays a major role in this change and is projected to do so well into the future. This is the stance taken in Our Changing Climate, the brand new climate science ebook from the American Meteorological Society (AMS). Our Changing Climate investigates Earth’s climate system, explores humans’ impact on it, and identifies actions needed in response to climate change.\nReleased in August 2014, Our Changing Climate is the result of a year’s worth of intensive research and writing, incorporating the latest scientific understandings of Earth’s climate system from reports such as IPCC AR5 and the Third National Climate Assessment. To encourage additional exploration of climate science information, scientific literature, from which chapter content was derived, is cited at the conclusion of each chapter. In addition, Topic In Depth sections appear throughout each chapter and lead to more extensive information related to various topics. For example, a Topic In Depth in Chapter 11 describes the effect of climate extremes on ranching enterprises in Nebraska.\nClimate science is multi-disciplinary and therefore Our Changing Climate covers a breadth of topics. From understanding basic statistics and geospatial tools used to investigate Earth’s climate system to examining the psychological and financial reasons behind climate change denial, the AMS believes that a multi-disciplinary approach is the most effective way to increase climate literacy.\nOur Changing Climate is part of the AMS Climate Studies course which is intended for undergraduate-level students. Other course materials include an eInvestigations Manual and access to the RealTime Climate Portal, both of which provide weekly activities corresponding to that week’s chapter content. The RealTime Climate Portal also has links to climate data as well as societal interactions and climate policy websites to spur further interest. Faculty support materials are also provided. AMS Climate Studies has been licensed by 130 institutions since Fall 2010.\nOur Changing Climate reveals the impact that each of us has on the climate. With this understanding come choices and actions for a more sustainable future.",

            "abstract": "The sedimentation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the largest carbon (C) sink in the combined biosphere, atmosphere and ocean systems, and therefore influences the global C cycle. Coccolithophores are important contributors to CaCO3 sediment production, with contributions varying from 95% of the total marine CaCO3in the Cenozoic to 50% in the modern ocean. Consequently, physiological adaptations of coccolithophores′ calcification and photosynthesis to varying ambient conditions have implications for the C cycle.\nIt has been recently shown that under low CO2 concentrations (CO2 threshold of ~20 μM), coccolithophores reallocate HCO3- from the calcification vesicle to the chloroplast to cope with the decrease in CO2 available for photosynthesis. This adaptation was first observed in the late Miocene, as δ13C of the more sensitive larger coccoliths (with lower surface to volume ratios) became lighter due to the diminished use of HCO3- and increased use of CO2 as C source for calcification (Bolton and Stoll, 2013). Without further physiological adaptations to maintain calcification, reduced HCO3-availability for calcification may result in less calcified coccoliths (e.g. thinner and lighter).\nHere we report δ44/40Ca and δ13C measurements of cultured Emiliana huxleyi, Calcidiscus leptoporus and Gephyrocapsa oceanica grown under varying CO2 concentrations. We test the hypothesis whether Ca transport is influenced by coccolithophores to maintain calcification at low CO2 concentrations. It is possible that as the reallocation of HCO3- from the calcification vesicle to the chloroplast is increasing in response to low CO2 availability for photosynthesis, Ca transport and concentration would also increase to maintain high saturation at the site of calcification. We also present δ44/40Ca and δ13C from two coccolith size fractions from site 925 in the Western Equatorial Atlantic from the last ~11 Myr, to access how the Ca system of coccolithophores of different sizes may have responded to the decrease of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over this time interval.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of the AMOC is one of the key uncertainties of future climate projections. The latest IPCC report states that state-of-art climate models show an AMOC reduction over the 21st century of 20-30% for the RCP4.5 scenario and 36-44% for RCP8.5. Moreover, it is found to be very unlikely that the AMOC will undergo an abrupt transition or collapse in the 21stcentury. However, during the last decade a strong increase in mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet has been observed, a trend that is expected to continue into the future. This enhanced melt water input to the North Atlantic provides a major uncertainty in the evolution of the AMOC that has thus far not been taken into account in the RCP projections.\nBased on observations and high resolution regional climate modeling, we have constructed state-of-the-art projections of changes in the surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet for the period 2006-2300, both for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The developed methodology enables the inclusion of Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance changes in GCM climate change projections, either as a forcing or as a climate feedback through the coupling with upper air temperature changes. These surface mass balance projections form the basis of a major model-inter-comparison effort that allows us to assess i) the potential impact on the AMOC evolution of changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet over the course of the next three centuries, ii) assess the likelihood of an AMOC collapse and iii) investigate how a potential weakening of the AMOC could in turn influence the surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",

            "abstract": "The abrupt reconstruction of the outer radiation belt is often observed after substorms, and is believed to result from internal acceleration or external transport. The internal acceleration is thought to take place outside the plasmapause through Doppler shifted cyclotron resonance, or relativistic turning acceleration with whistler mode chorus waves. Electrons are thought to be accelerated by the waves when characteristic pitch angle distribution, hard energy spectrum and earthward gradient of phase space density are identified, but it seems that direct observational evidence for the energy transfer from waves to electrons has not been explicitly provided. The external transport is thought to take place when electrons are accelerated by strong electric fields. We have solved bounce-averaged drift transport equations under the electric and magnetic fields given by the recently developed global MHD simulation. We reproduced the sequence of a substorm, and determined onset as a sudden decrease in the AL index and a sudden increase in the ionospheric conductivity (a proxy of aurora). Near the onset, a strong electric field is formed in the inner magnetosphere in a longitudinally narrow region with a thickness of the order of earth radius (Re), which rapidly transported relativistic electrons inward. Simultaneously, keV electrons were also injected inward, which may become a seed of relativistic electrons. Temperature anisotropy becomes large near the leading edge of the injected hot electrons. As the plasmapause shrinks, the ratio of the plasma frequency to the cyclotron frequency becomes small outside the plasmapause, which may favor the growth of chorus waves. We estimated the evolution of the phase space density of electrons due to the interaction with chorus waves under the assumption that the wave amplitude is small. We will demonstrate the results of numerical experiments on the energy spectrum, pitch angle distribution and radial gradient of the phase space density of energetic electrons for the purpose of identifying physical processes responsible for the observable signatures and providing a guide to understanding the abrupt reconstruction of the outer radiation belt.",

            "abstract": "Mantle plumes are thought to be the cause of hot spots and intraplate volcanism. Despite their importance in geophysics, our understanding of their dynamics is limited; the classical head-and-tail structure known from flow-visualisation work has not been observed in tomographic studies; significant uncertainty remains about the degree to which plumes entrain ambient material from the mid-mantle; and there is no accepted definition of the plume geometry. This work addresses these problems by providing quantitative, 3D measurements of the velocity fields surrounding a thermal plume using stereoscopic Particle-Image Velocimetry, as well as local temperature measurements. The Rayleigh number range in the experiments is 0.7 - 2 x 106. The concept of the ‘vortex ring bubble’ is introduced, which provides a quantitative means of defining the geometry of the plume. This definition is shown to be theoretically and experimentally robust, and is easily applied to numerical and experimental data. The definition allows the degree of entrainment of ambient material to be quantified. It is also shown that this boundary definition separates the fluid that has risen from the heater from the ambient material that has gained heat through conduction. In the Earth’s mantle, the Prandtl number is very large (~1023) and the effects of conduction are negligible. Our new plume-geometry definition is shown to be a close approximation of the geometry of a plume that would occur in the mantle. This shape does not contain the classical head-and-tail structure - in contrast to the widespread conception of plumes - but in agreement with tomographic studies.",

We test the static stress change hypothesis empirically by considering all events of magnitude M≥ 2.1 and the uncertainties in location and focal mechanism in the focal mechanism catalog for Southern California between 1981 and 2010 (Yang et al., 2011).\nWe quantify:\nHow the waiting time between earthquakes (1) relates to the Coulomb stress change (2) induced by event Ei at the location of Ej;\nHow significant is the Coulomb Index (CI), fraction of source-receiver pairs with positive ∆CFS interactions, conditioned on time and amplitude of ∆CFS, compared to a mean-field CI derived from the time-independent structure of the fault network.\nWe approximate the waiting time distributions empirically by (3), which respectively consists of triggering and background rate components, tapered by an exponential term to model the finiteness of the catalog. We observe that K/(Bc^p ) (the ratio of the triggering to the background rates at t=0), the exponent p, and the Maxwell time τ all increase with |∆CFS| and are significantly larger for positive than for negative ∆CFS’s. τ varies between ~90 days and ~150 days (approximately 0.3 decades over 6 decades of variation in stress). It defines the time beyond which the memory of stress is overprinted by occurrence of other events. The CI values become significant above a threshold |∆CFS|. The mean-field CI is 52%, while the maximum observed CI value is ~60%. Correcting for the focal plane ambiguity, those values become respectively ~55% and ~72%. Lastly, the CI values decrease with the waiting time and converge to the mean-field CI value.\nThe increase of p-value and K/(Bc^p ) with |∆CFS| contradicts the prediction of stress shadow regions where seismicity is suppressed if ∆CFS<0. Our results rather suggest a spatially ubiquitous triggering process compatible with dynamic triggering, modulated by the sign and amplitude of the static stress field. We also conclude that static stress-based forecasts should not be performed over time scales much larger than τ, which is of the order of few hundred days.",

            "abstract": "After 10 years of ESA’s Mars Express orbiting the planet its High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) covered about 90 % of the surface in stereo and color with resolutions up to 10 m/pixel. Digital elevation models of up to 50 m grid spacing [1], generated from all suitable datasets of the stereo coverage, currently cover about 40 % of the surface [2]. The geomorphological analysis of surface features, observed by the HRSC indicate major surface modifications by endogenic and exogenic processes on all scales. Endogenic landforms (e.g., tectonic rifts, small basaltic shield volcanoes) were found to be very similar to their equivalents on Earth, suggesting that no unique processes are required to explain their formation. Volcanism may have been active up to the very recent past or even to the present, putting important constraints on thermal evolution models [e.g. 3]. The analysis of diverse landforms produced by aqueous processes revealed that surface water activity was likely episodic, but ranged in age from very ancient to very recent [e.g. 3]. Particularly important is prominent glaciation and periglacial features at several latitudes, including mountain glaciers [e.g. 3]. The identification of aqueous alteration minerals and their geological context has enabled a better understanding of paleoenvironmental conditions and pedogenetic processes [e.g. 4]. Dark dunes contain volcanic material and are evidence for the significantly dynamic surface environment, characterized by widespread erosion, transport, and redeposition [e.g. 3]. Since basically all geologic interpretations of extraterrestrial features require profound knowledge of the Earth as key reference, studies of terrestrial analogues are mandatory in planetary geology. Field work in Antarctica, Svalbard and Iceland [e.g. 5] provided a basis for the analysis of periglacial and volcanic processes, respectively.\n",

Lidar data (possibly in conjunction with optical imagery) can be used to segment the landscape into either individual trees or clusters of trees. Canopy characteristics (i.e. max, mean height) for a segmented tree are typically derived from a rasterized canopy height model (CHM) and subsequently used in a regression model to estimate biomass. The process of rasterizing the lidar point cloud into a CHM, however, reduces the amount information about the tree structure. Here, we compute statistics for each segmented tree from the raw lidar point cloud rather than a rasterized CHM. Working directly from the lidar point cloud enables a more accurate representation of the canopy structure. Biomass estimates from the point cloud method are compared against biomass estimates derived from a CHM for a Juniper savanna in New Mexico.",

            "abstract": "Existing experimental and numerical models of ash sedimentation from volcanic plumes consider aerodynamic properties of particles as a function of their shape, density and size. However, rather than individually, particles are often observed to settle through zones of high particle concentration associated with gravitational instabilities (e.g., particle-rich fingers) where sedimentation is controlled by the properties of the bulk down-flow of settling particles. In order to investigate the differences in the aerodynamic behaviour of ash particles when settling individually or in mass, we performed systematic large-scale ash settling experiments.\nNatural basaltic ash from Etna (Italy, sampled in July 2014) and trachytic, pumiceous ash from Laacher See (Germany, 12.900 y BP) was used as starting material. For Etna, we used particles in the classes 0-125 and 125-500 µm, for Laacher See, we used 40-90 and 500-1000 µm. For each class, we released 40-500 g of sample from heights of 2 to 5 m with different, controlled volumetric flow rates, in an unconstrained open space and at minimal air movement. All experiments were recorded with a high-speed camera at 2000 fps. A vertical laser sheet crossing the flow enhanced visibility of particles. After release, particles were observed to cluster, leading to locally enhanced fall velocities.\nHigh-speed imaging, manual and automatic tracking analyses are being used to provide full characterization of particle settling dynamics as a function of particle concentration in the flow, density and particle size. SEM analysis will provide particle shape characterization. The main results are i) measured settling velocities of individual particles increase with increasing particle concentration; ii) particle sorting during sedimentation is observed. This suggests that particle dispersion during fallout may be one reason explaining larger than theoretical depletion rates of fine particles from volcanic ash clouds.",

            "abstract": "Natural and human-induced disturbances have profound impacts on forest carbon dynamics, and may cause the greatest uncertainty in estimating forest carbon budgets. In North America, three countries show very different forest disturbance patterns: Canadian forests are dominated by natural disturbances such as wildfires and insect outbreaks; forests of Mexico are more affected by human-induced land disturbances such as land-use change; while US forests are equally affected by human-induced and natural disturbances. As human-induced disturbances are closely linked to socioeconomic factors, natural disturbances are usually viewed as a natural process in forests and have equilibrium impacts on forests over the long run. However, with climate change and related changes in natural disturbance regimes in terms of frequency, intensity and scale, there are now fundamental changes in the nature of the impact of natural disturbances on forest carbon dynamics and even greater uncertainty about forest carbon budgets and feedbacks to the atmosphere and climate. In this study, we synthesize disturbance information for North America based on existing remote-sensing products, ground-based observations and modeling studies, evaluating impacts of disturbances on forest carbon budgets that are relevant to disturbance types, scales, frequency and intensity. The work represents the initial step of a more ambitious project tackling this research challenge for North America that crosses a broad climate gradient and diverse socioeconomic entities. The goal is to ultimately improve the estimates of forest carbon budgets and their potential for climate mitigation under changing environments.",

            "abstract": "Most coastal sediments consist of complex mixtures of cohesionless sands, physically-cohesive clays and extra cellular polymeric substances (EPS) that impart biological cohesion. Yet, our ability to predict bedform dimensions in these substrates is reliant on predictions based exclusively on cohesionless sand. We present findings from the COHBED project – which explicitly examines how bedform dynamics are modified by natural cohesion.\nOur experimental results show that for ripples, height and length are inversely proportional to initial clay content and bedforms take longer to appear, with no ripples when clay content exceeds 18%. When clay is replaced by EPS the development time and time of first appearance of ripples both increase by two orders of magnitude, with no bedforms above 0.125% EPS. For dunes, height and length are also inversely proportional to initial substrate clay content, resulting in a transition from dunes to ripples normally associated with velocity decreases. Addition of low EPS concentrations into the substrate results in yet smaller bedforms at the same clay contents and at high EPS concentrations, biological cohesion supersedes all electrostatic bonding, and bedform size is no longer related to mud content. The contrast in physical and biological cohesion effects on bedform development result from the disparity between inter-particle electrostatic bonding of clay particles and EPS grain coating and strands that physically link sediments together, which effects winnowing rates as bedforms evolve.\nThese findings have wide ranging implications for bedform predictions in both modern and ancient environments. Coupling of biological and morphological processes not only requires an understanding of how bedform dimensions influence biota and habitat, but also how benthic species can modify bedform dimensions. Consideration of both aspects provides a means in which fluid dynamics, sediment transport and ecosystem energetics can be linked to yield improved predictions of morphological and habitat adjustment.",

Through data processing, properties of natural fractures such as orientation and width were studied and high probable permeable zones were mapped along the deep drilled to the depth of 2363m deep into crystalline basement rocks. In addition to logging data, seismic data were processed to build a reliable image of underground. Velocity analysis in high resolution multi-component walk-away VSP informed us about the elastic anisotropy in place. Study of the natural and induced fracture as well as elastic anisotropy in the seismic data, led us to better map stress regime around the well bore.

            "abstract": "A major problem with reanalyses has been the presence of jumps in the climatology associated with changes in the observing system. These jumps became especially obvious when satellites were first introduced in 1979. After 1979, however, during the “satellite era” jumps have continued to appear whenever a new observing system was introduced. To explore this problem, we develop and test new methodologies to minimize these reanalysis jumps in the reanalyses time series due to new observing systems.\nWe first study a state-of-the-art reanalysis, NASA’s Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA thereafter). Analysis increments from two 2-year analyses with SSM/I (referred to as MERRA) or without SSM/I (referred to as NoSSMI), are compared and their climatological differences are defined as correction terms. The correction terms are then introduced into the tendency equation of the forecast model, i.e., GEOS-5. The debiased reanalysis without SSM/I observations shows improvements in almost all fields, even in precipitation field that is generally considered to be uncertain on all time and space scales, but the correction is underestimated by about a factor of 2. We believe that this is because the correction terms defined here do not take into account the nonlinear interactions between the temperature and humidity fields observed by SSM/I, which would introduce accumulated errors during the 2-year experiment period. This deficiency can be corrected by doing the No-SSMI analysis using a MERRA background, as in the method of Danforth et al. (2007)\nWe test the new correction method in a simpler data assimilation system, SPEEDY-LETKF because with our limited computational resource it is infeasible to apply this method to the complex MERRA system. The new method defines the correction terms by calculating the difference of analysis increments from the following two analyses, 1) assimilating both RAOB and AIRS observations, named RaobAirs, and 2) assimilating only RAOB but with its background coming from RaobAirs at every 6-hour analysis cycle. This new method limits the growth of nonlinear interactions between variables observed by AIRS, and the results show that it is significantly more effective in minimizing reanalysis “jumps” than the method similar to that applied to MERRA system.",

            "abstract": "We present new ambient noise data that help constrain the shear strength of marine sediments on the continental slope north of Hudson Canyon on the U.S. Atlantic margin. Sediment shear strength is a key parameter in models of potentially tsunamigenic, submarine slope failures, but shear strength is difficult to measure in situ and is expected to evolve in time with changes in pore pressure. The ambient noise data were recorded by 11 short-period, ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophones deployed in a ~1 by 1.5 km array for ~6 months on the continental slope. These high frequency (~0.1 – 50 Hz), narrow-aperture data are expected to record noise propagating as interface waves and/or resonating in the upper ~500 m of sediment. Propagation of interface waves is controlled by the shear-wave velocity of the sediment, which we measure by calculating lag-times in cross-correlations of waveforms recorded by pairs of receivers. These measurements of shear-wave velocity will be used to constrain shear strength. The data also appear to record wind-generated noise resonating in layered sediment. We expect this resonance to also be sensitive to shear-wave velocity, and spectral analysis and modeling of harmonics may provide a second constraint on sediment shear strength. Both the correlogram- and spectral-based measurements can be made using hour- to day-long segments of data, enabling us to constrain temporal evolution of shear-wave velocity and potential forcing mechanisms (e.g., tidal and storm loading and submarine groundwater discharge) through the ~6 month deployment.",

The Picture Post is an environmental monitoring project a part of Digital Earth Watch, a citizen science initiative funded by NASA. Picture Post creates opportunities for educators and community members to take digital photos from octagonal platforms on posts registered as part of the Picture Post national network and then share these photos online. Penn State Brandywine joined the Picture Post project May 27, 2014, to begin a long-term monitoring program, starting with an environmental baseline of the campus landscape. Four post locations were selected on campus based upon projected major construction projects. Photos at each post are being taken by students on a weekly basis and uploaded to the Picture Post website. The campus community and beyond are also being encouraged to take their own photos to upload to the website. Instructional signage has been placed on each post, and a Penn State Brandywine Picture Post website (\nhttp://sites.psu.edu/picturepost/\n) has been created to explain the project and campus objectives in more detail. This project was started by a student as part of her undergraduate summer research experience and will continue to be managed by students in future semesters. With just a half-year of Picture Post photos, it is evident that there are documented changes in the environment because of construction and expected seasonal variations. The Picture Post photos have provided enough data for an initial undergraduate research project with a student analyzing and comparing the variations in the greenness factor of the photos with supplemental temperature and precipitation data. This project will continue to provide opportunities for citizen contributions to the network as well as data for student investigations of the changing campus environment.",

            "abstract": "High historical deforestation rates and a rapidly changing agricultural landscape are altering the energy and water balance of the eastern Amazon basin. The headwaters of Xingu River Basin (XB; Area: 510,000 km2) in the southeastern Amazon have seen some of the highest rates of deforestation, resulting in a decrease of average basin forest cover from about 90% in the 1970s to 75% in the 2000s. This study examines the water balance of the XB and attributes the influences of climate variations and deforestation using a diverse set of observational and modeling tools including; long-term observations of rainfall and discharge, satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (MODIS) and surface water storage (GRACE), and numerical model output (IBIS) of the set of hydrological components (evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and discharge). This water budget of the 2000s is first estimated by explicitly including deforestation over the 2001–2010 through integration of the modeled outputs with forest cover information from MODIS. Modeled outputs from the 1970s to the 2000s are then used to estimate the effects on the Xingu water budget due to climate variability, historical deforestation, or both. The decadal mean water balance components of the IBIS simulation over the 2001–2010, compares well with the satellite-derived and field-based observational estimates. Analysis of the individual components of change from the 1970s to the 2000s indicates that climate variability and land cover change have had opposite influences with climate effects masking the changes in water budget due to historical deforestation. Changes in land cover due to deforestation have decreased ET by ~3% and increased soil moisture by ~1% in XB, leading to increased discharge on average by 8% from the 1970s to the 2000s.",

            "abstract": "Dam removal is of growing interest for the management of sediment fluxes, morphological evolution and ecological restoration of rivers. If dam removal experiments are well documented for small streams, examples of lowland and large rivers are scarce. We present the morphological response of a relatively large lowland river (Vienne River, France) to a dam removal. The objective is to understand and quantify the morphological adaptation on a reach of 50 km and over 15 years associated with the dam removal and the presence of ancient sand pits located along the riverbed. This study is based on field data collected during 7 surveys performed between 1998 and 2013. This dataset focuses on bed geometry, sediment grain size, and bedload fluxes. It was combined with a 1D numerical model to assess flow dynamics and sediment transport before and after dam removal. Results show that dam removal triggered both regressive and progressive erosions and that discharges higher than 100 m3.s-1 were sufficient to erode the sandy sediments trapped by the dam whereas gravels were mobilised for discharges higher than 300 m3.s-1. Since 1999, large bedload sediment waves coming from upstream migrated downstream at an average celerity of 2.2 km.year-1 and were trapped by three ancient sand pits located downstream. Some of these pits constitute efficient sediment traps even 15 years after dam removal. As a result, between 2002 and 2013, the slope of the river bed adjusted gently and observed morphological processes were minors compared with the time period between 1998 and 2002.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost peatbanks along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) have become valuable high-resolution archives for late-Holocene climatic conditions recently. We recently observed and studied a few water-saturated peatlands that had formed in rocky depressions near Vernadsky Station and in mainland Antarctica (~ 65°S, 64°W). Remarkably, we seem to be the very first ones to analyze these systems for environmental reconstructions. The similarity between these peatlands and fens from the lower latitudes is striking, and the rarity of these systems along the WAP is intriguing.\nWe present a high-resolution, multi-proxy record of ecosystem development and paleoenvironmental conditions for Rasmussen peatland. The ecosystem is ~100 m2 in size and is characterized by a shallow water table depth at 7 cm below the surface. Surface vegetation is dominated by Calliergon spp., a wet-adapted moss found along the WAP. The studied moss deposit is 50 cm thick and has a high organic matter content (> 90% dry weight). Plant macrofossil analysis reveals that the peatland was initially a wet Sanionia spp. carpet and that a sharp transition to Calliergon spp. occurred about half way through the deposit. A distinct layer of highly decomposed organic matter was observed from 32 to 40 cm and could indicate a period of slowed peat formation, potentially due to dry conditions (enhanced peat decay) or perennial snow cover (limited plant growth). Biochemical decomposition indicators such as carbohydrate yields, acid:aldehyde ratios of lignin phenols, and hydroxyproline yields are being determined to better understand the extent of peat decay that has occurred at this site throughout its development, particularly to further address the nature of the observed stratigraphic changes. Preliminary results indicate that carbohydrate yields of the bottom half of the core are about 1/3 smaller than those of the top half, indicating substantial carbon loss due to decomposition. Overall, these peatlands may represent a transition from wet and thin Sanionia carpets to waterlogged peatlands, which would be an important ecosystem transformation along the WAP that could be promoted in a warmer and wetter climate.",

            "abstract": "Large wildfire events are increasingly recognized for their adverse effects on air quality and visibility, thus providing motivation for improving smoke emission estimates. The Rim Fire, one of the largest events in California’s history, produced a large smoke plume that was sampled by the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) DC-8 aircraft with a full suite of in-situ and remote sensing measurements on 26-27 August 2013. We developed an inversion methodology which uses the WRF-Chem modeling system to constrain hourly fire emissions, using as initial estimates the NASA Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED). This method differs from the commonly performed top-down estimates that constrain daily (or longer time scale) emissions. The inversion method is able to simultaneously improve the model fit to various SEAC4RS airborne measurements (e.g., organic aerosol, carbon monoxide (CO), aerosol extinction), ground based measurements (e.g., AERONET aerosol optical depth (AOD), CO), and satellite data (MODIS AOD) by modifying fire emissions and utilizing the information content of all these measurements. Preliminary results show that constrained emissions for a 6 day period following the largest fire growth are a factor 2-4 higher than the initial top-down estimates. Moreover, there is a tendency to increase nocturnal emissions by factors sometimes larger than 20, indicating that vigorous fire activity continued during the night. This deviation from a typical diurnal cycle is confirmed using geostationary satellite data. The constrained emissions also have a larger day-to-day variability than the initial emissions and correlate better to daily area burned estimates as observed by airborne infrared measurements (NIROPS). Experiments with the assimilation system show that performing the inversion using only satellite AOD data produces much smaller correction factors than when using all available data, suggesting that top-down emissions estimates for exceptional fire events could be underestimated by current inversion methods. The changes in fire emissions can significantly affect the fire impacts on surface air quality, aerosol loads and its effects on meteorology, highlighting the need of performing these studies.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, vast amounts of carbon isotopic data have been collected allowing the construction of the Phanerozoic δ13C curve in unprecedented detail. Our dataset comprises 8143 points spanning the last 541 m.y., with a mean spacing of 66 k.y. The average δ13C of Phanerozoic carbonate is 1 ‰ ± 2 ‰, in accordance with the canonical values measured in the past. However, the record also shows numerous, highly resolved, large (± 6 ‰) excursions whose magnitude declines through time, especially going into the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic. When the magnitude – distribution of the excursions is tabulated we find that it follows a power law: plotting the min-max differences vs. number of bins in which a particular value occurs reveals that the data fall on a semilogarithmic line with a slope of -0.23 and R2 = 0.99. The result is insensitive to outliers: smoothing the data with lowess, spline, Savitzky-Golay, and Butterworth filters yields similar results. The continuity from small variation to large perturbations, both positive and negative, suggests that, despite the numerous proposed causes for individual carbon isotopic evens, there is likely an underlying mechanism which governs the magnitude of δ13C response to perturbations. We suggest that a mechanism acting to amplify carbon cycle perturbations is the key to explaining the power-law distribution, and identify the anoxia-productivity feedback as the most likely candidate. Establishment of sulfidic conditions is accompanied by increased release of phosphate to the water column, which allows for further productivity, and thus acts as a destabilizing, positive, feedback. This feedback would act to increase carbon cycle swings irrespective of their proximal trigger. The decline in frequency of anoxic-sulfidic bottom waters in the world’s oceans, and potential disappearance in the Late Mesozoic-Cenozoic, may account for a reduction in the Earth system's gain and increase in its resilience.",

However, their impact on ozone and other oxidants, predominantly through bromine and iodine chemistry, have been shown through previous process studies. We discus here additions to the GEOS-Chem model, which already includes bromine chemistry, to provide an iodine simulation. We include oceanic emissions of iodinated hydrocarbon and inorganic iodine fluxes (HOI and I2) tied to both O3 deposition and sea surface iodide concentration. The chemistry scheme is based on the available kinetic literature and we include both dry and wet deposition. We evaluate the model against a range of observational constraints including IO measurements. We will discuss the global budget of iodine and its impact on ozone and oxidizing capacity and the impact of emission and kinetic uncertainties on these conclusions.",

            "abstract": "Since the launch of LRO in 2009, the CRaTER instrument has been mapping albedo protons (~100 MeV) from the Moon. These protons are produced by nuclear spallation, a consequence of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) bombardment of the lunar regolith. Just as spalled neutrons and gamma rays reveal elemental abundances in the lunar regolith, albedo protons may be a complimentary method for mapping compositional variations.\nWe presently find that the lunar maria have an average proton yield 0.9% ±0.3% higher than the average yield in the highlands; this is consistent with neutron data that is sensitive to the regolith’s average atomic weight.\nWe also see cases where two or more adjacent pixels (15° × 15°) have significantly anomalous yields above or below the mean. These include two high-yielding regions in the maria, and three low-yielding regions in the far-side highlands. Some of the regions could be artifacts of Poisson noise, but for completeness we consider possible effects from compositional anomalies in the lunar regolith, including pyroclastic flows, antipodes of fresh craters, and so-called \"red spots\". We also consider man-made landers and crash sites that may have brought elements not normally found in the lunar regolith.",

The flux tube is allowed to move both radially away from the Earth and azimuthally around the Earth. Ion species O+ and He+ are for the first time treated as simulation particles in a numerical model for the plasmasphere. The simulation particles are subjected to the parallel electric field, magnetic mirror force, gravity, centrifugal force and Coulomb collisions, as well as possible wave-particle interaction. The effects of ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling on the day-night evolution of the plasmasphere and the relative abundance of O+ and He+ are studied.

            "abstract": "We present a new seismic velocity model for the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Sicily (Southern Italy) and surrounding areas, obtained by local earthquake tomography. The Sicilian region represents a portion of the Apennine–Maghrebide fold-and-thrust belt developed in an area dominated by both the convergence between the European and Nubia plates and the extensional processes linked to the opening of the Tyrrhenian basin (Malinverno and Ryan, 1986; Faccenna et al., 1996). Four major seismogenic domains characterize the region: (I) the Southern Tyrrhenian E–W striking domain undergoing N–S compression; (II) the northern Sicily domain presenting extensional regimes that vary from N–S, to the west, to WNW–ESE to the east; (III) the mainland Sicily domain comprising the Etna area and showing a mainly transpressional regime; (IV) the Hyblean Foreland domain (southeastern Sicily) with primarily strike-slip deformation. To perform the tomographic inversion, we selected ca. 7100 earthquakes that have occurred between 1990 and 2012 in the depth range 0-100km. Data and recordings have been derived by the Italian recording networks (www.ingv.it). By using the LOTOS code (Koulakov, 2009), we computed the distribution of Vp, Vs, and the Vp/Vs ratio in the study area. In order to increase the detail of our analysis with respect to previous study carried out in the same sector, we tested several spacing for the inversion grid and performed synthetic tests to estimate a possible effect of noise on the resolution as well as the optimal values of inversion parameters. The obtained velocity models, jointly evaluated with the hypocenter distribution and geological information, give us new constraints to geodynamical and structural knowledge of the study area. Main results evidence (i) the presence of a clear discontinuity in the P-wave velocity pattern between the Tyrrhenian off-shore of Sicily, characterized by high velocity anomalies, and the northern Sicilian on-shore, where a large almost E-W low velocity anomaly is evident at all depths; (ii) high velocity anomalies in the Iblean area with respect to the adjacent sector of central Sicily in the depth range 3 - 15 km; (iii) low P-wave velocity anomalies in correspondence with the Mt. Etna and the Eolian Island volcanos in the upper crust layers.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the boundary between a planet's metallic core and silicate mantle is important for constraining processes that dominate on either side of this boundary. Geophysical measurements of the planet Mercury by the MESSENGER spacecraft have provided evidence of a core larger than earlier, less-constrained estimates. Further, these results, taken in concert with measurements of the elemental composition of the surface by MESSENGER, have led to the suggestion that the uppermost layer of the outer core may be highly enriched in sulfur, and the top of the core may consist of a solid sulfide layer. The low iron and relatively large sulfur contents of the surface indicate highly reducing conditions during planet formation, placing constraints on the potential composition of Mercury’s core. Recent metal-silicate partitioning experiments have developed new limits on the amount of sulfur and silicon that may partition into the core as a function of sulfur abundance at the surface. Models for the planet’s internal structure constrained by the current best estimates of the bulk density, normalized polar moment of inertia, and fraction of the polar moment of inertia of the solid layer that extends from the surface to the top of the liquid outer core provide an important view of the layering and bulk composition of Mercury. By combining the results of these internal structure models with the experimental relationship between core and mantle composition we place new limits on core composition and structure. Further, imposing measured compositional constraints on the miscibility of iron-sulfur-silicon alloys yields important limits on the presence or absence of an immiscible sulfur-rich liquid layer or a solid sulfide layer at the top of the core.",

            "abstract": "Land use plays an important role in determining terrestrial–atmosphere mass and energy exchange, which in turn influences local to global climate. The CMIP5 project used “land use harmonization” to provide land use input for Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, but did not address numerous climate and carbon-cycle inconsistencies between Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and ESMs. Our new approach to reducing such inconsistencies is to integrate an IAM (Global Change Assessment Model) and an ESM (Community Earth System Model) into the first fully coupled model that directly simulates human–environment feedbacks. The resulting Integrated Earth System Model (iESM) is used to investigate the biogeophysical impacts of land cover change (LCC) at regional and global scales under RCP4.5 scenario. Regions with significant LCC differences between the coupled (predicted LCC with climate feedback) and control (prescribed LUC without climate feedback, CMIP5 style) runs include large portions of Europe, United States, eastern China, India, Indonesia and Brail at the end of 21st century. The model results suggest that the LCCs have little impact on globally averaged climatic variables (e.g., 2m temperature is -0.004 K cooler in the coupled simulation compared to control simulation with prescribed LCC). Within some of the regions with significant LCCs, there are relatively large changes o f selected climatic variables, but most are not statistically significant in the local annual mean (e.g., the reduction of precipitation is large as -0.115 mm/day over Southeast China, but not significant). Conversely, within some regions with small LCCs, there are relatively large and significant model changes (e.g., significant changes for precipitation, ET, LH, and net radiation appear over Tigris Euphrates). On the basis of our model experiments, it is important to consider the two-way feedbacks between the climate and LCC for projecting future climate, particularly at regional scales. ",

            "abstract": "Data brokering aims to provide those in the hydrological sciences with access to relevant data to represent physical, biological, and chemical characteristics researchers need to accelerate discovery in their domain. Environmental models are useful tools to understand the behavior of hydrological systems. Unfortunately, parameterization of these models requires many different data sources from different disciplines (e.g., atmospheric, geoscience, ecology). In hydrological modeling, the traditional procedure for model initialization starts with obtaining elevation models, land-use characterizations, soils maps, and weather data. It is often the researcher’s past experience with these datasets that determines which datasets will be used in a study, and often newer, more suitable data products exist. An added complexity is that various science communities have differing data formats, storage protocols and manipulation methods, which makes use by a non domain scientist difficult and time consuming. We propose data brokering as a means to address several of these challenges. We present two test case scenarios in which researchers attempt to reproduce hydrological model results using 1) general internet based data gathering techniques, and 2) a scientific data brokering interface. We show that data brokering increases the efficiency with which data are collected, models are initialized, and results are analyzed. As an added benefit, it appears brokering significantly increases the repeatability of a study.",

            "abstract": "Waves conditions in southern California are sensitive to offshore wave directions. Due to blocking by coastal islands and refraction across complex bathymetry, a <10o difference in incident wave direction can dramatically change coastal wave energy. Directional wave buoys are fundamentally low-resolution instruments, while the directional bin widths of operational wind-wave models are coarse (e.g. 10o). Operational wind-wave models have useful prediction skill in the nearshore, however, wave buoy measurements, when combined with standard directional estimation techniques, are shown to provide significantly better hindcasts. Techniques to combine offshore global wave model predictions (NOAA’s Wave Watch 3 hindcasts) and offshore buoy measurements are being developed. The skill of different combination methodologies as an offshore boundary condition is assessed using spectral ray-tracing methods to transform incident offshore swell-spectra to shallow water buoy locations. A nearly continuous 10 yr data set of approximately 14 buoys is used. Comparisons include standard bulk parameters (e.g. significant wave height, peak period), the frequency-dependent energy spectrum (needed for run-up estimation) and radiation stress component Sxy (needed for alongshore current and sediment transport estimation). Global wave model uncertainties are unknown, complicating the formulation of optimum assimilation constraints. Several plausible models for estimating offshore waves are tested. Future work includes assimilating nearshore buoy observations, with the long-term objective of accurate regional wave hindcasts using an efficient mix of global wave models and buoys.

            "abstract": "Current rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are a major concern with significant global ramifications, however, of the carbon (C) fluxes that are known to occur on Earth, the terrestrial sink has the greatest amount of uncertainty. Improved monitoring of forest cover and change is required for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). We determine C storage from volume measurements with a high-precision Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS), substantially improving current standard ground validation techniques. This technology is utilized on several 30 m x 30 m plots in a Virginia temperate forest. Aboveground C is calculated on each of the study sites with commonly used allometric equations to offer a realistic comparison of field-based estimations to TLS-derived methods. The TLS and aerial LiDAR point cloud data are compared via the development of canopy height models at the plot scale. The novel method of point cloud voxelization is applied to our TLS data in order to produce detailed volumetric calculations in these complex forest ecosystems. Statistical output from the TLS data allows us to resolve and compare forest structure on scales from the individual plot to the entire forest landscape. The estimates produced from this research will be used to inform more widely available remote sensing datasets provided by NASA’s Landsat satellites, significantly reducing the uncertainty of the terrestrial C cycle in temperate forests. Preliminary findings corroborate previous research, suggesting the potential for highly detailed monitoring of forest C storage as defined by the REDD initiative and analysis of complex ecosystem structure.",

            "abstract": "Real-time drought monitoring enables a proactive drought management approach that can lead to timely actions to mitigate the losses due to a drought event. In recent years, the availability of long-term, high quality, satellite and reanalysis based datasets of atmospheric forcings, combined with the development of state-of-the-art hydrologic models have made real-time global drought monitoring feasible. Hydrologic models are invaluable tools for global drought monitoring given the scarcity of long-term moisture observations (e.g. soil moisture, streamflow). However, as valuable as they are for drought monitoring, characteristics of a drought event (i.e. onset, severity and persistence) as estimated by a hydrologic model depend on the model’s parameters (e.g. soil and vegetation parameters) and its inherent dynamics that guide the partition of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff. One approach to account for the differences in drought estimates due to differences in model dynamics is to use multiple hydrologic models. Each hydrologic model is forced with the same atmospheric forcings to simulate moisture conditions which are converted into objective drought indicators (e.g. soil moisture percentile) with respect to the model’s own climatology and then those estimates are combined to provide a multimodel based drought estimates. The University of Washington’s Global Drought Information System (GDIS) developed in 2013, is one such prototype drought monitoring system. This system uses the VIC, NOAH and Catchment models. In this presentation we investigate how the differences in the dynamics of the models used in UW’s GDIS, influence the drought monitoring estimates. Specifically we answer following questions: 1.What is the level of uncertainties in drought onset, severity and persistence as estimated by different hydrologic models? 2. How do the uncertainties vary spatially and seasonally? 3. What are the sources of the uncertainties?",

            "abstract": "We examine the effects of recently announced energy policies in mainland China on air quality in both China and the U.S. in 2030. China is the largest contributor to global anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants, especially the precursors to ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Efforts to limit coal use in China under the country’s National Air Pollution Action Plan will reduce these air pollutants. Control efforts are expected to not only decrease the concentration of ozone and PM2.5 locally in China, but also reduce the trans-Pacific transport of air pollutants to the U.S. We couple an energy-economic model with sub-national detail for China (the China Regional Energy Model, or C-REM) to a global atmospheric chemistry model (GEOS-Chem) to assess air pollution reductions under an energy policy scenario relative to a no policy baseline scenario. Future Chinese anthropogenic emissions are predicted by C-REM under a national energy policy scenario which achieves a 20% reduction in energy intensity from 2012 to 2017 by targeting fossil fuel use nationwide as specified in the National Air Pollution Action Plan and also meets the Plan’s sub-national constraint that coal use must not increase above present levels in three largest urban regions (the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta) through 2030. Using GEOS-Chem, we project changes in the surface concentration of ozone and PM2.5 over China and the U.S. in 2030. We find that air pollutants decrease substantially over both China and the U.S. under the national targets set by the Air Pollution Action Plan.",

One of the few places where rocks returned from the MDD largely unaltered is Sivrihisar, Turkey: a structurally coherent terrane of lawsonite eclogite and blueschist facies rocks in which assemblages and fabrics record P-T-fluid-deformation conditions during exhumation from ~80 to 45 km. Crystallographic fabrics and other structural features of high-pressure metasedimentary and metabasaltic rocks record transitions during exhumation. In quartzite, heterogeneous microstructures and crystallographic fabrics record deformation and dynamic recrystallization from ~2.6 GPa to ~1.5 GPa, as expressed by transition from prism<a> c-axis patterns through progressive overprinting and activation of rhomb<a> and basal<a> slip. Omphacite, glaucophane, phengite, and lawsonite in quartzite remained stable during deformation. In marble, CaCO3 deformed in dislocation creep as aragonite, producing strong crystallographic fabrics. This fabric persisted through formation of calcite and destruction of the shape-preferred orientation, indicating the strength of aragonite marble. Omphacite in metabasalt and quartzite displays an L-type crystallographic fabric. Lawsonite kinematic vorticity data and other fabrics in metabasalt are consistent with exhumation involving increasing amounts of pure shear relative to simple shear and indicate strain localization and simple shear near the fault contact between the high-pressure unit and a serpentinite body. This large coaxial component multiplied the exhuming power of the subduction channel and forced rocks to return from the MDD.",

            "abstract": "One of the key advances that has allowed better simulations of the large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica has been the use of inverse methods. These have allowed poorly known parameters such as the basal drag coefficient and ice viscosity to be constrained using a wide variety of satellite observations. Inverse methods used by glaciologists have broadly followed one of two related approaches. The first is minimization of a cost function that describes the misfit to the observations, often accompanied by some kind of explicit or implicit regularization that promotes smallness or smoothness in the inverted parameters. The second approach is a probabilistic framework that makes use of Bayes' theorem to update prior assumptions about the probability of parameters, making use of data with known error estimates. Both approaches have much in common and questions of regularization often map onto implicit choices of prior probabilities that are made explicit in the Bayesian framework. In both approaches questions can arise that seem to demand subjective input. What should the functional form of the cost function be if there are alternatives? What kind of regularization should be applied, and how much? How should the prior probability distribution for a parameter such as basal slipperiness be specified when we know so little about the details of the subglacial environment? Here we consider some approaches that have been used to address these questions and discuss ways that probabilistic prior information used for regularizing glaciological inversions might be specified with greater objectivity.",

            "abstract": "Foundering of mafic lower continental crust (LCC) is often invoked to account for the relatively silicic composition of the bulk crust. However, the fate of this foundered material in the mantle is not well understood. Here we give geochemical evidence, including Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotope data, for historic Wudalianchi potassic basalts from NE China, to show that these basalts with extreme EM1 signatures can be direct melts derived from foundered LCC. They are characterized by linear trends between major elements, isotopes and trace elements ratios, suggesting mixing of a high-Si, low-Mg component with a low-Si, high-Mg one. The two end-members are nearly indistinguishable on a trace element spidergram, and both exhibit relative depletion of Th, U, Nb, Ta and Ti, and positive anomalies of Ba, K, Pb. The small range of absolute abundances of trace elements and the absence of Sr and Eu anomalies argue against significant crustal assimilation, which is further confirmed by a negative correlation between Nb/Th ratios and εHf. As a result, we suggest that these chemical features were inherited from foundered mafic lower crustal materials.\nFoundered mafic LCC will transform into garnet pyroxenites in the mantle. Experiments have shown that silica-excess and silica-deficient pyroxenites at high pressures can generate the major element compositions of both end-members of Wudalianchi basalts. Quantitative modeling of garnet pyroxenite melting with LCC as starting compositions can reproduce the trace element pattern of Wudalianchi lavas. Therefore, we suggest Wudalianchi lavas to be direct melts of foundered LCC, without requiring reaction between melt and peridotite. Correlations of decreasing 206Pb/204Pb with increasing SiO2 have been observed in Cenozoic basalts from North and NE China, suggesting that the involvement of foundered mafic LCC has played a more important role than previously thought for the genesis of this intra-plate magmatism.",

            "abstract": "Northern peatlands store about 500 Gt of carbon (C), constituting one of the largest continental C pools and thus a major component of the global C cycle. Due to the growing recognition of their importance, long-term changes in peatland C sequestration have been inferred from peat-core data to provide insights into the sensitivity to climate changes of the peatland C sink, to estimate C stock from local to global scales, and to incorporate peatlands into global C cycle models. In the analysis and synthesis of data from multiple sites/cores, chronological uncertainties are often ignored or treated simplistically, which may lead to over-interpret insignificant results. Also, additional problems may arise when analyzing and calculating peat C accumulation rates, which are strongly affected by age-depth modeling results, that is, small uncertainties in ages may lead to large differences in accumulation rates. Here we propose a new method, combining Bayesian age-depth modeling and Monte-Carlo procedure, to analyze peat C rate datasets by systematically addressing both chronological and rate calculation uncertainties. This method consists of the generation of a large number of dataset simulations from the possible modeled C rates, each with different Gaussian noise related to analytical error of C bulk density measurements. These dataset simulations can then be iteratively analyzed, allowing the systematic estimation of uncertainties related to age and density measurements. We applied this approach to the analysis of the latest northern peatland C database (Loisel et al., 2014. The Holocene 24) to generate regional and global synthesis curves, to refine the northern peatland C stock and net C balance during the Holocene, and to derive significant spatiotemporal patterns using Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF). For the synthesis curves and the C balance calculations, our method adds an extra ~10% to ~40% of error to the common error estimates (standard error of the means), whereas uncertainties on the EOF temporal patterns are mostly controlled by the number of sites in each time bin. The large amount of uncertainty inherent to age measurements emphasizes the need for more detailed northern peatland C rate records to better understand their dynamics and climate sensitivity, especially for the early Holocene.",

            "abstract": "Dryland ecosystems, including grassland, forest, and irrigated cropland, cover about 41% of earth’s land area and are inhabited by over two billion people. In drylands, particularly arid and semiarid areas, the production of ecosystem services is primarily constrained by freshwater availability. Often, water allocated to production by one ecosystem or of one ecosystem service negatively impacts other ecosystems or ecosystem services (ESS). The challenge is to determine how much water should be allocated to which ecosystems (natural and manmade) such that multiple ESS are maximized, thus improving overall well-being. This strategic management decision must be supported by knowledge about spatial and temporal availability of water and its relationship to production (location and scale) of ESS that people receive. We assess the spatial and temporal relationships between water availability and ESS production in Xinjiang, Northwest China. We address four questions: (1) What services are produced by which ecosystems with water available? (2) Where are these services produced? (3) Who uses the services produced? (4) How the production of services changes with variability of water available? Using existing global, national, and regional spatial and statistical data, we assess food, fiber, livestock, and wood production as well as unique forest landscapes (as a proxy for aesthetic appreciation and habitats for unique animals and plants) and protection from dust storms. Irrigation is necessary for crop production in Xinjiang. The production of about 4.2 million tons of wheat and 500,000 tons of cotton requires more than 2 km3 of water each year. This is an important source of food and income for local residents, but the diverted water has negative and potentially costly impacts on downstream forests that potentially provide aesthetic services and protection from dust. Our analyses also show that cropland had increased by about 1.6 million ha from 1987 to 2010, while grassland and woodland had decreased by about 1.5 million ha and 33,000 ha, respectively. Cropland expansion had increased water need for irrigation and decreased services produced by other ecosystems. This assessment helps understand connections between water and ESS better and contributes to water and land management in dry regions, particularly China.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is scheduled for launch in January 2015 and will provide L-band radar and radiometer observations that are sensitive to surface soil moisture (in the top few centimeters of the soil column). For several of the key applications targeted by SMAP, however, knowledge of root zone soil moisture (defined here nominally as soil moisture in the top 1 m of the soil column) is needed. The SMAP mission will therefore provide a value-added Level 4 Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture (L4_SM) product with the two key objectives: (i) to provide estimates of root zone soil moisture based on SMAP observations, and (ii) to provide a global surface and root zone soil moisture product that is spatially and temporally complete. The L4_SM algorithm uses an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to merge SMAP observations with soil moisture estimates from the NASA GEOS-5 Catchment land surface model. The model describes the vertical transfer of soil moisture between the surface and root zone reservoirs and will be driven with observation-based surface meteorological forcing data, including precipitation, on a global 9 km Earth-fixed grid. The presentation provides an overview of the SMAP L4_SM algorithm and pre-launch validation. Specifically, an L4_SM prototype product based on the assimilation of observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was validated using in situ measurements from SMAP core validation sites (densely instrumented watersheds) and from more than 100 single-profile sensors scattered across the United States. The validation results indicate that the prototype soil moisture product satisfies the formal RMSE requirement for the L4_SM product of 0.04 m3/m3 (after removal of the long-term mean bias). An examination of the observation-minus-forecast residuals from the L4_SM system suggests where the system could be improved further.",

            "abstract": "The total Joule heating in the polar ionosphere can be derived from an empirical model of the electric fields and currents, using input measurements of the solar wind velocity and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). In the thermosphere, measurements of the neutral density from accelerometers on the CHAMP and GRACE satellites are used to derive exospheric temperatures, showing that enhanced ionospheric energy dissipation produces elevated temperatures with little delay.\nUsing the total ionospheric heating, changes in the global mean exosphere temperature as a function of time can be calculated with a simple differential equation. The results compare very well with the CHAMP and GRACE measurement. A critical part of the calculation is the rate at which the thermosphere cools after the ionospheric heating is reduced. It had been noted previously that events with significant levels of heating subsequently cool at a faster rate, and this cooling was attributed to enhanced nitric oxide emissions. This correlation with nitric oxide has been confirmed with very high correlations with measurements of nitric oxide emissions in the thermosphere, from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. These measurements were used in a recent improvement in the equations that calculate the thermosphere temperature. The global nitric oxide cooling rates are included in this calculation, and the predicted levels of nitric oxide, derived from the ionosphere heating model, match the SABER measurements very well, having correlation coefficients on the order of 0.9.\nThese calculations are used to govern the sorting of measurements CHAMP and GRACE measurements, on the basis of the global temperature enhancements due to Joule heating, as well as various solar indices, and season. Global maps of the exospheric temperature are produced from these sorted data.",

            "abstract": "Lead (Pb) isotopes in detrital marine sediments and authigenic oxide coatings have proven useful in reconstructing past changes in continental weathering of glaciated continents and ocean circulation. This approach is under-utilised in the Southern Ocean, despite uncertainties about the evolution of Antarctica’s ice sheets and oceanographic changes in this region throughout the Cenozoic.\nLead isotopes in sediments are controlled by the mineralogy and age of their bedrock sources, making them an ideal tool to trace changes in Southern Ocean sediment provenance associated with onland erosion patterns (and ice sheet variability), and ocean circulation. However, core-top mapping of Pb isotope signatures of detrital marine sediments in this region is non-existent. We present new Pb isotope data for acid-digested <63µm and bulk Late Holocene sediments from 40 cores located in the East Antarctic sector of Southern Ocean. Results demonstrate that, similar to existing Nd and Sr core-top surveys, distinct provenance sectors can be seen in sediments proximal to the continent, due to the geological characteristics of bedrock sources along the margin. A striking N-S trend is also evident, with distal sediments characterised by less radiogenic isotopic signatures, likely associated with a decrease in radiogenic Pb-bearing minerals with increasing distance from the continental margin. This pattern suggests that Pb isotopes in marine sediments may be useful in reconstructing past provenance trends associated with ice sheet change, and migrations of Southern Ocean frontal positions.\nIn addition, we will present new seawater Pb isotope data from reductive leaching of authigenic coatings of these same sediments, permitting for Late Holocene Pb isotope seawater mapping of the Southern Ocean. To ensure we measured the true seawater signal, we adapted established sequential leaching procedures to minimise detrital contamination, and monitored leachate compositions with Nd isotopes, and major and trace elements. Preliminary results, along with those of parallel detrital studies, suggest Pb isotopes are a viable tool for paleoclimatic studies in areas of the Southern Ocean proximal to Antarctica, and our new data forms an important framework for future studies in the region.",

            "abstract": "For seismic monitoring, the task of finding and indentifying the sources of various seismic events is getting more and more difficult when the size (magnitude, yield, energy) of these events decreases. Firstly, the number of seismic events dramatically increases with falling magnitude - approximately by an order of magnitude per unit of seismic magnitude. Secondly, mining explosions become detectable and represent one of the biggest challenges for monitoring for magnitudes below 3.5 to 4.0. In the current study of mining activity within the Russian platform, we use the advantages of location and historical bulletins/catalogues of mining explosions recorded by small-aperture seismic array Mikhnevo (MHVAR) and extensive data from several IMS arrays at regional and far regional distances from the studied area. The Institute of Geosphere Dynamics (IDG) of the Russian Academy of Sciences runs seismic array MHVAR (54.950 N; 37.767 E) since 2004. Approximately 50 areas with different levels of mining activity have been identified by MHVAR and reported in the IDG catalogue as mining events. Signals from select mining events detected by MHVAR are sought at IMS arrays. Continuous data from MHVAR and IMS arrays (e.g. AKASG) are processed jointly using waveform cross correlation technique. This technique allows reducing the detection threshold of repeated events by an order of magnitude as well as accurately locating and identifying mining explosions. To achieve the highest performance of cross correlation, we have selected the best sets of waveform templates recorded from a carefully tested set of master events for each of the studied mines. We also test the possibility to use the Principal and Independent Component Analysis to produce sets of synthetic templates, which best fit the whole set of master events for a given mine.",

These simplistic models are the first step in developing an operational model for the Elqui River watershed located in northern Central Chile (30°S). In this semi-arid region, snow and glacier melt are the dominant hydrologic inputs where annual precipitation is limited to three or four winter events. Unfortunately winter access to the Andean Cordillera where snow accumulates is limited. While a monitoring network to measure snow where it accumulates in the upper elevations is under development, management decisions regarding water resources cannot wait. The two models we present differ in structure. The first applies a Monte Carlo approach to determine relationships between lagged changes in monthly snow cover frequency and monthly discharge. The second is a modified degree-day melt model, utilizing the MODIS snow cover product to determine where and when snow melt occurs. These models are not watershed specific and are applicable in other regions where snow dominates hydrologic inputs, but measurements are minimal.",

In this work we focus on separator reconnection. A magnetic separator can be understood as the 3D analogue of a 2D x line with a guide field, and is defined by the line corresponding to the intersection of the separatrix surfaces associated with the magnetic nulls. A separator in the magnetosphere represents the intersection of four distinct magnetic topologies: solar wind, closed, open connected to the northern hemisphere, and open connected to the southern hemisphere. The integral of the parallel electric field along the separator defines the rate of open flux production, and is one measure of the reconnection rate. We present three methods for locating magnetic separators and apply them to 3D resistive MHD simulations of the Earth’s magnetosphere using the BATS-R-US code. The techniques for finding separators and determining the reconnection rate are insensitive to IMF clock angle and can in principle be applied to any magnetospheric model. The present work examines cases of high and low resistivity, for two clock angles. We also examine the separator during Flux Transfer Events (FTEs) and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.",

Novel technology provides for unprecedented forest monitoring and ecosystem structure assessment with NI-SAR based on a 12-m reflector L-band scan-on-receive configuration (known as SweepSAR), which allows for a greater than 240 km swath and unprecedented global wall-to-wall coverage with a 12-day repeat cycle at pixel resolutions better than 25 m. Data from the mission will be made freely available through NASA’s open data policy. Latency for basic data products such as co- and cross-pol reflectivity is expected to be less than several days. Through this capability, the mission will provide a crucial tool for forest carbon assessment and monitoring, important for treaties like REDD+, forest inundation monitoring, improved carbon stock estimates for low biomass regions, and monitoring of land-cover conversion to and from agricultural production. In this paper we summarize the capability of NI-SAR’s observing strategy, anticipated approaches for monitoring forests, wetlands, and agricultural lands and their changes. We review the science background, science objectives and requirements, and data products stemming from the mission.",

            "abstract": "Landslides are common phenomena of sediment movement in mountain areas and usually pose severe risks to people and infrastructure around those areas. The occurrence of landslides is influenced by groundwater dynamics and bedrock characteristics as well as by rainfall and soil-mass properties. The bedrock may drain or contribute to groundwater in the overlying soil mass, depending on the hydraulic conductivity, degree of fracturing, saturation, and hydraulic head. Our study here is based on the model proposed by Iverson (2005). The model describes the relation between landslide displacement and the shear-zone dilation/contraction of pore water pressure. To study landslide initiation and movement, a block soil mass sliding down an inclined beck-rock plane is governed by Newton’s equation of motion, while both the bedrock exfiltration and excess pore pressure induced by dilatation or contraction of basal shear zone are described by diffusion equations. The Chebyshev collocation method was used to transform the governing equations to a system of first-order ordinary differential equations, without the need of iteration. Then a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme was used to solve these ordinary differential equations. The effects of nonuniform bedrock exfiltration pressure distributions, such as the delayed peak, central peak, and advanced peak distributions, on the time of landslide initiation and the speed of landslide movement were compared and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The composition of planets in the modern solar system can be traced to the chemistry and physics of the solar nebula, the diffuse disk of gas and dust that surrounded the young sun immediately after its formation. Materials such as the noble gases were too volatile to be chemically incorporated by planetary embryos. Instead, it is likely that they were trapped physically and transported to the inner planets by migrating comets and planetesimals. One trapping mechanism under consideration is the capture of noble gas atoms in amorphous ices on the surface of cold grains. We created a simple numerical model to explore this mechanism, using argon as a representative volatile gas. We have demonstrated that our model reproduces experimental trapping efficiencies (ratio of the volatile atoms to water molecules in the deposited ice) when we constrain the binding energy of our representative volatile to 3500-5500K and the sticking efficiency of volatile atoms to 0.004x gas phase water pressure. Binding energy and sticking efficiency are poorly understood for most volatile substances, but this study finds that they are among the most critical when predicting the trapping of volatiles in the physical world. Constraining these parameters under nebular conditions will allow us to evaluate how much argon could have been trapped in nebular ices and ultimately assess the role of amorphous ice trapping in the origin of planetary volatiles.",

            "abstract": "The major igneous events that form and shape the crust of a rocky body, such as magma ocean solidification and volcanism, affect the interior thermo-chemical evolution through control on the bulk volatile content, partitioning of heat-producing elements, and heat loss. Therefore, characterizing the crust of a body provides information on that object’s origin, differentiation, and subsequent geologic evolution. For Mercury, the crust may hold clues in particular to the still poorly understood processes of formation of this planet. Analysis of geoid-to-topography ratios (GTRs) has been previously applied to infer the thickness of the crust of the Moon, Mars, and Venus. We perform a similar analysis for Mercury with the gravity and altimetry data acquired by the MESSENGER spacecraft. We consider only the northern hemisphere, where the gravity field and topography are well constrained. We assume that Airy isostasy is the principal mechanism of support of variations in topography, and we therefore exclude from the analysis regions that might not be compatible with this assumption, such as large expanses of smooth plains and large impact basins. For a conservative range of densities of the crust, we infer a crustal thickness of 35±18 km (one standard deviation). This new mean value is substantially less than earlier estimates that were based on viscous relaxation of topography, on the relation between the low-degree gravity field and equatorial ellipticity, and on the depth of the brittle-ductile transition as constrained by models of thrust faulting and thermal evolution. This relatively thin crust allows for the possibility of excavation of mantle material during the formation of large impact basins (such as Caloris). Such material might be observed with instruments on MESSENGER and the BepiColombo spacecraft now in development.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic field measurements made by the MESSENGER spacecraft in orbit around Mercury have shown that, to first order, Mercury’s internal field can be described by an axially aligned dipole, offset by 479 km north of the geographic equator (the offset axial dipole, hereafter OAD). Near-periapsis MESSENGER magnetic field measurements at altitudes less than 200 km have been obtained since April 2014. We use these observations, together with higher altitude data from orbits that have been characterized with low magnetic activity , to identify non-OAD internal field structure and to establish whether it is of crustal and/or core origin. Magnetospheric models developed with MESSENGER data allow estimated contributions from magnetopause, magnetotail, and OAD fields to be subtracted from vector magnetic field measurements, and the sources of residual signatures to be examined. For measurements made at spacecraft altitudes above 200 km, determining the magnitude and sources of additional regional and global-scale contributions to the internal field has been challenging because of MESSENGER’s orbit geometry and because the residuals are dominated by additional external fields that are organized in the local time frame and that vary with magnetospheric activity. After accounting for the large-scale magnetospheric fields, any additional external field contributions to the residual fields are estimated empirically in the local time frame. We investigate crustal and core contributions to the remaining signals, in particular to the low altitude signals, by examining repeatability in the body-fixed frame and using global (spherical harmonic) and local (equivalent source dipole) basis functions with regularization. Crustal sources associated with large-scale regional geological provinces such as the northern lowlands, the northern rise, and major impact basins are investigated and equivalent spherical harmonic core/crustal field spectra computed.",

            "abstract": "This study examines schemes of autoconversion (mass transfer from the cloud water to the rain water by the coalescence of cloud droplets) based on sensitivity experiments by an aerosol climate model, MIROC-SPRINTARS. The autoconversion scheme proposed by Berry (1968), which is a default in MIROC-SPRINTARS, predicts larger autoconversion rate than other autoconversion schemes (e.g., Beheng 1994; Khairoutdinov and Kogan 2000) that have non-linear dependence on the cloud droplet number concentration. Such a larger autoconversion rate of Berry parameterization results in faster production of precipitating cloud.\nIn addition, we estimated the conversion rate (sum of autoconversion and accretion rates) from the active CloudSat and passive MODIS retrieved data as well. The inter-comparison of the frequency distribution diagrams as a function of the liquid water path and conversion rate, associated with conversion time, between the CloudSat/MODIS observations and single-column model simulation showed the characteristics of larger conversion rate and faster conversion time in the parameterization of Berry, than that of the CloudSat/MODIS observations. These characteristics and results support the findings of a previous study (e.g., Suzuki et al., 2013) by the method of \"contoured frequency by optical depth diagram (CFODD)\".\nPractically all the climate models generally have non-negligible large uncertainty in cloud–precipitation parameterizations due to the difficulty in representing the complex aerosol–cloud interactions. The cloud (and water vapor) plays an important role in the global radiation budget and climate system, therefore to improve the reproducibility related to the cloud and precipitation leads to the improvement in performance of climate models as a whole.\nThis study was partly supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (S-12-3) of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan.",

            "abstract": "Mathematical models with different level of complexity are needed to address a range of engineering questions on security issues of CO2 sequestration, which has been proposed as a promising strategy for carbon mitigation. Among this wide range of mathematical models, a family of vertically integrated models has been developed. These models are usually based on a vertical equilibrium (VE) assumption, which states that due to strong buoyancy, CO2 and brine segregate instantaneously and reach a hydrostatic pressure distribution in the vertical dimension. Such VE models are accurate and computationally efficient as long as the VE assumption is valid. By comparing VE models with a full three-dimensional model for a series of practical problems, Court et al. (2012) found that there are a number of cases for which the VE model is not applicable, especially when the geological formations have relatively low vertical permeability, on the order of 10 milliDarcy or lower. To overcome the VE limitation, Guo et al. (2014) have developed a vertically integrated model for homogeneous formations that relaxes the VE assumption and accounts for vertical dynamics of CO2 and brine. Though, limited to homogeneous formations, this model has a much wider applicability compared to VE models while maintains much of the VE model’s computational efficiency.\nIn this contribution, we extend the vertically integrated model of Guo et al. (2014) to deal with the horizontally layered systems to include vertical heterogeneities. Each layer of the system can have different material properties but is assumed to be homogeneous within the layer. Such horizontally layered systems are of high practical relevance because of the depositional history of the geological formations. We develop coupling conditions between the layers and use a similar algorithm of Guo et al. (2014) to solve the individual layers. The end result is a model capable of dealing with vertical geological heterogeneities while still maintaining much of the computational advantages of VE models. Comparison of results with a VE model and a full three-dimensional model will be presented to demonstrate the applicability of the new model.",

            "abstract": "Wind-profiling lidars are now regularly used in wind energy for wind resource assessment, inflow characterization, and wake measurements. Lidar wind profilers exploit the Doppler shift of laser light backscattered from particulates carried by the wind to measure a line-of-sight (LOS) velocity. The Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS) technique, used by many commercial systems, considers measurements of this LOS velocity in multiple radial directions in order to estimate horizontal and vertical winds. The method relies on the assumption of homogeneous flow across the region sampled by the beams. Use of such a system in inhomogeneous flow, such as wind turbine wakes or complex terrain, will result in error which may or may not be significant.\nTo quantify the error expected from such violation of the assumption of horizontal homogeneity, we simulate inhomogeneous flow in the atmospheric boundary layer, notably stably-stratified flow past a wind turbine using large-eddy simulation. This slightly stable case results in 15 degrees of wind direction change across the turbine rotor disk. The resulting flow-field is sampled in the same fashion that a lidar samples the atmosphere with the DBS approach, enabling quantification of the error in the DBS observations. The observations from the instruments located upwind have small error, which is further ameliorated with time-averaging. However, the downwind observations, particularly within the first two rotor diameters downwind from the wind turbine, suffer from errors due to the heterogeneity of the wind turbine wake. Errors in the stream-wise component of the flow are generally small, less than 0.5 m s-1. Errors in the cross-stream and vertical velocity components are much larger: cross-stream component errors are on the order of 1.0 m s-1, while errors in the vertical velocity exceed the actual values of the vertical velocity. DBS-based assessments of wake wind speed deficits based on the stream-wise velocity can be relied upon even within the near wake within 0.5 m s-1, but cross-stream and vertical velocity estimates in the near wake are compromised. Measurements of inhomogeneous flow such as wind turbine wakes are susceptible to these errors, and interpretations of field observations should account for this uncertainty.",

The X-ray background level tracks the progression of the solar cycle through its maximum and minimum. Using the X-ray data, we can therefore make estimates of the solar cycle progression and date of so- lar maximum.

            "abstract": "In ancient orogens, such as the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States, the difference between the high and low points—topographic relief—can continue to increase long after the tectonic forces that created the range have become inactive. Climatic forcing and mantle-induced dynamic uplift are proposed to drive formation of relief, but clear evidence is lacking in the Appalachian Mountains. Here I use a numerical simulation of dynamic topography in North America, combined with reconstructions of the sedimentation history from the Gulf of Mexico, to show that rejuvenation of topographic relief in the Appalachian Mountains since the Palaeogene period could have been caused by mantle-induced dynamic subsidence associated with sinking of the subducted Farallon slab. Specifically, I show that patterns of continental erosion and the eastward migration of sediment deposition centres in the Gulf of Mexico closely follow the locus of predicted dynamic subsidence. Furthermore, pulses of rapid sediment deposition in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic correlate with enhanced erosion in the Appalachian Mountains during the Miocene epoch, caused by dynamic tilting of the continent. Calculations show that such subsidence-induced differential erosion caused flexural-isostatic adjustments of Appalachian topography that led to the development of both relief and elevation.

            "abstract": "The Palos Verdes Fault (PVF) is one of few active faults in Southern California that crosses the shoreline and can be studied using both terrestrial and subaqueous methodologies. Despite its proximity to metropolitan Los Angeles, the recent activity and earthquake hazards associated with the PVF are poorly constrained. To characterize the near seafloor fault morphology, Late Pleistocene–Holocene slip-rate and tectonic influences on slope sedimentary processes, a grid of high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and chirp sub-bottom profiles were acquired with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI) Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The AUV surveys were focused along the continental slope ~25 km south of Long Beach in water depths between 250 and 600 m, where the PVF crosses the slope. AUV multibeam bathymetry data gridded at 2-m resolution and chirp profiles are merged with 25-m resolution ship-based multibeam bathymetry and seismic-reflection profiles. Vibracores collected with the MBARI Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and ship-based USGS gravity cores provided radiocarbon dates for stratigraphic horizons offset by the PVF. Recent deformation is expressed as a well-defined seafloor lineation and offset Late Pleistocene–Holocene sub-bottom reflections. Curvilinear scarps associated with an upper submarine landslide (~450 m water depth), a buried slump block, and a lower submarine landslide (~525 m water depth) have been right-laterally offset by 55±3, 55±5, and 40±5 meters, respectively. The age of the upper scarp is bracketed between 23–31 kyr BP, which yields an average slip rate across the PVF of 1.6–2.4 mm/yr. However, our best estimate for the age of the upper landslide is ~ 31 kyr BP, which yields a right-lateral slip-rate of 1.8 mm/yr. Vertical growth faulting observed along a subtle transtensional fault-bend suggests that at least two surface ruptures occurred during the Holocene. In summary, these results indicate that the offshore extension of the PVF remains active, may carry as much as 50% of the total slip-budget assigned to the Inner California Borderland, and is critical to understanding the earthquake hazards in Southern California.",

            "abstract": "Olivine (Mg,Fe)2SiO4, which is one of the major mineral constituents of mafic and ultramafic rocks, has an attractive potential for CO2 mineral sequestration, as it possesses a high content of carbonate-forming divalent cations and exhibits one of the highest dissolution rate amongst rock-forming minerals. This study reports drastic differences in carbonation yields between experiments performed on olivine-rich basalt samples and on olivine separates (a more restricted chemical system). Batch experiments were conducted in water at 150°C and pCO2 = 280 bars on a Mg-rich tholeiitic basalt (9.3 wt.% MgO and 12.2 wt.% CaO), composed of olivine, Ti-magnetite, plagioclase and clinopyroxene. After 45 days of reaction, 56 wt.% of the initial MgO has reacted with CO2 to form Fe-bearing magnesite (Mg0.8Fe0.2)CO3 along with minor calcium carbonates. The substantial decrease of olivine content upon carbonation supports the idea that ferroan magnesite formation mainly follows from olivine dissolution. In contrast, in experiments performed under similar run durations and P/T conditions with a San Carlos olivine separate (47.8 wt.% MgO) of similar grain size, only 5 wt.% of the initial MgO content reacted to form Fe-bearing magnesite. The overall carbonation kinetics of the basalt is enhanced by a factor of 40. It could be accounted for by differences in chemical and textural properties of the secondary-silica layer which covers reacted olivine grains in both types of sample. A TEM inspection of mineral surfaces shows that the thin amorphous silica layer (~100 nm) is porous in the case of the basalt sample and that it contains significant amounts of iron and aluminum. Thus, we propose that the composition of the olivine environment itself can strongly influence the olivine dissolution-carbonation process. Consequently, laboratory data obtained on olivine separates might yield a conservative estimate of the true carbonation potential of olivine-bearing basaltic rocks. More generally, this study questions the approach which consists in evaluating the carbonation potential of a rock based on experiments on separate minerals. It also emphasizes the impact of fO2 and potential co-injected gases on the olivine dissolution-carbonation process.",

For example, for over 100 years, the evolution of library cataloging practice has largely been driven by debates (which are still ongoing) about the fundamental principles of cataloging and how those principles should manifest in rules for cataloging. Similarly, the development of archival research and practices over the past century has proceeded hand-in-hand with the emergence of principles of archival arrangement and description, such as maintaining the original order of records and documenting provenance.\nThis project examines principles related to the creation of metadata for scientific data. The presentation will outline: 1) how understandings and implementations of metadata can range broadly depending on the institutional context, and 2) how metadata principles developed by the library and information science community might apply to metadata developments for scientific data. The development and formalization of such principles would contribute to the development of metadata practices and standards in a wide range of institutions, including data repositories, libraries, and research centers. Shared metadata principles would potentially be useful in streamlining data discovery and integration, and would also benefit the growing efforts to formalize data curation education.",

            "abstract": "Pore scale characterization of flow velocities and concentration spatial distributions is a key to understanding non-Fickian transport and mixing in porous media. We present a millifluidic setup aimed at investigating those processes in transparent porous media, at the pore scale. The porous media are quasi-2D, consisting of a Hele-Shaw cell containing cylindrical grains. They are made by soft lithography from a numerical model and provide full control on the geometry (medium porosity, permeability and heterogeneity). The setup allows for the study of primary drainage/imbibition, or the joint continuous injection of two fluids (e. g. water and air). A camera records the distributions of fluid phases, the position of solid tracers, and spatially-resolved images of light emissions inside the flow cell. The pore scale velocity field is thus measured from particle tracking, while pore scale concentration fields are measured accurately in passive transport experiments, using fluorescein; both continuous injection and finite volume solute injections can be achieved. Using two chemo-luminescent liquids, the reaction of which produces photons in addition to the reaction product, we are also able to study the local production rate of the reaction product as the reactive liquids flow through the system [1]. Pressure drops across the medium are also measured. This complete characterization (phase distributions, velocity and concentration fields, pressure drops) of the system allows to explain non-Fickian behaviors and test models that upscale transport and mixing properties from pore scale data. As examples, we shall discuss the upscaling of transport from the knowledge of Lagrangian velocities and the relationships between conservative and reactive transport under mixing-limited conditions (very large Damkhöler number). Other applications include the prediction of the mixing rate from the sole knowledge of the flow stretching [2], and the characterization of mixing by unsaturated flows [3].\n[1] P. de Anna et al.

            "abstract": "The Beijing city, located in the north of North China Plain, China, has undergone severe land subsidence for the last several decades. An integrated subsidence-monitoring program, including leveling survey, borehole extensometer and and\nSatellite radar interferometry (InSAR) time series analysis\n, has been designed to meet the needs of mapping and monitoring land subsidence in this region. The monitoring data reveal that the subsidence rates of plain area exhibit significant spatial variability, ranging from 1cm to 15cm/yr. The purpose of this article is to identify and analyze the natural and anthropogenic mechanisms that drive the land subsidence. The movement sources are described and classified by their depth of occurrence. We attribute effects of displacement of the Beijing plain to three major components: (1) shallow components, (2) mediate component, and (3) deep component. Deep components are recognized as tectonic movement of the pre-Tertiary basement. Medium component act at depths generally range of 50 to 450m, and include groundwater exploitation; geochemical compaction, due to the high salt concentration in the deep lacustrine sendiments. Shallow components are related to the settlement of building; natural consolidation, due to the compaction of the loose sediments occurred mainly in the clayey layers of the uppermost 26-m Holocene deposits and organic soil subsidence occurs mainly with drainage and development of peat by land reclamation. The latter factor primarily involve the southeast area of the Beijing plain. The loads of new buildings may also cause short-live compaction of shallow deposits. Groundwater exploitation is thought to be the major factor that contributes to the present land subsidence in the Beijing plain. Settlement caused by buildings loads cannot be omitted in newly developed area, but such phenomenon might be localized.",

            "abstract": "Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), as an alternative to conventional optical remote sensing, is being increasingly used to accurately estimate aboveground forest biomass ranging from individual tree to stand levels. Recent advancements in LiDAR technology have resulted in higher point densities and better data accuracies, which however pose challenges to the procurement and processing of LiDAR data for large-area assessments. Reducing point density cuts data acquisition costs and overcome computational challenges for broad-scale forest management. However, how does that impact the accuracy of biomass estimation in an urban environment containing a great level of anthropogenic disturbances? The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of LiDAR point density on the biomass estimation of remnant forests in the rapidly urbanizing regions of Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. We used multiple linear regression to establish the statistical relationship between field-measured biomass and predictor variables (PVs) derived from LiDAR point clouds with varying densities. We compared the estimation accuracies between the general Urban Forest models (no discrimination of forest type) and the Forest Type models (evergreen, deciduous, and mixed), which was followed by quantifying the degree to which landscape context influenced biomass estimation. The explained biomass variance of Urban Forest models, adjusted R2, was fairly consistent across the reduced point densities with the highest difference of 11.5% between the 100% and 1% point densities. The combined estimates of Forest Type biomass models outperformed the Urban Forest models using two representative point densities (100% and 40%). The Urban Forest biomass model with development density of 125 m radius produced the highest adjusted R2 (0.83 and 0.82 at 100% and 40% LiDAR point densities, respectively) and the lowest RMSE values, signifying the distance impact of development on biomass estimation. Our evaluation suggests that reducing LiDAR point density is a viable solution to regional-scale forest biomass assessment without compromising the accuracy of estimation, which may further be improved using development density.",

            "abstract": "Natural or anthropogenic episodic events such as snowmelt, floods, fire, insect-defoliation, pollutant spills, etc. can result in sudden and unexpected changes in runoff water quality from watersheds. Depending on the magnitude and intensity of the change, such events which are also occasionally referred to as “hot moments”, can have significant ecological and environmental consequences. Measuring and recording such rapid and unexpected changes in runoff quality has always been a logistical challenge. However, the advent of in-situ, UV- and fluorescence-based spectrometers that can continuously measure water quality changes at high-frequency (minutes to hours) show considerable promise. We implemented a UV-vis spectrometer (Spectrolyser, S::CAN Inc.) to characterize the stream water quality at every 30 minutes from a small (12 ha) forested watershed located in the Piedmont region of Maryland. The spectrometer recorded the UV-Vis spectrum (200-750 nm), turbidity (NTU), nitrate-N (mgN/L), and total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC, respectively; mgC/L). To evaluate the accuracy of the sensor values, water sampling was also performed simultaneously using automated ISCO samplers for multiple storms since November 2013. Water samples have been analyzed for suspended solids, particulate and dissolved forms of organic carbon (OC), and nitrate-N. In addition, water samples were also analyzed on laboratory spectrometers to develop a variety of UV and fluorescence metrics that characterize the lability and recalcitrance of DOC. Key questions that we address here are: How reliable and accurate are the spectrometer values for dissolved and particulate species of OC and nitrate-N? How does the magnitude of the storms and the amount of suspended sediment influence the accuracy of sensor readings? Can the sensor UV-vis data provide insights into DOC character/composition similar to those derived from lab-based UV and fluorescence metrics? Addressing these questions is critical to the long-term use of these sensors and their ability to provide critical insights into watershed and ecological processes.",

On average, a destructive typhoon hits the Penghu Islands every 15-20 years. As a typhoon approaches Penghu Islands, its track and intensity are influenced by the CMR topography. Therefore, CMR complicates the wind forecast of the Penghu Islands. Six main typhoon tracks (Classes I-VI) are classified based on typhoon directions, as follows: (I) the direction of direct westward movement across CMR of Taiwan, (II) the direction of northward movement traveling through Taiwan Strait, (III) the direction of northward movement along the western coast of Taiwan, (IV) the direction of westward movement traveling through Luzon Strait, (V) the direction of westward movement traveling through the southern East China Sea (near Northern Taiwan), and (VI) the irregular track direction. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) were used as the forecasting technique to predict the wind velocity. We analyzed 49 typhoons from 2000 to 2012. Results showed that the ANFIS models provided high-reliability predictions for wind velocity, and the ANFIS achieved more favorable performance than did the MLPNN. In addition, we provide a detailed discussion on the interaction of the CMR with the Penghu Islands based on various track directions.",

The two dominant modes of subseasonal precipitation variability are identified with an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The first mode (EOF1) is characterized by a monopole in South China, whereas the second mode (EOF2) has a meridional dipole structure with opposite precipitation anomalies over the Yangtze River Basin and the coastal area of South China. These two modes tend to have a phase shift to each other in both space and time, indicating that part of their variability is related to a common process and represents a southward propagating pattern.\nThe subseasonal variability is decomposed into two components, i.e., that related to the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and that independent of the MJO. The MJO-related component is obtained using a bivariate linear regression with respect to the MJO index as defined by Wheeler and Hendon. It is found that the MJO contributes to only a small amount (up to 10%) of precipitation variability in South China. EOF1 is associated with the MJO phase 3, corresponding to enhanced equatorial convection in the Indian Ocean and depressed convection in the western Pacific, while EOF2 is related to the MJO phase 5, when the enhanced tropical convection moves to the Maritime continent region. A large part of the subseasonal precipitation variability in China is independent of the MJO. Lagged regression analysis is performed between the leading principal component (PC1) and the MJO-independent component of variability of 500-hPa geopotential height, sea-level pressure and 2-meter air temperature. It is found that the subseasonal precipitation variability in China is related to a wave train from the North Atlantic, development of the Siberian high, and cold air outbreak in East Asia.",

            "abstract": "Today, when we look at the tropical latitudes all around the world, we see rainforests more or less everywhere, except the easternmost parts of tropical East Africa. Why do the environmental conditions elsewhere in the tropics support the rainforest biomes but not in East Africa? The suggested explanation for this is the progressive tectonic uplift of the region. The uplift of eastern African topography, together with the changes in Earth's orbital forcing, resulted in the aridification of the region over the past 10 million years. It follows that there must have been rainforest environments in tropical East Africa before the uplift began and there is evidence to support this claim. Then, it raises the questions about how extensive these forests were, when and under which environmental conditions they started to fragment and grasslands took over. To address these questions we ran a dynamic vegetation model under experimental scenarios with varying precipitation, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration values. Our results show that even an increase of rainfall by 100% with respect to present-day conditions is not enough by itself for sustaining forest biomes at the easternmost parts of tropical East Africa. Within the range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations estimated for the late Miocene (9 Ma) [250-320 ppmv], decrease in temperature must also accompany the increase in rainfall to support the woody vegetation. Although an increase in arboreal cover at the expense of herbaceous vegetation could clearly be simulated all over the region, a continuous forest cover was only established at the south of the equator which fragmented with the decreasing rainfall and increasing temperatures in the region.",

The WIND SWE data set is used to examine the helium distributions at the shock fronts observed at the spacecraft.

As a result, relatively high frequency records are abandoned during source inversion when the length of cell is large.

We then intergrate the convolution of the interpolated functions to get the displacement. In this way, every single point on the fault plane has been considered and thus the limitation that the wavelength must far outweigh the size of cell can be removed.",

            "abstract": "Despite the abundantly clear evidence for the existence of two Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in the lower mantle, the origin, composition, and dynamics are still not well understood, nor is the relationship of the LLSVPs to the greater mantle. Observations of seismic anisotropy are often used to better understand flow in the mantle, but their utility is limited in the mostly isotropic lower mantle. An exception to this is in the lowermost mantle (D”) where observations of seismic anisotropy are numerous; however, the interpretation of such measurements in terms of dynamic processes remains challenging. Here we use observations of seismic anisotropy at the eastern edge of the African LLSVP beneath the Afar hotspot to 1) test the consistency of different mechanisms for D” anisotropy with observations, and 2) constrain the geometry of mantle flow at an LLSVP edge. Our observational data set consists of measurements of differential S-ScS and discrepant SKS-SKKS splitting, totaling 22 SKS, SKKS and ScS phases, corrected for upper mantle anisotropy. By utilizing different raypath combinations, we are able to sample the edge structure of the African LLSVP from five distinct raypath orientations, an improvement over previous work. Through forward modeling using mineral physics constraints, we find that our splitting observations are best fit by a model of crystallographically aligned post-perovskite, with the [100] axis oriented either vertically, or highly oblique to the horizontal plane. Such an alignment suggests that mantle flow at the eastern edge of the African LLSVP has an upward component, consistent with either the vertical deflection of material at the LLSVP or with sheet-like upwellings. Placing our preferred flow scenario(s) in context with other recent work, we propose that the edge of the African LLSVP acts as a barrier to mantle flow, ultimately deflecting flow upwards along the margins.",

            "abstract": "Recent research has revealed unexpected dynamical variability in the extratropical atmosphere. Work by Thompson & Woodworth (2013) and Thompson & Barnes (2014) has demonstrated the existence of a baroclinic annular mode (BAM), a 20-30 day oscillation of the zonally averaged eddy-kinetic energy (EKE). This study explores EKE oscillations in the Southern Hemisphere in the context of two distinct questions: (1) At what zonal scale does the BAM signal appear? (2) Do different regions of the Southern Hemisphere contribute more to the BAM than others?\nIn order to answer these two questions, the study uses data from two different models: the GFDL gray-radiation aquaplanet model and the GFDL-CM3 GCM. Analysis of the aquaplanet power spectra isolates the question of scale while the GFDL-CM3 analysis is used to investigate both the question of scale and geographic distribution. Results indicate EKE oscillations with peaks within the frequencies of analysis (20-30 days) to ranges as small as 35 degrees zonal width in the aquaplanet, and 120 degrees zonal width in the fully-coupled GCM. The geographic distribution of EKE in the GCM suggests the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean regions contribute more to the BAM signal. Preliminary results suggest possibile variations in frequency/period at different geographic locations that warrant further investigation. Ultimately, the scale and geographic location of EKE oscillations/the BAM may have important implications for precipitation at regional scales.",

            "abstract": "North America’s Midcontinent Rift (MCR) is traditionally considered to have formed by midplate extension and volcanism ~1.1 Ga that ended due to compression from the Grenville orogeny, the ~1.3 - ~0.98 Ga assembly of Amazonia (Precambrian northeast South America), Laurentia (Precambrian North America), and other continents into the supercontinent of Rodinia. We find that a more plausible scenario is that it formed as part of the rifting of Amazonia from Laurentia and became inactive once seafloor spreading was established. The MCR has aspects both of a continental rift - a segmented linear depression filled with sedimentary and igneous rocks - and a large igneous province (LIP). Comparison of areas and volumes for a range of continental LIPS shows that the MCR volcanic rocks are significantly thicker than the others. The MCR flood basalts have steeper dips and thicker overlying sediments than other continental flood basalts, and were deposited in a subsiding basin after most extension ended, indicating that they are better viewed as post-rift than syn-rift rocks. Hence we view the MCR as a LIP deposited in crust weakened by rifting, and thus first a rift and then a LIP.",

            "abstract": "The ~120Ma Manihiki Plateau basement consists of high-Ti tholeiitic basalts with EM-I type isotopic signatures, similar to the Singgalo basalts at Ontong Java, and low-Ti tholeiitic basalts with FOZO (Kwaimbaita/Kroenke) to HIMU-type isotopic compositions, similar to late stage volcanism on Hikurangi and Manihiki Plateaus (Hoernle et al. 2010; Timm et al. 2011). The low-Ti basalts have affinities to boninites and have been interpreted to be derived from residual mantle wedge mantle (Ingle et al. 2007). New major, volatile and trace element and radiogenic isotope data have been generated from fresh low-Ti glass samples recovered during R/V Sonne cruises SO193 and SO225. The low-Ti samples have distinctly lower Ti/V ratios compared to lavas from Ontong Java Plateau (Kwaimbaita-Kroenke and Singgalo), but similar to boninitic rocks. Glasses and melt inclusions in olivine have low volatile contents (0.12-0.25 wt% H2O). Olivine chemistry points to derivation from peridotite source. Therefore we interpret the low-Ti lavas to have formed through melting of dry and depleted peridotite at high temperatures, consistent with Timm et al (2011). The low-Ti group is characterized by U-shaped trace element patterns. The glass samples form linear mixing arrays on radiogenic isotope diagrams, pointing to the involvement of two components: 1) a component ultra-depleted in highly incompatible elements (UDC) but with intermediate Pb, Sr and Nd isotopic compositions, being similar to Kwaimbaita/Kroenke lavas from Ontong Java, and 2) an enriched component with HIMU-type incompatible element and isotopic characteristics, similar to late-stage volcanism on Manihiki, Hikurangi and Ontong Java (e.g. Hoernle et al. 2010). The ultra-depleted, FOZO-like mantle component could represent second stage melting of FOZO type mantle or re-melting of young recycled oceanic lithosphere within the plume head. Enrichment with HIMU type melts is required to explain the enrichment in the most incompatible elements and distinct U-shaped patterns of these melts. The presence of dry, boninite-like second stage melts in the Manihiki Plateau basement shows direct geochemical/petrological evidence for anomalously high temperatures in the upper mantle caused by a mantle plume.",

            "abstract": "The vast majority of in situ soil carbon efflux studies measure total CO2 evolution (RS) from soil, which consists of both heterotrophic-(RH) and autotrophic-(RA) derived carbon sources. Because RA represents recently fixed carbon that is relatively transient within the plant-soil system, partitioning RH from RA is necessary for understanding organic matter decomposition and deriving ecosystem carbon balances. Management practices and vegetation type can influence RH through the effects of soil tillage, litter inputs, root turnover, root exudates, and soil microclimate. Yet, partitioning RH and RA in the field has proven notoriously challenging, and all current methods are subject to certain biases. The root exclusion method is the most common technique for estimating RH, but removing live roots from soil can alter physical conditions and thus may bias the RH estimate. Our objective was to derive and compare in situ estimates of RH in corn (Zea mays) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) temperate bioenergy cropping systems. We hypothesized that summer RH would be greater in corn compared to switchgrass due to tillage practices and generally warmer surface soil conditions in corn. Additionally, we hypothesized that the root exclusion method would provide relatively low estimates of RH, particularly during high precipitation periods when the root exclusions may hold excess moisture. We evaluated our hypotheses in July 2014 at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center cropping systems trial in Arlington, WI, USA. Total RH averaged 50% greater in corn than in switchgrass, but the percent contribution of RH to RS was statistically similar between cropping systems at 24%. Following an abnormally wet June, RH estimates were 18% of RS, which is lower than most studies in similar cropping systems. However, as root exclusions dried out throughout July, RH gradually increased to 30% of RS. Continuing efforts will better constrain RH estimates using the root regression method and will additionally assess the effects of soil temperature and moisture on RH.",

            "abstract": "The shorelines of the Baltic Sea and the inner coastal waters in Denmark consist of many barrier islands. These sandy barrier islands were mainly formed in the Holocene and are still very dynamic. The present day changes in the morphology are dominantly governed by storm waves and associated high water levels. These storms induce collision, overwash or inundation of the barrier crest and generate wash-over fans and barrier breaching.\nIn this presentation, we focus on the present-day morphologic evolution of these barrier islands, couple these to extreme events, and we will predict the potential changes in this evolution due to changes in the climate and associated sea levels.\nWe analyzed the morphologic evolution of a series of barrier islands over the last decades using maps, aerial photographs and satellite images. This decadal morphologic evolution was coupled to the frequency and intensity of the local extreme events. The characterization of the extreme events was based on the joint probability of the extreme water levels and storm waves for the specific sites.\nThe predicted climate change for the Danish waters will lead to higher water levels and an increase of the overwashes on the barrier islands. We analyzed the vulnerability of the small barrier islands to these predicted changes. We analyzed the potential changes in the barrier island morphology in the future by defining the vulnerability of the barrier islands (volumetric approach using Lidar images and dGPS measurements), and by computing the overwash statistics from deep water wave characteristics (see Stockdon et al., 2006; 2012) and via a wave transformation model in the nearshore (e.g. XBeach). The analysis clearly showed a spatial variability of barrier island response due to the external conditions. Overall, the amount of overwash and inundation events increased and the barriers showed more overwash and inundation regimes. This will probably increase the onshore migration rates of the barriers.",

            "abstract": "Fossil coral microatolls from fringing reefs above the great (MW 8.6) megathrust rupture of 2005 record an extensive prior uplift, during the historically reported great earthquake of 1861. Such evidence spans nearly the entire 400-km strike length of the 2005 rupture, which we have shown previously to be bounded by two persistent barriers to seismic rupture. Moreover, at those sites where we have constrained the 1861 uplift, it is comparable to uplift in 2005. Thus the 1861 and 2005 ruptures appear to be nearly identical in both extent and magnitude. At one of these sites a still earlier uplift, about AD 1422, also appears to mimic the amount of uplift in 2005. The high degree of similarity among ruptures of this Nias–Simeulue section of the Sunda megathrust is unique across the 2000-km long Sumatran section of the Sunda megathrust offshore. At one site on the northwestern tip of Nias, reefs also rose during an earthquake in AD 1843, known historically for its damaging tsunami along the eastern coast of the island.\nAnother intriguing aspect of the coral records is that they demonstrate pronounced changes in rates of deformation between earthquakes. On southern Simeulue, interseismic rates of subsidence were low between 1750 and 1820 but abruptly increased three to four decades before the 1861 rupture. This may indicate that strong or deep locking of the megathrust began only a few decades before the great earthquake. More recently, Bangkaru island, near the hinge line between uplift and subsidence in 2005, switched from ~2.5 mm/yr of steady subsidence between 1956 and 1966, to ~8 mm/yr of steady uplift until 1981, and then reverted to ~2.5 mm/yr of steady subsidence until the coseismic uplift of 2005. These observations might be explained by a 15-year slow slip event under Bangkaru.",

            "abstract": "As climate change is felt around the world, research indicates that developing countries bear the greatest impacts. Scientists have long been building models, applications, and tools to assist with climate change mitigation, adaptation and extreme event early warning systems, but too often these programs and products do not reach their intended user groups, or may not take into account the realities of developing countries. Less common are models and applications built or developed collaboratively with the intended users, particularly those at the local level. The SERVIR Program, a unique partnership between NASA and the US Agency for International Development (USAID),is attempting to change that. The SERVIR Program works to improve resilience to climate change by strengthening the capacity of governments and other key stakeholders to integrate Earth observation information and geospatial technologies into development decision-making. Working in partnership with regional institutions around the world, SERVIR develops geospatial tools and decision-support applications while concurrently building the capacity of local analysts and decision-makers to utilize them. In many cases, these same users are helping shape the tools that provide them with critical information. In this session we will present two case studies from the Eastern and Southern Africa and Hindu Kush-Himalaya regions that demonstrates the transformation of science into applied decision-making, and the impacts those decisions are having across geographic scales, from the regional and national level to the village level.",

            "abstract": "A number of deep underground laboratories exist around the world, all originally developed to advance our understanding of the Universe. They were built to host ‘low-background’ Astroparticle Physics experiments, needing to be shielded from interference produced by cosmic radiation. These unique infrastructures show great diversity in terms of depth, size, and geological and environmental characteristics.\nOver the last decade, the four European deep underground laboratories – LSM in France, LSC in Spain, LNGS in Italy and Boulby in the UK – supported by their funding agencies, have been making great efforts to get integrated into a single distributed research infrastructure. At the same time, they have been asking “how can our facilities, primarily built for Astroparticle Physics, be used to tackle global challenges?”. Astroparticle Physicists have wide experience in forming long-term large international collaborations, developing innovative technologies, building unique facilities and organising data handling, reduction, storage and analysis: all of these were put to the disposal of scientists from other disciplines. As a result, a number of very interesting multidisciplinary projects have been hosted in the labs with excellent scientific results: geologists, climatologists, environmental scientists and biologists from academia and public authorities have all used these deep underground environments. Even more recently, the four European labs have decided to go one step further: in order to treat global challenges, global cooperation is necessary, so they are trying to unite the global deep underground science community around these multidisciplinary synergies.\nThe objective of this talk is to present the bottom-up policy adopted by these world-leading European research infrastructures related to global environmental change, including some of the most interesting scientific results received so far (e.g. muon tide detector for continuous, passive monitoring of offshore CO2 deep storage sites, radionuclide dating of lake sediments to understand climate change, detectors of large flood events to alert civil protection authorities, etc). It is believed that these efforts could greatly contribute to the FutureEarth Initiative.",

            "abstract": "The prereversal enhancement of the vertical plasma drift in the postsunset sector is an important factor that controls the generation of equatorial plasma bubbles. In this study, we use the measurements of the ion velocity meter (IVM) on board the Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite to identify the postsunset ion vertical drift and its effects on the occurrence of plasma bubbles. We only include the events when C/NOFS is located within ±5o from the magnetic equator during the interval of 1800-1900 LT and lower than 500 km in altitude. In total, we identified 886 events in which plasma bubbles were detected by C/NOFS between 1900 and 2100 LT and 1170 events in which no plasma bubbles were detected during May 2008-June 2013. The ion vertical drift is almost always upward for the 886 cases of occurrence of plasma bubbles, with a mean value of ~40 m/s. The mean ion vertical drift for bubble occurrence increases with the solar radio flux and varies with longitude. The mean ion vertical drift for the cases without plasma bubbles is smaller than 20 m/s, with minimum values near 60o and 300o longitude, respectively. There is some overlap in the ion vertical drift between the two categories, with plasma bubbles and without plasma bubbles. The occurrence probability of plasma bubbles increases with the ion upward drift when the ion drift is within 0 and 40 m/s. ",

            "abstract": "Recent catastrophic tsunamis in the last decade, as well as the 50th anniversary of the 1964 Alaskan event, have heightened awareness of the threats these natural hazards present to large and increasing coastal populations. For communities located close to the earthquake epicenter that generated the tsunami, strong shaking may also cause significant infrastructure damage, impacting the road network and hampering evacuation. There may also be insufficient time between the earthquake and first wave arrival to rely on a coordinated evacuation, leaving at-risk populations to self-evacuate on foot and across the landscape. Emergency managers evaluating these coastal risks need tools to assess the evacuation potential of low-lying areas in order to discuss mitigation options, which may include vertical evacuation structures to provide local safe havens in vulnerable communities.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey has developed the Pedestrian Evacuation Analyst software tool for use by researchers and emergency managers to assist in the assessment of a community’s evacuation potential by modeling travel times across the landscape and producing both maps of travel times and charts of population counts with corresponding times. The tool uses an anisotropic (directionally dependent) least cost distance model to estimate evacuation potential and allows for the variation of travel speed to measure its effect on travel time. The effectiveness of vertical evacuation structures on evacuation time can also be evaluated and compared with metrics such as travel time maps showing each structure in place and graphs displaying the percentage change in population exposure for each structure against the baseline. Using the tool, travel time maps and at-risk population counts have been generated for some coastal communities of the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The tool can also be used to provide valuable decision support for tsunami vertical evacuation siting.",

            "abstract": "Crystal-hosted melt inclusions are able to preserve information about the geochemical diversity of melts present within magmatic systems, including information about both the oxygen fugacity (fO2) of their mantle source and the redox evolution of their carrier melt. However, the ferric iron proportions (Fe3+/ΣFe) measured in olivine-hosted melt inclusions are partially controlled by post-entrapment processes, such that inclusions may no longer preserve a record of the fO2 at which they were trapped. Post-entrapment crystallisation (PEC) of olivine onto the inclusion walls during cooling sequesters Fe2+ into olivine. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions may also maintain H2O and fO2equilibrium with their external environment via coupled proton and metal vacancy diffusion through the olivine crystal lattice.\nIn this study we present a combination of XANES, major, trace and volatile element (C, H, S, F, Cl) analyses from a suite of 100 olivine-hosted melt inclusions from the AD 1783 Laki eruption, Iceland. The inclusions are hosted in Fo86-Fo68 olivines, and have experienced up to a maximum of 7% PEC. They preserve a diverse range of melt compositions similar to that seen in global mid-ocean ridge basalts. Composition-dependent CO2-H2O solubility models have been used to determine the pressures of inclusion trapping. Many of the melt inclusions have experienced diffusive H+ re-equilibration with their external environment: trace element depleted inclusions with low initial H2O concentrations have gained H+ via diffusive exchange with a more H2O-rich carrier melt, which is a consequence of concurrent mixing and crystallisation of diverse primary melt compositions in the Laki magmatic system. This sample set therefore presents a unique opportunity to deconvolve the post-entrapment crystallisation and diffusion processes that modify Fe3+/ΣFe in olivine-hosted melt inclusions, permitting the recovery of the true extent of magmatic redox variability present at the time of inclusion trapping.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic region has proven to be more responsive to recent changes in climate than other parts of the Earth. A key component of the Arctic climate is the Greenland ice sheet (GIS), which has the potential to dramatically influence sea level, depending on the amount of melting that occurs, as well as climate, through shifts in the regional radiation balance. Light-absorbing aerosols from biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and dust sources can potentially have a significant impact on the radiation balance of the GIS; however, in order to better understand their impact, it is important to first understand the annual trends of light-absorbing aerosols and their sources over the ice sheet. With this in mind, aerosol properties including the wavelength dependent aerosol light scattering and absorption coefficients have been continuously measured at Summit, Greenland since the spring of 2011.\nThese measurements will be used to calculate the multi-wavelength single-scattering albedo (ω0) and absorption Ångström exponent, identify annual patterns of aerosols over the GIS and how they vary from year to year, detect events of high absorption, and determine the sources of the aerosols. Preliminary findings indicate that the aerosols have an absorption Ångström exponent of approximately 1, which is characteristic of black carbon (BC). Absorption and scattering coefficients are higher in the spring and summer (March-September) and consequently lower in the fall and winter (September-March). Absorption and single-scattering albedo are averaged over the sunlit months of April-August and are found to be highest and lowest, respectively, in the year of 2012, corresponding to the year of record melt extent over the GIS.",

            "abstract": "Strong mantle plumes arising from the deep mantle can impose stresses on the continents, thereby facilitating continental rifting and disrupting the supercontinent cycle (Storey, Nature 1995; Santosh et al., Gondwana Research 2009). In recent years, several studies have characterized the relation between the location of the plumes and the continents, but with contradicting observations. While Heron and Lowman (GRL, 2010; Tectonophysics, 2011) propose regions where downwelling has ceased (irrespective of overlying plate) as the preferred location for plumes, O’Neill et al. (Gondwana Research, 2009) show an anti-correlation between the average positions of subducting slabs at continental margins, and mantle plumes at continental/oceanic interiors.\nExtent of continental motion depends on the heat budget of the mantle (CMB heat flux, radiogenic heating, mantle cooling). CMB heat flux is not well defined; however, the recent determination of core's high thermal conductivity requires a CMB heat flow of at least 12 TW (de Koker et al., PNAS 2012; Pozzo et al., Nature 2012; Gomi et al., PEPI 2013), much higher than early estimates of 3-4 TW (Lay et al., Nature 2008). Thus, it is necessary to characterize the effect of increased CMB heat flux on mantle dynamics.\nIn almost all mantle convection simulations, the top boundary is treated as a free-slip surface whereas Earth's surface is a deformable free surface. Unlike free-slip, a free surface boundary condition allows for the development of topography and leads to realistic single-sided (asymmetric) subduction (Crameri et al., GJI 2012; Crameri et al., GRL 2012).\nUsing StagYY code (Tackley, PEPI 2008), we test (i) the impact of increased basal heating on mantle dynamics with continents and self-consistent plate tectonics, including whether plumes prefer to develop under continents; (ii) the influence of a free surface on continents using the ‘sticky air’ approach, in which a low density and a small viscosity fluid layer is added to the top of the model. The existing model from Rolf et al. (EPSL 2012) is developed further but with weaker continents.",

            "abstract": "Abrupt droughts in West Africa impart significant socio-economic impacts on the developing countries of this region, and yet a comprehensive understanding of the causes and duration of such droughts remains elusive. Much of the summertime rainfall associated with the West African Monsoon (WAM) falls within the Niger River basin and eventually drains into the eastern Gulf of Guinea, contributing to the low sea-surface salinity of this region. Of the limited number of studies that reconstruct Gulf of Guinea salinity through the deglacial, the most comprehensive of those is located ~ 400 km east of the Niger delta and may not be solely influenced by WAM runoff. Here, we present XRF and foraminiferal trace metal data from two new cores located less than 100 km from the Western Niger Delta. Radiocarbon dating of cores Grand 21 (4.72oN, 4.48oE) and Fan 17 (4.81oN, 4.41oE) produced near linear sedimentation rates of 20 cm/kyr and 15 cm/kyr respectively. Elemental sediment compositions from XRF core scanning reveal an abrupt 50% increase in SiO2 between 17-15 ka during Heinrich Event 1. This increase, coeval with increases of CaCO3 (+12%) content and Ba/Ti ratios suggests a large increase in primary productivity during H1. Values then decrease at the onset of the Bolling-Allerod (~14.6 kyr) until a similar, albeit smaller increase is recorded during the Younger Dryas beginning at 12.7 kyr. In contrast, FeO2 and TiO2 are thought to be a proxies of Niger River discharge strength and suggest a more gradual change in riverine discharge across the deglacial that is most likely driven by precession. These proxies suggest Niger River runoff was low from the LGM through Heinrich 1, gradually increasing around 13 ka. FeO2 and TiO2 values then peak between 11.5-7.5 kyr, consistent with the African Humid Period, before gradually decreasing through the mid-late Holocene. This deglacial pattern of riverine input is markedly different from previous reconstructions of WAM variability and does not appear to explain the large increases in primary production during H1 or the YD. To further investigate Niger River runoff and water column hydrography change in the Niger Delta across the deglacial, we will also present data from three planktonic foraminifera: Globigerinoides ruber, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Globorotalia crassaformis.",

            "abstract": "Monterey Bay, California is the location of recurring harmful algal blooms. These massive growths of phytoplankton occur in the Northeastern portion of the bay, known as the “incubator”, and have been shown to harm the entire food chain with neurotoxins. A significant source of nutrients is needed by algal blooms, and could be from submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). SGD is the ubiquitous movement of groundwater from the land into the sea and is a mixture of freshwater and seawater which has entered the coastal aquifer. Previous studies have shown that SGD at one site in the incubator contains nutrients for phytoplankton similar to the Redfield ratio, which induces phytoplankton growth in the bay. This study aims to determine whether SGD in other locations throughout the incubator are also similar to Redfield ratios, thereby making SGD a viable source of nutrients to phytoplankton throughout the bay. In the northernmost beaches of the incubator, nitrate was depleted relative to silicate. However, transformations in the groundwater in the coastal aquifer pushed the Redfield ratios closer to the ideal. In the southward beaches, the ratios shifted and both silicate and phosphate were depleted compared to nitrate. These findings illustrate the impact of SGD on the health of both a foundation and potential killer in the Monterey Bay food chain.",

            "abstract": "Mauritia flexuosa is one of the most widely distributed palms in the Neotropics. They are found in in warm, wet lowland environments ranging from dense tropical rainforests to monospecific communities restricted to flooded drainage basins. The monospecific stands of M. flexuosa communities provide structural complexity and habitat diversity for unique terrestrial and aquatic flora and fauna. These communities contribute to enhanced Neotropical diversity from both a taxonomic (α- diversity) and landscape (β-diversity) perspective. Conservation plans have begun to target M. flexuosa palm wetlands as potential refugia and their role in protection of watersheds. However, the long-term development and evolution of these systems is poorly understood. Numerous paleoecological studies from Amazonia suggest that the present day species distribution of M. flexuosa underwent a dramatic increase during the Late Holocene (after ca. 3000 cal yr. BP) that is often coupled with an increased in charcoal accumulation. Some researchers have interpreted these data as evidence for extensive human landscape modification. However, archaeological evidence supporting human landscape modification of M. flexuosa habitats is lacking. To investigate the long-term development of M. flexuosa, a 15,000-year high-resolution sedimentary record was analyzed for charcoal, phytolith and isotope data from Huanchaca Mesetta, Bolivia. To date, there is no evidence for human modification on the plateau, thus this records provides a control study to investigate the role of natural climate variability in the evolution of M. flexuosa communities. Increased insolation driven by Milankovitch precessional forcing resulted in an expansion of the South American Summer Monsoon, increased precipitation and a lengthening of the wet season, supporting the establishment of the modern palm swamp vegetation after 5,000 cal yr BP. Increased charcoal accumulation is likely associated with increased lightning ignitions that accompanied the expanded SASM. The paleofire and vegetation history from Huanchaca Mesetta provides conservationists, land-managers, and policy makers a context for understanding ecological response of M. flexuosa communities to increased warmth and drought stress expected for the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "In the summer of 2012, the Central Plains of the United States experienced one of its most severe droughts on record. This study uses satellite data from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to document several geophysical parameters including land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), cloud fraction, and total rainfall associated with the drought and human response to the drought (irrigation). Non-irrigated areas often showed 5 K LST increases and negative NDVI anomalies (compared to summer 2002-2011 averages) while irrigated areas showed < 2 K LST anomalies and NDVI anomalies near zero. As expected, the cloud fraction anomaly is negative nearly everywhere in the domain. However, the largest reduction in cloud fraction is found over the heavily-irrigated area, which conflicts with several previous modeling studies showing an increase in cloud fraction over irrigated areas. This could be explained by a hypothesis that the temperature gradient between irrigated and non-irrigated areas is strong enough during severe drought to produce a local circulation (similar to land/sea breezes) that results in an atmospheric downdraft over the irrigated area. To test this hypothesis, reanalysis data, including ERA-Interim data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), are examined and WRF simulations are conducted to interpret the observational data and evaluate the hypothesis previously discussed.",

            "abstract": "Laboratory, field-, and satellite-based visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy allows for rapid, remote, and non-destructive analysis of geologic materials to identify mineralogy as well as organic compounds. This type of analysis has potential to aid the search for organics on Mars as a means of first detection of reduced carbon, or to study organic matter nondestructively in valuable samples such as meteorites. In order to assess potential applications of this method we aim to answer fundamental questions about detection limits and quantification of organic matter using reflectance spectroscopy. Laboratory mixtures and natural samples are measured for total organic carbon (TOC in wt.%) with standard methods and reflectance spectroscopy. Absorption features due to C-H2 and C-H3 bonds are observed in the 3.3 to 3.5μm (3000 to 2850 cm-1) wavelength region. A strong H2O feature near 3μm, as well as carbonate-related absorptions near 3.4µm, are also found in this spectral region and can complicate detection of organic material, particularly at low TOC values. In natural samples without carbonate there appears to be a linear trend between TOC and the band depth of organic absorptions; samples that have low albedo, or strong 3μm water features deviate from this trend line. Spectra of samples with carbonate may be modeled with Gaussians to remove the influence of the carbonate features and better match the organic absorption trend. Early results indicate that quantification of organic matter in natural fine-grained samples using reflectance spectroscopy will need to take low-albedo components and water content into account. Detection limits may also depend on these properties; organic absorption features are clearly seen in the lowest TOC sample measured so far (0.08wt% or 800ppm), which is a relatively bright, carbonate-free, quartz- and clay-dominated outcrop sample. A series of laboratory experiments have been undertaken in which known amounts of organic compounds are mixed with smectitic clay in order to understand detection limits and the effects of albedo and hydration in a controlled setting. These laboratory results are compared with findings from natural samples that represent a wide range of ages and depositional settings.",

            "abstract": "How flat slab geometries are generated has been long debated. It has been suggested thattrenchward motion of thick cratons in some areas of South America and Cenozoic NorthAmerica progressively closed the asthenospheric wedge and induced flat subduction. Here wedevelop time-dependent numerical experiments to explore how trenchward motion of thickcratons may result in flat subduction. We find that as the craton approaches the trench andthe wedge closes, two opposite phenomena control slab geometry: the suction between oceanand continent increases, favoring slab flattening, while the mantle confined within the closingwedge dynamically pushes the slab backward and steepens it. When the slab retreats, as inthe Peru and Chile flat slabs, the wedge closure rate and dynamic push are small and suctionforces generate, in some cases, flat subduction. We model the past 30 m.y. of subduction in theChilean flat slab area and demonstrate that trenchward motion of thick lithosphere, 200–300km, currently ~700–800 km away from the Peru-Chile Trench, reproduces a slab geometrythat fits the stress pattern, seismicity distribution, and temporal and spatial evolution ofdeformation and volcanism in the region. We also suggest that varying trench kinematics mayexplain some differing slab geometries along South America. When the trench is stationaryor advances, the mantle flow within the closing wedge strongly pushes the slab backward andsteepens it, possibly explaining the absence of flat subduction in the Bolivian orocline.",

However, the VDA systems suffer from several limitations: (1) It is difficult to derive adjoint models in the VDA models, (2) It is time-consuming to compute flow-dependent background error covariance, and (3) VDA schemes cannot directly provide the uncertainty of estimates. To overcome these shortcomings, an Ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) data assimilation framework was developed and tested extensively over six FLUXNET sites with grassland, cropland and forest land cover types. The state augmentation approach is used to estimate both the model parameters and state simultaneously. Land surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES) are assimilated into the EnKS scheme. The results illustrated that the EnKS model can predict surface energy fluxes well over different sites with various hydrological conditions and land cover types. Moreover, the results from EnKS are compared with those of VDA. The comparison shows that VDA performs slightly better than the EnKS model, implying that EnKS performs marginally suboptimal.",

            "abstract": "Observations of Mercury's local plasma environment by MESSENGER have revealed that the planet hosts a strongly asymmetric magnetosphere as a result of an off-axis dipolar or quadrupolar internal field, and significant finite Larmor radius effects at the boundary layer between magnetospheric and solar wind plasma environments. One important asymmetry appears in the growth and evolution of Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves at the dawn and dusk flanks of the magnetopause. Linear analysis and global hybrid simulations support a dusk-dawn asymmetry in the growth rate caused by finite Larmor radius effects, and indeed K-H waves have been exclusively observed at the dusk magnetopause during northward IMF. Observations of these K-H waves at sodium gyro-scales invites investigation into the impact of the hot planetary sodium ion population, itself distributed preferentially on the dusk flank, on the growth of the K-H instability and associated plasma transport. We present local two- and three-dimensional hybrid simulations of the dusk and dawn boundary layers, with varying magnetospheric sodium ion number density, and examine the associated changes in the growth rates of the K-H instability, K-H wave spectra, and cross-boundary particle transport. We show that gyroresonance between growing K-H vortices and sodium ion gyration introduces a strong spectral peak at sodium gyro-scales at the dusk magnetopause, that an increase in sodium ion number density increases dawn-dusk asymmetry of K-H growth rates, and that cross-boundary particle transport increases with sodium number density.",

            "abstract": "This work describes numerical models of advection/diffusion between enclaves and host magmas, applied with the aim of estimating time-scales during which enclaves can be homogenised. In particular, advection was simulated using a numerical system consisting of regular and chaotic regions. Results indicate that the homogenisation time of enclaves in chaotic regions is several orders of magnitude faster than in regular regions. For instance, an enclave with a diameter of 100 cm may be homogenised in the chaotic region in about 380 years, assuming an advection velocity of 10 cm/year, whereas in the regular region it would require 6.5×10^5 years for complete homogenisation. This implies that, in the same magmatic system, large differences in the degree of homogenisation may coexist, generating magmatic masses with large spatial and temporal inhomogeneities.\nThe results of this study may have significant petrological and volcanological implications. From a petrological point of view, mafic enclaves dispersed in felsic host rocks are regarded as portions of mafic magma which, trapped inside regular regions, survived the hybridisation process. Instead, host rocks are regarded as regions where efficient mixing dynamics generated hybrid magmas. The fact that a single magmatic mass may display large compositional differences at the same time undermines the assumption of most geochemical models, which assume the temporal and spatial homogeneity of the magma body. From the volcanological perspective, the presence of magmatic enclaves in volcanic rocks allows us to estimate the mixing times of magmas by analysing chemical diffusion patterns between host rocks and enclaves.",

This carbon is vulnerable to release to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4 as high-latitude temperatures warm. Microtopographic features, such as polygonal ground, are characteristic sources of landscape heterogeneity in the Alaskan Arctic coastal plain. In a future warmer climate, the spatial distribution of soil moisture and active layer depth are expected to be key factors controlling the fate of thawed permafrost carbon. Polygonal ground structures, with high or low centers, dominate the local hydrologic environment, thereby impacting the energy balance, biogeochemical dynamics, vegetation communities, and carbon releases from the subsurface. In spite of their importance to local hydrologic and thermal processes, the impact of these microtopographic features at larger spatial scales is not well understood. Our previous work from isothermal surface-subsurface simulations has indicated that statistical moments of soil moisture follow a non-linear scaling relationship. In this study, we perform surface-subsurface non-isothermal flow simulations using PFLOTRAN for four study sites located near Barrow, AK. Simulations are performed on domains at multiple horizontal resolutions for several years. We describe the statistical moments of simulated soil moisture and soil temperature fields across spatial resolutions.",

            "abstract": "Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) are often conducted to evaluate the worth of existing data and data yet to be collected from proposed new missions. As missions increasingly require a broader ``Earth systems'' focus, it is important that the OSSEs capture the potential benefits of the observations on end-use applications. Towards this end, the results from the OSSEs must also be evaluated with a suite of metrics that capture the value, uncertainty, and information content of the observations while factoring in both science and societal impacts. In this presentation, we present the development of an end-to-end and end-use application oriented OSSE platform using the capabilities of the NASA Land Information System (LIS) developed for terrestrial hydrology. Four case studies that demonstrate the capabilities of the system will be presented: (1) A soil moisture OSSE that employs simulated L-band measurements and examines their impacts towards applications such as floods and droughts. The experiment also uses a decision-theory based analysis to assess the economic utility of observations towards improving drought and flood risk estimates, (2) A GPM-relevant study quantifies the impact of improved precipitation retrievals from GPM towards improving landslide forecasts, (3) A case study that examines the utility of passive microwave soil moisture observations towards weather prediction, and (4) OSSEs used for developing science requirements for the GRACE-2 mission. These experiments also demonstrate the value of a comprehensive modeling environment such as LIS for conducting end-to-end OSSEs by linking satellite observations, physical models, data assimilation algorithms and end-use application models in a single integrated framework.",

The meticulous, extensive and high-quality climate record maintained at this location has included the measurement of wind among many other parameters since its earliest days, and this provides a unique opportunity to examine wind speed trends at this site over nearly 130 years. Although multiple wind sensors have been in use during this time and the height of the anemometers was raised in 1908, the wind records have been made as consistent as possible through careful analysis of these changes and the application of adjustments to ensure consistency. The 30-year mean wind speed at this location has decreased from 6.8 m s-1 in the middle 20th century to its present value of 6.0 m s-1 with an increase in the rate of the decline beginning around 1980. The wind speed time series shows a significant (p < 0.05) downward trend over the entire period from 1885-2013 (-0.085 m s-1 decade-1) that is stronger and also significant for the sub-periods from 1961-2013 (-0.266 m s-1 decade-1) and 1979-2008 (-0.342 m s-1 decade-1). This declining trend persists in all seasons and has significant implications for the efficiency of wind power generation in the area, if it reflects a regional change in the near-surface wind regime. The wind instruments in use since the 19th century will be described, and the official long-term record will be compared with measurements from other wind sensors at the Observatory and surrounding locations. In addition, initial investigations of the possible causes of the wind speed decline will be presented in the context of global stilling (i.e. the theory of a widespread decline in measured near-surface wind speed), including an analysis of the wind speed change as a function of wind direction.",

Both gases and the secondary pollutants they produce (particulate matter, PM2.5, and tropospheric ozone) are among USEPA designated criteria pollutants, posing serious threats to human health and the environment (e.g., acid rain, plant damage, and reduced visibility).\nA new generation of the OMI standard SO2 and NO2 products (based on critically improved DOAS spectral fitting for NO2 and innovative Principal Component Analysis method for SO2) provides a valuable dataset for studying anthropogenic pollution on local to global scales. Here we highlight some of the OMI observed long-term changes in air quality over several regions.\nOver the US, average NO2 and SO2 pollution levels have decreased dramatically as a result of both technological improvements (e.g., catalytic converters on cars) and stricter regulations of emissions. We see continued decline in NO2 and SO2 pollution over Europe. Over China OMI observed a ~ 60% increase in NO2 pollution between 2005 and 2013, despite a temporary reversal of the growing trend due to both 2008 Olympic Games and the economic recession in 2009. Chinese SO2 pollution seems to have stabilized since peaking in 2007, probably due to government efforts to curb SO2 emissions from the power sector. We have also observed large increases in both SO2 and NO2 pollution particularly in Eastern India where a number of new large coal power plants have been built in recent years. We expect that further improvements in the OMI NO2 and SO2 products will allow more robust quantification of long-term trends in local to global air quality.",

            "abstract": "Foreland arches’ particular placement far inland relative to active subduction boundaries prompts this long-standing question: do these arches form as a result of lithospheric rheology inherent in the zone between more ancient mobile belts and cratons, or do they result from stress⁄strength conditions driven by more recent processes, such as low-angle subduction? The Sierras Pampeanas basement-cored uplifts in Argentina correspond spatially with present-day low angle subduction, which many consider an analogue for western U.S. Laramide basement arches uplifted contemporaneously with low-angle subduction ˜50 Ma. However, significant questions remain about the lithospheric rheology of the two regions, in particular, how much have they been modified by subduction processes? Seismic anisotropy can potentially indicate how continental lithospheres above subduction zones deform or resist deformation in response to stress, and therefore may constrain possibilities for lithospheric rheology. We contrast two comparable shear wave splitting datasets, for the Sierras Pampeanas and Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, to examine the similarity of continental lithospheric structure in these two regions. Heterogeneous shear wave splitting patterns for Wyoming suggest the existence of Archean lithosphere preserved under the region, supported by seismic fast directions consistent with expected patterns resulting from Wyoming craton assembly orogenic events. Regional tomography shows a thick zone of fast velocity upper mantle, also consistent with ancient lithospheric mantle. In contrast, seismic anisotropy for the Sierras Pampeanas is more homogeneous over a similarly-sized region, with fast directions inconsistent with our expectations for patterns resulting from the assembly of the Andean foreland, and quite consistent with modern deformation expected to result from subduction processes. Seismic wavespeeds indicate that much of the Sierras Pampeanas is not underlain by pristine ancient continental lithosphere, having been modified significantly by the subduction process. These comparisons indicate that different histories accompany the lithospheres of deformed foreland regions, and if these lithospheres have a similar rheology, there are multiple ways to produce such a rheology.",

            "abstract": "Soils in the Arctic store up to 50% of global soil organic carbon (C) (1,672 Pg C) and more than twice the amount of C currently present in the atmosphere. At the core of this enormous C pool is the large fraction of C that has been frozen in permafrost and disconnected from the active C cycle. As the Arctic undergoes warming and wetting, permafrost C is at risk of being transferred to the atmosphere, resulting in a strong positive feedback to global climate. One of the most commonly observed responses to climate warming in the Arctic is an increase in woody shrub growth and corresponding changes in the surface energy budget and shifts in belowground processes. Increased shrub cover is accompanied by a number of soil physical and chemical changes, including decreased growing season soil temperature due to soil shading, warmer winter soil temperature due to snow accumulation around shrubs, and increased rooting depth. Therefore, shrub expansion may feedback to alter the amount of C stored in arctic ecosystems, but the direction and magnitude of this potential feedback are highly uncertain.\nTo address this uncertainty, we established four sites across a shrub cover gradient near Toolik Lake, AK, USA, ranging from herbaceous tussock to deciduous shrub tundra. At each site we measured the rate and isotope composition (13C/12C, 14C/12C) of ecosystem, root and microbial respiration with chambers and incubations, the concentration and isotope composition of soil CO2 with wells, and the C and N concentration and isotopic composition of bulk organic matter in the active layer and upper permafrost with EA-IRMS. We used the isotope values to partition ecosystem CO2 emissions into respiration from plants, young surface soil, and old deep soil. We found that rates of ecosystem respiration increase with increasing shrub cover. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that the proportional contribution of plants and old soil to ecosystem respiration changes with increasing shrub density. Taken together, our results suggest that ongoing shrub expansion will alter permafrost C dynamics in arctic ecosystems. Forthcoming winter measurements will provide insights into the consequences of shrub expansion for the annual C budget of the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The observed trends in the Midwestern United States of increasing rainfall variability will likely continue into the future. Events such as individual days of heavy rain as well as seasons of floods and droughts have large impacts on agricultural productivity and the natural resource base that underpins it. Such events lead to increased soil erosion, decreased water quality and reduced corn and soybean yields. Winter cover crops offer the potential to buffer many of these impacts because they essentially double the time for a living plant to protect and improve the soil. However, at present, cover crops are infrequently utilized in the Midwest (representing 1-2% of row cropped land cover) in particular due to producer concerns over higher costs and management, limited time and winter growing conditions as well as the potential harm to corn yields. In order to expand their use, there is a need to quantify how cover crops impact Midwest cropping systems in the long term and namely to understand how to optimize the benefits of cover crops while minimizing their impacts on cash crops. We are working with APSIM, a cropping systems platform, to specifically quantify the long term future impacts of cover crop incorporation in corn-based cropping systems. In general, our regional analysis showed only minor changes to corn and soybean yields (<1% differences) when a cover crop was or was not included in the simulation. Further, a “bad spring” scenario (where every third year had an abnormally wet/cold spring and cover crop termination and planting cash crop were within one day) did not result in any major changes to cash crop yields. Through simulations we estimate an average increase of 4-9% organic matter improvement in the topsoil and an average decrease in soil erosion of 14-32% depending on cover crop planting date and growth. Our work is part of the Climate and Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated Agriculture Project (CSCAP), a collaboration of eleven Midwestern institutions established to evaluate how conservation practices, including cover crops, improve the resilience of Midwest agriculture to future change. Such collaborations can help better quantify long term impacts of conservation practices on the landscape that ultimately lead to more climate-smart management of such agricultural systems.",

            "abstract": "Concentrations of dissolved 230Th, 231Pa and 232Th measured along the US GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect between Peru and Tahiti illustrate the enhanced scavenging of trace elements by particles derived from the hydrothermal plume that spreads westward from the East Pacific Rise (EPR). Concentrations of dissolved 230Th and 231Pa increase linearly with depth in the upper 2 km of the water column, consistent with their removal by reversible scavenging. The intensity of scavenging by plume particles is quantified by comparing the predicted (extrapolated) concentration of dissolved 230Th at the core depth of the plume (30 to 35 fg/kg) with measured concentrations. Within the core of the plume, measured concentrations of dissolved 230Th are 8 fg/kg at a distance of approx. 1200 km to the west of the EPR, and 12 fg/kg at a distance approx 2500 km to the west of the ridge, much less than the predicted value. Particles derived from the EPR plume potentially impact the scavenging and removal of many trace elements from the deep ocean over a broad area of the eastern tropical South Pacific.",

            "abstract": "We study the 79north (Nioghalvfjerdsbræ) and Zachariæ Isstrøm sector of the Greenland Ice Sheet using a combination of satellite and Operation IceBridge (OIB) remote sensing data and numerical ocean modeling. Around 2004, the southern portion of the floating ice tongue of Zachariæ Isstrøm began to break up, presumably due to changes in sea-ice/ocean conditions in the northeast. While the floating portion of the glacier started to speed up in response to the reduction in ice shelf buttressing, it was not until 2012 that the velocity of the grounded portion increased significantly. In 2014, the glacier is calving at its grounding line, which retreated 5 km in 1996-2011. The southern ice tongue is gone, and the northern ice tongue is detached from the glacier. We use satellite-derived ice velocity and refined ice thickness based on mass conservation to estimate discharge of these glaciers. We compare the results with RACMO surface mass balance and reconstruct the mass balance of this sector for the period 1992-2014 to show that most mass loss picked up after 2012, not in the earlier 2000's as stated in a recent study. We reconstruct the sea floor bathymetry beneath the former ice shelves for the first time using OIB gravity data. The results reveal the natural passages of subsurface warm waters and help constrain the simulation of ice shelf melt rates. The grounding line of 79north also retreated in 1996-2011, but its flow speed has remained constant. We attribute this contrasting evolution of the two glaciers to a difference in sea floor bathymetry, which allows an intrusion of larger amounts of warm subsurface waters for Zachariæ since the early 2000s, but limits access of such currents for 79north. The latter will likely undergo a fast recession until its grounding reaches a topographic barrier about 30 km upstream, where ice retreat will temporarily slow down. We conclude that since about 2012, major change in glacier dynamics have started to hit north Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric Data Assimilation Four-Dimensional (IDA4D) is a continuous-time, three-dimensional imaging algorithm that can produce 4D electron density specifications for various science investigations [e.g.,  Bust et al., 2007]. IDA4D is based on three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation [Daley and Barker, 2001]. The algorithm combines various data sources and their associated error covariances with a background model (in this case the IRI) and its covariances to produce an ionospheric specification with formal uncertainties. IDA4D employs a Gauss- Markov Kalman filter technique similar to that used by operational assimilation models. The model can ingest a broad spectrum of data types that are either linearly or non-linearly related to electron density, including ground-based TEC, space-based TEC as measured by GPS occultation sensors and UV emissions associated with nightside recombination of O+.\nIDA4D has been undergoing testing at The Aerospace Corporation to determine its performance with respect to combinations of input data sets under different conditions (solar minimum, solar maximum, geomagnetic activity). The results presented here summarize the performance of IDA4D when UV data is ingested, both with and without additional TEC measurements. The UV data used in the study summarized here are 135.6 nm emissions measured the SSUSI instruments on F16 and F18 DMSP. We discuss the process by which UV data is ingested into IDA4D, including data binning, error estimation and correction of 135.6 nm contamination from mutual neutralization of O+ and O-. Model performance is then assessed using comparisons to various ground truth data, including ISR data, Jason VTEC, CNOF/S in-situ plasma density and ionosonde-derived NmF2 values. The results of this study show that UV data improves model performance, particularly when TEC data coverage is sparse.\nBust, G. S., G. Crowley, T. W. Garner, T. L. Gaussiran II, R. W. Meggs, C. N.

            "abstract": "Texas teachers have expressed a need for engaging activities for use in high school Earth science courses. With funding from the NSF, geoscience and education faculty from different institutions around the state collaborated with ten Earth science teachers to create five online Earth science instructional blueprints. The work is part of the DIG (Diversity and Innovation for Geosciences) Texas Instructional Blueprint project. A blueprint stitches together nine units for a yearlong Earth science course (scope and sequence). Each unit covers three weeks of teaching and contains lectures, readings, visualizations, lab investigations, learning activities, and other educational materials from credible sources, which are aligned with Texas state science standards for Earth and Space Science and the Earth Science Literacy Principles. Taken together, the collection of activities address the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).\nDuring summer 2014, three minority-serving secondary teachers completed a six-week internship at The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG). As DIG Texas Education Interns, we organized and revised the content of the units, created scaffolding notes, and built blueprints by selecting groups of nine units from the project’s current collection of twenty-one units. Because fieldwork is an important element of geoscience learning, we integrated virtual field trips into each unit. We (1) gained expertise in selecting high quality activities that directly correlate with state standards and address the Earth Science Literacy Principles; (2) developed a keen awareness of the value of the NGSS; (3) learned how to navigate through the NGSS website to track the relationships between the Science and Engineering Practices, Disciplinary Core Ideas, and Crosscutting Concepts for Earth science, as well as connections to other disciplines in the same grade level. Collaborating with other secondary Earth science teachers introduced each of us to new teaching practices, allowing us to build relationships that we expect to last for many years. UTIG researchers mentored and introduced us to their research and methodology. In addition, they helped us find high quality activities for the units. In turn, we shared our knowledge of pedagogy and classroom expertise with them.",

            "abstract": "The Whillans Ice Plain (WIP) moves by stick-slip motion with periods of little to no motion followed by a brief rapid surge, or slip event. Previous work has found that sliding motion initiates in one of two regions of the WIP depending on tide height: in the middle of the ice plain during high tide (Site A), and near the grounding zone during low tide (Site B). The persistence of these two slip initiation areas suggests that these two locations have different basal conditions than the surrounding ice plain. In order to investigate spatial variability in bed properties, we combine 3 GPS and 4 passive seismic datasets collected on the WIP over 4 months between 2008-11 for a comprehensive analysis of ice dynamics and seismicity during the stick-slip cycle. Using continuous GPS (15 sec interval), we calculate seismic coupling, or the percent of total ice motion that occurs during slip events, at >40 locations. We find Site A is highly coupled (~80-90%) and surrounded by less coupled ice (55-75%). This suggests that Site A has a stronger bed and accumulates a greater shear stress between slip events than the surrounding ice, which responds to shear stress by creeping. Visual inspection of high frequency seismic data (>1Hz) in both the time and spectral domain reveals ~10s-100s of tiny earthquakes during slip events at 11 locations near Site A. Seismicity is scarce in the surrounding areas during slip, and at all seismic sites during the inter-slip periods. Site B has lower coupling (<55%) and few basal microearthquakes. This result confirms elevated basal stress near Site A and suggests that it occurs as isolated small regions of high friction. S-P times of the microearthquakes change over weeks, suggesting different rupture patches evolve over short timescales. The pattern of GPS-derived coupling shows mesoscale variability in bed strength (~10s of km) while microseismicity with varying S-P times indicates small-scale bed variability within the initiation area (~100s of m).",

New contributions are encouraged and instructions are provided for model authors who wish to share their model via EMC.\nAll contributed Earth models are hosted in their original format and a version in netCDF format (network Common Data Form). The EMC model overview pages provide summaries of the contributed models and links to more detailed metadata and description pages.\nTaking advantage of the unified netCDF format of the models, EMC provides a set of online 2D visualization tools that allow users to produce a variety of horizontal slices, vertical slices and velocity profiles from the Earth models. Auxiliary data such as topography, earthquake locations, plate boundaries, etc. may also be included on these plots. Extension of the EMC visualization tools to 3D is currently underway.

Two hundred and one oriented standard paleomagnetic cores corresponding to twenty-eight paleomagnetic sites were collected from all units. Rock-magnetic properties are characteristic for each unit. Isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition curves and continuous susceptibility vs. temperature experiments point from low to medium-Ti content in titanomagnetite as the main opaque magnetic minerals, presumably result from oxy-exsolution processes during the initial flow cooling. Opaque mineral microscopy supports this assumption. Unblocking temperature and hysteresis parameters suggests predominance of pseudo-single domain magnetic grain size. Thermal and alternating field demagnetizations show mostly well-defined univectorial magnetizations. Most sites present a mean direction with small angular dispersion. The overall mean direction (N=10, Dec=1.1°, Inc=34.1°, k=531 and α95=2.1°) is characterized by small angular dispersion and inclination close to dipolar value for the locality.

The window is formed by Subpenninic nappe system composed of Variscan basement (Zentralgneiss) with Mesozoic cover sequences overlain by Penninic nappes. The studied nappes were previously recognized as Lower and Upper Schieferhülle and their P-T conditions of up to blueschist facies were determined by Selverstone (1988, 1993).\nOur detailed structural and petrological study focused mainly on tectono-metamorphic evolution of different nappes. The Zentralgneiss cover sequences consist mainly of schists, amphibolites and quartzites with originally subhorizontal – gently westward dipping fabric. Dominant fabric was later deformed during deformation stages D2 and D3 that are preserved in the form of folds and cleavages. The later one mainly in the W part of studied area. The Penninic nappes are composed of deformed greenschists, micaschists and marbles, which are together folded by large-scale open folds during D2.\nThe metamorphic PT conditions were reconstructed by using the phase equilibrium modelling and chemical composition/zoning of garnets, which are mostly synkinematic to the formation of the main deformation fabric. The compositional zoning in garnets revealed an overall prograde PT evolution with PT increase up to 3.5 kbar and 100°C associated with the main deformation event.\nThe structural and petrological record show the relation of nappe evolution and unroofing of the complex such as described in Jeřábek et al. (2012) from West Carpathians. The E-W stretching and prograde metamorphic evolution is associated with burial, while exhumation is associated with formation of subhorizontal cleavage and dip-slip kinematics towards W contrary to previously published studies.",

            "abstract": "Carbon cycle perturbations associated with Ocean Anoxic Event 1a have been implicated in global climate and environmental changes in the Early Aptian, in particular evidence for high sea surface temperatures (SST) and carbonate platform drowning. Records of environmental changes in the terrestrial realm remain sparse. This study provides additional data on clumped isotope derived temperatures (T(Δ47)) from lacustrine carbonates of the Xiagou Formation, Gansu Province, China. In addition, Vitrinite reflectance and the Rock-Eval parameter Tmax were used to evaluate the potential for 13C-18O bonds in the carbonates to have experienced reordering. Clumped isotope derived temperatures range from 28.8 °C to 45.9°C. Vitrinite reflectance values range from 0.67 to 0.72 and Tmax ranges from 429 °C to 443 °C.\nThe warmest temperature, derived from a very fine-grained calcareous sandstone, is at the upper limit of known modern Earth surface temperatures, and prompts concern that the T(Δ47) may be shifted to warmer temperatures as a result of burial diagenesis. Vitrinite reflectance and Tmax values indicate the samples have reached early maturity for oil generation (oil window from 60 °C to 150°C), so may have reached the lower end of temperatures for bond reordering to have occurred (~100 °C for ~100 million years). Despite this, the T(Δ47) are consistent with summer temperatures in a warm Cretaceous. In addition, temperature variations are similar to TEX86 records, especially from SST of the tropical Pacific. Two temperature increases and decreases occur, with the first peak in temperature occurring at the negative carbon isotope excursion (C3) associated with the initiation of the Selli Event (OAE1a).\nThis study provides evidence that climate variations occurring during the Selli Event were experienced in terrestrial environments, and provides maximum summer temperatures for this part of the Asian continent during the Cretaceous. While it was intended that thermal maturity parameters such as vitrinite reflectance and Tmax would help to rule out alteration due to burial diagenesis, the results are somewhat ambiguous. More rigorous data will be needed in future studies to screen clumped isotope samples for burial diagenesis.",

In the meantime, new hypotheses of dynamic mechanisms have been put forward to interpret seismological results. Here, the nature of hemispherical dichotomy and anisotropy is re-investigated by bridging the observations of PKP(bc-df) differential travel-times with the iron bcc/hcp elastic properties computed from first-principles methods.The Candy Wrapper velocity model introduced here accounts for a dynamic picture of the inner core (i.e., the eastward drift of material), where different iron crystal shapes can be stabilized at the two hemispheres. We show that seismological data are best explained by a rather complicated, mosaic-like, structure of the inner core, where well-separated patches of different iron crystals compose the anisotropic western hemispherical region, and a conglomerate of almost indistinguishable iron phases builds-up the weakly anisotropic eastern side.",

            "abstract": "For the past several years, vapor intrusion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that emanate from hazardous waste sites has been gaining attention due to adverse health effects and regulatory action. Most studies of VOC vapor intrusion suggest that diffusion is the dominant contaminant transport mechanism, while advection is only considered important near contaminant entry points (i.e. building cracks). This conceptual framework is accurate when above-ground surface features do not promote air flow into (or out of) the ground surface. Recent research related to air flow in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) due to wind effects around buildings suggests a need for better understanding how advective transport processes can impact contaminant profiles and vapor intrusion exposure risks. In this study, a numerical model using COMSOL Multiphysics was developed to account for parameters affecting the transport of VOCs from the subsurface into buildings by considering wind effects in the ABL. Model simulations are compared to preliminary laboratory and field data to evaluate the relative importance of wind induced pressure gradients, soil permeability, soil porosity, and soil effective diffusivity on vapor intrusion entry rates. The major goal of this research is to develop an improved conceptual understanding of the vapor intrusion process so that remediation efforts can be better designed and implemented.",

            "abstract": "High resolution hydro acoustic methods have been successfully employed for the detailed classification of sedimentary habitats. The fine-scale mapping of very heterogeneous, patchy sedimentary facies, and the compound effect of multiple non-linear physical processes on the acoustic signal, cause the classification of backscatter images to be subject to a great level of uncertainty. Standard procedures for assessing the accuracy of acoustic classification maps are not yet established.\nThis study applies different statistical techniques to automated classified acoustic images with the aim of i) quantifying the ability of backscatter to resolve grain size distributions ii) understanding complex patterns influenced by factors other than grain size variations iii) designing innovative repeatable statistical procedures to spatially assess classification uncertainties.\nA high-frequency (450 kHz) sidescan sonar survey, carried out in the year 2012 in the shallow upper-mesotidal inlet the Jade Bay (German North Sea), allowed to map 100 km2 of surficial sediment with a resolution and coverage never acquired before in the area. The backscatter mosaic was ground-truthed using a large dataset of sediment grab sample information (2009-2011). Multivariate procedures were employed for modelling the relationship between acoustic descriptors and granulometric variables in order to evaluate the correctness of acoustic classes allocation and sediment group separation.\nComplex patterns in the acoustic signal appeared to be controlled by the combined effect of surface roughness, sorting and mean grain size variations. The area is dominated by silt and fine sand in very mixed compositions; in this fine grained matrix, percentages of gravel resulted to be the prevailing factor affecting backscatter variability. In the absence of coarse material, sorting mostly affected the ability to detect gradual but significant changes in seabed types. Misclassification due to temporal discrepancies between the acoustic and ground-thruthing datasets were quantified through the method.\nThe effectiveness of the analytical approach was tested by extending the latter to the analysis of data collected in the area during a strategically designed survey carried out in July 2014.",

            "abstract": "The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is widely recognized in the earth science community as possessing extensive collections of geologic and geophysical materials gathered by its research personnel. Since the USGS was established in 1879, hundreds of thousands of samples have been gathered in collections that range from localized, geographically-based assemblages to ones that are national or international in scope. These materials include, but are not limited to, rock and mineral specimens; fossils; drill cores and cuttings; geochemical standards; and soil, sediment, and geochemical samples.\nThe USGS National Geological and Geophysical Data Preservation Program (NGGDPP) was established with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Since its implementation, the USGS NGGDPP has taken an active role in providing opportunities to inventory, archive and preserve geologic and geophysical samples, and to make these samples and ancillary data discoverable on the Internet. Preserving endangered geoscience collections is more cost effective than recollecting this information. Preserving these collections, however, is only one part of the process – there also needs to be a means to facilitate open discovery and access to the physical objects and the ancillary digital records.\nThe NGGDPP has celebrated successes such as the development of the USGS Geologic Collections Management System (GCMS), a master catalog and collections management plan, and the implementation and advancement of the National Digital Catalog, a digital inventory and catalog of geological and geophysical data and collections held by the USGS and State geological surveys. Over this period of time there has been many lessons learned. With the successes and lessons learned, NGGDPP is poised to take on challenges the future may bring.",

            "abstract": "Research on the structure and evolution of individual El Niño / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events has identified two categories of ENSO event characteristics that can be defined by maximum equatorial SST anomalies centered in the Central Pacific (around the dateline to 150°W; CP events) or in the Eastern Pacific (west of about 150°W; EP events). The distinction between these two events is not just academic: both types of event evolve differently, implying different predictability; the events tend to have different maximum amplitude; and the global teleconnection differs between each type of event. The identification of initial conditions that tend to grow into each type of event will lead to better predictability and better dynamical understanding of individual ENSO event evolution.\nIn this study, we use a linear inverse model framework to (i) calculate optimal initial conditions that lead to CP or EP ENSO events, (ii) identify patterns of stochastic forcing that are responsible for exciting each type of event, and (iii) investigate the relative roles of stochastic forcing and internal dynamics in generating long term variations in CP and EP ENSO event statistics. We target our analysis toward CP or EP ENSO events by constructing a CP or EP norm under which optimal initial conditions are calculated. Results highlight a fundamentally different role for the Pacific Meridional Mode in the initial condition and subsequent evolution of CP vs. EP ENSO events. Analysis of stochastic forcing shows that CP ENSO events evolve via the Seasonal Footprinting Mechanism, in which mid-latitude atmospheric variability associated with the atmospheric North Pacific Oscillation lead to ENSO events through the Pacific Meridional Mode. Finally, variations in ENSO event statistics are investigated using a linear inverse model derived from a long simulation of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model. Variations in stochastic forcing vs. dynamics of the system will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Asia is facing enormous challenges including large-scale environmental changes, rapid population growth and industrialization. The inherent generated pollution contributes to half of all Earth’s anthropogenic trace metals emissions that, when deposited to glaciers of the surrounding mountains of the Third Pole region, leave a characteristic chemical fingerprint. Records of past atmospheric deposition preserved in snow and ice from Third Pole glaciers provide unique insights into changes of the chemical composition of the atmosphere and into the nature and intensity of the regional atmospheric circulation systems. The determination of the elemental composition of aeolian dust stored in Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau glaciers can help to qualify the potential contamination of glacial meltwater as a part of the greater fresh Asian water source. The 215 m long Puruogangri ice core retrieved in 2000 at 6500 m a.s.l. in central Tibetan Plateau (Western Tanggula Shan, China) provides one of the first multi-millennium-long environmental archives (spanning the last 7000 years and annually resolved for the last 400 years) obtained from the Tibetan Plateau region. The Puruogangri’s area is climatologically of particular interest because of its location at the boundary between the monsoon (wet) and the westerly (dry) dominated atmospheric circulation. The major objective of this study is to determine the concentration of trace and ultra-trace elements in the Puruogangri ice core between 1600 and 2000 AD in order to characterize the atmospheric aerosols entrapped in the ice. Particular attention is given to assess the amount of trace elements originating from anthropogenic sources during both the pre-industrial and industrial periods. The distinction between the anthropogenic contribution and the crustal background may rely on the precise decoupling of the dry and wet seasons signals, the former being largely influenced by dust contribution.",

            "abstract": "Urban environments are centers for rapidly growing populations. In order to meet the culinary water needs of these areas, municipal water departments use water from multiple locations and/or sources, often piped differentially to different locations within a municipality. This practice creates isotopically distinct locations within an urban area and therefore provides insight to urban water management practices. In our study we selected urban locations in the Salt Lake Valley, UT (SLV) and San Francisco Bay Area, CA (SFB) where we hypothesized geographically distinct water isotopic ratio differences existed. Within the SLV, municipal waters come from the same mountainous region, but are derived from different geologically distinct watersheds. In contrast, SFB waters are derived from regionally distinct water sources. We hypothesized that the isotope ratios of tap waters would differ based upon known municipal sources. To test this, tap water samples were collected throughout the urban regions in SLV and SFB and analyzed for δ2H, δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios. Seasonal collections were also made to assess if isotope ratios differed throughout the year. Within SLV and SFB, different regions were characterized by distinct paired δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr values. These different realms also agreed with known differences in municipal water supplies within the general geographic region. Waters from different cities within Marin County showed isotopic differences, consistent with water derived from different local reservoirs. Seasonal variation was observed in paired δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr values of tap water for some locations within SLV and SFB, indicating management decisions to shift from one water source to another depending on demand and available resources. Our study revealed that the δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr values of tap waters in an urban region can exhibit significant differences despite close spatial proximity if districts differ in their use of local versus transported waters.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic material incorporated within speleothems can provide useful information about changes in the paleoenvironment. Speleothems dated using high-precision U-Th radiometric techniques constitute a unique resource for environmental magnetism. Rock magnetic measurements were carried out on a speleothem collected from Buckeye Creek Cave, West Virginia, USA. The studied sample spans an interval from 58 to >123 ka. Using a previously published age model and stable isotope data [Springer et al., 2014], we compare rock magnetic measurements made on the speleothem to stable-isotope, paleoenvironmental proxies. Variations in the oxygen isotope record follow precession-scale forcings, where relatively enriched δ18O values arise from an increase in summer precipitation. Alternating-field demagnetization of the saturation magnetization (SIRM) of representative samples reveals that there is no major variation in the coercivity spectra, suggesting that the composition and grain size of the magnetic carriers in the speleothem remain uniform across the studied interval. We use S-ratio measurements to investigate changes in the proportion of the speleothem’s magnetization carried by the magnetically ‘hard’ minerals such as goethite and any ‘soft’ component, such as magnetite. Between 123 and 58 ka, the contribution of the soft component (IRMsoft) to the SIRM varies between a maximum of 5.56 x 10-7 Am2kg-1 and a minimum of 8.25 x 10-8 Am2­ kg-1 accounting for between 66% and 100% of the total SIRM. The ‘soft’ component record shows three peaks at 71.5 ka, 96.9 ka and 118.1 ka. These peaks present an intriguing correlation with intervals of enriched δ18O. The peaks in IRM­soft­ appear to lag the most enriched δ18O values by approximately 1.5 kyr. We attribute this correlation between IRMsoft and increased summer rainfall to pedogenic processes, whereby environmentally-driven variations in soil magnetite production are recorded by the speleothem.",

A systematic simulation study of antiparallel reconnection is performed with the kinetic PIC code P3D. Electrons are energized and heated through reflection across contracting magnetic field lines in the center of the outflow exhaust. Parallel electric fields form to keep electrons trapped in the exhaust and to maintain quasi-neutrality. These parallel fields act as an electron pre-acceleration mechanism which makes the contracting field line energization more efficient. Although the energy gain for each electron pass through the exhaust is weaker for smaller electron mass, the increase in bounce frequency leads to a heating prediction that is independent of the electron to ion mass ratio. Ultimately, this parallel heating isotropizes due to several different scattering mechanisms leading to nearly isotropic heating several 10s of ion inertial lengths downstream of the x-line.",

            "abstract": "The business community stands to be highly impacted by climate change. In both short and long-term timescales, climate change presents material and financial risks to companies in diverse economic sectors. How the private sector accounts for long-term risks while making short-term decisions about operations is a complex challenge. Companies are accountable to shareholders and must report performance to them on a quarterly basis. At the same time, company investors are exposed to long-term climate-related risks and face losses if companies fail to prepare for climate impacts.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) obligates publicly traded companies to discuss risks that might materially affect their business and since 2010, the agency recommends that companies consider and discuss any significant risks to their business from climate change. Some companies have complied with this guidance and comprehensively analyze potential climate change impacts, yet others fail to consider climate change at all. Such omissions leave companies without plans for addressing future risks and expose investors and the public to potential catastrophic events from climate change impacts.\nClimate risk projections can inform companies about the vulnerability of their facilities, supply chains, transportation pathways, and other assets. Such projections can help put climate-related risks in terms of material costs for companies and their investors. Focusing on the vulnerability of coastal facilities, we will use climate change impact projections to demonstrate the economic impacts of climate change faced by the private sector. These risks are then compared to company disclosures to the SEC to assess the degree to which companies have considered their vulnerability to climate change. Finally, we will discuss ways that companies can better assess and manage long-term climate risks.",

            "abstract": "There were two typhoon processes during Campaign PRIDE-PRD2006 in July 2006 and serious ozone pollution episodes occurred before the landing of the typhoons. Chemical transport model CMAQ was employed in this work to simulate the ozone pollution episode related by the typhoon KAEMI. According to the meteorological conditions, the pollution episode could be divided into three phases with the movement of the typhoon, which were (1) far away from the continent; (2) coming close to the continent; (3) before landing. Process analysis was applied to get the contributions of physical and chemical processes for the ozone. It revealed that transport process was dominant during this pollution episode, and the influence of chemical process increased in the second phase. Three typical regions, northern rural area, urban area and Hong Kong area, were selected to study the contribution of each chemical and physical process. In the first phase, the primary process in northern rural area and the urban area was vertical diffusion, accounting for 47% and 46% respectively. In the second phase, the primary process in northern rural area and the urban area was chemical process, accounting for 33% and 31% respectively. In the third phase, the region of high concentration ozone moved southward. For Hong Kong area, the western inflow was prominent as 40%. Sensitivity study showed that urban areas were VOCs-limited regime with decreased ozone concentration when reducing the emission of VOCs. On the contrary, the ozone concentration in downwind rural areas decreased with the reduction of NOx, and the reason may be the decrement of the accumulated precursors.",

            "abstract": "The axial melt lens (AML) is a common feature lying at the base of the upper crust at fast-spreading mid-ocean ridges. It is thought to play a major role in the evolution of MORB and, potentially, accretion of the plutonic lower crust. In order to better understand the petrological processes that operate in AMLs we have examined the nature and variability of the horizon equivalent to the AML preserved in the Oman ophiolite. We present the results of a detailed investigation of a section east of Fahrah in the Ibra Valley. Here, a suite of ‘varitextured’ gabbros separates the sheeted dykes above from foliated gabbros below. It comprises 3 distinct units: an ophitic gabbro with pegmatitic patches (patchy gabbro; 70 m thick), overlain by a spotty gabbro (50 m), capped by a quartz-diorite (120 m). The sheeted dykes are observed to root in the quartz-diorite. Contacts between the plutonic units are gradational and subhorizontal. All of the units are isotropic.\nA total of 110 samples were collected for detailed petrographic and chemical analysis. With the exception of a small number of the diorites, all of the samples have a ‘cumulate’ component. Primary igneous amphibole is ubiquitous, present even as a minor phase in the foliated gabbros beneath, and indicating extensive differentiation and/or the presence of water in the primary liquid. France et al. (2014, Lithos) report patches of granoblastic material from this horizon in the Fahrah area, and suggest they represent the restites of partially melted pieces of the sheeted dykes. We did not, however, find any such granoblastic material, nor can the quartz-diorites represent partial melt; instead, preliminary geochemical modeling suggests that all of the units can be related by simple progressive fractional crystallization of an Oman axial (‘V1’ or ‘Geotimes’) melt. Along with the field relationships, as well as the basaltic andesite to dacite composition of the overlying sheeted dykes, this suggests that the AML was the locus of formation of the highly evolved melts. This contrasts with the more primitive AML and sheeted dyke complex documented in Wadi Abyad. From this we conclude that there is significant lateral variability in AML compositions along the Oman ridge axis.",

Induced seismicty is a nessesary tool to create an enhanced geothermal system; however, potential seismic hazard poses a major challange to the widespread implementation of this technology. Monitoring and controlling induced seismicity with warning systems requires models that are updated as new data arrive and that are cast in probabilistic terms. Our main question is: is it possible to forecast the seismic response of the geothermal site during and after stimulation with models based on observed seismicity and hydraulic data? To answer the question, we explore the predictive performance of various stochastic and hybrid models. The goal is to find the most suitable model or model combination for forecasting induced microseismicity and unexpected events in geothermal reservoirs.\nIn this study, we consider the Basel 2006 dataset and generate forecasts of the number and spatial distribution of seismicity in the next six hours. We explore two models: (1) a hydro-geomechanical stochastic seed model based on pore pressure diffusion with irreversible permeability enhancement; and (2) four variants of a 3D “Shapiro” model which combine estimates of seismogenic index with a spatial forecast based on kernel-smoothed seismicity and temporal weighting. For both models, hydraulic and seismic parameters are calibrated against data from a learning period (starting at the beginning of injection) every six hours. We assess the models using metrics developed by the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability: we check the overall consistency of forecasts with the observations by comparing the number, magnitude and spatial distribution of forecast events with the observed induced earthquakes. We also compare the models with each other in terms of information gain, allowing pairwise ranking.",

Of environmental significance, bridges, control structures, channelization and foot traffic are common near stream mouths, warranting comparisons of natural and channelized stream mouths. The present work completes the first investigation focusing specifically on the hydrology of surface-water/sediment exchanges at stream-mouth reaches discharging to lakes and compares these exchanges to those measured along the nearby shoreline in both a qualitative and quantitative manner. Heat and water exchanges for two common types of stream mouths (a natural stream with a summer barrier bar and a channelized stream mouth) are compared with comparable exchanges along the nearby shoreline on the north shore of Lake Tahoe located in the Central Sierra Nevada Mountain Range (CA/NV, US). The study site was selected partially due the abundance of streams discharging into the lake of both a natural and channelized nature (~30 small streams with a large number of both types of stream mouths). Heat and water exchanges were both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct for the three types of hydrologic settings, with (1) cool, low velocity, longitudinal (hyporheic) flowpaths observed below the channelized stream mouth, discharging beneath the warmer, more buoyant lakeshore water, (2) the nearby shoreline receiving relatively warm, higher velocity discharge and (3) for the natural stream mouth, there was strong diurnal temperature pattern in groundwater discharging through the seasonal barrier beach to the lake. Impacts of strong 2013 wave action on exchanges were also distinct for the three settings, with (1) channelization allowing waves to extend well upstream, (2) a lesser invasive impact in the shoreline swash zone exchanges and (3) the least spatial impact on the natural stream with its seasonal barrier beach shielding the mouth.",

There is still significant uncertainty as to the ultimate destination of the released magnetic energy, whether into bulk flows, thermal heating, or energetic particle production. Using a systematic set of 2D kinetic PIC simulations, we study how inflowing plasma conditions and the electron to ion mass ratio modifies the amount of ion heating during magnetic reconnection. Consistent with recent satellite observations, we find that the primary controlling factor is the inflowing Alfven speed, or the magnetic energy per electron-ion pair. In contrast with electron heating findings, introducing a guide field substantially reduces the amount of ion heating. Possible ion heating mechanisms, and well as relative electron to ion heating energy partition, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Cropland plays an important role in land-atmosphere interactions. Integrating advanced regional-scale crop-growth modeling capabilities into a land surface model (LSM) is not only crucial for assessing potential impacts of climate change and climate variability on crop yields, but also can help to improve the representation of crop-atmosphere interactions in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. Therefore, the objectives of developing Noah-MP-CROP are: 1) provide high-spatial and high-temporal resolution regional agro-climatic related products; 2) enhance the simulations of cropland surface-fluxes in the WRF model for numerical weather prediction and regional climate modeling. Noah-MP is a new-generation of LSM that uses multiple parameterizations for land hydrology and energy processes. In this study, we couple species-specific crop phenology and carbon allocation schemes with Noah-MP-based complex simulations of canopy photosynthesis and soil moisture. The Noah-MP-CROP can be executed at field-scales or grid-scales of different spatial resolution and it also can be applied at multiple temporal scales. The major agriculture-related outputs include: grain mass, leaf mass, leaf area index, crop yield, growth primary production, growing degree days, soil temperature, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. The model also allows us to conduct different assessments by using either historical, real-time, short-term forecast or future projected weather input data. In this study, we focus on evaluating the Noah-MP-CROP for the regional agro-climatic assessments in the U.S. Corn Belt. Model simulations are conducted at both field-scale (Bondville, IL and Mead, NE) and grid-scale (4km-resolution). At both field sites, model outputs of crop yield (grain mass), leaf area index and surface fluxes show strong agreement with observations. Also incorporating crop-growth models in Noah-MP improves the simulated latent heat and sensible heat fluxes during the crop growing season.",

Mounted on the NASA HU-25C aircraft, GeoTASO measures radiation in 1000 spectral bands from 415 nm to 696 nm, and is a prototype for the TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) instrument. It flew over Houston during September 2013 and gathered several days’ of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for our research.\nOur inversion method, which is based on the optimization theory and different from the traditional lookup table (LUT) retrieval technique, can simultaneously retrieve parameters of atmospheric aerosols such as the aerosol optical depth and other aerosol parameters, as well as the surface reflectance albedo. To provide constraints of hyperspectral surface reflectance in the inversion, we first conduct principal component analysis (PCA) using 46 reflectance spectra of various plants and vegetation to identify the most influential components. With the first six principal components and the corresponding calculated weight vector, the spectra could be reconstructed with an accuracy of 1%.\nUNL-VRTM (UNified Linearized Radiative Transfer Model) is employed for forward model calculation, and its outputs include not only the Stokes 4-vector elements, but also their sensitivities (Jacobians) with respect to the aerosol properties parameters and the principal components of surface spectral reflectance. The inversion is carried out with optimization algorithm L-BFGS-B (Large scale BFGS Bound constrained), and is conducted iteratively until the modeled spectral radiance fits with GeoTASO measurements. Finally, the retrieval results of aerosol optical depth and other aerosol parameters are compared against those retrieved by AEROENT and/or in situ measurements during the aircraft campaign.",

            "abstract": "The recent convergence of free, high quality Landsat data and acceleration in the development of dense Landsat time series algorithms has spawned a nascent interagency effort known as the Landscape Change Monitoring System (LCMS). LCMS is being designed to map historic land cover changes associated with all major disturbance agents and land cover types in the US. Currently, five existing algorithms are being evaluated for inclusion in LCMS. The priorities of these five algorithms overlap to some degree, but each has its own strengths. This has led to the adoption of a novel approach, within LCMS, to integrate the map outputs (i.e., base learners) from these change detection algorithms using empirical ensemble models. Training data are derived from independent datasets representing disturbances such as: harvest, fire, insects, wind, and land use change. Ensemble modeling is expected to produce significant increases in predictive accuracy relative to the results of the individual base learners.\nThe non-parametric models used in LCMS also provide a framework for matching output ensemble maps to independent sample-based statistical estimates of disturbance area. Multiple decision trees “vote” on class assignment, and it is possible to manipulate vote thresholds to ensure that ensemble maps reflect areas of disturbance derived from sources such as national-scale ground or image-based inventories.\nThis talk will focus on results of the first ensemble integration of the base learners for six Landsat scenes distributed across the US. We will present an assessment of base learner performance across different types of disturbance against an independently derived, sample-based disturbance dataset (derived from the TimeSync Landsat time series visualization tool). The goal is to understand the contributions of each base learner to the quality of the ensemble map products. We will also demonstrate how the ensemble map products can be manipulated to match sample-based annual TimeSync estimates of disturbance area.",

            "abstract": "Natural gas will inevitably contain trace amounts of water and other impurities during different stages of processing and transport. Glycols, such as triethylene glycol (TEG), will in many cases follow the water. The glycol contents of the gas can originate from preceding glycol-drying units or it can be a residue from the direct injection of glycols used to prevent hydrate formation. Thus, it is important to know how glycol contents will affect the different paths leading to hydrate formation. Glycols may in some cases dominate the condensed water phase. If this occurs, it will lead to the well-documented shift in the hydrate stability curve, due to the altered activity of the water. A great deal of information on the molecular path of a glycol through the system can be obtained from calculating the chemical potential. Due to difficulties in measuring interfacial chemical potentials, these often need to be estimated using theoretical tools.\nWe used molecular dynamics (MD) to study how TEG behaves in the vicinity of mineral surfaces such as calcite and hematite. Many methods exist for estimating chemical potentials based on MD trajectories. These include techniques such as free energy perturbation theory (FEP) and thermodynamic integration (TI). Such methods require sufficient sampling of configurations where free energy is to be estimated. Thus, it can be difficult to estimate chemical potentials on surfaces. There are several methods to circumvent this problem, such as blue moon sampling and umbrella sampling. These have been considered and the most important have been used to estimate chemical potentials of TEG adsorbed on the mineral surfaces. The resulting chemical potentials were compared to the chemical potential of TEG in bulk water, which was estimated using temperature thermodynamic integration.",

Hence, the available times series used to document long\nterm climate changes are heterogeneous since they are based on different indicators\nand different reconstruction methods.\nIn order to document the climate variability captured by the time series, we have\nanalyzed the scaling behavior of Holocene records (last 12,000 years) by the mean\nof the Haar fluctuations (for a given time interval, these are simply the differences\nbetween the means of the first and second halves of the interval). Over various\nranges of time scale, they can be characterized by exponents H (e.g. [Lovejoy and\nSchertzer, 2012]).

When H>0 on the contrary, fluctuations tend to grow with larger time\nintervals as the series “wanders” like a drunkard’s walk, i.e. it appears “unstable”. We\nshow how to perform the analyses in a robust fashion, avoiding biases due to\nirregular sampling and/or variable temporal resolutions. On this basis, we\nwere able to evaluate whether the signals of different paleo-indicators for the\nsame location converge at low frequency, or whether they diverge. Even when\nconsidering the same core, different indicators sometimes yield diverging signals. This\nsuggests variations which could be due to methods of reconstruction or to the\nclimatic signal recorded by the indicators. Despite divergences in some of the regional\nrecords, results consistently show that signals from marine cores tend to be\nmore stable than those from continental environments. ",

            "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is a macronutrient involved both in functional and structural components of all living cells. This makes it an essential nutrient for life, including microbial life in the deep subseafloor habitat. P availability in this environment is limited since organic matter is scarce and P is thought to be mainly present in refractory mineral phases. However, recent estimates suggest that the deep biosphere may contain up to 1% of Earth’s total biomass, which implies that microorganisms may possess mechanisms to harvest recalcitrant phosphorus compounds in this environment. In addition, the role of the organic P pool in this setting is poorly understood and could be of great importance should it represent an important P pool fueling the deep biosphere. This study aims to identify and quantify organic P compounds in open ocean sediments using our newly developed sequential extraction procedure for 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P NMR). This method amplifies the signal of organic P in spectra by increasing its concentration and quantitatively removing the majority of inorganic P. Briefly, P bound to iron oxyhydroxides is removed from sediment samples during a reductive step; then, P in authigenic and biogenic apatite is solubilized over the course of an extraction in an acidic buffer. These two steps remove the majority of inorganic P from the sample. Lastly, the residue is extracted in 0.25M NaOH+ 0.05M Na2EDTA and the supernatant is frozen and lyophilized prior to 31P NMR analysis. This method will be applied to sediment samples from North Pond (IODP expedition 336), an isolated sediment pond on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic ridge. This work will provide valuable insight into the diagenetic processes affecting organic P in open ocean sediments and into possible nutrient sources to the deep biosphere.",

We applied seismic interferometry concept for retrieval of seimic response of a model dike of soil structure like a fill dam. We employed deconvolution interferometry to estimate seismic response in time domain. From the waveforms obtained from deconvolution with the motion in the basement of a model dam, we estimate traveltimes of shear wave propagating through it and its mean velocity. Estimated velocity explain the dominant frequency of a model dike well. This approach can be applicable to monitor change in seismic response of a dike induced consolidation process after construction, or by shaking during strong‐motion earthquake.\nIn order to examine the applicability of this method to monitoring of a fill dam, we conducted the centrifuge tests with shaking table. We can retrieve the time-domain seismic response from not only acceleration waveforms at shaking but also ambient vibration induced by the centrifuge loading. By monitoring the change in the response estimated by the application of time-lapse deconvolution interferometry, we could find the temporal change in shear velocity while shaking and its recovery process after shakin.",

            "abstract": "Landsat satellite images have been used frequently to map evapotranspiration (ET) andbiophysical variables at the field scale with surface energy balance algorithms. Although Landsat images have high spatial resolution with 30m cell size, it has limitations for real time monitoring of crop ET by providing only two to four images per month for an area, which, when encountered with cloudy days, further deteriorates the availability of images and snapshots of ET behavior. Therefore real time monitoring essentially has to include near-daily thermal satellites such as MODIS/VIIRS into the time series. However, the challenge with field scale monitoring with these systems is the large size of the thermal band which is 375 m with VIIRS and 1000 meter with MODIS. To maximize the accuracy of ET estimates during infusion of MODIS products into land surface models for monitoring field scale ET, it is important to assess the geometric accuracy of the various MODIS products, for example, spatial correspondence among the 250 m red and near-infrared bands, the 500 m reflectance bands; and the 1000 m thermal bands and associated products. METRIC model was used with MODIS images to estimate ET from irrigated and rainfed fields in Nebraska. Our objective was to assess geometric accuracy of MODIS image layers and how to correctly handle these data for highest accuracy of estimated ET at the individual field scale during the extensive drought of 2012. For example, the particular tool used to subset and reproject MODIS swath images from level-1 and level-2 products (e.g., using the MRTSwath and other tools), the initial starting location (upper left hand corner), and the projection system all effect how pixel corners of the various resolution bands align. Depending on the approach used, origin of pixel corners can vary from image to image date and therefore impacts the pairing of ET information from multiple dates the consistency and accuracy of sampling ET from within field interiors. Higher level MODIS products, including multi-day products, can have more consistent registration, but may suffer some compromisation of spatial fidelity due to the resampling required during various reprocessing steps.",

            "abstract": "The net atmospheric response to deforestation is known to be a combination of individual atmospheric processes and their interactions triggered by changes in various land surface characteristics. These individual responses also vary with the scale of deforestation. Previous studies of atmospheric impacts of Amazonian deforestation have focused on very small (~1 km) and very large (hundreds of km) scales of deforestation and have showed that different land surface properties can dominate the atmospheric response at different scales. However, analysis of the net atmospheric impact of intermediate-scale deforestation (tens of km) has received less attention, despite it being a better representative of the contemporary landscape in some parts of the Amazon. This study looks at the effects of contemporary intermediate-scale deforestation in Rondônia, Brazil, with an emphasis on the role of changes in surface roughness, using a variable-resolution GCM, the Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Model. It is found that reductions in surface roughness give rise to a mesoscale circulation that is capable of convective triggering but that weakens the turbulent energy fluxes between land and atmosphere. Overall, this mesoscale circulation causes distinct impacts on the hydroclimates of the western and eastern halves of Rondônia, increasing convection in the former while suppressing it in the latter. These results show that the regional atmospheric response to contemporary intermediate-scale deforestation in Rondônia is likely to be more influenced by differences in surface roughness between forest and forest clearings than by the differences in the surface energy partitioning which is the dominant factor at small scales of deforestation.",

            "abstract": "Due to the numerous ecological services provided by mangroves and its vital ecological role, the monitor of mangrove ecosystem in China receives a growing concern. We deployed eddy covariance system and meteorological instrument to continuously monitor the exchange of CO2 flux, water vapor, heat flux and meteorological factors of mangrove ecosystem on Guangdong and Fujian province in 2012, namely GDGQ and FJYX. The major species of two sites were similar, and by 2012 were on average 2.8~3.3 m in height. Climatically, temperature, net radiation and rainfall have significant seasonal difference, all reaching peak values during the summer wet season. Based on the results available, two sites were strong carbon sink in annual scale. The cumulative NEP in GDGQ (667.92 g C m-2 year-1) was lower than that in FJYX (848.31 g C m-2 year-1), but respiration (Rd) was opposite, 1433.80 g C m-2 year-1 for GDGQ and 1345.13 g C m-2 year-1 for FJYX. Tidal inundation decreased nighttime Rd by ~0.82 μ mol m-2 s-1 in GDGQ and ~0.99 μ mol m-2 s-1 in FJYX. The diurnal patterns of sensible (Hs) and latent heat fluxes (LE) of two sites were both single peak, and peak values both occurred at 12:00~14:00. Hs of GDGQ was higher than FJYX during nighttime and lower in daytime, but LE of GDGQ was lower than FJYX during nighttime. Evapotranspiration (ET) of two sites presented similar seasonal pattern, reaching highest value in July and lowest value in January. ET of whole year were 892.66 mm and 1051.76mm for GDGQ and FJYX. Daily WUE was strong negatively correlated to salinity in in FJYX, but the pattern of GDGQ was less distinct. Due to its high salinity stress and long-time inundation, water use efficiency (WUE) of GDGQ was higher than FJYX in all months. Soil heat flux (G) was quite small when compared to other heat flux, but both had obvious diurnal pattern in two sites. G was positively correlated to air temperature and G variation range of GDGQ (-8.68 ~5.51 w m-2) was greater than FJYX (-1.27~1.11 w m-2) because the latter was rarely flooded by tide. Mangroves have such high NEP was attributed to year-round productivity and low ecosystem respiration, which can be partly explained by regular tidal inundation. Salinity influences must also be considered when involving ET and WUE of mangroves.",

Therefore, it is critical to detect and estimate the attitude jitter for further possible compensation to explore the full geometric potential of HRSI. We bring up with a solution to detect the attitude jitter effect based on image processing using images recorded by a sensor system with parallax observation.\nThree methods of attitude jitter detection are investigated. The first one is based on analysis of the co-registration errors between images with very small parallax observation (e.g. different bands of multispectral image). The second one is based on stereo images using sensor imaging models to investigate the geometric inconsistance in image space. The third one is based on analysis of the co-registration errors of two DOM products from the images. Phase correlation, geometric constraint cross correlation and least squares matching are used in our methods correspondingly for high accuracy image matching, and the RANSAC algorithm is adopted to remove mismatched points and outliers. Finally, the image disparities from each method are used to investigate the effect and characteristic of satellite attitude jitter.\nWe applied our methods on different satellites to investigate their attitude jitter characteristics. Results of experiment with multispectral images obtained by the ASTER camera equipped on Terra satellite showed that there exist more than one frequency with amplitude up to 0.3 pixel. Experimental results with panchromatic image strips captured by LROC revealed that there exist at least two attitude jitter frequencies with amplitude up to 0.6 pixel. Three methods were all used to investigate the attitude jitter of Chinese ZY-3 satellite and the results from different methods showed good consistency, and a distinct periodic attitude fluctuation with frequency around 0.65Hz always exist, and the amplitude decreased from the early 1 pixel down to within 0.5 pixel, revealing that ZY-3 platform becomes steady with good potential of high positioning accuracy.\nKey words: satellite attitude jitter, high resolution satellite imagery, ASTER, LROC, ZY-3",

            "abstract": "When modeling the Earth’s interior, essential features lie in our knowledge of iron and iron alloys physical properties at extreme pressures and temperatures. While the density profile of the Earth’s interior is rather well constrained from seismic data, the temperature at the boundary between the solid inner core and liquid outer core (ICB, Inner Core Boundary), where the pressure is estimated to be of 330GPa, remains up to now largely uncertain. It corresponds to the melting temperature of an iron alloy containing a small but unconstrained amount of impurities [1]. As a reference, the melting temperature of pure iron at ICB pressure condition is thus one of the most important parameters of earth and planetary interiors physics. For that reason, measuring the iron melting curve at conditions corresponding to the Earth Inner Core Boundary (ICB) under pressure of 330GPa has eluded scientists for several decades.\nHere we used X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy with ultrafast X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) sources coupled to a laser shock experiment, to detect the state of iron along the shock Hugoniot up to 420GPa (+/- 50) and 10800K (+/- 1390). Our results allows to put an upper constrain on the high pressure-melting curve of iron by detecting well beyond recent diamond-anvil cell measurements performed at 150GPa [2].\n[1] J.P.

            "abstract": "This study investigates the magnitude, structure and potential causes of biases in summertime surface air temperature (SAT) and related variables across 29 coupled models over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. These models, included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), exhibit local climatological biases of up to 10°C during December and January. In the 50°S-90°S domain, the spread of SAT across models is highly correlated with absorbed solar radiation (ASR). Over the ice-free ocean domain of 40°S-60°S, models have a spread in ASR of about 50 W/m2 that arises from cloud properties. On the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS), ASR is strongly correlated with surface albedo. Inter-model biases in the open ocean, sea ice and land domains are largely uncorrelated, but similar biases within the open ocean and land domains occur among coupled models that share atmospheric and land component models, respectively. ASR is proposed as a diagnostic that captures model skill in simulating summertime surface climate across all three domains. ASR differences dominate the spread in net surface radiation and net surface energy flux (including sensible and latent heat). CMIP5 models’ net radiation and upward heat fluxes are predominantly too large over the ocean. This work will also illustrate how the radiation budget explains the large spread in sea ice extent among CMIP5 models.",

            "abstract": "Until recently, the hotspot hypothesis has been generally accepted to explain the presence of linear volcanic chains. The hypothesis predicts a linear age progression along each chain, as well as consistent angular rotation velocities for all chains on a single plate. While such age progressions have been observed at places such as Hawaii and Louisville, several young (0-30 Ma) volcanic chains that formed on the Pacific plate show age progressions and associated angular velocities that are in disagreement with one another. The Cook-Austral island chain has age distributions that are particularly difficult to resolve based on the hotspot hypothesis, due to its location on the “hotspot highway” (Jackson et al. 2010) and a wide geographic range of recent volcanism. Several of these islands were previously studied by Turner and Jarrard (1982) who interpreted this age progression to suggest the presence of three active hotspots positioned along a “hot line” above a sheet-like upwelling area in the mantle as opposed to a singular “hot spot”. However, this study was performed using the K/Ar dating method, and it has been shown that K and/or Ar loss (and addition of K) due to weathering and alteration can have significant effects on the age and uncertainty of samples dated with this technique. Here we present high-resolution 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating ages for several of the same samples previously analyzed in this study, as well as some unpublished samples. Analyses were conducted using the ARGUS-VI multicollector mass spectrometer, employing incremental heating procedures that provide more precise and more accurate ages compared to K/Ar and total fusion 40Ar/39Ar measurements. These new data will be used in conjunction with existing plate motion models and geochemical data to assess whether they support a point source or line source hypothesis. This in turn will allow us to improve our overall knowledge of mantle anomaly geometry and absolute plate motion.",

            "abstract": "Detailed measurements of ice crystals in cirrus clouds were used to compare with results from the Community Atmospheric Model Version 5 (CAM5) global climate model. The observations are from two different field campaigns; Atmospheric Radiation Measurements Spring Cloud Intensive Operational Period in 2000 (ARM-IOP), which was characterized primarily by midlatitude frontal clouds and cirrus, and Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4), which was dominated by anvil cirrus. Results show that the model typically overestimates the slope parameter of the exponential size distributions of cloud ice and snow, while the variation with temperature (height) is comparable. The model also overestimates the ice/snow number concentration (0th moment of the size distribution) and underestimates higher moments (2nd through 5th), but compares well with observations for the 1st moment. The mass-weighted terminal fallspeed is lower in the model compared to observations, which is partly due to the overestimation of the size distribution slope parameter. Sensitivity tests with modification of the threshold size for cloud ice to snow autoconversion (Dcs) do not show noticeable improvement in modeled moments, slope parameter and mass weighed fallspeed compared to observations. Further, there is considerable sensitivity of the cloud radiative forcing to Dcs, consistent with previous studies, but no value of D­cs improves modeled cloud radiative forcing compared to measurements. Since the autoconversion of cloud ice to snow using the threshold size Dcs has little physical basis, we suggest improvements by removing the artificial distinction of cloud ice and snow, combining them into a single ice-phase category, and improving the representation and self-consistency of ice particle properties in the model using empirical particle mass-dimensional and projected area-dimensional relationships. Preliminary results with the improved parameterization will be shown.",

            "abstract": "Environmental magnetic studies of soils have generally focused on providing insights into the climate and environmental conditions that produce modern soils and geologically young paleosols (<5 Ma), but environmental magnetic analysis of more ancient paleosols has been limited. The Bighorn Basin Coring Project (BBCP) recently recovered ~300 m of sediment core spanning the Paleocene-Eocene boundary from the Polecat Bench locality in the Bighorn Basin, WY. Core scan images show that oxidative weathering extends some 20-30 m below the surface, suggesting that recent surficial weathering could have significantly altered the magnetic signals preserved in paleosols that crop out in this region. This study presents the first detailed core to outcrop comparison of paleosol magnetism of which we are aware. Nine paleosols from Polecat Bench, spanning the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), have been sampled at high-resolution from outcrop trenches and core sediments. Importantly, these paleosols are stratigraphically below the weathering front in the core sediments, suggesting that they preserve an unweathered magnetic signature. We present results of preliminary comparison between the magnetic signals preserved in core sediments and the same sediments exposed as outcrops using detailed measurements of low-field magnetic susceptibility, frequency dependence of susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM), and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM). We explore the implications of surficial weathering for environmental magnetism, including the application of magnetic paleoprecipitation proxies calibrated using modern soils to more ancient paleosols.",

            "abstract": "Aira caldera is located within Kagoshima Bay at the southern end of Kyushu, in Japan. Sakurajima, a post-caldera andesitic stratovolcano, sits on the calderas southern rim and is Japan’s most active volcano. Historical records of activity at Sakurajima are punctuated with larger events: for example, in 1914 a major flank eruption ejected 0.52 km3 of pumice and ash, and 1.34 km3 of lava. The co-eruptive subsidence accompanying this eruption was around one metre in the vertical component, as determined from leveling surveys. Repeat surveys, and the addition of modern GPS data indicate that the present day level of ground uplift is approaching the level inferred before the 1914 eruption. This study is focused on interpreting the current deformation with integration of additional geophysical signals to constrain the subsurface magma storage conditions. Analytical geodetic models have been previously used to infer a deep spherical reservoir beneath Aira caldera and a smaller source beneath the summit craters of Sakurajima. However, subsequent geophysical explorations have shown that the assumptions inherent in these simple models may not apply. We use the Finite Element method to model the recorded deformation with an inverse least-squares approach. Our models incorporate the surrounding topography/bathymetry and three-dimensional medium heterogeneities inferred from seismic tomography. These are used to assess their respective significance when solving for the optimum source location. Subsequent forward Finite Element models quantify the importance of rheology and thermo-mechanical coupling owing to the observed high seismic attenuation and aseismic zones. The results are evaluated alongside the current volcanic activity to yield new insights into the behaviour of the Aira-Sakurajima sub-volcanic system.",

These precipitating electrons can be additionally reflected back into the magnetosphere by the conjugate atmospheres, leading to a series of multiple reflections that can greatly influence precipitating flux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km) and the resultant secondary electron population. We present the solution of the Boltzmann-Landau kinetic equation that uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production of secondary electrons (E < 600 eV). This solution takes into account, for the first time, the role of multiple atmospheric reflections of the precipitated electrons that initially were moved into the loss cone via wave-particle interaction processes in the Earth’s plasmasheet.",

            "abstract": "Climatic forcing signals in river systems tend to be modified on different temporal and spatial scales due to inherent signal buffering, re-routing, and a complex mixing of multiple autogenic and allogenic signals. Thus climate forcing response is generally assumed inherently non-linear with significant hysteresis effects.\nThis paper explores propagation and effects of monsoonal, seasonally intense rainfall signal in river strata in the monsoonal and bordering subtropical domains. Some such rivers occur completely within the monsoon climate zone. Others have parts of their drainages in temperate climate zones, or on high elevations and receive some of their water discharge from other sources. Yet others, have their upstream drainages in the tropical monsoon climates, but flow through bordering subtropical drylands. Yet, all these rivers characteristically experience seasonal high magnitude floods as the effect of intense monsoon precipitation. Many rivers in the bordering subtropical zone receive monsoon rain and transmit discharge only during abnormal or strengthened monsoon seasons and associated cyclonic flow.\nField datasets, comparison to modern river deposits and a literature review of monsoonal and bordering subtropical domain rivers reveal that the effects of the intense seasonal monsoon rain and the resultant flooding are readily recognizable in modern and ancient fluvial strata. This paper argues that this distinct and dominant climate signal propagation occurs because it is the monsoon discharge that is commonly responsible for up to 100% of sediment erosion, transport and deposition, creating a system wide flushing or splash effect on a single season to multi-million year time scale. The distinct monsoon flood deposits are interbedded with other types of fluvial strata in systems where significant deposition also occurs from low-magnitude flood or non-flood discharges.",

            "abstract": "Jurassic northward migration of Mexico, trailing the North America plate, resulted in temporal evolution of climate-sensitive depositional environments. Lower-Middle Jurassic rocks in central Mexico contain a record of warm-humid conditions, which are indicated by coal and compositionally mature sandstone deposited in continental environments. Preliminary paleomagnetic data indicate that these rocks were deposited at near-equatorial paleolatitudes. The Middle Jurassic (ca. 170 Ma) Diquiyú volcanic sequence in central Oaxaca give an overall mean of D=82.2º/ I= +4.1º (n=10; k=17.3, α95=12º). In the Late Jurassic, the Gulf of Mexico formed as a subsidiary basin of the Atlantic Ocean, when the supercontinent Pangaea ruptured. Upper Jurassic strata, including eolianite and widespread evaporite deposits, across Mexico indicate dry-arid conditions. Available paleomagnetic data (compaction-corrected) from eolianites in northeast Mexico indicate deposition at ~15-20ºN. As North America moved northward during Jurassic opening of the Atlantic, different latitudinal regions experienced coeval Late Jurassic climatic shifts. Climate transitions have been widely recognized in the Colorado plateau region. The plateau left the horse-latitudes in the late Middle Jurassic to reach temperate humid climates at ~40ºN in the latest Jurassic. In turn, the southern end of the North America plate (central Mexico) reached arid horse-latitudes in the Late Jurassic. At that time, epeiric platforms developed in the circum-Gulf region after a long period of margin extension. We suggest that Upper Jurassic hydrocarbon source rocks in the circum-Gulf region accumulated on these platforms as warm epeiric hypersaline seas and the Gulf of Mexico itself were fertilized by an influx of wind-blown silt from continental regions. Additional nutrients were brought to shallow zones of photosynthesis by ocean upwelling driven by changes in the continental landmass configuration.",

They can help quantify the contribution of cometary impacts to terrestrial oceans and help elucidate the role of comets in the formation and evolution of planetary atmospheres. This paper focuses on argon and the capabilities to measure this noble gas with in situ measurements at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the target of the European Space Agency’s spacecraft Rosetta. Argon may have been detected by remote sensing in a single Oort cloud comet and nothing is known about the isotopic abundances of argon in comets. Furthermore, no detection of argon in a Jupiter family comet has been reported to date. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko belongs to the group of Jupiter family comets and originates most likely in the Kuiper belt. Onboard Rosetta is ROSINA/DFMS (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis / Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer). DFMS has unprecedented mass resolution and high sensitivity and is designed to measure isotopic ratios including argon. Argon measurements using the DFMS lab model (identical to the flight model) demonstrate this capability. Most likely, DFMS will provide the first detection of argon in a Jupiter family comet and the first determination of the 36Ar/38Ar ratio at a comet.",

            "abstract": "Human-induced changes in landscape occurring at an unprecedented rate and spatial scale have significantly altered the hydrological processes. However, due to the complexity of human decision making on land management in response to various socio-economic circumstances, anthropogenic changes in landscape rarely occur homogenously across temporal and special scales, so do the underlying drivers for land management decisions. For this reason and that for achieving more sustainable natural resources management, we develop a cascading integrated assessment model (CIAM) that accounts for dynamic land use characteristics in modeling hydrological variability, heterogeneity in human land management decisions under various socio-economic scenarios, and feedback of hydrological responses to human behaviors. The CIAM consists of two core components: the interactive land-use transition agent-based model (ILUTABM) and the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). The ILUTABM simulates heterogeneity in land use decisions at parcel levels by differentiating decision making processes for agricultural, urban and forest landowners. A landowner is expected to make decisions given his expected utility with respect to different underlying socio-economic drivers given the landowner category and the characteristics of his landholdings. These attributes of the land include but not limited to the neighboring land use, zoning rules, current use, soil, slope and elevation. The RHESSys is physical-based watershed model that uses a hierarchical spatial framework to simulate runoff, snow, soil and vegetation processes. Here we use the CIAM to examine the impacts of coupled landscape and climate changes on flood and nutrient transport and consequently the impacts of flood and nutrient loadings on human decisions for land use in the Missisquoi Watershed, Vermont.",

            "abstract": "Changes in climate, natural vegetation and human land use are expected to significantly influence air quality in the coming century. These changes and their interactions have important ramifications for the effectiveness of air pollution control strategies. In a series of studies, we use a one-way coupled modeling framework (GEOS-Chem driven by different combinations of historical and future meteorological, land cover and emission data) to investigate the effects of climate-vegetation changes on global and East Asian ozone air quality from 30 years ago to 40 years into the future. We find that future climate and climate-driven vegetation changes combine to increase summertime ozone by 2-6 ppbv in populous regions of the US, Europe, East Asia and South Asia by year 2050, but including the interaction between CO2 and biogenic isoprene emission reduces the climate impacts by more than half. Land use change such as cropland expansion has the potential to either mostly offset the climate-driven ozone increases (e.g., in the US and Europe), or greatly increase ozone (e.g., in Southeast Asia). The projected climate-vegetation effects in East Asia are particularly uncertain, reflecting a less understood ozone production regime. We thus further study how East Asian ozone air quality has evolved since the early 1980s in response to climate, vegetation and emission changes to shed light on its likely future course. We find that warming alone has led to a substantial increase in summertime ozone in populous regions by 1-4 ppbv. Despite significant cropland expansion and urbanization, increased summertime leafiness of vegetation in response to warming and CO2 fertilization has reduced ozone by 1-2 ppbv, driven by enhanced ozone deposition dominating over elevated biogenic emission and partially offsetting the warming effect. The historical role of CO2-isoprene interaction in East Asia, however, remains highly uncertain. Our findings demonstrate the important roles of land cover and vegetation in modulating climate-chemistry interactions, and highlight aspects that warrant further investigation.",

During this process, fluxes of N trace gases from soils are likely mediated by interactions between changing soil N availability and primary abiotic biogeochemical drivers in arid systems, namely temperature and wetting/re-wetting dynamics. We investigated the effects of encroachment, season and rainfall dynamics on total reactive N flux (NO, NOy, NH3, N2O) in a sub-tropical, semi-arid Texan savanna encroached by N-fixing Prosopis glandulosa over two years. We compared unencroached upland grasslands and non-fixing woody clusters with continuous Prosopis cover over uplands, intermediate drainages, and playa lowlands. We also quantified denitrification potential of intact soil cores to determine whether N2 could contribute significantly to soil N flux.\nSubstantial soil N enrichment in upland Prosopis groves did not elevate N fluxes above those in remnant grasslands, though lower (moister) landscape positions did exhibit higher total emissions. Along with temperature, soil-wetting dynamics explained the greatest portion of variation in emissions and interacted with vegetation type. Timing and quantity of most recent soil wetting and interval to previous wetting were significant predictors, highlighting the importance of dynamics not captured by soil moisture measurements alone. As with other arid systems, rainfall events after dry periods can stimulate pulse emissions of >400 ug NO-N m-2 h-1. At realistic soil O2 concentrations, N2 fluxes fell below the detection limit of the Nitrogen-Free Atmospheric Recirculation Method system (~11 ug N m-2 h-1). However, applying plausible N2O:N2 flux ratios likely constrains the flux to much lower levels under field conditions. We conclude that encroachment does not increase N fluxes from upland savannas, but that interactions with rainfall and landscape position are important determinants of total emissions.",

            "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effect of the north-south displacement of the Oyashio Extension (OE) SST front on the atmosphere mainly based on satellite-derived observations. An index is used for quantifying the time-varying location of the SST front. After removing ENSO signals, linear regression is applied to interpret the connection between the OE index and a number of climate variables. The variables include surface precipitation rate, rain water, and latent heat at different layers obtained from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, vertical profiles of air temperature and geopotential height from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) along with vertical pressure velocity and other atmospheric variables from the ECMWF Interim Reanalysis.\nIt is found that when the OE makes a northward displacement, there are warm SST signals in the vicinity of the OE region, the Kuroshio Extension region, and the central North Pacific. Over the OE region, increasing surface precipitation and penetration of upward air motion to 500mb are located overlying warm SST anomalies. Over the Kuroshio Extension region, warm SST and upward air motion are collocated with the two ridges of the Kuroshio Extension current meanders. Noticeable but modest meso-scale characteristics of ocean meanders are found in precipitation when a spatial filter is conducted prior to linear regression to isolate small-scale signals. The varying Kuroshio Extension current meanders with the OE displacement leave imprints on air temperature and geopotential height in free atmosphere on the frontal scale. The magnitude of small-scale air temperature and geopotential height response is small compared to the large-scale response, which displays a dipole structure with positive values in the north and negative values in the south of the North Pacific according to the AIRS data. Unlike the AIRS data, the frontal-scale responses of air temperature and geopotential height using ERA-Interim data are confined to the atmospheric boundary layer, implying the limitation of reanalysis data to interpret small-scale variations associating with ocean fronts. This study uses observations longer than 10 years to highlight the impact of SST front variability on the atmosphere not only within the boundary layer but also in free atmosphere.",

We have used this information to evaluate the clay formation conditions in detail through thermochemical modeling (Bridges et al. submitted to JGR; this conference, session 2128) and compare the calculated fluid to those modeled for the nakhlite alteration mineralogy (Hicks et al. DOI: 10.1016/j.gca.2014.04.010, Bridges and Schwenzer, DOI: 10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.044) and other Martian fluids. Concentrating the modeled Gale fluid though evaporation (or freezing) leads to a complex set of precipitates, which include silica, sulfate and halite. For example, 1 kg of brine produced by the alteration of a mixture of 70 % amorphous component, 20 % olivine and 10 % host rock (W/R 1000, T= 10 °C) evaporated to dryness (less that 1 % water left) will precipitate 70 mg of anhydrite, 46 mg of silica, 6.5 mg of halite and traces of pyrite, sulfur, calcite, and apatite. A fluid from this host rock with more mature alteration (W/R 100, T = 10 °C) precipitates the same minerals, but in very different abundances: the most abundant phase at dryness is halite (330 mg), followed by silica (88 mg) and anhydrite (30 mg). The calculated pH varies between 8 and 7.3 in both cases. If the evaporating brine is allowed to interact with the precipitate, a ‘dirty’ sulfate layer or vein filling would result, which could subsequently be refined through dissolution and re-precipitation, a mechanism that, for example, is proposed for the gypsum veins at the UK Triassic coast near Watchet (Philipp doi:10.1017/S0016756808005451). Factors that influence the nature of the precipitate include alteration stage of the host rock during clay formation, and pH and degree of fractionation of the early formed minerals from the evaporating fluid. Using REMS data we also consider desiccation of sulfates in the near surface.",

            "abstract": "For the purposes of detecting nuclear test explosions in the oceans, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) operates a network of underwater hydrophone stations in the oceans and T-phase (seismometer) stations on land adjacent to ocean basins. The requirement for essential maintenance to be carried out on the CTBTO hydrophones means that data from some of these stations may be unavailable for substantial periods of time. In this study we examine the possibility of using seismometer stations located on nearby islands as temporary replacements. To do this, hydrophone station recordings of T-phases for seismic disturbances published in the Reviewed Event Bulletin are compared with the recordings at nearby seismometer stations. A comparison of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for these data from a five-year period shows that many of the T-phases recorded on the CTBTO hydrophones are detected in the 2-6 Hz passband at seismometers located on Ascension Island and Diego Garcia. The T-phase detection capability of the seismometer at Diego Garcia is however limited by the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. This creates a shadow which blocks hydroacoustic waves for sources to the west of Diego Garcia. At higher frequencies the detection capability at Ascension Island is hindered by the presence of high frequency noise, while at Diego Garcia signals above 8 Hz are rarely detected. The absence of high frequencies suggests that while T-phases recorded on nearby seismometers may potentially be used to detect and locate seismic sources when nearby hydrophones are unavailable, source identification by observation of the bubble pulse or high frequency signals diagnostic of an underwater explosion will not be possible.",

            "abstract": "We propose a new framework for parameterization of ocean convection processes. The new framework is termed ‘‘patchy convection’’ since our aim is to represent the heterogeneity of mixing processes that take place within the horizontal scope of a grid cell. We focus on applying this new scheme to represent the effect of pre-conditioning for deep convection by subgrid scale eddy variability. The new scheme relies on mesoscale eddy kinetic energy field.\nWe illustrate the patchy parameterization using a 1D idealized convection case. Next, the scheme is compared against observations. We employed the 1D case using the summer time ARGO floats from the Labrador Sea as initial conditions. We used ECMWF reanalysis atmospheric forcing and compared our results to the winter time ARGO floats. Finally we evaluate the scheme in two different global ocean-ice simulations with prescribed atmospheric forcing (CORE-I); (i) diagnosed eddy velocity field applied only in the Labrador Sea (ii) diagnosed global eddy velocity field. The global simulation results indicate that the patchy convection scheme improves the warm biases in the deep Atlantic Ocean and Southern Ocean. This proof-of-concept study is a first step in developing the patchy parameterization scheme, which will be extended in future to use a prognostic eddy field as well as to parameterize convection due to under-ice brine rejection.

            "abstract": "Currently, there is uncertainty in how climate or land-use-induced changes in hydrology and vegetation will affect subsurface carbon flux, the spatial and temporal distribution of flow and transport, biogeochemical cycling, and microbial metabolic activity. Here we focus on the initial development of a Genome-Enabled Watershed Simulation Capability (GEWaSC), which provides a predictive framework for understanding how genomic information stored in a subsurface microbiome affects biogeochemical watershed functioning, how watershed-scale processes affect microbial function, and how these interactions co-evolve. This multiscale framework builds on a hierarchical approach to multiscale modeling, which considers coupling between defined microscale and macroscale components of a system (e.g., a catchment being defined as macroscale and biogeofacies as microscale).\nHere, we report our progress in the development of a trait-based modeling approach within a reactive transport framework that simulates coupled guilds of microbes. Guild selection is driven by traits extracted from, and physiological properties inferred from, large-scale assembly of metagenome data. Meta-genomic, -transcriptomic and -proteomic information are also used to complement our existing biogeochemical reaction networks and contributes key reactions where biogeochemical analyses are unequivocal. Our approach models the rate of nutrient uptake and the thermodynamics of coupled electron donors and acceptors for a range of microbial metabolisms including heterotrophs and chemolitho(auto)trophs. Metabolism of exogenous substrates fuels catabolic and anabolic processes, with the proportion of energy used for each based upon dynamic intracellular and environmental conditions. In addition to biomass development, anabolism includes the production of key enzymes, such as nitrogenase for nitrogen fixation or exo-enzymes for the hydrolysis of extracellular polymers. This internal resource partitioning represents a trade-off against biomass formation and results in microbial population emergence across a fitness landscape. We use this model in simulations to explore the controls on community emergence and impact on rates of reactions that contribute to the cycling of carbon across distinct redox zones of an aquifer.",

            "abstract": "High-pressure investigations of rare earth transition metal oxide garnets have revealed structural and magnetic phase transitions, including pressure-induced amorphization, magnetic collapse, spin crossover transitions and metallization, as well as transformation to highly-incompressible oxides. Yttrium iron garnet (YIG), Y3Fe5O12, exhibits interesting magnetic properties, behaving as a ferrimagnet with a Néel temperature TN ~ 559 K at ambient pressure and transforming to a paramagnetic material at high temperatures. At high temperatures and pressures, it converts to a GdFeO3-type perovskite structure. However, the composition of the perovskite is debated, with two proposed reaction pathways, leading to either (Y0.75Fe0.25)FeO3–perovskite or a mixture of YFeO3-perovskite and Fe2O3. Here, we synthesized YIG-perovskite in the diamond anvil cell above 18 GPa and 1500 K at GeoSoilEnviroCARS beamline 13-ID-D of the Advanced Photon Source. NaCl was used as a quasihydrostatic pressure medium, and Au, with the Fei equation of state, was used as the pressure calibrant and laser absorber. Our measurements of the perovskite structure extend to 70 GPa with annealing at each pressure step. We do not find any iron oxide diffraction peaks after heating, indicating that the perovskite structure is likely (Y0.75Fe0.25)FeO3. We observe a previously unknown ~5% volume discontinuity in the perovskite between 44 and 50 GPa. This discontinuity is not accompanied by a change in the diffraction pattern, suggesting that the Fe in this structure undergoes a high-spin to low-spin transition. When compressing without laser heating, we confirm the amorphization of YIG starting material at 50 GPa that was previously observed by Gavriliuk et al. (2006). This amorphous material is easily converted to the low-spin perovskite upon heating above 1400 K.",

In situ denitrification (DNT) was measured monthly (April 2013 - October 2014) in organic (peat bog, heathland, acid grassland), forest (mixed and deciduous), and grassland (improved and semi-improved) land use types in the Ribble-Wyre and Conwy River catchments in the UK. A static chamber technique according to the 15N-Gas Flux method1 was employed for quantifying the fluxes of 15N-N2 and 15N-N2O gases after labelling the soil with 98 at% K15NO3- at tracer level amounts (10% of the ambient nitrate concentration) and sampling the chamber headspace at 0, 1, 2 and 20 hour intervals. The DNT rates ranged between 0 and 2.3 mg N m-2 h-1 and were significantly influenced by land use type (p<0.05). The annual denitrification rate of organic and forest soils (4 kg N ha-1 y-1) was 3 and 6 times less than that of semi-improved (12 kg N ha-1 y-1) and improved (23 kg N ha-1 y-1) grassland soils, respectively. The N2O emission, due to denitrification, followed a similar trend with lower fluxes from organic and higher from improved grassland soils (range: 0 – 0.04 mg N m-2 h-1), whilst the N2O:N2 ratio ranged between 0.2 and 4%. The relative contribution of denitrification to net N2O flux varied temporally and across the different land use types and ranged from 0.2 to 75%. The 15N-Gas Flux method can be successfully applied in a variety of land use types for relatively high temporal and spatial resolution measurement of in situ denitrification and the simultaneous quantification of N2 and N2O fluxes due to denitrification. Therefore the ratio of N2O:N2 and also the source apportionment for N2O can be estimated more accurately. The results suggested a difference in DNT rates between unmanaged/ low nitrate content versus managed/ high nitrate content land use types, which was further supported by the significant positive correlation between DNT and soil nitrate content.\n1R.

            "abstract": "Phosphorous (P) Indices are an assessment tool used to identifying agricultural fields most vulnerable to P losses. In the two decades since its introduction, the P Indexing concept has evolved, and there are now P Indices that serve as Best Management Practice (BMP) selection and targeting. While the use of observed P loss data under various management scenarios is the ideal way to assess the accuracy of the P Indices, water quality data, particularly at the field scale, are not widely available and can require years of costly field research to generate. In place of in-situ water quality measurements, the use of locally relevant and corroborated water quality models is a more expedient option to conduct index assessments in the short time required for new standards.\nThe input forcing data required by these models include precipitation and temperature. Unfortunately obtaining representative meteorological data for watershed-scale hydrological modelling can be difficult and time consuming. Land-based weather stations do not always adequately represent the weather occurring over a watershed because they can be far from the watershed of interest and can have gaps in their data series, or recent data are not available. Fuka et al. (2013) has shown that readily available short term forecasting data can match the accuracy of using traditional weather gauging stations, especially when the closest stations are more than 10km from the watershed. In this study we demonstrate a methodology to ascertain the most representative openly accessible weather forcing data for running water quality models in any location in the US. For this P-Index assessment, nine representative project watersheds from the three regional consortiums--Heartland, Chesapeake Bay, and Southern Regions--are used to demonstrate this method of determining what is the most representative weather forcing data for any location within the regions.",

            "abstract": "Orbicella annularis is an abundant ecological cornerstone framework-building Scleractinian coral throughout the Caribbean Sea. The O. annularis holobiont (biotic and abiotic components of the coral) is negatively impacted by increased exposure to anthropogenic pollution. This is consistently evidenced by altered tissue cellular composition, and skeletal structure. The O. annularis’ holobiont is weakened by increased exposure to sewage and ship bilge pollution. Pollution exposure is characterized by decreased skeletal growth, as well as decreased zooxanthellae and chromatophore tissue cell densities. Healthy colonies studied at five sites on the leeward coast of Curacao, along a systematically decreasing pollution concentration, were sampled from the back-reef depositional facies of a protected fringing reef tract. A unidirectional oceanographic current flows to the NW past the city of Willemstad, a large point source of human sewage and ship bilge. This setting creates an ideal natural laboratory for in situ experimentation that quantitatively tracks the impact to coral physiology along a gradient from unimpacted to polluted seawater. Our lab has established laser scanning microscopy for three-dimensional (3D) quantification of zooxanthellae, and chromatophore cellular tissue density. X-ray computed tomography (BioCT) was used for analysis of skeletal density. Zooxanthellae density decreased as pollution concentration increased. Chromatophore density showed no significant relationship with pollution concentration but varied dramatically within each site. This suggests zooxanthellae density is highly impacted by environmental stress while variation in chromatophore density is driven by genetic variation. These results will be used to create a new model for environmental impacts on coral physiology and skeletal growth.",

            "abstract": "Seismic long-period (LP) events are still not completely understood, in part because our source models are poorly constrained. In particular individual LP events are usually inverted using a very limited bandwidth, which might mask important aspects of the source. Following advances from earthquake seismology where sources are inverted using joint static and dynamic data we investigate the possibility of using seismometers as deformation sensors, where ‘static’ displacements are hypothesised to be in the micrometre range (Bean et al. 2014). We use data from high-density networks on a variety of volcanoes. The first component of this study focuses on the extraction of small static displacement steps from seismometer data. The main challenges we face include low signal-to-noise ratios and ambiguity of the extracted ground motion due to the tilt-sensitivity of the instruments. We use a combination of laboratory experiments on seismometers and numerical simulations to investigate the processing steps needed to perform the ‘step’ extraction task and to guide the interpretation of the resulting data. The method is applied to signals recorded near the summits of Turrialba volcano (Costa Rica) and Mt Etna (Italy), which exhibit ramp-like displacement waveforms, coincidently associated by ‘dynamic’ LP recordings. Our interim conclusion is that these LP sources likely have a measurable static component in the source. Our next step is to use this static component to better constrain LP source inversions.",

Those prior measurements revealed the presence of distinct geochemical terranes on Mercury’s surface at the ~1000-km spatial scale. The low-altitude data, in particular measurements acquired below 60 km, provide a spatial resolution of <100 km, facilitating an investigation of the chemical properties of smaller areas of interest. Specific targets include individual polar deposits, fresh impact craters, low-reflectance material, pyroclastic deposits, isolated small expanses of smooth and intercrater plains, and areas with unusual color properties or composition indicated by imaging or other elemental remote sensing observations. Because neutron measurements are particularly sensitive to volatile elements, such as H, Na, and Cl, the low-altitude data provide new insights into volatile transport processes on Mercury, including the sequestration of water ice and other frozen volatile compounds in permanently shadowed craters and volatile-driven volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Many factors drive evolution, although it is not always clear which factors are more influential. Miller et al. (2009) found that there is a change in geographic disparity in diversity in marine biotas over time. We tested if there was also geographic disparity in body size during different epochs.\nWe used marine ostracods, which are tiny crustaceans, as a study group for this analysis. We also studied which factor is more influential in body size change: distance or time. We compared the mean body size from different geologic time intervals as well as the mean body size from different locations for each epoch. We grouped ostracod occurrences from the Paleobiology Database into 10º x 10º grid cells on a paleogeographic map. Then we calculated the difference in mean size and the distance between the grid cells containing specimens. Our size data came from the Ellis & Messina“Catalogue of Ostracod” as well as the“Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology”. Sizes were calculated by applying the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid to three linear dimensions of the ostracod carapace (anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and right-left lengths).\n\nThroughout this analysis we have come to the realization that there is a trend in ostracods towards smaller size over time. Therefore there is also a trend through time of decreasing difference in size between occurrences in different grid cells. However, if time is not taken into account, there is no correlation between size and geographic distance. This may be attributed to the fact that one might not expect a big size difference between locations that are far apart but still at a similar latitude (for example, at the equator). This analysis suggests that distance alone is not the main factor in driving changes in ostracod size over time.",

            "abstract": "Demand for projections of climate extreme events has arisen out of local infrastructure vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning. Global climate models (GCMs) are often too coarse in resolution to provide information specific to regional and local communities. To obtain the local data needed, statistical downscaling methods are frequently used to generate high resolution projections for individual assessments or areas.\nOne element of downscaling that is not often considered is the effect that downscaling has on the magnitude and distribution of changes in extreme events that are projected to occur in GCMs. Our objective is to explore whether or not projected anomalies in both average and extreme precipitation indices from GCMs are preserved after downscaling. To investigate this question we downscaled daily precipitation over Canada from 12 GCMs to 10 km resolution using a Bias Correction Constructed Analogues with Quantile Mapping approach. Downscaled precipitation fields are aggregated to GCM scale (150 km resolution) and the results compared against the driving climate model. We examine whether the downscaling process preserves the projected changes in the large-scale GCM spatial patterns and precipitation distributions using a set of field significance tests.\nComparisons between GCM derived projections and aggregated downscaled projections reveal no significance differences in annual and monthly quantities, however statistically significant differences are present for rarer events such as return periods. Results suggest the downscaling method inflates projected changes for parameters derived from the tails of precipitation distributions leading to larger projected changes in extreme events than those taken directly from the global climate models.",

We investigate the high-latitude Poynting flux enhancement measured by DMSP satellites (F15, F16, F17 and F18) for quiet and main phases of several storm events in this study. The distribution of Poynting Flux enhancement in the polar region is illustrated with a bin size of 2.5 MLAT and 1 hour MLT. Also the horizontal component of ion drift velocity is used to define the Convection Reversal Boundaries (CRBs), which indicate the area of polar cap. The analysis of two storms on August 6, 2011 and September 26, 2011 shows clear enhancement of nightside Poynting flux that is pole-ward of 80 MLAT and well inside CRBs. It is also found that the polar cap can extend equator-ward to 60 MLAT during main phases. Moreover, the track-integrated Poynting flux shows enhancement in both auroral zone and polar cap during main phases, and the Poynting flux in the polar cap can reach above 90% of the total Poynting flux integrated along the track.",

            "abstract": "Snow is considered essential to ecosystems, people, and climate, regulating water availability by mediating runoff and soil moisture throughout the year, and altering planetary radiative balance. Like canary in a coalmine, snow also serves as a kind of sentinel system, providing a benchmark by which we can measure the advance of global warming. Yet recent analyses reveal that the relationship between snow and warming is more complex: Despite warming, for example, the magnitude of internal climate variability suggests some Northern Hemisphere regions may experience snow increases for at least the next 50 years. While studies demonstrate that snow supply is vital and in critical danger, such assessments are based only on projections of annualized supply-side changes, such as the fraction of total annual runoff coming from snowfall. These measures do not consider a region’s unique seasonal patterns of water supply and, in particular, water demand. We therefore do not know snow’s relative importance to each region’s water supply portfolio, and thus how great a risk global warming presents to regional water availability. Here we present the first quantification of snow’s observed role in fulfilling monthly water demand for people in the Northern Hemisphere given each basin’s unique sub-annual patterns of snow accumulation and melt. This quantification also reconciles the requirements of ecosystems and includes the buffering capacity of existing artificial storage, such as dams and reservoirs. Our results provide a meaningful baseline against which projected snow changes (from global warming) or demand changes (from population or land-use change) can be evaluated to identify regions at acute risk of disequilibria between future snow water supply and its demand.",

            "abstract": "The thermal history of the Drummond Basin in central Queensland (Australia) has only been partly investigated. Inverse thermal modeling of apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He data can reveal the complex thermal history of sedimentary basins. We performed (U-Th)/He dating for detrital apatite and zircon grains extracted from five sandstone samples from the Campaspe DDH-1 drill hole. Mean apatite helium ages generally increase from 65.9 Ma (depth = 538 m) to 83.8 Ma (depth = 263 m). The deeper four samples yielded mean zircon helium (ZHe) ages of 289.7 - 278.2 Ma, with a systematic increase of the ZHe ages from deep to shallow samples. The shallowest sample (depth = 117 m) yielded a mean ZHe age of 263.6 Ma. Our inverse thermal modeling suggests five thermal events since burial: (1) rapid heating to the maximum temperature of 180~380 oC during ~320-290 Ma, (2) rapid cooling from ~260 oC to ~80 oC during ~290-240 Ma, (3) subdued cooling from ~80 oC to ~30 oC during ~240-200 Ma, (4) slow heating from ~30 oC to ~80 oC during ~200-80 Ma, followed by (5) rapid cooling from ~80 oC to ~35 oC at ~80 Ma. The timing and temperature conditions of the initial thermal event are consistent with K/Ar ages and temperatures deduced from illite. This period was characterized by voluminous regional magmatism and crustal extension preceding opening of the overlying Bowen Basin. Rapid cooling during ~290-240 Ma identified by our inverse thermal modeling roughly coincides with the thermal relaxation phase and foreland basin phase of the overlying Bowen Basin. This rapid cooling was probably a result of cessation of extension and subsequent contractional events to the east of Bowen Basin. Cooling slowed down during ~240-200 Ma. The Drummond Basin probably underwent serious erosion during this period, coeval with the peneplanation phase of the Bowen Basin. As is delineated by our modeling, the Drummond Basin was slowly heated from ~20 oC to ~90 oC during ~200-80 Ma, synchronous with development of the Eromanga Basin and slow subsidence of the Surat Basin . The final episode of rapid cooling at ~80 Ma identified from our modeling is consistent with regional-scale uplift, denudation and cooling in the nearby Eromanga Basin during Late Cretaceous.",

            "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly important to understand the emissions and health effects of industrial facilities. Many areas have no or limited sustained monitoring capabilities, making it difficult to quantify the major pollution sources affecting human health, especially in fence line communities. Developments in real-time monitoring and micro-scale modeling offer unique ways to tackle these complex issues. This presentation will demonstrate the capability of coupling real-time observations with micro-scale modeling to provide real-time information and near real-time source attribution.\nThe Houston Advanced Research Center constructed the Mobile Acquisition of Real-time Concentrations (MARC) laboratory. MARC consists of a Ford E-350 passenger van outfitted with a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) and meteorological equipment. This allows for the fast measurement of various VOCs important to air quality. The data recorded from the van is uploaded to an off-site database and the information is broadcast to a website in real-time. This provides for off-site monitoring of MARC’s observations, which allows off-site personnel to provide immediate input to the MARC operators on how to best achieve project objectives.\nThe information stored in the database can also be used to provide near real-time source attribution. An inverse model has been used to ascertain the amount, location, and timing of emissions based on MARC measurements in the vicinity of industrial sites. The inverse model is based on a 3D micro-scale Eulerian forward and adjoint air quality model known as the HARC model. The HARC model uses output from the Quick Urban and Industrial Complex (QUIC) wind model and requires a 3D digital model of the monitored facility based on lidar or industrial permit data.\nMARC is one of the instrument platforms deployed during the 2014 Benzene and other Toxics Exposure Study (BEE-TEX) in Houston, TX. The main goal of the study is to quantify and explain the origin of ambient exposure to hazardous air pollutants in an industrial fence line community near the Houston Ship Channel. Preliminary results derived from analysis of MARC observations during the BEE-TEX experiment will be presented.",

A better understanding of atmospheric chemistry across this region requires consideration of variation in precursor emissions. To complement the intensive GoAmazon measurement campaigns that are focused on the interaction of Manaus urban plume with surrounding forest emissions we have established a suite of measurements at the km67 site in the Floresta Nacional do Tapajós, south of Santarem. The site is situated midway between the Tapajos River on the west and the BR 163 highway to the east (upwind). The nearby surroundings for up to 6 km on all sides is intact rain forest. A strip along the east side of the highway and adjacent roads has been cleared for agriculture, but the upwind area is otherwise sparsely populated. The km67 site was initially established in 2001 during the LBA campaign as carbon flux site and included CO measurements to identify influence from local and regional biomass burning. A 64 m tower extends above a 40-45 m closed canopy. In 2014 additional instrumentation including continuous NO/NO2, O3, SO2, and CH4 concentration profiles, NOy concentration and fluxes were added. Volatile organic compound (VOC) measurements using a PTR-HRTOF-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction-High Resolution-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometer) and particle measurements using a nanoSMPS were added during a campaign in June-July 2014. This period was influenced by heavy precipitation; as a result O3 levels above the canopy were rather low, and declined further close to the ground. Even though there was no evidence of anthropogenic influence NO and NO2 concentrations were significant. Elevated concentrations beneath the canopy indicate soil NO emission is the dominant source. Eddy-covariance flux measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC) above the Tapajós forest revealed concentrations and fluxes of more than 100 masses. Most followed a strong diurnal pattern with higher fluxes during the daytime. Some compounds (e.g., isoprene, acetone and monoterpenes) were emitted from the forest canopy while other compounds, primarily oxidation products of the emitted VOC, were deposited to the forest canopy.",

            "abstract": "The safety of CO2 sequestration in geological formations relies on the integrity of the caprock. However, the elevated fluid pressure during CO2 injection changes the stress states in the caprock, and may lead to reactivate pre-existing fractures or even fracture the caprock. It is necessary to develop an efficient and practical monitor technology to detect and identify CO2 leakage pathways. To this end, we should understand the transport behavior of CO2 coupled with geomechanical effects during injection. In this work, we first developed an efficient parallel fully-coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical simulator to model CO2 transport in geological formations. The numerical model was verified through classical problems with analytical solutions. Then, based on this simulator, we investigated the fluid flow behavior when CO2 leakage occurs through fluid-driven fracturing zones. We proposed an implicit, physics-based model to simulate the fluid-driven fracturing process by using several practical correlations, including fracturing pressure functions, porosity/permeability-stress relationships, which can be obtained by lab experiments. A set of numerical simulations have been conducted by considering various scenarios, such as different injection rates, locations and distributions of fracture zones, and initial fracture permeability. The numerical results show that there are several characteristics can be used to detect CO2 leakage pathways, and it is possible to develop an advanced inverse modeling and monitoring technology to identify leakage locations, times and rates using measured pressure data of permanent downhole gauges and our simulator.",

Members of our team from NASA Ames Research Center and the University of Minnesota have been developing new distributed data mining algorithms and developing distributed versions of algorithms originally developed to run on a single machine. We are integrating these algorithms together with the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), an ecological nowcasting and forecasting system, on the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX). We are also developing a framework under which data mining algorithm developers can make their algorithms available for use by scientists in our system, model developers can set up their models to run within our system and make their results available, and data source providers can make their data available, all with as little effort as possible. We demonstrate the substantial time savings and new results that can be derived through this framework by demonstrating an improvement to the Burned Area (BA) data product on a global scale. Our improvement was derived through development and implementation on NEX of a novel spatiotemporal time series change detection algorithm which will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates a real-time system that detects earthquakes using only data from Twitter—a service for sending and reading public text-based messages of up to 140 characters. The detector algorithm scans for significant increases in tweets containing the word “earthquake” in several languages and sends internal alerts with the detection time, representative tweet texts, and the location of the population center where most of the tweets originated. It has been running in real-time for over two years and finds, on average, two or three felt events per day, with a false detection rate of 9%.\nThe main benefit of the tweet-based detections is speed, with most detections occurring between 20 and 120 seconds after the earthquake origin time. This is considerably faster than seismic detections in poorly instrumented regions of the world. The detections have reasonable coverage of populated areas globally. The number of Twitter-based detections is small compared to the number of earthquakes detected seismically, and only a rough location and qualitative assessment of shaking can be determined based on Tweet data alone. However, the Twitter-based detections are generally caused by widely felt events in populated urban areas that are of more immediate interest than those with no human impact. We will present a technical overview of the system and investigate the potential for rapid characterization of earthquake damage and effects using the 32 million “earthquake” tweets that the system has so far amassed.\nInitial results show potential for a correlation between characteristic responses and shaking level. For example, tweets containing the word “terremoto” were common following the MMI VII shaking produced by the April 1, 2014 M8.2 Iquique, Chile earthquake whereas a widely-tweeted deep-focus M5.2 north of Santiago, Chile on April 4, 2014 produced MMI VI shaking and almost exclusively “temblor” tweets. We are also investigating the use of other social media such as Instagram to obtain rapid images of earthquake-related damage. An Instagram search following the damaging M6.9 earthquake near the Mexico, Guatemala boarder on July 7, 2014 reveled half a dozen unconfirmed images of damage; the first posted 15 minutes after the event.",

We more accurately identify the location of the NW-striking, NE-facing Kentucky Bend scarp along the northern Reelfoot fault, which is spatially associated with the Lake County uplift, contemporary seismicity, and changes in the Mississippi River from the February 1812 earthquake. We use 1m-resolution LiDAR hillshades and slope surfaces, aerial photography, soil surveys, and field geomorphic mapping to estimate the location, pattern, and amount of late Holocene coseismic surface deformation. We define eight late Holocene to historic fluvial deposits, and delineate younger alluvia that are progressively inset into older deposits on the upthrown, western side of the fault. Some younger, clayey deposits indicate past ponding against the scarp, perhaps following surface deformational events. The Reelfoot fault is represented by sinuous breaks-in-slope cutting across these fluvial deposits, locally coinciding with shallow faults identified via seismic reflection data (Woolery et al., 1999). The deformation pattern is consistent with NE-directed reverse faulting along single or multiple SW-dipping fault planes, and the complex pattern of fluvial deposition appears partially controlled by intermittent uplift. Six localities contain scarps across correlative deposits and allow evaluation of cumulative surface deformation from LiDAR-derived topographic profiles. Displacements range from 3.4±0.2 m, to 2.2±0.2 m, 1.4±0.3 m, and 0.6±0.1 m across four progressively younger surfaces. The spatial distribution of the profiles argues against the differences being a result of along-strike uplift variability. We attribute the lesser displacements of progressively younger deposits to recurrent surface deformation, but do not yet interpret these initial data with respect to possible earthquake magnitudes. Additional efforts hopefully will address shallow subsurface evidence of single- or multiple-deformational events at selected localities.",

            "abstract": "Solar flares produce non-thermal electrons with energies up to tens of MeVs. To understand the origin of energetic electrons, coronal hard X-ray sources in particular ‘above-the-looptop’ sources have been studied extensively. However, it still remains unclear how energies are partitioned between thermal and non-thermal electrons within the above-the-looptop source. Here we show that the kappa distribution, when compared to conventional spectral models, can better characterize the above-the- looptop hard X-rays (>~15 keV) observed in four different cases. The combined thermal plus power-law distribution can also fit the data, but it returns unreasonable parameter values due to the artifact of its sharp, lower-energy cutoff Ec. In two cases with extreme-ultraviolet data from SDO/AIA, the analysis of differential emission measure (DEM) did not rule out the kappa distribution model. Based on the kappa distribution model, we found that the 2012 July 19 flare showed the largest non-thermal fraction of electron energies about 50%, suggesting equipartition. Considering results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well as density estimates of the four cases studied, we propose a scenario in which electron energization is achieved primarily by collisionless magnetic reconnection but the non-thermal tail can be suppressed or thermalized by Coulomb collisions.",

            "abstract": "At the annual scale, water balance variability may result directly from inter-annual fluctuation of the climate drivers. However, intra-annual (i.e., within-year) variability of climate drivers and their nonlinear interactions with the landscape can also affect the inter-annual water balance variability. How climate variability at intra-annual and inter-annual time scales and hydrological effects of land use and land cover changes propagate through the landscape and result in changes in spatiotemporal variability of water balance is an important question when the earth system is facing multiple changes that challenge sustainable water management. In this study, the inter- and intra-annual variability of streamflow from over 250 natural catchments across the contiguous United States is systematically examined based on a framework that partitions the total temporal variability into inter- and intra-annual variance components. It is found that the dominance of the intra-annual variance over the inter-annual variance of streamflow decreases under drier climate, and this phenomenon is mostly controlled by the subsurface runoff. The intra-annual variance of streamflow increases with that of precipitation and decreasing with that of potential evapotranspiration. Moreover, a damping effect has been found for the temporal variance components of streamflow to those of precipitation, as indicated by the values of the deviation ratio (i.e., the variance components of streamflow divided by the corresponding components of precipitation) mostly less than one. This damping effect can be linked to the interactions of catchment water availability and evaporative energy availability at both inter- and intra-annual scales. These empirical findings will help improve water resources management at the ungauged basins and opens a window for further process-based investigations.",

On the other hand, few local subsurface structures beneath volcanoes whose volcanic activities are low have been investigated in detail, though it is important to study them to understand the potential of volcanic activity of these volcanoes. Then, we analyzed the seismic attenuation beneath Tateyama volcano (Midagahara volcano) located in central Japan, whose volcanic activity is quite low.\nWe used seismograms obtained by Hi-net deployed by NIED (National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention). Hi-net is one of the densest seismic station networks in the world, and the spatial interval of their seismographs is about 20 km, which is suitable for investigating local structure beneath an individual volcano. We estimated S-wave attenuation using seismograms at five stations near Tateyama volcano for nineteen small, local, shallow earthquakes (M 2.7-4.0) that occurred from January 2012 to December 2013. We divided these earthquakes into six groups according to their hypocenter locations.\nWe used twofold spectral ratios around the first S-arrivals to investigate the S-wave attenuation when S-waves passed through the region beneath Tateyama volcano. We focused on station pairs located on opposite sides of Tateyama volcano to each other, and earthquake pairs whose epicenters were located almost along the line connecting Tateyama volcano and the two stations, so that the spectral ratios reflect a local structure beneath Tateyama volcano.\nTwofold spectral ratios of all seismograms for S waves having northwestern or southeastern sources show strong attenuation beneath Tateyama volcano. On the other hand, those of seismograms having northeastern or southwestern sources show much weaker attenuation, which suggested that the region of strong attenuation is anisotropic and/or has complicated shape.",

            "abstract": "Prediction of large scale coastal behavior is especially challenging in areas of pervasive human activity. Many coastal zones on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts are moderately to highly modified through the use of soft sediment and hard stabilization techniques. These practices have the potential to alter sediment transport and availability, as well as reshape the beach profile, ultimately transforming the natural evolution of the coastal system.\nWe present the results of a series of probabilistic models, designed to predict the observed geomorphic response to high wave events at Fire Island, New York. The island comprises a variety of land use types, including inhabited communities with modified beaches, where beach nourishment and artificial dune construction (scraping) occur, unmodified zones, and protected national seashore. This variation in land use presents an opportunity for comparison of model accuracy across highly modified and rarely modified stretches of coastline.\nEight models with basic and expanded structures were developed, resulting in sixteen models, informed with observational data from Fire Island. The basic model type does not include anthropogenic modification. The expanded model includes records of nourishment and scraping, designed to quantify the improved accuracy when anthropogenic activity is represented. Modification was included as frequency of occurrence divided by the time since the most recent event, to distinguish between recent and historic events.\nAll but one model reported improved predictive accuracy from the basic to expanded form. The addition of nourishment and scraping parameters resulted in a maximum reduction in predictive error of 36%. The seven improved models reported an average 23% reduction in error. These results indicate that it is advantageous to incorporate the human forcing into a coastal hazards probability model framework.",

This has drawn attention to prospects for flood forecasts to protect life and livelihoods. Typical forecasts emphasize the short-term (hours to days) scale to inform immediate response action. Longer-range forecasts, on the order of months to seasons, however, could compliment short-range forecasts by focusing on disaster preparedness. Initially, we define key flood seasons globally, at grid and basin scales, which are most likely to contain the most severe annual flood using observational (GRDC) and model (PCR-GLOBWB) streamflow data over 1958-2000. Model–defined flood seasons strongly agree (89% of time) with flood seasons defined through observations. Model–defined flood seasons were also qualitatively verified with actual flood records over 1985-2008 from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory records. Subsequently we have begun investigating the effects of inter-annual climate variability on seasonal maximum floods, particularly how ENSO and other large-scale phenomena may modulate discharge and flood severity. Skillful relationship have led to preliminary seasonal global flood forecast models, at the basin scale, providing early (season-ahead) flood probabilities, flood extent, and estimated damages.",

            "abstract": "The USGS has an ongoing National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards project that provides data, analysis, and assessments of coastal change hazards on a national scale. As part of this effort, the USGS is developing a systematic comprehensive coastal landform classification system for the nation’s coast. The primary focus is a hierarchical characterization of natural landforms along the coast, but the framework also includes anthropogenic metrics. The framework is intended to be open-ended and adaptable based on availability and relevancy of data. The purpose of the framework is to provide a comprehensive organization for a vast and varied database of relevant geologic and anthropogenic information (both qualitative and quantitative) related to coastal change hazards.\nThe framework is divided geographically and is comprised of five units: 1) natural landform type (foreshore and backshore); 2) geology; 3) level of anthropogenic development; 4) engineering structures; and 5) beach nourishment. The units are categorically separated but are designed to be utilized in conjunction with each other to describe the makeup, character, and processes that may influence change along a given coastal area. For the natural landform types, the foreshore is defined as extending from the mean high water to the base of the backshore feature. The levels of anthropogenic development range from ‘none’ to ‘high intensity’ based on the data from the USGS National Land Cover Database.\nA pilot implementation of the natural landform and anthropogenic development units of the framework was developed for the Mid-Atlantic region, from New York through Virginia. Initial queries of the database indicate that the primary foreshore landforms along the Mid-Atlantic coast are barrier island beaches (62%), mainland beaches (21%), and barrier spits (16%). Almost forty percent of this coastal region is categorized as having a medium or high intensity level of development.\nThe framework will allow users to access and extract relevant information about the coast and will provide a baseline system that can be populated and updated as new data becomes available. The classification database will provide a valuable resource to help inform the scientific and management communities about the relevant factors influencing coastal change hazards.",

Data assimilation impacts due to both different instrument capabilities (i.e. vertical sensitivity and global coverage) will be discussed. For example, using a multispectral retrieval approach, MOPITT has enhanced measurement sensitivity toward the surface compared to IASI. Conversely, IASI spatial sampling covers the globe in one day while it takes four days for MOPITT. Impacts of these two different nadir sounder properties will be compared using data assimilation. Effects of a combined data assimilation experiment and synergies between the two instruments in the middle and the lowermost troposphere will be shown.",

            "abstract": "The exploration of unconventional gas resource achieved a successful breakthrough in USA due to the innovation of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling since 1995. The production of shale gas dramatically changed the energy structure and released the demand of fossil fuel in USA. Many studies about the unconventional oil-gas resource were performed worldwide especially in China, which provide very useful characterization for unconventional gas reservoirs. Since Taiwan has a strong energy demand and still highly relied on imported fossil fuel, the development of unconventional gas resource needs to be concerned. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of unconventional oil-gas in Taiwan. In this study, we examine mineral composition and pore structure of Miocene oil-gas bearing strata from the Western Foothill Belt in Taiwan. Sandstone samples were collected from Cholan Fm, Yutengpin ss, Kuantaoshan ss, Shangfuchi ss, Tungkeng Fm, Guanyinshang ss and Peiliao Fm; whereas shale samples were collected from Chinshui sh and Talu sh, as well as outcropped coal sample from Nanchung Fm. The porosity, permeability, TOC, thermal maturity, and mineral composition of samples are examined after a series of geochemical experiments. Finally, after comparing the data with their gas sorption capacity, the reservoir with the strongest potential in unconventional gas resource can be identified.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone is a potentially important producer of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas. The location and magnitude of nitrous oxide generation within the hyporheic zone involves complex interactions between multiple nitrogen species, redox conditions, microbial communities, and hydraulics. To better understand nitrous oxide generation and emissions from streams, we conducted large-scale flume experiments in which we monitored pore waters along hyporheic flow paths within stream dune structures. Measured dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and dissolved nitrous oxide showed distinct spatial relationships reflecting redox changes along flow paths. Denitrifying genes (nosZ, nirS, and nirK), determined using qPCR, were spatially associated with abundances of nitrogen species. Using residence times along a flow path, clear trends in oxygen conditions, genes encoding for microbial catalysis, and nitrogen species were observed. Hotspots of targeted genes correlated with hotspots for conversion of nitrogen species, including nitrous oxide production and conversion to dinitrogen. Trends were apparent regardless of dune size, allowing for the possibility to apply observed relationships to multiple streambed morphologies. Relating streambed morphology and loading of nitrogen species allows for prediction of nitrous oxide production in the hyporheic zone.",

            "abstract": "While natural wetlands are the largest natural source of methane, they also accumulate substantial amounts of carbon, with estimates of peat accumulated during the Holocene reaching 600 PgC. The consideration of natural wetlands in land surface models therefore is an important challenge for closing the GHG budgets on both short and long time scales.\nIn order to mechanistically model glacial-interglacial carbon cycle dynamics, we have developed a dynamical model of wetland extent and wetland biogeochemistry, which we have integrated in the coupled climate carbon cycle model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER2-LPJ. This model consists of the climate model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER2, containing dynamic models of atmosphere and ocean, as well as sea ice and land surface modules. Its coarse spatial resolution leads to a high computational speed, which allows long-term transient integrations of the coupled model.\nLand carbon dynamics are computed using the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ, running at a high spatial resolution of 0.5° and coupled to CLIMBER2 using the climate anomalies approach. Changes in land carbon storage as a response to changes in climate or atmospheric CO2 are therefore taken into account interactively at high spatial resolution.\nWithin this model, we have implemented a module that dynamically determines the extent of a grid cell that is inundated, based on the TOPMODEL approach, incorporating sub-grid scale information on hydrological properties of the land surface. Within the wetlands determined, decomposition of carbon is slowed under anaerobic conditions and methane is generated, which is emitted via the three pathways of diffusion, ebullition and plant mediated transport. In addition, the excess of biomass production over organic matter decomposition in permanent wetlands leads to accumulation of peat.\nWe have performed model experiments covering the climatic range from the last glacial maximum to future climate states and will present selected results from these experiments, discussing wetland extent changes and changes in methane emissions, as well as Holocene carbon uptake by peatlands.",

In addition to its use as a circulation proxy, the particulate Pa/Th ratio has been suggested to monitor total particle flux and/or diatom productivity via processes related to the scavenging, or the adsorptive removal of these elements onto particles. We investigate the nature of scavenging using trans-Atlantic measurements from GEOTRACES of dissolved (<0.45 µm) and particulate (0.8-51 µm) 231Pa and 230Th, together with major particle composition. We find widespread impact of intense scavenging by authigenic Fe/Mn oxides, in the form of hydrothermal particles emanating from the Mid-Atlantic ridge and particles resuspended from reducing conditions near the seafloor off the coast of West Africa. Biogenic opal was not a significant scavenging phase for either element, essentially because of its low abundance at the studied sites.\nIn the context of the paleo-record, the particulate Pa/Th ratio responds most significantly to scavenging intensity, caused by either biotic or abiotic processes. In the modern setting at least, the influence of North Atlantic Deep Water circulation on Pa/Th is apparently outweighed. The Pa/Th proxy, therefore, is best used in conjunction with other information to support the cause for past changes in scavenging intensity.",

            "abstract": "The size of sediments produced on hillslopes and supplied to channels regulates river incision and thus landscape evolution in steep mountain catchments, yet the controls on sediment size are poorly understood. Analysis using cosmogenic nuclides and detrital thermochronometry on samples collected at the outlet of Inyo Creek, California, has quantified spatial variation in the size of sediment produced on hillslopes, however field data are needed to validate and explain the findings. We report on a field campaign to measure hillslope grain size distributions, and correlate size variations with topographic, geomorphic, and climatic attributes, across an elevation gradient in this steep catchment. We begin by mapping hillslope geomorphic process regimes, which in this watershed, underlain by granodiorite, are: bare bedrock that erodes by spallation and landsliding, angle of repose slopes of talus, landslide and debris flow deposits, and at lower elevations, soil-mantled convex hillslopes. For each process regime, we select sampling sites to span a wide elevation range. We use tape transects to measure the size of particles >100 mm, the extent of bedrock exposure, and density of vegetation. For finer sediments we collect bulk samples for sieve analysis in the lab. On bare bedrock, we measure joint spacing to infer the size of rock fragments produced. For steep, inaccessible areas we analyze photographs, scaled by objects of known size. Early results suggest that sediment production occurs primarily on bare bedrock surfaces that supply regolith-covered surfaces below, which serve as transport pathways and storage reservoirs. At lower elevations in the catchment, size distributions are bimodal, with only large boulders and fine-gravel and sand. At higher elevations, slopes near the channel have a more continuous distribution, including gravel, cobbles, and small boulders. Results to-date are broadly consistent with the geochemical analysis, which found that higher elevation slopes supply coarser sediment. Our ongoing field measurements of hillslope size distributions at Inyo Creek, combined with additional geochemical data, will help test the hypothesis that sediment size varies systematically with elevation, because of altitudinal gradients in climate and dominant erosional process.",

This study expands on these early results using observations from the Polar spacecraft. The distributions by charge state show O6+, from the solar wind, charge exchanging into O5+, O4+, and O3+ as the ion populations drift to lower L-shells. Meanwhile, ionospheric O+ and O2+ are primarily seen at low L-shells and may also play a role in O3+ populations. We present here the Kp, Bz, and AE dependencies of oxygen charge states (O+ through O6+) in MLT and L-shell in the magnetosphere of the Earth.

            "abstract": "In March 2013, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft began its Second Extended Mission (XM2) to acquire observations of Mercury’s surface and interior at unprecedented spatial resolution and measurements of the planet’s dynamic magnetosphere and exosphere at high temporal resolution during the peak and declining phase of the current solar cycle. XM2 is framed by six science questions, each motivated by discoveries and observations made during MESSENGER’s Primary and First Extended Missions: (1) What active and recent processes have affected Mercury’s surface? (2) How has the state of stress in Mercury’s crust evolved over time? (3) How have compositions of volcanic materials on Mercury evolved over time? (4) What are the characteristics of volatile emplacement and sequestration in Mercury’s north polar region? (5) What are the consequences of precipitating ions and energetic electrons at Mercury? (6) How do Mercury’s exosphere and magnetosphere respond to both extreme and stable solar wind conditions during solar maximum and the declining phase of the solar cycle? Also since March 2013, the periapsis altitude, or closest approach distance to Mercury’s surface, has declined progressively with each orbit, in response to the gravitational attraction of the Sun, although the rate of that decline depends on the angle between the Mercury–Sun line and MESSENGER’s orbit plane. For the first year of XM2, no propulsive orbit-correction maneuvers (OCMs) were conducted to change the evolution of the spacecraft’s orbital parameters. Because sufficient propellant remained at the end of that year to complete four periapsis-raising OCMs, a low-altitude campaign was designed to use those maneuvers to maximize the number of orbits for which the periapsis altitude is as low as 15–25 km. The periapsis altitude passed below 200 km altitude for the first time on 20 April 2014 and below 100 km altitude for the first time on 25 July 2014. It will reach 25 km for three extended intervals prior to OCMs on 12 September and 24 October 2014 and 21 January 2015. A two-week period in February and March 2015 during which the periapsis altitude will be ~15 km precedes the end of mission on 28 March 2015 and will provide the highest-resolution observations of Mercury ever attained.",

            "abstract": "Together, the Etendeka flood basalt province of Namibia, the old Walvis Ridge and the young Walvis Ridge guyot province constitute a 130 Myr record of hotspot volcanism in the South Atlantic. Previous age-dating along the Walvis Ridge has revealed a strong linear age progression (~30 mm/a, Rohde et al. 2013) that is consistent with modeled relative spreading rates between the African and South American plates (~33 mm/a over the past 3 Myr, NUVEL-1 model). However, tracing the path of the African plate over the Tristan-Gough hotspot is more complicated in the guyot province because the seamounts do not form a single trail. Instead we see a region of diffuse volcanism with multiple discontinuous linear sub-tracks of seamounts and coeval volcanism at edifices located up to 400 km apart. We present here the results of 24 new 40Ar/39Ar step-heating experiments on groundmass and phenocryst separates from trachybasalts, trachy-andesites, trachytes and similarly evolved rocks dredged from the guyot province in 2012. The age-dating results represent nine seamounts in the southern half of the guyot province, most of which have never been studied before. We will combine the new ages with previous high-resolution ages from nearby seamounts to constrain plate motion rates recorded by each of the sub-tracks. We will compare the results with previously-established absolute plate motion models in order to shed light on the relationship between plume dynamics and the unusual spatial distribution of volcanism in this region.",

            "abstract": "Arsenic is found naturally in the soils in the Mekong delta in Vietnam and Cambodia. It originates from erosion in the Himalayas. When similar levels of arsenic are present in well aerated soil, it is not dangerous, because it is strongly bound to soil particles and not readily plant available. Arsenic is released when the soil is saturated with water, and therefore contaminates crops grown in flooded fields. This results in people being exposed to unsafe levels of arsenic from their food, such as rice and lotus, which are normally grown under flooded conditions. Rice is a staple food in these regions, so the transfer of arsenic from soil, to water, and ultimately into the grain, poses a threat to human health.\nWe have conducted a limited, preliminary field survey of arsenic levels in soil, flood water, and crops from distinctly different paddy fields in the lower Mekong delta in Vietnam and Cambodia. The purpose of the study was to identify soils and crops (or specific plant parts) that are especially prone to arsenic transfer from soil to crop, and vice versa (i.e. arsenic uptake is prevented in spite of being present in the soil). In addition to arsenic concentration in soil, plant and water, we are examining other elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and iron, which give us clues about what chemical and microbial processes that control the overall arsenic uptake.",

            "abstract": "The International Mars Exploration Working Group (IMEWG) chartered an iMARS working group in 2007 to develop a plan for an international Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission potentially occurring in the timeframe 2018-2023. In early 2014, IMEWG reconstituted iMARS with the objectives of elaborating on the scientific management aspects of returned martian samples and incorporating technical developments since 2008 including NASA’s Mars Science Laboratory and planned Mars2020 mission and ESA’s partnership and progress with Roscosmos on ExoMars. In this discussion, the iMARS science subteam describe their approach and some preliminary organizational and operational models for a fully international sample-science management paradigm.\nScientific management of the samples - from reception on Earth to distribution amongst the scientific community and through to long-term curation for many decades hence - is a diverse and complex issue. Samples returned from Mars would be amongst the most scientifically interesting and valuable materials ever recovered and would be the focus of intensive study and investigation for decades to come. Future MSR mission(s) would be international in nature, and a key driver for our discussions is to ensure that any processes we suggest enable internationally collaborative research. A further constraint is the issue of planetary protection, whereby samples must remain in containment until proven non-hazardous to Earth’s biosphere and environment. However, a genuine concern is that the samples become “stuck in containment” and unavailable for wider scientific study. A wide range of geobiological analyses would be carried out, and an important part of planning for MSR is deciding which analyses must be carried out within containment and what could or should be done outside of containment. In addition, the nature and type of geobiological investigations carried out in situ by future missions would have an important influence on activities carried out once samples return to Earth by informing decisions made during preliminary examination, early science, and planetary protection investigations. Our team is strongly committed to disseminating our work to our colleagues in the geo-, bio- and planetary science communities to ensure that a productive dialogue is achieved.",

            "abstract": "In 2009, a multi-scale seismic tomography experiment was conducted on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge aboard the R/V Marcus G. Langseth. Ocean bottom seismometers were deployed at 64 sites and recorded 5567 shots of a 36-element, 6600 in.3 airgun array. The experiment extended 100 km along-axis and 60 km cross-axis. Two crustal tomographic analyses have previously been completed using data from the experiment. First, 93,000 manually picked crustal refraction arrivals (Pg) were used to develop a three-dimensional model of crustal velocity and thickness in the upper crust (Weekly et al. 2014). Second, this model was used as the starting model in an analysis that incorporated ~19,000 Moho reflection arrivals (PmP) for non-ridge crossing paths to image lower crustal velocity structure and crustal thickness off-axis. A key feature of this model is a ~0.5-1 km increase in crustal thickness beneath a bathymetric plateau that extends to either side of the central portion of the Endeavour segment. We present a tomographic inversions that incorporates ridge-crossing paths to examine spatial variations in lower crustal velocity and crustal thickness beneath the ridge axis. The preliminary results from an inversion that incorporates ~8700 manually picked ridge-crossing PmP arrival times reveals a ~10-km-wide low velocity zone extending throughout the lower crust with a velocity anomaly of -0.3 to -0.5 km/s at ≥4 km depth. This low velocity zone extends both to the north and south of the axial magma chamber reflector imaged previously beneath the central Endeavour. The inversion also shows significant variations in apparent crustal thickness along axis but additional analysis is required to understand whether these variations are well resolved.",

            "abstract": "Shallow groundwater-fed seepage springs, also known as hypotelminorheic habitats, are found around the Washington, DC area, including in the George Washington Parkway, a National Park unit in northern Virginia. These springs differ from better-known vernal pools both in their hydrology and their ecology: because they are groundwater-fed, they are more resistant to drying out than vernal pools, and they harbor cave-adapted arthropod species including amphipods of the genus Stygobroumus. This project seeks to understand the ecohydrology of the hypotelminorheic habitats that support these species, some of which are endangered, and which comprise an important but underappreciated component of biodiversity in DC-area National Parks. Our study focuses on two hypotelminorheic habitats in the GW Parkway area and consists of three main components: (1) a weekly population census of Stygobroumus using multiple mark-recapture methodology, (2) weekly monitoring of dissolved radon, a tracer of groundwater discharge, as well as conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH, and (3) continuous logging of spring water temperature. This poster presents preliminary data from the Stygobroumus population census and explores how these animals may be affected by spring hydrology. Specifically, we use temperature, conductivity, radon activity and precipitation data from a nearby weather station to understand how the springs respond to episodic and seasonal variation in temperature, precipitation and groundwater seepage and how this affects Stygobromus populations. We also explore whether variations in Stygobromus counts reflect (1) active migration between the surficial spring and the larger subterranean habitat, or (2) passive flushing driven by groundwater discharge. Our results provide basic hydrologic data about a little-understood habitat type and will help managers protect Stygobromus in the urban park environment.",

            "abstract": "Oxidation of organic aerosols can lead to changes in their atmospheric lifetime, optical properties and health effects. Whereas much is known about the rates of reaction and subsequent branching ratios of gas-phase organic species, much less is known about their condensed phase counterparts. The determination of the kinetics and abundances of the oxidation products associated with condensed phase reactions is needed to understand the oxidation reaction pathways and their branching ratios. The Vacuum Ultraviolet Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (VUV-AMS) at the Chemical Dynamics Beamline at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been useful in determining the reaction rate constants for a number of condensed phase organic compounds with oxidants such as OH and O3. The relatively soft ionization in the VUV-AMS leads to substantially less fragmentation than other AMS instruments that use electron impact ionization, and therefore preserves a greater amount of molecular information about parent molecules. Previously, ketones formed from the heterogenous oxidation of model organic compounds have been identified and their formation kinetics quantified. However, other possible products, such as alcohols and organic peroxides, have not previously been identified in the VUV-AMS mass spectra or characterized as these are subject to greater fragmentation. Here, we present a method in which the fragmentation pattern is specified for each alcohol isomer formed from the oxidation of two model organic compounds, bis-2-ethylhexl sebacate and squalane. From this we are able to define unique m/z fragments for each isomer from which we derive information about alcohol and abundances. This study demonstrates additional methods for the analysis of mass spectra obtained with the VUV-AMS as well as provides insights into condensed phase oxidation kinetics.",

            "abstract": "Data centers struggle with difficulties related to data submission. Data are acquired through many avenues by many people. Many data submission activities involve intensive manual processes. During the submission process, data end up on varied storage devices. The situation can easily become chaotic. Collecting information on the status of pending data sets is arduous. For data providers, the submission process can be inconsistent and confusing. Scientists generally provide data from previous projects, and archival can be a low priority. Incomplete or poor documentation accompanies many data sets. However, complicated questionnaires deter busy data providers.\nAt the ORNL DAAC, we have semi-automated the data set submission process to create a uniform data product and provide a consistent data provider experience. The formalized workflow makes archival faster for the data center and data set submission easier for data providers. Software modules create a flexible, reusable submission package. Formalized data set submission provides several benefits to the data center. A single data upload area provides one point of entry and ensures data are stored in a consistent location. A central dashboard records pending data set submissions in a single table and simplifies reporting. Flexible role management allows team members to readily coordinate and increases efficiency. Data products and metadata become uniform and easily maintained. As data and metadata standards change, modules can be modified or re-written without affecting workflow.\nWhile each data center has unique challenges, the data ingestion process is generally the same: get data from the provider, scientist, or project and capture metadata pertinent to that data. The ORNL DAAC data set submission workflow and software modules can be reused entirely or in part by other data centers looking for a data set submission solution. These data set submission modules will be available on NASA's Earthdata Code Collaborative and by request.",

            "abstract": "Ionospheric conductance is a key component necessary for characterizing high-latitude electrodynamics at all scale sizes, yet remains difficult to observe directly. Gradients in the local conductance are a key mechanism that support the closure of field-aligned currents. The enhancement of conductance caused by auroral particle precipitation has been difficult to assimilate into global conductance models. Thus, determining the conductance on mesoscale sizes (100s of km) is important for linking local scale sizes (1-10s of km) and global scale sizes (> 1000 km). Incoherent scatter radar is able to obtain high spatially resolved measurements on the local scale sizes, whereas, all-sky imagers are able to obtain mesoscale maps of visible auroral emission. Flexible, rapidly steered ISRs, such as Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) systems enable imaging of the electron density and conductivities. We present results of case studies from observations taken during the PFISR Ion-Neutral Observations of the Thermosphere (PINOT) campaign to examine the structure of the conductance for stable auroral configurations near magnetic zenith. All sky imager observations are presented which characterize the visible aurora simultaneously observed by the ISR. We discuss the techniques used to take measurements of conductance from the ISR and project them onto the all-sky image. The characteristic energy and energy flux using other techniques are compared against the radar derived characteristic energy and energy flux. We investigate techniques for remotely determining mesoscale conductance using ISR and all-sky imagers to investigate the role conductance has in high-latitude electrodynamics.",

            "abstract": "A discrepancy that has been seen in a number of climate models is that simulated temperatures in the Antarctic lower stratosphere during winter and spring are much lower than observed; this is referred to as the “cold pole” problem. Recent simulations with the NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model have shown that polar stratospheric temperatures are much improved by including a parameterization of gravity waves, which have inertial periods, longer horizontal wavelengths and shorter vertical wavelengths than the mesoscale gravity waves already parameterized in this and most other middle atmosphere models. Improvements include a more realistic seasonal development of the ozone hole and somewhat better timing for the winter to summer transition in the zonal winds and Brewer-Dobson Circulation.\nAlthough the availability and quality of observations of gravity waves in the middle atmosphere has been increasing, there are still not sufficient observations to validate the inertial gravity wave morphology and distribution in the model. Here, we use constraints from new analyses of radiosonde observations to provide guidance for the horizontal and vertical wavelengths of the waves, their seasonal variability, and their potential sources such as fronts or flow imbalance. Tighter observational constraints remove an element of arbitrary “tuning” and tie the model simulations of the middle atmosphere more closely to the simulated climate.",

            "abstract": "A compact differential absorption ozone lidar (DIAL) system has been developed called the Langley Mobile Ozone Lidar (L-MOL) which can provide ozone, aerosol and cloud atmospheric profiles from a mobile trailer for ground-based atmospheric air quality campaigns. This lidar is integrated into the Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) currently made up of four other ozone lidars, three of which are mobile, across the country. The laser transmitter consist of a Coherent Evolution 30 TEM00 1-kHz diode pumped Q-switched Nd:YLF inter-cavity doubled laser pumping a Ce:LiCAF tunable UV laser. The transmitter transmits ~60 mW at two wavelengths between 280 and 293-nm for ozone and 2.5-W at 527-nm for aerosol profiling. The lidar operates at 1-kHz with 500-Hz at each 0f two UV wavelength. A fiber coupled 40-cm diameter parabolic telescope collets the backscattered return and records analog and photon counting signals. A separate 30-cm diameter telescope collects very near field returns for ozone profiles close to the surface. The lidar is capable of recording ozone profiles from 100-500-m with the very near field telescope and from 800-m to approximately 6000-m with the far field channel depending on sky background conditions.\nThe system has been configured to enable mobile operation from a trailer which is environmentally controlled, and is towed with a truck with the objective to make the system mobile such that it can be setup at remote sites to support air quality field campaigns such as the July-August 2014 Denver, CO DISCOVER_AQ campaign.\nBefore the lidar was deployed in the DISCOVER-AQ campaign the lidar operated for 15 hours at NASA Langley in Hampton, VA to test the ability of the system to accurately record ozone profiles. The figure below shows the results of that test. Six ozonesondes were launched during this period and show reasonable agreement with the ozone (ppbv) curtain plot. Ozone of stratospheric origin at 4-14 UTC was noted as well as local ozone production at 18 UTC. The system was then deployed in the DISCOVER-AQ campaign at South Table Mountain in Golden, CO.  Results from that campaign will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Global chemistry-climate models have been used to simulate the evolution of the atmospheric composition over the past decades. These simulations have been performed in free-running and specified dynamic modes, using the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 included in the the NCAR Community Earth System Model.\nWe have analyzed the long-term changes as well as the interannual variability of several atmospheric compounds with a focus on ozone, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. We have investigated the behavior of these species by focusing on two regions, Europe and Asia. In Europe, surface emissions have decreased significantly since the 1980s, which have led to a decrease in the concentrations of several tropospheric compounds. On the contrary, emissions in Asia have dramatically increased, particularly during the past two decades, which has resulted in large increases in the atmospheric content of several species.\nWe have used in-situ observations of O3, CO and NO2 from the Cooperative Air Sampling Network and from network of the European monitoring and evaluation programme (EMEP) to analyze the model results in different stations in the regions under consideration. We have also compared the model results with remote sensing observations from MOPITT, OMI, GOME, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY instruments. Results show an underestimation of modeled CO concentrations, which has also been reported by previous studies. We will also analyse the simulated O3 and NO2 concentrations through comparisons with monitoring surface stations and satellite observations.",

            "abstract": "Sodic playa surfaces can be major sources of dust emission but their erodibility depends on the surface salt crust characteristics. Here we determine dust emission thresholds in a wind tunnel for 22 different crusts with varying concentrations of sodium sulphate and sodium chloride. Crusts mimic those on Sua Pan, in the Makgadikgadi Basin, Botswana, which is one of the biggest dust hot spots in the Southern Hemisphere. Crusts were grown by encouraging capillary processes and subjected to several weeks of diurnal temperature variation to enable the development of hydrated and dehydrated salt crystals, along with low density, ‘fluffy’ sediment beneath the primary (and in some cases, secondary) crust. Spray on crusts and liquefied crusts were also developed for response comparison. Using laser scanning we tracked surface change and crystal growth, which we link to crust type and evaporation rates. We found that under pre-dawn and early morning Sua Pan conditions, crusts were typically non-emissive, but during mid-day temperature and humidity conditions typical of Sua Pan in August and September (dry and peak dust emission season), several crusts became friable and highly emissive above wind velocities of 7 m/s, which agrees with in-situ field observations. Thenardite capillary crusts were the most emissive, in contrast to supply limited, halite liquefied crusts which were relatively stable. Disturbances, or small crust fractures, common on polygonal surface patterns decreased the dust emission threshold values and enabled emission from more stable crusts. Our study confirms the potential of playa surfaces to emit dust without the presence of saltation, and highlights the sensitivity of emission thresholds to crust geochemistry, evaporation rates and temperature and humidity conditions.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory is engaged in a study of the changing Arctic with a particular focus on ice thickness and distribution variability. The purpose is to optimize computer models used to predict sea ice changes. An important part of our study is to calibrate/validate CryoSat-2 ice thickness data prior to its incorporation into new ice forecast models. The large footprint of the CryoSat-2 altimeter over sea-ice is a significant issue in any attempt to ground-truth the data. Along-track footprints are reduced to ~ 300 m by SAR processing of the returns. However, the cross-track footprint is determined by the topography of the surface. Further, the actual return is the sum of the returns from individual reflectors within the footprint making it difficult to interpret the return, and optimize the waveform tracker.\nWe therefore collected a series of grids of airborne scanning lidar and nadir pointing radar on sub-satellite tracks over sea-ice that would extend far enough cross-track to capture the illuminated area. One difficulty in the collection of grids comprised of adjacent overlapping tracks is that the ice moves as much as 300 m over the duration of a single track (~ 10 min). With a typical lidar swath width of 500m we needed to adjust the survey tracks in near real-time for the ice motion. This was accomplished by a photogrammetric method of ice velocity determination (RTIME) reported in another presentation. Post-processing refinements resulted in typical track-to-track miss-ties of ~ 1-2 m, much of which could be attributed to ice deformation over the period of the survey. An important factor is that we were able to reconstruct the ice configuration at the time of the satellite overflight, resulting in an accurate representation of the surface illuminated by CryoSat-2. Our intention is to develop a model of the ice surface using the lidar grid which includes both snow and ice using radar profiles to determine snow thickness.\nIn 2013 a set of 6 usable grids 5-20 km wide (cross-track) by 10-30 km long were collected north of Barrow, AK. In 2014 a further 5 narrower grids (~5km) were collected. Data from these grids are shown here and will be used to examine the relationship of the tracked satellite waveform data to the actual surface.",

            "abstract": "The 24 September 2013 Mw7.7 Balochistan, Pakistan earthquake ruptured a ~200 km-long stretch of the Hoshab fault in southern Pakistan. We remotely measured the coseismic surface deformation field using high-resolution (0.5 m) pre- and post-event satellite imagery. We measured ~300 near-field (0-10 m from fault) laterally offset piercing points (streams, terrace risers, roads, etc.) and find peak left-lateral offsets of ~12-15 m. We characterized the far-field (0-10 km from fault) displacement field using manual (~250 measurements) and automated image cross-correlation methods (e.g., pixel tracking) and find peak displacement values of ~16 m, which commonly exceed the on-fault displacement magnitudes. Our preliminary observations suggest the following: (1) coseismic surface displacement typically increases with distance away from the surface trace of the fault (e.g., highest displacement values in the far field), (2) for certain locations along the fault rupture, as little as 50% of the coseismic displacement field occurred in the near-field; and (3) the magnitudes of individual displacements are inversely correlated to the width of the surface rupture zone (e.g., largest displacements where the fault zone is narrowest). This analysis highlights the importance of identifying field study sites spanning fault sections with narrow deformation zones in order to capture the entire deformation field. For regions of distributed deformation, these results would predict that geologic slip rate studies underestimate a fault’s complete slip rate.",

            "abstract": "Recently acquired swath bathymetry on the Gulf of Valencia continental margin (NW Mediterranean Sea) allowed characterizing a large-scale sediment wave field which develops on the continental slope, from 250 m in depth to the continental rise, found at 850 m in depth. Geometric parameters as wavelength, wave height, asymmetry index, and steepness were obtained from the analysis of the bathymetric models. The internal structure of the sediment waves was determined using parametric (TOPAS), single-channel (Sparker) and multi-channel (Airgun) seismic reflection profiles. Sediment wavelengths range between 500 and 1000 m, and maximum wave heights of up to 50 m were observed on the upper-slope, decreasing downslope to just 2 m high on the continental rise. These depositional sediment waves over the continental slope are preferentially developed on the foreset region of the prograding margin clinoform, and are preserved in the sediment record since the Early/Lower Pliocene. Contemporary hydrodynamic data have determined the presence of strong near-inertial internal waves interacting with the continental slope, playing an important role in the redistribution of near-bottom suspended particles. Such hydrodynamic process can contribute to the sediment transport and deposition and to the formation of the sediment waves over the Gulf of Valencia continental slope. These morphological features were previously interpreted as a result of gravitational slope failures. However, the use of adequate seafloor mapping techniques, together with oceanographic and sedimentary dynamics measurements, allowed changing the previous interpretation and providing new insights on the seafloor morphology over this part of the NW Mediterranean continental margin.",

Efforts to port the scalable spectral element dynamical core to incorporate these developments is presented, including both 2D and 3D benchmark test case results.

In this presentation, we apply data from all of these sources as well as the Mars Express spacecraft in order to characterize a few events in which MARSIS Active Ionospheric Sounding, the topside sounder on board the Mars Express spacecraft, detects intense vibrations of period about 10 s in both locally detected electron density and magnetic field strength and remotely sensed electron density profiles near the ionospheric peak. That these vibrations appear both locally and in the remote sensing indicates the global nature of this phenomenon.

Nested regional climate model simulations were conducted using RegCM4.4 over the CORDEX-North America domain with 50 km grid spacing. Initial and lateral boundary conditions are taken from the HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M AOGCMs (for RCP8.5 emissions scenario) to simulate present and future climate (1951-2098). For each run, RegCM4 uses three different convection schemes: Emanuel scheme, Grell scheme, and Mixed scheme which uses the Emanuel scheme over water and Grell over land.\nCurrent findings show the regional climate simulations are of the same magnitude of average frequency for heavy ( 25.4-76.2 mm/day), and extreme (154.9+ mm/day) precipitation events while very heavy events (76.2+ mm/day) were less frequent by an order of magnitude. For current and recent past climate (1951-2005), frequency of precipitation events is similar in both HadGEM2-ES and GFDL-ESM2M AOGCM-driven regional climate simulations with most variation due to the convection scheme being used. Initial results seem to exhibit similar trends in the increase of frequency for each precipitation event as is seen in observations. In accordance with Groisman et al. (2012), preliminary findings also show months during the cold season had more frequent heavy events in comparison to very heavy and extreme events while months during the warm season had more frequent very heavy and extreme events in comparison to heavy events. Further analysis will better determine the correlation and accuracy of these regional climate simulations.",

            "abstract": "Multibeam bathymetry surveys acquired two months after hurricane Sandy offshore of Fire Island, NY, revealed broad areas of small-scale (<15 m) bedforms on top of large-scale (200–3000 m) sand ridges and sorted bedforms. The small-scale bedforms were absent prior to the hurricane, as evidenced by previous surveys in 2003 and 2011. Here we statistically analyze these bedforms in conjunction with seabed sedimentary properties and storm history to understand the correlation of sedimentary deposition with the storm history. The Fire Island shoreface/inner shelf has been the site of ongoing studies by the USGS. The western half is dominated by 1–3 km-wide sand ridges, with abundant fine-medium sand. The eastern half, on the other hand, is largely starved of modern sand, and the bedform morphology is dominated by 0.2–1.0 km-wide sorted bedforms. We utilize two post-storm surveys, one along the western half of the island and the other to the east, providing an opportunity to compare these different nearshore settings. A Gaussian covariance model is used, with four parameters: rms height, orientation and characteristics length and width. An iterative, least-squares inversion is used to estimate these parameters and their uncertainties from selected sample areas. Bedforms with aspect ratio (length/width) > 1.5 are categorized as two-dimensional, and have rms heights ~3–7 cm and widths 4–6 m. Bedforms with aspect ratio < 1.5 are categorized as three-dimensional, and have smaller rms heights (~1.5–4 cm) and larger widths (~6–13 m). Parameters are correlatable with grain size and large-scale bedform topography. Three-dimensional bedforms tend to form in finer sands and have been interpreted as hummocky bedforms formed by long-period surface gravity waves generated during the storm. The two-dimensional bedforms are interpreted as large ripples that show consistent lineation oblique to the orientation of larger sand ridges. For this study we will compare bedform lineations to storm history in order to infer stage at which these bedforms originated with respect to the passage of the storm. These results should help to improve our understanding of storm processes and their impact on sediment transport and deposition, as well as deduce the magnitude and frequency of ancient storm processes based upon the preserved rock record.",

            "abstract": "Ongoing climate change is affecting the timing and amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exported to the Gulf of Maine (GoM) through effects on hydrologic conditions. Climate warming in the northeast United States has resulted in decreases in snowfall amount and increases in the proportion of annual precipitation that falls as rain compared with snow. Warming has resulted in an increase in runoff during winter and earlier snowmelt and associated high spring flow. Increases in annual precipitation have resulted in increases in annual runoff. Increases in flashiness in some rivers have resulted in higher variability in daily runoff. DOC fluxes were estimated for water years 1950 through 2012 in eight rivers draining to the GoM that had long-term discharge data and data for DOC during all months of the year. These estimates used LOADEST to fit a seasonally-adjusted concentration - discharge relation. The adjusted maximum likelihood estimation (AMLE) method was used to estimate loads. One of several predefined regression models evaluated in LOADEST was selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each river. This analysis assumed stationarity in the concentration - discharge relations. The proportion of total annual DOC exported during winter has increased. The proportion of DOC exported during March and April has also increased and the proportion exported during May has decreased in association with earlier snowmelt runoff and earlier recession to summer low flow. The total annual DOC exported by these rivers increased significantly from 1950 to 2012. The increase in flashiness has increased daily variability in DOC export in some rivers. Changes in the timing and amount of DOC exported to the near coastal ocean may influence marine biogeochemistry including the development of nuisance and harmful algal blooms, carbon sequestration, and the interpretation of satellite-derived ocean color. Terrestrially derived DOC exported to the marine environment could decrease phytoplankton productivity through light attenuation.",

            "abstract": "A wide range of climates exists on planet Earth, and the different kinds of life inhabiting each area vary greatly in accordance with its topography and weather conditions. The nature of each climate is in part determined by its latitude—latitudes closer to 90º suggest a colder climate while latitudes closer to 0º suggest a warmer, more tropical climate. The evolution of organisms is expected to differ in different parts of the world because environment plays such a significant role in it. In our study, we focus on the relationship between location and the extent to which the evolution of ostracod body size follows Cope’s Rule (i.e., the tendency for body size to increase over time) and Bergmann’s Rule (i.e., body size decreases with temperature) from the Ordovician to the Holocene. Using body sizes of ostracod occurrences, we explored the relationships among size, latitude and time. Modern ecosystems near the poles are more sensitive to environmental and climate change than those near the equator, we hypothesized that ostracods with latitudes closer to the poles will follow Cope’s Rule more closely. To test this hypothesis, we compared body size and latitude as well as trends of body size evolution over time in tropical, temperate and polar regions. The graphs produced showed that over different latitudes, there was a decreasing trend in the mean size of ostracods over time. This means that the evolution of ostracod body size does not follow Cope’s Rule any more in polar and temperate regions than it does in tropical regions. In fact, our data suggests that ostracods do not necessarily follow Cope’s Rule or Bergmann’s Rule at all, which concurs with a notion that has been previously brought up—the possibility that ectothermic marine organisms are exceptions to Bergmann’s Rule.",

Our simulations are within the observational error bars for the mass of organics, sulfate and black carbon from the boundary layer to upper-troposphere. CARMA, as a sectional model, provides detailed aerosol size distributions from nano-meters to tens of microns, which is important to determine optical properties. We investigate how the aerosol size distribution varies with altitude. Modeled spatial gradients of [O]:[C] and [OC]:[SO4-2] ratios are compared with the AMS and PALMS data collected over forests, fires and cities. These ratios are important to constrain the budget of secondary organic aerosols. We will discuss the values of these ratios over the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

            "abstract": "The fast magnetosonic mode is one of the dominant wave modes in the Earth's radiation belts. These waves influence the ring current by scattering ions in energy in the 10's of keV range, and are believed to be a heat source for radiation belt electrons. The fast magnetosonic mode observed around the Earth's inner equatorial magnetosphere sometimes exhibits quasi-periodic modulation as detected by the Van Allen probes. During each modulation the wave frequency exhibits a strong drifting (dispersive) signature characterized by a rising tone. Each tone is composed of harmonics with spacing close to the proton cyclotron frequency. The tones are band limited in frequency and mainly observed above the 20th harmonic of the local proton cyclotron frequency. We observe this modulation mainly outside the plasmapause, but it has also been observed to penetrate down to 1.5 RE. The modulation is observed up to magnetic latitudes of ±17º, at all magnetic local times, but its signatures are more pronounced on the dayside. For events where lower frequency ULF waves are detected, the period of the ULF wave is about twice the modulation period of the fast magnetosonic mode, suggesting strong wave-wave interactions. The modulation period varies from 50 to 200 s and its duration ranges from 0.2 to 3 h, with the maximum duration limited by the spacecraft orbit. We hypothesize that the rising tone is produced by changing Alfven velocities created by steepened density fluctuations due to plasma modification by an underlying ULF wave.",

            "abstract": "Drought prediction from monthly to seasonal time scales is of critical importance to disaster mitigation, agricultural planning, and multi-purpose reservoir management. Starting in December 2012, NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) has been providing operational Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) Outlooks using the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) forecasts, to support CPC's monthly drought outlooks and briefing activities. The current NMME system consists of six model forecasts from U.S. and Canada modeling centers, including the CFSv2, CM2.1, GEOS-5, CCSM3.0, CanCM3, and CanCM4 models. In this study, we conduct an assessment of the predictive skill of meteorological drought using real-time NMME forecasts for the period from May 2012 to May 2014. The ensemble SPI forecasts are the equally weighted mean of the six model forecasts. Two performance measures, the anomaly correlation coefficient and root-mean-square errors against the observations, are used to evaluate forecast skill.\nSimilar to the assessment based on NMME retrospective forecasts, predictive skill of monthly-mean precipitation (P) forecasts is generally low after the second month and errors vary among models. Although P forecast skill is not large, SPI predictive skill is high and the differences among models are small. The skill mainly comes from the P observations appended to the model forecasts. This factor also contributes to the similarity of SPI prediction among the six models. Still, NMME SPI ensemble forecasts have higher skill than those based on individual models or persistence, and the 6-month SPI forecasts are skillful out to four months. The three major drought events occurred during the 2012-2014 period, the 2012 Central Great Plains drought, the 2013 Upper Midwest flash drought, and 2013-2014 California drought, are used as examples to illustrate the system's strength and limitations. For precipitation-driven drought events, such as the 2012 Central Great Plains drought, NMME SPI forecasts perform well in predicting drought severity and spatial patterns. For fast-developing drought events, such as the 2013 Upper Midwest flash drought, the system failed to capture the onset of the drought.",

            "abstract": "Tracking monomethylmercury (MeHg) from its source in soils and sediments through various environmental compartments and transformations is critical to understanding its accumulation in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Advances in the field of mercury (Hg) stable isotopes have allowed for the tracking of discrete Hg sources and the examination of photochemical and bacterial transformations. Despite analytical advances, measuring the Hg stable isotopic signature of MeHg in environmental samples or laboratory experiments remains challenging due to difficulties in the quantitative separation of MeHg from complex matrices with high concentrations of inorganic Hg. To address these challenges, we have developed a MeHg isolation method for sediments and bacterial cultures which involves separation by gas chromatography. The MeHg eluting from the GC is passed through a pyrolysis column and purged onto a gold amalgam trap which is then desorbed into a final oxidizing solution. A MeHg reference standard carried through our separation process retained its isotopic composition within 0.02 ‰ for δ202Hg, and for native estuarine sediments, MeHg recoveries were 80% to 100%. For sediment samples from the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers (New Jersey, USA), δ202Hg values for MeHg varied from -1.2 to +0.58 ‰ (relative to SRM 3133) and for individual samples were significantly different from that of total Hg (-0.38 ± 0.06 ‰). No mass independent fractionation was observed in MeHg or total Hg from these sediments. Pure cultures of Geobacter sulfurreducens, grown under fermentative conditions showed preferential enrichment of lighter isotopes (lower δ202Hg) during Hg methylation. The Hg stable isotope signatures of MeHg in sediments and laboratory methylation experiments will be discussed in the context of the formation and degradation of MeHg in the environment and the bioaccumulation of MeHg in estuarine food webs.",

            "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Sequestration is a viable technology to reduce the concentration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. The success of an injection project requires large amounts of dry supercritical CO2 to be injected into brine saturated aquifers within the subsurface. However, solid salt precipitation causes a reduction of permeability, having adverse effects on well injectivity as well as pressure build-up. This study evaluated the accumulation of precipitated salt, brine flux patterns, and pressure build-up for two well constructions, 1) partially completed with 4 injection intervals and 2) fully completed throughout the thickness of the target formation. This study found that when a partially completed well is implemented, precipitation of solid salt experiences a greater radial extent then a fully completed well. Both well designs showed non-localized salt precipitation in low permeability formations (5 and 50 mD) and localized salt precipitation at high permeability (250 and 500 mD). It was also found that two different brine flux patterns occurred; under low-k conditions the brine flux was primarily outward and parallel to the direction of the CO2 migration and salt precipitation became limited. While under high-k conditions there developed back-flow of the brine to the tail of the plume as the plume experienced greater vertical movement, and the counter-flowing brine sustained the precipitation process amplifying salt precipitation. When this process occurred the permeability reduction factor became orders of magnitude less then when non-localized salt precipitation occurred, and formed an impermeable barrier around the injection well. The formation of this barrier was found to have the effect of increasing the pressure build-up near the well in regions of the reservoir in which it occurred. A sensitivity analysis on the anisotropic/isotropic nature of the reservoir and the value of the critical porosity was also conducted. The analysis revealed that an isotropic assumption of reservoir permeability may overestimate the degree of salt precipitation. Also that critical porosity has a high influence on the degree of salt precipitation in high-k reservoirs, the permeability reduction in both high and low-k reservoirs, and the pressure build-up in the near well region.",

            "abstract": "We are evaluating the use of stormwater runoff as a source for managed aquifer recharge (MAR), using data from an operational field site to address two questions: (1) How much stormwater can be captured and infiltrated with this system? (2) What is the impact of sediment delivered to the infiltration basin with the stormwater, and what maintenance would be required to sustain favorable infiltration conditions? Our field site is a working ranch in the Pajaro Valley, central coastal California, where runoff from ~48 ha (120 ac) is directed into a 1-ha (2.5 ac) infiltration basin. We instrumented the site for water years (WY) 2012, 2013, and 2014 to measure local precipitation, total inflow, and sediment accumulation. In WY14, we added a network of instruments that reports some of these data in real time.\nWY12, WY13, and WY14 were dry, with total precipitation 50%, 70%, and 45% of the regional long-term average, respectively. In WY12, precipitation was spread over many storms, and total inflow was 5,600 m3 (4.5 ac-ft). A series of more intense storms in WY13 delivered 39,000 m3 (31 ac-ft) of total inflow. The driest year of our study so far, WY14, included the most intense rainfall we have recorded, and total inflow was 42,000 m3 (34 ac-ft). These results demonstrate that both precipitation amount and intensity influence how much stormwater runoff is generated. During a wetter year, we expect this system could collect at least 134,000 m2 (100 ac-ft) of runoff. Sediment accumulation in the infiltration basin in WY13 ranged from 0–8 cm, but in WY14 was no greater than 1 cm. As total inflow for these years was similar, sediment load of runoff captured during WY14 was much smaller than that of WY13. Grain size analyses demonstrate that fine material is preferentially delivered to the infiltration basin, while coarser material is removed during transport. These data will be linked to a regional model and used to develop additional stormwater-MAR projects in this area.",

            "abstract": "Simulation and fluid flow prediction of many petroleum enhanced oil recovery methods as well as environmental processes such as carbon dioxide (CO2) geological storage requires accurate modeling and determination of relative permeability under different saturation histories. Based on this critical need, there has been several different three-phase relative permeability models developed to predict the hysteresis effects in relative permeability, most of which requiring many different parameters which introduce extreme complexity to the models for practical purposes. In this work, we experimentally measured three-phase, water/oil/gas, relative permeability in a 1-m long water-wet sand pack, under several different flow histories. We measured the in-situ saturations along the sand pack using a CT scanner. We then determined the relative permeabilities directly from the measured in-situ saturations, using unsteady-state method. Based on our results, good estimation of residual saturations yields in excellent three-phase relative permeability estimations by just using the simple, standard relative permeability models such as, Saturation Weighted Interpolation (SWI), Corey’s and Stones. Our results show that, the key parameter to model the hysteresis in three-phase relative permeability (effect of saturation history) is the residual saturations. Once the residual saturations were correctly determined for each specific saturation path, the standard relative permeability models can predict the three-phase relative permeabilities perfectly.",

            "abstract": "Definitive measurements of enhanced hydrogen concentrations linked to permanently shaded regions (PSRs) near Mercury’s north pole were made with MESSENGER’s Neutron Spectrometer (NS). These hydrogen concentrations were reported only as variations with latitude, in part because the NS data set from MESSENGER’s first orbital year had a spatial resolution of around 650 km for regions poleward of 75ºN. As a consequence, the data for these initial measurements did not allow for investigations of variations of hydrogen with longitude or enable the specification of hydrogen concentrations for individual polar deposits. Now, with new NS data that have been acquired or will be acquired during MESSENGER’s low-altitude campaign, such questions on spatial variability can be addressed. First, the average altitude in polar regions (latitude > 75ºN) will be ~200 km compared with the 430 km average altitude during the first year of data collection. This lower altitude will improve the spatial resolution by a factor of 2 and provide for a quantification of the longitudinal variation of the north polar hydrogen enhancement. Second, during early September 2014, the MESSENGER spacecraft will pass over an isolated group of three PSRs (in the craters Desprez, Bechet, and Qui Ying) at altitudes of less than 100 km. If these PSRs have sufficient water ice, as is expected on the basis of radar backscatter data, then the increase in epithermal neutron signal strength and spatial resolution may allow this group of PSRs to be spatially resolved.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric soundings, cloud radar, and air-sea flux measurements collected during DYNAMO (Dynamics of the MJO) are employed to study the initiation of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) over the tropical Indian Ocean. Findings indicate that moistening of the troposphere during MJO initiation occurs in two stages: low-to-midlevel moistening in the suppressed phase (i.e., prior to the onset of deep convection), followed by deep-column moistening during the early active phase. The first stage of moistening occurs as the drying by large-scale subsidence and horizontal advection wane and convective clouds increase in areal coverage and deepen from shallow to congestus. Analysis of the suppressed phase reveals the striking degree to which the moistening characteristic of this period is accomplished by the diurnal cycle of cumulus clouds. This diurnal cycle is driven by the cycle in sea surface temperature and air-sea fluxes linked to shallow oceanic diurnal warm layers. This coupled diurnal cycle, and the associated afternoon peak in convective cloud depth, cloud areal coverage, and cumulus moistening, likely drives more vigorous overall moistening than would occur without this diurnal cycle. A conspicuous finding pertaining to the suppressed phase convection is the prominence of mesoscale cloud organization (i.e., open cells and horizontal convective rolls), which is hypothesized to enhance convective instability in localized patches, thereby promoting deeper, more vigorous cumulus moistening than would otherwise occur.",

            "abstract": "In spite of the important improvement provided by the recent space missions GRACE and GOCE to the accuracy of Earth’s gravity field models, many geodetic and geophysical issues require higher resolution models. To address spatial resolution in the range between 80 km and 10 km, the airborne gravity gradiometry is a convenient way to complete these global models at the short wavelengths in particular in land/sea transition areas where the gravity field is poorly covered by current measurements. Taking advantage of technologies, developed by ONERA for the accelerometers used in these space gravity missions, the new GREMLIT airborne gravity gradiometer is more particularly developed to determine the horizontal components of the gravity gradient tensor in the instrumental frame. GREMLIT is composed of a double deck of a compact planar assembly of 4 electrostatic accelerometers. The eight plane proof-masses are arranged in a cubic configuration and the whole instrument is mounted on a dedicated stabilized platform which is controlled by the common mode outputs of the instrument itself to achieve a sufficient rejection ratio of the perturbations induced by the airborne environment in the horizontal directions. In addition to be well suited to sustain the proof-mass levitation in the Earth’s gravity field, the planar configuration presents an intrinsic linearity of the control loops which minimizes the aliasing effects. Concerning the present development, in addition to the one axis prototype manufactured in order to verify the hardware performance of the concept, detailed numerical simulations were conducted over some realistic coastal test areas. Taking into account the data sheet performance of the associated commercial angular and data rate sensors and assuming actual airplane acceleration measurements, they lead to exhibit accuracy below 1E along the Txx and Tyy horizontal components. The characteristic of the controlled platform being one of the key point of the development, a specific study was conducted to conceive, specify and verify its performance through a complete simulation. Finally, the interest of a combined integration of this horizontal high resolution electrostatic instrument with a very stable and absolute vertical cold atoms interferometer will also be mentioned.",

            "abstract": "Northern high-latitude peatlands accumulated an estimated 436 Gt of carbon over the Holocene. Vegetation changes, such as the succession from fen to bog species, are often clearly visible in peat profiles and can be caused by organic matter accumulation or by changes in regional climate. Most peatlands developed during the early Holocene as fens under a climate that was warmer than today due to a summer insolation maximum. Subsequent transition to bogs facilitated permafrost aggradation during the mid- to late-Holocene. Teasing out permafrost aggradation in peat cores remains a challenge, as they often resemble dry bogs. However, in many locations permafrost aggradation can be assumed especially if thermokarst is evident later in the peat record (i.e., an abrupt transition from dry bog or plateau peat to wet Sphagnum riparium or even fen peat). We used a database of existing peat core records from around the northern high latitudes to determine transition of fen to bog from plant macrofossils and determined permafrost aggradation from both plant macrofossils and physical peat properties to improve constraints on methane emissions from northern peatlands throughout the Holocene.\nHere, we examine the spatial and temporal trends of the fen to bog transition and permafrost aggradation in the northern high latitude regions by compiling a database of existing records of macrofossil assemblages and peat properties (carbon, nitrogen, and bulk density). We find that the timing of the fen-to-bog transition varied throughout the northern high latitudes, from 5200 yr BP in Alaska and Western Canada to < 1000 yr BP in Eastern Canada and Siberia. Similarly, the first occurrences of permafrost aggradation varied across the high latitudes, ranging from 4000 yr BP in Western Canada to the Little Ice Age in southern regions and parts of Western Siberia. The spatial and temporal differences in the fen to bog transition and permafrost aggradation suggest that methane emissions differed considerably across northern high latitudes throughout the Holocene. Identifying controls of the fen-to-bog transition and permafrost aggradation in the northern high latitudes has important implications for both carbon sequestration and methane emissions from northern peatlands to the atmosphere throughout the Holocene.",

            "abstract": "A region centered on the Yellowstone hotspot and encompassing the Colorado Plateau sits at an elevation 2 km higher than the cratonic North America. This difference broadly coincides with tomographically observed variations in lithospheric thickness: ~120 km beneath western North America, ~240 km beneath the craton. Thermochronology of the Grand Canyon area, sedimentary flux to the Gulf of Mexico, and river profile inversion all suggest that regional uplift occurred in at least two separate stages. High resolution seismic tomographic models, using USArray data, have identified a ring of low velocity material beneath the edges of the Colorado Plateau. Magmatism coincides with these low velocity zones and shows distinct phases: an overall increase in volume around 40 Ma and a change from lithospheric to asthenospheric signatures around 5 Ma. Volcanism is also observed to migrate north-east with time. Here, we attempt to integrate these different observations with lithospheric thickness. A dynamic topography model of progressive lithospheric erosion over a hot mantle plume might account for uplift as well as the temporal and spatial distribution of magmatism across western North America. Thinning of the lithosphere around the edges of the Colorado Plateau in combination with the hotter mantle potential temperature of a plume could create isostatic and dynamic uplift as well as allowing for melt production. To test this model, we have analysed around 100 samples from volcanic centers across western North America by ICP-MS for rare earth elements (REE). Most of the samples are younger than 5 Ma, and all of them have previously been analysed by XRF. Using trace element ratios such as La/Yb and Nb/Y we assess depth of melting and melt fraction, respectively. In addition, we use REE inversion modelling to estimate melt fractions as a function of depth and temperature of melting. The results are compared to existing constraints on lithospheric thickness and mantle potential temperature.",

These will produce 8 TB of data per day, i.e. considerably more than can be downloaded via normal Internet connections.\nThere is no definitive answer to the many challenges of big data but there are gradual solutions for Copernicus in view of the progressive roll out of the space infrastructure and the thematic services which the European Commission will develop.\nThis presentation will present several approaches to the big data issue. It will start from the needs of the Copernicus users, which are far from being homogeneous. As their needs are different, the European Commission and ESA will have to propose different solutions to fulfil these needs, taking into account the present and future state of technology. The presentation will discuss these solutions, both with regard to a better use of the network and with regard to hosted processing.",

            "abstract": "Drought, which is usually defined as an extended period of water supply deficit, is one of the costliest natural hazards. Agricultural, fisheries, hydropower generation and water resource management are all directly affected by droughts. Droughts are usually classified as meteorological, agricultural, or hydrological. The first type is defined based on precipitation and the latter two are connected with hydrological variables (soil moisture and runoff). Because observations of soil moisture and (spatially distributed) runoff are sparse, agricultural and hydrological drought is more difficult to quantify, and hydrological models are often used in their analysis. Nonetheless, the temporal and spatial characteristics of these types of drought are not well understood. Based on hydrological model simulation results for a period of nearly a century, we evaluate the historical characteristics of drought over the Pacific Northwest (PNW) region, defined as the Columbia River basin and coastal drainages. Major droughts in the 1930s, 1977 and early 2000s caused substantial economic losses to the region. We used the VIC macroscale hydrology model to simulate 94 years (1920-2013) of runoff and soil moisture over the region. In order to minimize the effects of model error, we interpret results as percentiles that are calculated according to simulation outputs distribution. We explore in particular the characteristics of drought in the PNW. The main results are: 1, the dry time period are more likely to be included in a drought event while the onset are usually earlier; 2, little snow-melting can lead to hydrological drought (below-normal streamflow) in that year; 3, the spatial pattern of agricultural drought frequency is highly related with precipitation and soil moisture persistence.",

            "abstract": "With warm SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic and cold SST anomalies in the East Pacific, the reduced Atlantic tropical cyclone activity from August to early September in 2013 was a surprise to the hurricane community. Our analyses suggest that the suppressed storm activity can be attributed to the frequent occurrence of dry air in the middle to upper troposphere along with strong vertical wind shear. Such unfavorable conditions are directly related to the equatorward propagation and breaking of midlatitude Rossby waves, which lead to the equatorward intrusions of cold and dry extratropical air.\nFurther examination suggests the active anti-cyclonic Rossby wave breaking and frequent equatorward intrusions of extratropical air in August 2013 were associated with changes of the midlatitude jet stream (i.e., acceleration, eastward extension and greater strain rate). The EOF analysis of 200-hPa zonal wind identifies a recurrent mode of interannual variability over Atlantic, which is associated with the variations of the intensity and zonal extent of the mid-latitude jet. This mode is found significantly correlated to Atlantic hurricane frequency in August, with a coefficient higher than the Nino3.4 index and comparable to the (relative) SST of Major Development Region (MDR). Our analyses thus emphasize the extratropical impacts on Atlantic tropical cyclones via the Rossby wave breaking. This physical link is missing in most statistical and hybrid forecast schemes and may help explain the seasonal prediction bust in 2013.",

            "abstract": "The 4 June 2011 eruption of Cordón Caulle, Chile was the largest event recorded that year, and marked just the second time a rhyolite eruption has been scientifically monitored. Ground-based and remote sensing observations (Terra SAR-X, Landsat 7) of this event indicate that a shallow magmatic intrusion occurred beneath the active vent in the second week of the eruption (~18-24 June) and lead to significant, localised uplift (10 to >200 m) and complex surface deformation across an area of about 2 km2. Shallow intrusion coincided with the first days of lava effusion, with effusion rates estimated at 20-80 m3s-1 and simultaneous pyroclastic venting producing 5-6 km-high ash plumes. Despite this contemporaneous, high magmatic flux out of the vent, the intrusion continued to grow, implying greater rates of magma input than eruption. High-resolution digital elevation data extracted from Pléiades satellite imagery in March 2014 along with detailed surface mapping of ground deformation patterns help determine the depth, form, and mechanism of intrusion. These data collectively indicate a laccolith-shaped body emplaced at a minimum depth of 300 m and with an asymmetrical form controlled by broad monoclines on the southern end and thrust and high-angle growth faults to the northern side. Structures such as these have long been recognized in dissected laccoliths in the southwestern U.S. and are interpreted here to indicate shallow magma emplacement involving: 1) firstly, the formation of a sill-shaped body, 2) lateral spreading of the sill to a critical width, and 3) upward bending of overburden and eventual failure along growth faults at the margins of the laccolith. A 2D mechanical model will be presented that determines the stress required to grow the laccolith, which in turn will provide an estimate of the magma overpressure in the shallow subsurface.",

            "abstract": "Soil respiration (Rs) is a combination of autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh). Several methods have been developed to tease out the components of Rs, such as isotopic analyses, and removing Ra input through tree girdling and root exclusion experiments. Trenching involves severing the rooting system surrounding a plot to remove the Ra component within the plot. This method has some potential limitations. Reduced water uptake in trenched plots could change soil water content, which is one of the environmental controllers of Rs in many ecosystems. Eliminating root inputs could reduce heterotrophic decomposition of SOM via lack of priming. On the other hand, the severed dead roots may temporarily increase available carbon substrate for Rh.\nAt the Harvard Forest, MA, we used the trenching method to partition Rs into its components Ra and Rh. Pre-trenched Rs was measured from spring to fall of 2012. In late fall of 2012, a trench was excavated to 1m depth around a 5x5m area, severing all roots. Plastic tarp was placed along the trench walls and then backfilled. Four automated Rs chambers were placed in the trenched plot and four in an un-trenched plot. Respiration was measured hourly for each chamber along with soil temperature and moisture from spring through fall of 2013 and 2014. Eighty root decomposition bags were placed in the organic soil horizon of the trenched (40) and un-trenched (40) plots at the time of trenching in 2012 and measured in 2013 and 2014. These data are being used to estimate the size and duration of any artifact due to root death. As expected, Rs was lower in the trenched plot (Rh only) than in the un-trenched plot (Rh + Ra) in 2013, but the reverse was unexpectedly observed during a period of low precipitation in 2014. High rates of ET combined with below-average precipitation dried the un-trenched plot to a point where Rh was inhibited, whereas less ET allowed the un-trenched plots to remain measurably wetter.",

            "abstract": "Our ability to close the Earth’s carbon budget and predict feedbacks in a warming climate depends critically on knowing where, when and how carbon dioxide is exchanged. Vegetation biomass is an important carbon sink that varies significantly over annual and inter-annual timescales. At global scales, the only feasible approach for monitoring vegetation biomass is satellite remote sensing. In this regard, existing passive microwave missions have the potential of estimating Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), an indicator of total aboveground vegetation water content, closely related to vegetation biomass.\nPresent approaches provide VOD as a soil moisture inversion residual at every time step and are therefore highly contaminated by residuals from model error. This work presents a novel technique for retrieving VOD using time-series of dual-polarized microwave observations. Taking advantage of the slow-time dynamics of VOD, a number of consecutive observations are used to estimate a single VOD. The soil dielectric constant of each observation is also retrieved simultaneously and later used as a consistency check. The method has been applied to two years of L-band passive observations from the NASA’s Aquarius sensor. Results show global VOD distribution follows general gradients of climate and canopy biomass conditions, with characteristic seasonal variability among the major land cover classes.\nSatellite retrievals of microwave VOD provide independent but complementary information to other remote sensing vegetation metrics such as fluorescence and optical-infrared indices. The method presented here could be used in satellite missions such as SMOS and SMAP to decouple soil effects from vegetation, for the benefit of soil moisture retrievals. Also, it could be used to generate a new observational record of vegetation water content for a more comprehensive view of land surface phenology and terrestrial ecology.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a method of evaluating the mesospheric geopotential height (GPH) profiles provided by Aura MLS using Suomi OMPS Limb Profiler (LP) measurements at 350 nm. Our results indicate that the error in MLS GPH profiles increases with altitude. We compare our results with the errors calculated by the MLS team based on internal error analysis. Their error estimates have never been independently verified. This evaluation has, in turn, helped us to develop a more accurate altitude registration method of the OMPS LP measurements, with an estimated accuracy of +/- 100 m. Prior to launch of the Suomi NPP spacecraft in October 2011, there were concerns that flexing of its structure could cause large pitch angle errors at the OMPS instrument location, leading to altitude registration errors. While Suomi NPP contains an accurate star tracker, it is located near the VIIRS instrument on the opposite end of the spacecraft. Our results indicate that the variation in Suomi NPP pitch angle along the orbit at the location of the OMPS LP instrument is less than 20 arc-second (corresponding to 300 m in altitude registration at the limb). We also find that the variation of the pitch error along the orbit is highly repeatable from day to day, and has not varied significantly over the past 3 years since launch. Finally, our results confirm and improve upon previous estimates of ~2 arc-minute pitch error (2 km at the limb) in mounting the OMPS LP instrument on the NPP spacecraft.",

Weathering from Himalayan landscape supply high amount of major ions, nutrients and suspended sediments to the oceans. Surface water samples were collected from sixteen stations at different altitude along the Langtnag-Narayani Himalayan river system in central Nepal on a monthly basis for one year. This study aims to investigate spatiotemporal variations of dissolved organic matter, nutrients and carbonic species and to evaluate their controlling factors within the basin. The fluxes of these species appeared several fold higher at low elevation than at mid mountains and high elevation Himalaya sites. Seasonality appeared to exert major control on concentrations and fluxes of major solutes along the drainage network. The highest export rate of chemical species corresponded to the monsoon season, followed by the ones corresponding to post-monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. Carbonate has major control on the flux of major solutes within the basin. The export rate of dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen were about three and seventeen times higher respectively at the Narayani basin than its headwater at Langtang basin within the high Himalaya. Nitrate and phosphate export rates in the Narayani basin were 5.07 and 0.34 tons km-2 yr-1 respectively which is several fold higher than the rates in the high Himalaya probably due to input from agricultural activities. The export of dissolved inorganic carbon from the Narayani basin was 101.87 tons km-2 yr-1 of which bicarbonate appeared to be the dominant fraction (94.9%) followed by carbonic acid (4.7%) and carbonate (0.4%). Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) resulted under-saturated in the high elevation Himalayan basin and supersaturated at the low elevation Narayani basin. The concentration of pCO2 is considered to be an important factor for regulating weathering rates of any landscape.",

In this contribution, we present noble gas data of shale gas samples from the Antrim shale formation in the Michigan Basin. The Antrim shale was one of the first economic shale-gas plays in the U.S. and has been actively developed since the 1980’s. This study pioneers the use of noble gases in subsurface shale gas in the Michigan Basin to clarify the nature of vertical transport processes within the sedimentary sequence and to assess potential variability of noble gas signatures in shales.\nAntrim Shale gas samples were analyzed for all stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) from samples collected at depths between 300 and 500m. Preliminary results show R/Ra values (where R and Ra are the measured and atmospheric 3He/4He ratios, respectively) varying from 0.022 to 0.21. Although most samples fall within typical crustal R/Ra range values (~0.02-0.05), a few samples point to the presence of a mantle He component with higher R/Ra ratios. Samples with higher R/Ra values also display higher 20Ne/22Ne ratios, up to 10.4, and further point to the presence of mantle 20Ne. The presence of crustally produced nucleogenic 21Ne and radiogenic 40Ar is also apparent with 21Ne/22Ne ratios up to 0.033 and 40Ar/36Ar ratios up to 312.\nThe presence of crustally produced 4He, 21Ne and 40Ar is not spatially homogeneous within the Antrim shale. Areas of higher crustal 4He production appear distinct to those of crustally produced 21Ne and 40Ar and are possibly related the presence of different production levels within the shale with varying concentrations of parent elements.",

            "abstract": "This study quantifies diapycnal mixing and vertical heat transfer in the Pacific side of the Arctic Ocean, where sea-ice cover has disappeared between July and September in the last few decades. We conducted microstructure measurements in the open water region around the Canada Basin from late summer to fall in 2009 and 2010 using RV Mirai. In the study domain, the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, ε, is typically as low level as O(10-10) W kg-1, resulting in vertical heat diffusivity of O(10-7) m2 s-1, which is close to the molecular diffusivity of heat, suggesting comparatively little predominance of mechanical turbulent mixing. An exception is the case at the Barrow Canyon, where the strong baroclinic throughflow generates substantial vertical mixing, producing ε >O(10-7) W kg-1, because of the shear flow instability. Meanwhile, in the confluence region, where the warm/salty Pacific water and the cold/fresh Arctic basin water encounter, the micro-temperature profiles revealed a localized enhancement in vertical diffusivity of heat, reaching O(10-5) m2 s-1 or greater. In this region, an intrusion of warm Pacific water creates a horizontally interleaved structure, where the double-diffusive mixing facilitates vertical heat transfer between the intruding Pacific water and the surrounding basin waters.",

            "abstract": "Diffusion of gases through snow and firn is important for air-snow transfer in temperate regions and decoding ice core climate records from the polar regions. The diffusion process depends on a number of factors, including temperature and chemical concentration gradients, layering and pore structure of the snow and firn, and fractionation of gases. Assessing the potential impact of layering on of gases through the firn column over time is crucial for understanding the natural archive of past atmospheric composition. Existing 1-D firn air models include gravitational settling and thermal diffusion in order to explain seasonal anomalies found in firn-air measurements but have not considered the possibility of inhomogeneous firn structure and layering effects in time-varying simulations. This work presents development, testing, and use of a multidimensional numerical diffusion model for investigating impacts of spatial heterogeneity of firn layering over time, in addition to thermal and gravitational effects on gas diffusion in firn. The model is verified using existing data. Results of numerical experiments are presented that show impacts of varying the spatial structure of firn on the magnitude of the impact on gas profiles in firn. Comparison of numerical results with published firn air field studies will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In Western Turkey, obducted ophiolite, metamorphic sole and oceanic accretionnary complex units linked with the closure of the Neotethys are found along a 400 kilometre-long section (from north to south). We herein reappraise the metamorphic evolution of the sub-ophiolitic metamorphic units (both the metamorphic sole and the accretionnary units) of Western Turkey (i) to better characterize rock units exhumed along a cooling subduction interface, from birth to steady state (ii) to constrain the formation of metamorphic sole during the initiation of subduction (iii) and to track record of obducted ophiolite. On the basis of field and petrological observation three differents accretionnary units are reccognized with pressure-temperature estimates ranging from incipient metamorphism to blueschist-facies conditions providing information on plate coupling at different depths along the subduction interface. The upper part of the metamorphic sole was form in an amphibolite facies (garnet amphibolite - garnet clinopyroxene amphibolite). Different slices of metamorphic sole with different pressure-temperature conditions might be observed probably showing discrete timing of accretion to the upper plate. Part of the samples are characterized by a late blueschsit developpement. Both the blueschist overprint in the metamorphic sole and the high-pressure in oceanic unit were found only in the northern part of the field investigation. On the basis of the presented data, available radiometric and palaeogeographic data as well as recent themomechanical moddeling a tentative reconstruction of the subduction-zone evolution through time and the emplacement of a large-scale ophiolite is presented. Finally a comparison with ongoing work on the metamorphic sole of the Semail ophiolite of Oman is proposed with special highlights on the retrograde evolution in both settings.\n ",

            "abstract": "Pyrogeographic theory suggested that global fire activity (fire frequency or area burned) changes along productivity/aridity gradients following a unimodal relationship, i.e. the intermediate fire–productivity hypothesis. However, less is known about whether this hypothesis applies to other components of fire regime, such as fire size distribution and severity. In this analysis, we summarized four key components of the fire regime, including fire frequency, area burned, median fire size, and percent area burned by high severity fires, between 1984 and 2010 within each Bailey’s section using data from monitoring trends in burned severity projects in the western United States (US). We then examined how these fire regime components varied along with gradients of net primary productivity (NPP) and climatic water deficit (WD) using generalized additive models. Results showed all these fire regime components had unimodal relationships with NPP at the Bailey’s section level. Statistical models with both NPP and WD explained significantly more variation of fire regime than NPP only model; suggesting fire regime was co-controlled by independent effects of productivity and fuel moisture in the western US. Results implied that fire frequency, area burned, and fire size in the western US could respond dramatically to productivity and WD change, but fire severity may be more resilient. Responses were different for forest and non-forest. For example, fire activity for non-forest was more sensitive to change in productivity, while fire activity for forest was more sensitive to change in WD. Fire size was the most sensitive fire regime component in non-forest areas, while fire severity was the most sensitive fire regime component in forest areas. This analysis extended the scope of global fire-productivity relationship, and provided insight on understanding how climate change may affect multiple components of the fire regime.",

            "abstract": "Subduction beneath the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica generates the largest underthrusting earthquakes in the country with a recurrence interval of about 50 years. The most recent of these events occurred on September 5th 2012 (Mw 7.6). A vigorous aftershock sequence of more than 6400 earthquakes was recorded by a local seismic network within the first 4 months of the mainshock. We identify those aftershocks occurring on the mainshock fault plane and compare their locations to the 2012 mainshock slip distribution, the location of past interplate seismicity, and slow slip phenomena to better understand the mechanical behavior of this plate interface. Our focal mechanism determination includes all aftershocks occurring within the first nine days after the mainshock and aftershocks with magnitude greater than four occurring through the end of December 2012. We use the HASH (Hardebeck and Shearer, 2002) software package, based on first motion polarities, to obtain aftershock focal mechanisms. We are able to determine reliable focal mechanisms for 583 of the aftershocks and identify 264 of them as occurring on the plate interface. All of these are relocated using HypoDD (Waldhauser and Ellsworth, 2000) and their locations are compared with other plate boundary activity. We find no significant seismicity patterns as a function of time or magnitude, but confirm that deeper underthrusting events occur in the north compared to the south as revealed by previous studies (Newman et al., 2002). Most of the aftershocks occur in and around the updip part of the coseismic rupture zone. This suggests that the Nicoya mainshock released all of the accumulated strain in the deeper part of the plate interface, leaving none to occur as aftershocks. A comparison with previous interface seismicity in this region reveals a similar distribution to the aftershocks. This demonstrates that the deepest part of the plate boundary was strongly locked prior to this event and slipped only during the mainshock. This segregation of the plate interface into a strong deep region, that slips only during the mainshock and a weaker shallower part, that slips before and after the event suggests that the next large earthquake will again focus its slip in the deeper region.",

            "abstract": "Satellite radar altimetry is widely used for measuring global sea level variations and, increasingly, water height variations of inland water bodies. Existing satellite radar altimeters measure water surfaces directly below the spacecraft (approximately at nadir). Over the ocean, most of these satellites use radiometry to measure the delay of radar signals caused by water vapor in the atmosphere (also known as the wet troposphere delay (WTD)). However, radiometry can only be used to estimate this delay over the largest inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, due to spatial resolution issues. As a result, atmospheric models are typically used to simulate and correct for the WTD at the time of observations. The resolutions of these models are quite coarse, at best about 5000 km2 at 30˚N. The upcoming NASA- and CNES-led Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, on the other hand, will use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques to measure a 120-km-wide swath of the Earth’s surface. SWOT is expected to make useful measurements of water surface elevation and extent (and storage change) for inland water bodies at spatial scales as small as 250 m, which is much smaller than current altimetry targets and several orders of magnitude smaller than the models used for wet troposphere corrections. Here, we calculate WTD from very high-resolution (4/3-km to 4-km) simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, and use the results to evaluate spatial variations in WTD. We focus on six U.S. reservoirs: Lake Elwell (MT), Lake Pend Oreille (ID), Upper Klamath Lake (OR), Elephant Butte (NM), Ray Hubbard (TX), and Sam Rayburn (TX). The reservoirs vary in climate, shape, use, and size. Because evaporation from open water impacts local water vapor content, we compare time series of WTD over land and water in the vicinity of each reservoir. To account for resolution effects, we examine the difference in WRF-simulated WTD averaged over ECMWF and NCEP-NCAR resolution grid cells and compare the magnitudes of each over reservoirs. Finally, we also test the degree to which, if uncorrected, the WTD would dampen or strengthen measured changes in water levels (and storage) at each reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) is an emerging tool that permits autonomous and rapid high-resolution imaging of the surface expression of fault slip. Here, we explore the possibility that MLS geodesy can complement GNSS and InSAR geodetic studies of fault-related deformation. We are particularly interested in transient slip aspects of the earthquake cycle – quasi-continuous creep and post-earthquake afterslip, for example – that have proven elusive to study with other geodetic methods because of their spatially and/or temporally punctuated occurrence. We envision and test two manners of performing MLS geodesy: (1) MLS data referenced to legacy Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data sets and (2) MLS data referenced to other MLS data sets collected from a moving automobile. From 2012 to 2014, we collected multiple MLS data sets from a creeping section of Northern California’s Hayward fault near Fremont, CA; the area was also imaged in the 2007 EarthScope regional ALS survey. The study area is a suburban, residential neighborhood and was chosen, in part, so that we could utilize the stability and geometric regularity of built structures as virtual control points in the geodetic analysis. Our analysis derived an estimated offset by a least squares rigid body transformation of planar surfaces from structural features common to each data set. For the ALS-MLS technique this presents a complication because ALS data image mostly house roofs whereas MLS data image a combination of roofs and vertical walls. Using TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) data as ground truth, we find that both ALS-MLS and MLS-MLS techniques have relative accuracy capability of measuring surface fault slip at the ~1cm/yr level. Furthermore, we find good agreement between independently measured creep and the ALS-MLS derived measurement of ~6 cm over 6 years. We discuss the promise of extending this pilot work to cover a much larger portion of the Hayward fault as well as the implications and challenges related to carrying out MLS geodesy in natural environments.",

It has been made possible through collaboration with GCOS, WCRP, and the ACRE initiative. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational validation dataset, with quantified uncertainties, for assessments of climate model simulations of the 20th century, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses, together with an NCEP global numerical weather prediction (NWP) land/atmosphere model to provide background \"first guess\" fields, an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation method. This yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also yields the uncertainty of that analysis.\nImprovements in the new version (“2c”) include an extension back to 1850 and the specification of new boundary conditions. These come from new fields of monthly COBE-SST2 sea ice concentrations and an ensemble of daily Simple Ocean Data Assimilation with Sparse Input (SODAsi.2c) sea surface temperatures. SODAsi.2c itself was forced with 20CR, allowing these boundary conditions to be more consistent with the atmospheric reanalysis. Millions of additional pressure observations contained in the new International Surface Pressure Databank version 3 are also included. These improvements result in 20CR version “2c” having comparable or better analyses, as suggested by improved 24 hour forecast skill, more realistic uncertainty in near-surface air temperature, and a reduction in spurious centennial trends in the tropical and polar regions. An intercomparison with ERA-Interim, MERRA, and JRA-55 reanalyses that assimilate all available upper-air and satellite observations will also be discussed.",

Our current research aims to determine the rarity of TGFs by searching for ones that are considered observationally dim, that is, they exist below the threshold of the current detection algorithms of instruments such as the GBM. It will do this by combining data from ground-based, low frequency (LF) radio sensors, the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), and the Fermi satellite. LF sensor data is crucial to this search because it allows us to exploit the known link LF data has to TGFs in a way that can’t be done using Fermi and NLDN alone. First we use NLDN data to identify in-cloud events that have a peak current >15 kA and occur within 600 km of Fermi’s nadir point. These are chosen because they have a known association with TGFs. This is followed by examining LF data at the time of the NLDN events to identify probable early stage IC events, a sequence of fast pulses followed by ionospheric reflections, which have been linked to TGFs. Once these TGF-like events are found in LF data, their signal peaks are used to determine the time of their NLDN sources to tens of μs. From this, the time the TGF-like events’ gamma-rays would have reached Fermi, had they been a TGF, is calculated using the Fermi position at the times of the TGF-like events. Fermi’s GBM data is then used in conjunction with the LF radio signal to create an observed photon distribution of all the events that were found to be TGF-like. The photon distribution will be statistically compared to a random distribution of Fermi photons to determine the overall likelihood that observationally dim TGFs were found. So far, many thousands of events have been considered TGF-like in terms of their LF signals, a number of which are known TGFs, thereby verifying the performance of this method. The results found through this research will provide us with vital scientific insight into the rarity of TGFs as a whole.",

            "abstract": "Remediation efforts and contaminant transport predictions generally neglect the complicated dissolution and transport behavior associated with multicomponent NAPL (Non-aqueous phase liquid) sources. Therefore, it is important to understand the diffusion and dissolution processes occurring in these multicomponent systems as a function of mole fraction, molecular similarity/dissimilarity, hydraulic, or nonideal factors. A series of laboratory scale NAPL-aqueous phase dissolution experiments were conducted to assess dissolution and intra-NAPL diffusion as a function of multicomponent NAPL composition (i.e. mole fraction) for both trichloroethene and toluene. These target compounds were selected as representative contaminants as they are commonly components of NAPL mixtures and they define both classes of NAPL (dense-DNAPL and light-LNAPL). Predetermined volumes of target NAPL were mixed with an insoluble n-hexadecane NAPL to create mixtures that vary by NAPL composition. The ideality of resulting target compound dissolution was evaluated by quantifying NAPL-phase activity coefficient through Raoult’s Law analysis. The results show that dissolution from the NAPL mixtures behave ideally for mole fractions above 0.2. As the target compound fraction of the NAPL mixture get smaller, the dissolution behavior becomes increasingly more nonideal (i.e. greater NAPL-phase activity coefficients). Overall, the time-series batch experiments show that dissolution rates were consistent for various mole fraction ratios, indicating that intra-NAPL diffusion is not the rate-limiting control over aqueous concentrations or is not significantly controlled by NAPL composition-dependent factors. The results of this work will improve transport predictions, remediation design, and risk assessments especially for sites contaminated by complex NAPL mixtures.",

            "abstract": "Instrument calibration and cloud retrieval algorithms have been developed to minimize retrieval errors on small scales. However, measurement uncertainties and assumptions within retrieval algorithms at the pixel level may alias into decadal-scale trends of cloud properties.\nWe first, therefore, quantify how instrument calibration changes could alias into cloud property trends. For a perfect observing system the climate trend accuracy is limited only by the natural variability of the climate variable. Alternatively, for an actual observing system, the climate trend accuracy is additionally limited by the measurement uncertainty. Drifts in calibration over time may therefore be disguised as a true climate trend. We impose absolute calibration changes to MODIS spectral reflectance used as input to the CERES Cloud Property Retrieval System (CPRS) and run the modified MODIS reflectance through the CPRS to determine the sensitivity of cloud properties to calibration changes. We then use these changes to determine the impact of instrument calibration changes on trend uncertainty in reflected solar cloud properties.\nSecondly, we quantify how much cloud retrieval algorithm assumptions alias into cloud optical retrieval trends by starting with the largest of these biases: the plane-parallel assumption in cloud optical thickness (τC) retrievals. First, we collect liquid water cloud fields obtained from Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) measurements to construct realistic probability distribution functions (PDFs) of 3D cloud anisotropy (a measure of the degree to which clouds depart from plane-parallel) for different ISCCP cloud types. Next, we will conduct a theoretical study with dynamically simulated cloud fields and a 3D radiative transfer model to determine the relationship between 3D cloud anisotropy and 3D τC bias for each cloud type. Combining these results provides distributions of 3D τC bias by cloud type. Finally, we will estimate the change in frequency of occurrence of cloud types between two decades and will have the information needed to calculate the total change in 3D optical thickness bias between two decades. If we uncover aliases in this study, the results will motivate the development and rigorous testing of climate specific cloud retrieval algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Along with the recent recognition of the role of vegetation in influencing channel hydraulics, and thus fluvial morphology comes the need for scientific research on vegetation recruitment and its control factors. Flood disturbance is known to create a suitable physical template for the establishment of woody pioneers. Sapling recruitment patterns and underlying physical controls were investigated on a 5 km braided reach of the Drôme River in South-eastern France, following the 2003 50-year flood event. The approach was based on the analysis of a chronosequence of high resolution aerial images acquired yearly between 2005 and 2011, complemented by airborne LiDAR data and field observations. The study highlights how physical complexity induced by natural variations in hydro-climatic and consequently hydro-geomorphic conditions facilitates variable patterns of recruitment. The initial post-flood vegetative units, which covered up to 10% of the total active channel area in 2005, was seen to double within six years. The variability of hydro-climatic conditions was reflected in the temporal and spatial patterns of recruitment, with a pronounced peak of vegetation expansion in 2007 and a decreasing trend following higher flows in 2009. Recruitment was further seen to be sustained in a variety of geomorphic units, which showed different probabilities and patterns of recruitment. Active channels were the prominent geomorphic unit in terms of total biomass development, while in-channel wood units showed the highest probability for recruitment. Vegetation recruitment understanding is becoming crucial for predicting fluvial system evolution in different hydroclimatic contexts. Applied, these findings may contribute to improve efforts made in the field of flood risk management, as well as restoration planning.",

            "abstract": "In many seasonally snow-covered forests, the snowpack is the primary water resource. The snowpack also serves as an insulating layer over the soil, warming soil throughout the winter and preserving moisture conditions from the preceding fall. Therefore, the total amount of water in the snowpack as well as the timing and duration of the snow-covered season are likely to have a strong influence on forest productivity through the regulation of the biophysical environment. We investigated how interannual variation in the amount and timing of seasonal snow cover affect winter carbon efflux and growing season carbon uptake at the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site (NWT) in Colorado (3050m a.s.l.; 40˚N) and the Valles Caldera Mixed-Conifer AmeriFlux site (VC) in New Mexico (3003m a.s.l.; 36˚N). The tree species composition at NWT is dominated by Abies lasiocarpa, Picea engelmannii, and Pinus contorta. At VC, the dominant tree species are Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies concolor, Picea pungens, Pinus strobiformis, Pinus flexilis, Pinus ponderosa, and Populus tremuloides. We used net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and climate data from 1999-2012 at NWT and 2007-2012 at VC to divide each year into the growing season, when NEE is negative, and the winter, when NEE is positive. Snow water equivalent (SWE), precipitation, and duration of snow cover data were obtained from USDA/NRCS SNOTEL sites near each forest. At both sites, the start of the growing season was strongly controlled by air temperature, but growing season NEE was not dependent on the length of the growing season. At NWT, total winter carbon efflux was strongly influenced by both the amount and duration of the snowpack, measured as SWE integrated over time. Years with higher integrated SWE had higher winter carbon efflux and also had warmer soil under the snowpack. These patterns were not seen at VC. However, peak SWE amount was positively correlated with growing season NEE at VC, but not at NWT. These results suggest that carbon cycling in seasonally snow-covered forests is responsive to interannual variation in winter precipitation, however, there is not a general relationship to explain the overall effect on annual NEE.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies on aggradational continental sedimentary basins globally show that fluvial deposits in most modern sedimentary basins are dominated Distributive Fluvial Systems (DFS). DFS’s are identified by: (1) pattern of channels and floodplain deposits that radiate outward from an apex located where the river enters the sedimentary basin, (2) deposition where an alluvial system becomes unconfined upon entering the sedimentary basin, (3) broadly fan shaped deposit that is convex upward across the DFS and concave upward down-fan, and (4) if the DFS is incised, an intersection point above which the alluvial system is held in an incised valley and below which it distributes sediment across an active depositional lobe. Several papers about DFS hypothesized that rivers on DFS decrease in size down-fan. We are testing this hypothesis through evaluation of LANDSAT and STRM data from large DFS described by Hartley et al (2010). We use ArcGIS to: (1) open the images and merge them together if there are more than one image corresponding to the DFS being studied, (2) use a Maximum Likelihood Analysis in six classes to segment different features on the DFS (e.g. exposed sands, water, vegetation, and other fan environments), (3) isolate the classes that correspond to the active channel belt (e.g., exposed sand bars and water), (4) divide the active channel belt into 1000 m long sections, (5) determine the area of active channel belt in each section, and (6) calculate the average width of the river in each section (e.g., W = area/1000m). We present our result for each DFS river on a graph that shows the change in width downstream. Our final product will be a dataset that contains width versus distance down-fan from the apex for as many of the large DFS from Hartley et al (2010) as possible. If the hypothesis is supported, the decrease in width could have a substantial predictive significance on sandstone geometry in fluvial successions.",

            "abstract": "In southern Italy, Mesozoic carbonate formations, covered by ash-fall pyroclastic soils, are large karst aquifers and major groundwater resources. For these aquifers, even though Allocca et al., 2014 estimated a mean annual groundwater recharge coefficient at regional scale, a more complete understanding of the recharge processes at small spatio-temporal scale is a primary scientific target.\nIn this paper, we study groundwater recharge processes in the Acqua della Madonna test site (Allocca et al., 2008) through the integrated analysis of piezometric levels, rainfall, soil moisture and air temperature data. These were gathered with hourly frequency by a monitoring station in 2008. We applied the Episodic Master Recharge method (Nimmo et al., 2014) to identify episodes of recharge and estimate the Recharge to Precipitation Ratio (RPR) at both the individual-episode and annual time scales.\nFor different episodes of recharge observed, RPR ranges from 97% to 37%, with an annual mean around 73%. This result has been confirmed by a soil water balance and the application of the Thornthwaite-Mather method to estimate actual evapotranspiration. Even though it seems higher than RPRs typical of some parts of the world, it is very close to the mean annual groundwater recharge coefficient estimated at the regional scale for the karst aquifers of southern Italy. In addition, the RPR is affected at the daily scale by both antecedent soil moisture and rainfall intensity, as demonstrated by a statistically significant multiple linear regression among such hydrological variables. In particular, the recharge magnitude is great for low storm intensity and high antecedent soil moisture value.\nThe results advance the comprehension of groundwater recharge processes in karst aquifers, and the sensitivity of RPR to antecedent soil moisture and rainfall intensity facilitates the prediction of the influence of climate and precipitation regime change on the groundwater recharge process.",

Key issues to an efficient emergency response after a natural disaster include rapidly processing and delivering this critical information to emergency responders and reducing human intervention as much as possible. Essential elements of information necessary to achieve situational awareness are often generated by a wide array of organizations and disciplines, using any number of geospatial and non-geospatial technologies. A key challenge is the current state of practice does not easily support information sharing and technology interoperability.\nNASA E-DECIDER (Emergency Data Enhanced Cyber-Infrastructure for Disaster Evaluation and Response) has worked with the California Earthquake Clearinghouse and its partners to address these issues and challenges by adopting the XChangeCore Web Service Data Orchestration technology and participating in several earthquake response exercises.\nThe E-DECIDER decision support system provides rapid delivery of advanced situational awareness data products to operations centers and emergency responders in the field. Remote sensing and hazard data, model-based map products, information from simulations, damage detection, and crowdsourcing is integrated into a single geospatial view and delivered through a service oriented architecture for improved decision-making and then directly to mobile devices of responders. By adopting a Service Oriented Architecture based on Open Geospatial Consortium standards, the system provides an extensible, comprehensive framework for geospatial data processing and distribution on Cloud platforms and other distributed environments.\nWhile the Clearinghouse and its partners are not first responders, they do support the emergency response community by providing information about the damaging effects earthquakes. It is critical for decision makers to maintain a situational awareness that is knowledgeable of potential and current conditions, possible impacts on populations and infrastructure, and other key information. E-DECIDER and the Clearinghouse have worked together to address many of these issues and challenges to deliver interoperable, authoritative decision support products.",

The algorithms are also valid for TOPS acquisition mode, the operational mode of the Sentinel-1A ESA satellite that was successfully launched in April 2014. Spectral properties of burst-mode data and an overview of the interferometric processing steps of burst-mode acquisitions, emphasizing the importance of the co-registration stage, will be provided. A co-registration approach based on incoherent cross-correlation will be presented and applied to seismic scenarios. Moreover geodynamic corrections due to differential atmospheric path delay and differential solid Earth tides are considered to achieve accuracy in the order of several centimeters.\nWe previously derived a 3D displacement map using cross-correlation techniques applied to optical images from Landsat-8 satellite and TerraSAR-X ScanSAR amplitude images. The Landsat-8 cross-correlation measurements cover two horizontal directions, and the TerraSAR-X displacements include both horizontal along-track and slant-range (radar line-of-sight) measurements that are sensitive to vertical and horizontal deformation. It will be justified that the co-seismic displacement map from TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data may be contaminated by postseismic deformation due to the fact that the post-seismic acquisition took place one month after the main shock, confirmed in part by a TerraSAR-X stripmap interferogram (processed with conventional InSAR) covering part of the area starting on 27 September 2013.\nWe have arranged the acquisition of a burst-synchronized stack of TerraSAR-X ScanSAR images over the affected area after the earthquake. It will be possible to apply interferometry to these data to measure the lower magnitude of the expected postseismic displacements. The processing of single interferograms will be discussed.\nA quicklook of the wrapped differential TerraSAR-X ScanSAR co-seismic interferogram is provided in the attachment (range coverage is 100 km by using 4 subswaths).",

However, quantitative assessments have rarely been conducted at specific energy-producing locations so that the true risk of contamination can be evaluated. The most likely pathways for contamination are surface spills and faulty well bores that leak production fluids directly into an aquifer. This study conducts fate and transport simulations of the most mobile chemical contaminants, based on reactivity to subsurface soils, degradation potential, and source concentration, to better understand which chemicals are most likely to contaminate water resources, and to provide information to planners who wish to be prepared for accidental releases. The simulations are intended to be most relevant to the Niobrara shale formation.",

            "abstract": "Ocean surface wind vector is likely the critical variable to predict onset, maintenance and dissipation of El Niño and La Niña. Analyses of SeaWinds and ASCAT 10-m height (called “surface”) vector winds in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans from 1°S-1°N during March 2000 – June 2011 revealed the longitudinal distribution of the surface zonal wind component associated with the Walker Circulation. In the Pacific Ocean east of 140°E and west of 85°W, the mean wind direction was westward towards the maritime continent with maximum mean zonal wind speed (– 6.5 m s-1) at 150°W; east of 85°W the mean direction was toward the convection zone over South America. Four El Niños and five La Niñas occurred from March 2000 – June 2011. In the Pacific from 150°E to 160°W, the average El Niño (La Niña) westward wind speed was 2 m s-1 (1 m s-1) smaller (larger) than normal. In the west Pacific, the variation in westward wind speeds in El Niño and La Niña conditions relative to normal conditions would be expected to substantially uplift the thermocline during El Niño compared to La Niña, which is consistent with conventional wisdom. In the east Pacific from 130°W – 100°W, average El Niño westward wind speeds were less than normal and La Niña conditions by 0.5 m s-1 and 1 m s-1, respectively. The “central” Pacific nature of the El Niños may have influenced the smaller difference between El Niño and La Niña westward wind speeds in the east Pacific compared to the west Pacific. Analyses of longitudinal distributions of thermocline depths will be discussed. Surface zonal wind speeds in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans showed no evidence of El Niño and La Niña; surface meridional winds showed an apparent response in the Indian and Pacific Oceans but not in the Atlantic Ocean. At 700-m height, the MISR zonal wind component in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans had similar features as those at the surface, except in the east Pacific where the westward wind speeds were identical during El Niño, La Niña and normal conditions. In the east Pacific, the shear between 10- and 700-m heights increased (decreased) during La Niña (El Niño).",

It is known that Flute-type density irregularities can develop during the nonlinear stage of an interchange instability in Earth’s ionosphere and can affect radio communication channels. These density structures play an important role in the refraction and scattering of EM waves in Earth’s ionosphere and also in laser diagnostic scattering experiments. To generate Flute-type density irregularities, we will use previously obtained numerical solution of nonlinear fluid equations involving the electrostatic potential and density. The solutions to these fluid equations govern the development of an interchange instability and results in the spatial dependence of density irregularities which can be used to analyze scattering of high frequency EM waves. This solution contains both large scale vortex density structures coexisting with short scale density perturbations. Next we will initialize a PIC simulation with the density structure from the fluid simulation to calculate the scattering cross-section and compare the results with an analytic solution obtained using numerically calculated density spectra. Because the linear and non-linear stages are well separated in time, we will compare the effect of scattering from density irregularities which form in both the linear and non-linear stages.",

            "abstract": "Litter decomposition is the main process that returns C and nutrients assimilated by plants during net primary production back to the atmosphere and soil from where they came. Grasslands store an estimated 30% of the total world’s soil C, and are often managed by frequent burning. In frequently burned grasslands, fire stimulates grass productivity but also removes the aboveground litter layer that would otherwise decompose and contribute to SOM formation, while returning thermally altered pyrogenic organic matter (py-OM) to the soil surface. We hypothesized that the removal of litter and input of py-OM from frequent burning directly alters the SOM formation process in ways that impact C and N cycling. Here, we will present the results of a study where we incubated 13C and 15N labeled litter and labeled py-OM in the field at both an annually burned and an infrequently burned tallgrass prairie site to examine these effects of fire on SOM formation. Over the course of one year, we traced C and N from the decomposing litter and py-OM into CO2 fluxes, the bulk soil down to 40 cm, and microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and SOM fractions in the top 5 cm of the soil. We found little evidence of biological decomposition of py-OM, and the py-OM was recovered mainly in the light fraction of the surface soils untransformed by soil microbes. In contrast, the litter had lost almost 50% of its mass, with significant losses to CO2 and microbial PLFA uptake. PLFA uptake as well as sand, silt and light fraction SOM incorporation of litter C was significantly higher in the annually burned site as compared to the infrequently burned site, likely due to N limitation created by a long history of altered SOM formation due to burning. Although the annually burned site showed biological evidence for N limitation, it also had a higher amount of overall C and N in the soils. These results imply that although py-OM accumulation can add to long term C and N storage in frequently burned soils, the chronic removal of aboveground litter by burning limits the recycling of nutrients provided by the litter decomposition process, leading to N limitation. These results provide insight into the mechanisms underlying SOM formation in frequently burned grasslands, which will be critical to modeling SOM dynamics under future scenarios of increased fire frequency.",

As part of our research, we collected emerging information on the environmental fate and toxicity of many ENMs and investigated transportation and transformation processes in air, water, and soil. Generally, studies suggest that (i) ENMs will have limited transport in the atmosphere, because they settle rapidly; (ii) ENMs are more stable in freshwater and stormwater than in seawater or groundwater primarily due to variations in ionic strength and the presence of natural organic matter; and (iii) in soil, the fate of ENMs strongly depends on the size of the ENM aggregates and groundwater chemistry, as well as pore and soil particle size. Emerging patterns regarding ENM fate, transport, and exposure combined with emerging information on toxicity indicate the risk is low for most ENMs although current exposure estimates compared with current data on toxicity indicate that at current production and release levels, exposure to Ag, nZVI, and ZnO may cause a toxic response to freshwater and marine species.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical methods can provide a non-invasive method for estimating spatial variability in hydrogeological parameters such as water content, hydraulic conductivity, and matric potential. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is unique amongst geophysical methods in that it is directly sensitive to water, via the initial signal magnitude, and thus provides a robust estimate of water content. In addition, the NMR relaxation time is sensitive to pore geometry, allowing it to be used to predict the hydraulic conductivity and to determine water retention curves. While NMR measurements are considered a mature technology in the petroleum industry, the strength of NMR data for hydrogeophysical studies is still being realized. The major ongoing challenge is to generate a functional mapping of the relationship between pore geometry and relaxation time, while accounting for pore chemistry. In our research, we are developing and refining quantitative petrophysical models that relate NMR parameters to hydrogeological parameters.\nHere we present laboratory measurements that highlight our recent successes in using NMR measurements to estimate several hydrogeological parameters and overcome the limitations of the standard petrophysical models. We examine these relationships by collecting NMR measurements on synthetic and geologic materials with carefully controlled or quantified pore properties, i.e., pore surface-area-to-volume ratio (S/V), pore size and surface iron concentration, and relate these variables to hydrogeological parameters including water content, hydraulic conductivity, and/or the water retention curve. Our major results include developing a relationship between the NMR relaxation times and water saturation across diverse chemical environments, and showing that for materials with rough surfaces, S/V, and not average pore diameter, is the relevant parameter in the interpretation of NMR data. Despite the many challenges in interpreting the measurements, valuable information about hydrogeological parameters can be obtained from NMR relaxation data, and we conclude by outlining pathways for improving the interpretation of NMR data for hydrogeophysical investigations.",

Satellite observations have revealed that the grounding line is retreating rapidly, ice is thinning meters per year, the fast portion of the ice stream is widening, and since 2006 the main portion of the glacier has been accelerating following a period of relatively steady speed.\nHere, we use the JPL/UCI Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) to study the grounding line dynamics of Thwaites Glacier to determine its stability and sensitivity to changes in ice-ocean interactions. We use a full Stokes model, a higher order (HO) approximation and a shelfy-stream approximation (SSA) in 2D and try to best fit observations of ice flow, ice surface elevation and ice thickness across the grounding line by tuning basal friction on land and bottom melt rates on the floating ice tongue. The motion of the grounding line is treated as a contact problem with Full Stokes and using hydrostatic equilibrium with HO and SSA. We show that only the Full Stokes model can correctly represent the balance of stresses and a near steady state profile of the glacier across the grounding line. The work is then extended in 3D to estimate the sensitivity of the glacier’s grounding line to changes in ice melt rates.",

Established in 2005 with the goal of increasing the number and diversity of students studying geosciences and engineering and entering the high-tech workforce, GeoFORCE has been highly successful. Key elements to that success will be presented here.\nGeoFORCE targets bright students in rural and inner-city schools where they are generally not academically challenged. Every summer throughout high school we take them on geologic field trips all over the country. In 2014, GeoFORCE led 15 field academies for about 600 students. The program is rigorous and academic. We emphasize college-level thinking skills. Because it is a 4-year program, they have a pretty good grounding in physical geology by the time they graduate. More importantly, they develop confidence in their ability to handle college, and a strong motivation to earn a college degree. GeoFORCE students are mostly minority (85%) and more than half will be the first in their family to graduate from college. GeoFORCE students exceed national averages in rates of going to college (97%), majoring in STEM fields (66%), majoring in geosciences (15%) and engineering (13%), and graduating from college (~85%).\nGeoFORCE is a public/private partnership and a workforce-focused program. The Jackson School funds staff and operating expenses (37%). Money for student programs comes from private industry (44%), state and federal grants (14%), and foundations and individual donors (5%). Our corporate partners are in the energy sector. In addition to funding, corporate sponsors attend the summer field programs, mentor GeoFORCE students, and provide opportunities for the students to visit the companies. As our students move toward college graduation, our industry and government partners have begun to hire them as interns.\nGeoFORCE graduates are now entering the workforce. Our first two cohorts are 4 and 5 years past high school graduation. That group of 155 students boasts 70 college graduates and another 60 still pursuing degrees. There are 19 geoscience majors and 9 engineers. They are also contributing to the body of science with a growing list of publications, including at least one at this meeting.",

(2012) reported the frequent presence of convectively injected water vapor in the lowermost stratosphere over North America during summertime, based on aircraft measurements. They asserted that enhanced catalytic ozone destruction within these wet stratospheric air parcels presents a concern for UV dosages in populated areas, especially if the frequency of deep convective events increases. Schwartz et al.(2013) analyzed 8 years of more widespread Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements of lower stratospheric water vapor over North America and concluded that anomalously wet (>8 ppm) air parcels were present only 2.5% of the time during July and August. However, given the 3-km vertical resolution of MLS water vapor retrievals in the lowermost stratosphere, thin wet layers deposited by overshooting convection may be present but not readily detectable by MLS.\nSince 1980 the balloon-borne NOAA frost point hygrometer (FPH) has produced nearly 400 high quality water vapor profiles over Boulder, Colorado, at 5-m vertical resolution from the surface to the middle stratosphere. The 34-year record of high-resolution FPH profiles obtained over Boulder during summer months is evaluated for evidence of convectively injected water vapor in the lowermost stratosphere. A number of approaches are used to assess the contributions of deep convection to the Boulder stratospheric water vapor record. The results are compared to those based on MLS profiles over Boulder and the differences are discussed.\nAnderson, J. G., D. M. Wilmouth, J. B. Smith, and D. S.

            "abstract": "Extending from the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the northwest Indian Ocean and modern Iran, West Asia represents one of the most climatically dynamic regions in the northern hemisphere. The regional climate of West Asia is governed by interactions between the mid-latitude Westerlies, the Siberian Anticyclone and the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon. In recent years, sparse records of Pleistocene climate variability have emerged from cave deposits (speleothems) in East Asia, the Arabian Peninsula and eastern Mediterranean. However, there remains a large gap in our understanding of abrupt and long-term climate variability in this region. We present for the first time δ18O data from speleothem and water samples that were collected from two cave systems in west-central Iran at similar latitudes, 60km apart: Qaleh Kord Cave (QKC, 35°47'50”N, 48°51'25\"E) and Kataleh Khor Cave (KKC, 35°50'09\"N, 48°09'41\"E). U-Th geochronometry in two stalagmites from QKC yielded ages that range from 73,000 to 118,000 years B.P. Likewise, two stalagmites dated from KKC yielded ages 214,000-260,000 years B.P. and 300,000-500,000 years B.P. The analysis of additional speleothems from these caves should help to establish a continuous half million year multi-proxy record of δ18O variations, trace metal composition (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca), and radiogenic Sr isotopes in these cave systems.\nHigh-resolution δ18O analyses of QKC stalagmites show patterns of variation that can be attributed to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a and 5b. Since both these caves sit at relatively high elevations (QKC: 2,160 masl, KKC: 1,695 masl) far from major seas (1,100km from Mediterranean Sea, 1,500km from North Indian Ocean), this record potentially reflects the synoptic interactions between the Westerlies and the Siberian Anticyclone during this time interval, as opposed to direct variations caused by sea level fluctuations. Measurements of drip water composition and modern environmental parameters (temperature, relative humidity and pCO2) inside the caves paired with δ18O analyses of fluid inclusions in the stalagmites will place additional constraints on multi-proxy reconstruction of paleo-records from these cave systems.",

            "abstract": "The greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is both produced and consumed in soils. In strict denitrification, nitrogen (N)-oxides are reduced stepwise by microbial enzymes until dinitrogen (N2) is produced. N2O may be lost and/or consumed during this process, by microbes that may or may not possess the enzyme required for the final step of the reduction chain. In cold, N-limited, boreal forest soils consumption may dominate, resulting in low net N2O flux to the atmosphere, though the ubiquity of this pattern and the temperature response of these processes are unclear. To accurately predict the temperature response of net soil efflux of N2O in the boreal biome, we must understand fundamental, temperature responses of the boreal soil denitrifier community.\nUsing boreal forest organic and mineral soils collected from three climate regions along the Newfoundland and Labrador Boreal Ecosystem Latitudinal Transect, Canada, we measured soil N2O fluxes during ~60 h lab incubations, in which conditions for denitrification were optimized. Organic soils from the warmer climate and incubated at the warmest temperature produced the most N2O. These soils also experienced net consumption of N2O earlier in the incubation than other soils. All mineral soils, regardless of location along the climate gradient, exhibited net N2O consumption earliest in the incubation at the warmest incubation temperature. Ongoing analyses of headspace N2O and N2 d15N and relative abundances of denitrifying communities during the incubation will reveal mechanisms driving changes in [N2O] over time, but these data suggest warmer temperatures in these boreal soils promote enhanced rates of both N2O production and consumption, with ‘hot moments’ of net N2O efflux during which production far exceeds consumption. If these results are applicable in situ, a warming climate may result in greater net N2O flux from boreal forest soils such as these.",

            "abstract": "Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala, is a dominantly basaltic complex that has been continually active since the 1960’s, with over 250 lava flows, intermittent strombolian activity, and ash and fumerolic plumes. Sometime between 0.6 and 1.6 ka B.P., the SW sector of the initial cone failed in a major edifice collapse. This event left a large arcuate scarp, within which the modern cone was constructed from historical times up to the present. Two collapses on the upper flanks of the cone near the main vent in 1962 and 2010, and uneven loading of lava flows on the SW flank are a cause for concern about the stability of this young edifice. For this study, ALOS PALSAR L-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data was analyzed at Pacaya from February 2007 - February 2011. Interferograms reveal several applications of InSAR for understanding and monitoring activity at Pacaya, including: (1) lava cooling-related compaction during effusive activity, (2) inflation on the northern side of the cone prior to a large eruption on May 27th, 2010, and (3) movement of the edifice to the SW during this large eruption, suggesting large-scale flank instability. With the implementation of InSAR technology at Pacaya in the future, we may be able to provide insights into the post-emplacement behavior of lava flows and shed light on edifice stability, leading to improved volcano hazard assessments.",

            "abstract": "Recently acquired seismic refraction data in the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) have provided new insights into the basin’s crustal structure. We use the four refraction profiles to build regional-scale crustal sections across the GOM, and then use these profiles as the basis for basin modeling of crustal subsidence through time. Basin modeling includes flexural backstripping of the sediment load and correction for thermal subsidence, with the aim of calculating the shape of the basin at the time (Callovian) of salt deposition. The age of salt deposition relative to rifting events is debated, with opinions ranging from salt being synrift to entirely postrift. We suggest that salt was deposited near the end of rifting, close to the time of initiation of sea floor spreading. This interpretation is based partly on reconstructing possible water depths at the start of salt deposition, using the backstripping method. If water depths were too deep, i.e. sea floor spreading already established, salt thickness based on isostatic balance would be far too large. If water depths were too shallow, i.e. little crustal thinning, salt thickness would be too thin.  We can compare the outcome of this analysis with the distribution of evaporites in the Gulf of Mexico basin, which may have formed a 4 km thick layer in some areas, though these salt deposits have subsequently been remobilized. Crustal structure from the refraction data shows crustal thicknesses of 8-15 km under the salt basin. The seismic velocity structure of the thinned crust suggests that at least some of the basement was formed by magmatic intrusions. If we correct for the inferred stretching of the continental margin and thermal subsidence, we obtain a plausible depth for the margin at Callovian time.  Velocity structure from the refraction data plus observations of SDRs in the eastern GOM are consistent with the margins of the GOM having a significant synrift volcanic component. We suggest that this volcanic component is a prerequisite for formation of marginal salt basins like the GOM, Aptian South Atlantic and present-day Red Sea.",

            "abstract": "The Himalayas possess one of the largest resources of snow and ice, which act as a huge freshwater reservoir. Monitoring the glaciers is important to assess the overall reservoir health. In last few decades the most of the mountainous glaciers have undergone negative mass balance and terminal recessions, unlike the advancing glaciers. In this investigation, glaciers of Western Himalaya have been monitored since 1962 and variability in retreat was identified within the region. Thus, further analysis about significant parameters was taken into account to understand the relationship between glacio-morphological factors and change in glacial area. Initially change in areal extent of glaciers was derived for two time frames (1962-2001/02 and 2001/02-2010/11). The study comprised of 324 glaciers for the monitoring period of 1962-2001/02. A loss in glacial area was observed as 11% for this period. Many of these glaciers (238) were further monitored between 2001/02 and 2010/11. These glaciers showed a loss of 1.1%. The annual deglaciation has been found higher during the period of 1962-2001/02, which means rate of melting is less in this region in latest decade. Another observation in deglaciation was found spatial and temporal variability in glaciers which was addressed using glacio-morphic parameters. Areal extent of glaciers was observed to be having significant role on rate of glacial shrinkage. The another important parameter is equilibrium line altitude, i.e. the glaciers located below ELA have experienced 4.6% of deglaciation for the time frame 2001/02 – 2010/11 where as it was found to be 1.1% for the glaciers occurring above ELA. Moreover, glaciers located at lower altitude and having gentle slope show more area retreat. The results of area retreat in debris covered and debris free glaciers supports that the glaciers covered by debris retard ice melting at some extent. 158 glaciers were observed having no debris cover which shows 14% of loss in surface area. In glaciers having 40 % debris cover, 8% of deglaciation was observed. However, orientation of glaciers did not show any considerable pattern on glacial change. The study inferences that the glaciers which are debris free, located below mean altitude of snowline, smaller in size, gentle slope,and located at lower altitude has experienced higher rate of shrinkage.",

            "abstract": "In practice, it is difficult to estimate groundwater recharge accurately. Despite this challenge, most recharge investigations produce a single, best estimate of recharge. However, there is growing recognition that quantification of natural recharge uncertainty is critical for groundwater management. We present a multiple-model framework for estimating recharge uncertainty. In addition, we show how direct water flux measurements can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of total basin recharge for an arid, closed hydrologic basin in the Atacama Desert, Chile. We first formulated multiple hydrogeologic conceptual models of the basin based on existing data, and implemented each conceptual model for the purpose of conducting numerical simulations. For each conceptual model, groundwater recharge was inversely estimated; then, Null-Space Monte Carlo techniques were used to quantify the uncertainty on the initial estimate of total basin recharge. Second, natural recharge components – including both deep percolation and streambed infiltration – were estimated from field data. Specifically, vertical temperature profiles were measured in monitoring wells and streambeds, and water fluxes were estimated from thermograph analysis. Third, calculated water fluxes were incorporated as prior information to the model calibration and Null-Space Monte Carlo procedures, yielding revised estimates of both total basin recharge and associated uncertainty. The fourth and final component of this study uses value of information analyses to identify potentially informative locations for additional water flux measurements. The uncertainty quantification framework presented here is broadly transferable; furthermore, this research provides an applied example of the extent to which water flux measurements may serve to reduce groundwater recharge uncertainty at the basin scale.",

The current suite of instruments allows for a near comprehensive picture of the atmospheric state above Summit but increased spatial and temporal resolution of water vapor and temperature are needed to reveal detailed microphysical information.

Under different agricultural practice scenarios, crop yield may have different climate sensitivities. Since it is important to understand how future climate changes affect agriculture productivity and what the potential adaptation strategies would be to compensate for possible negative impacts on crop production, we performed experiments to study climate sensitivity under different agricultural practice scenarios for rice, maize and wheat in the top four production provinces in China using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model. The agricultural practice scenarios include four categories: different amounts of nitrogen fertilizer or no nitrogen stress; irrigation turned on or off, or no water stress; all possible seeds in the DSSAT cultivar data base; and different planting dates. For the climate sensitivity test, the control climate is from 1998 to 2007, and we individually modify four climate variables: daily maximum and minimum temperature by +2 °C and -2 °C, daily precipitation by +20% and -20%, and daily solar radiation by + 20% and -20%. With more nitrogen fertilizer applied, crops are more sensitive to temperature changes as well as precipitation changes because of their release from nitrogen limitation. With irrigation turned on, crop yield sensitivity to temperature decreases in most of the regions depending on the amount of the local precipitation, since more water is available and soil temperature varies less with higher soil moisture. Those results indicate that there could be possible agriculture adaptation strategies under certain future climate scenarios. For example, increasing nitrogen fertilizer usage by a certain amount might compensate for the negative impact on crop yield from climate changes. However, since crops are more sensitive to climate changes when there is more nitrogen fertilizer applied, if the climate changes are unfavorable to crop yields, increasing nitrogen fertilizer usage at certain levels might enhance the negative climate change impact. Enhanced nitrogen fertilizer use might have additional negative impacts on climate because of nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere, but those effects were not studied here.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic natural gas hydrate (NGH) accumulations form when natural gas is trapped thermodynamically within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), which extends downward from the seafloor in open ocean depths greater than about 500 metres. As water depths increase, the thickness of the GHSZ thickens, but economic NGH deposits probably occur no deeper than 1 km below the seafloor. Natural gas (mostly methane) appears to emanate mostly from deeper sources and migrates into the GHSZ. The natural gas crystallizes as NGH when the pressure - temperature conditions within the GHSZ are reached and when the chemical condition of dissolved gas concentration in pore water is high enough to favor crystallization. Although NGH can form in both primary and secondary porosity, the principal economic target appears to be turbidite sands on deep continental margins. Because these are very similar to the hosts of more deeply buried conventional gas and oil deposits, industry knows how to explore for them. Recent improvements in a seismic geotechnical approach to NGH identification and valuation have been confirmed by drilling in the northern Gulf of Mexico and allow for widespread exploration for NGH deposits to begin.\nNGH concentrations occur in the same semi-consolidated sediments in GHSZs worldwide. This provides for a narrow exploration window with low acoustic attenuation. These sediments present the same range of relatively easy drilling conditions and formation pressures that are only slightly greater than at the seafloor and are essentially equalized by water in wellbores. Expensive conventional drilling equipment is not required. NGH is the only hydrocarbon that is stable at its formation pressures and incapable of converting to gas without artificial stimulation. We suggest that specialized, NGH-specific drilling capability will offer opportunities for much less expensive drilling, more complex wellbore layouts that improve reservoir connectivity and in which gas-water separation can begin within the seafloor, and specialized production techniques. NGH is the only oceanic hydrocarbon deposit in which pressure can be controlled within the reservoir by balancing conversion and extraction. Oceanic NGH has a very low environmental risk, which also serves to distinguish it from other deepwater hydrocarbon deposits.",

Studies suggest that these earthquakes were induced by reactivation of the Wilzetta fault due to the disposal of waste water from hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) and other oil and gas activities. The Wilzetta fault is a northeast trending vertical strike-slip fault that is a well known structural trap for oil and gas. Since the November 2011 Prague sequence, thousands of small to moderate (M2-M4) earthquakes have occurred throughout central Oklahoma. The most active regions are located near the towns of Stillwater and Medford in north-central Oklahoma, and Guthrie, Langston and Jones near Oklahoma City.\n The USGS, in collaboration with the Oklahoma Geological Survey and the University of Oklahoma, has responded by deploying numerous temporary seismic stations in the region in order to record the vigorous aftershock sequences. In this study we use data from the temporary seismic stations to re-locate all Oklahoma earthquakes in the USGS National Earthquake Information Center catalog using a multiple-event approach known as hypo-centroidal decomposition that locates earthquakes with decreased uncertainty relative to one another. Modeling from this study allows us to constrain the detailed geometry of the reactivated faults, as well as source parameters (focal mechanisms, stress drop, rupture length) for the larger earthquakes. Preliminary results from the November 2011 Prague sequence suggest that subsurface rupture lengths of the largest earthquakes are anomalously long with very low stress drop. We also observe very high Q (~1000 at 1 Hz) that explains the large felt areas and we find relatively low b-value and a rapid decay of aftershocks.",

Using pilot campaign strategies, we have engaged local residents in focus groups and interviews to understand how effective the approach can be. Growing educational research suggests learning about climate change can lead to feelings of depression, fear and inaction. Climate change seems too big of a task to take on. But with sweaty back (or “swack” as it’s known in some circles), there’s a public enemy that can be defeated. As only one piece of an innovative model for informal climate change education, the Climate and Urban Systems Partnership repositions the war on climate change by declaring a war on swack instead. This way, we can talk about climate change in a way it has never been talked about before that will certainly get people’s attention. It also answers the common question of, “Yeah, but how does it affect me?” We’re educating about responses to climate change because heat waves, floods, and excessive back sweat all kinda suck a lot.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus’ surface is composed mostrly of pure water ice. The Cassini spacecraft has observed present-day geologic activity at the moon’s South Polar region (the so-called “Tiger Stripes”). Plumes of micron-sized particles composed of water ice and other contaminants (CO2, NH3, CH4) erupting from this region are the major source of Saturn’s E-ring. Some of this material, however, falls on Enceladus’ surface to form deposits that extend to the north at ~220°E and ~40°E and whose highest concentration is at the south pole.\nThe Cassini VIMS spectrometer acquires hyperspectral data in the 0.3–5.1 μm spectral range. We selected VIMS cubes of Enceladus in the IR range (0.8–5.1 μm), and minimized photometric effects due to different illumination conditions by normalizing all spectra at 2.23 μm.\nWe aim to identify E-ring deposits across Enceladus’ surface through the variation in band depth of the main water-ice spectral features located at 1.25, 1.5, and 2.0 μm. Since plumes deposits on the surface undergo darkening processes for less time than surrounding terrains, they appear brighter and so the water-ice absorption bands must be deeper.\nFor all pixels in the selected cubes, we measured the band depths for the main water-ice absorptions and the height of the 3.6 μm reflection peak, whose value relates to grain size. To characterize the global variation of water-ice band depths across Enceladus, we divided the surface into a 1°x1° grid and then averaged the band depths and peak values inside each square cell.\nThis approach clearly identifies plums deposits. As expected, the highest concentrations occur at Enceladus’ south pole, where band depths values are the deepest across the entire moon’s surface. Our results confirm that plume particles fall in north-oriented patterns at ~40°E and ~220°E, and disappear around ~0°E and ~180°E. In addition, we observed a possible non-plume related regional variation in all major water ice absorption bands on the leading side.",

            "abstract": "Decay of an eyewall of a hurricane after its landfall can be monitored by seismic data. We report our analysis of Hurricane Isaac in August, 2012, based on data from a dense seismological array by Earthscope.\nWe examined seismic amplitudes for frequencies between 0.01 Hz and 0.02 Hz, plotted as a function of distance from the center of the hurricane eye. Selection of this frequency range is critical as some seismic waves are excited by ocean waves, thus not representing the processes near the eye. For this frequency range, we analyzed distance-amplitude plots for every 6-hour interval for which the hurricane location was published.\nAt the time of the landfall, seismic amplitudes showed a sharp peak at about 75 km from the center of the eye. The maximum seismic amplitudes decreased over the next 12 hours but the distance from the center did not change. In the following 18 hours, the peak gradually moved to a distance of about 200-300 km with diminishing amplitudes. We inverted these seismic data for the time evolution of surface pressure that could explain the observed seismic amplitudes.\nThe surface-pressure solutions showed that pressure decayed in half during the first 12 hours after the landfall but the pressure peak remained at the same radius 75 km. In the next 18 hours, the peak moved to a distance of 200-300 km with additional halving of amplitude and broadening.\nWe postulate the mechanism as follows: the focused ascending flow in the eyewall generated intense pressure fluctuation on the Earth’s surface that in turn excited ground motions in the Earth. For Hurricane Isaac, the ascending flow in the eyewall existed at radius of about 75 km from the center during the first 12 hours. The ascending flow weakened during this period, indicated by halving of surface pressure. In the next 18 hours, the eyewall moved outward to distances of about 200-300 km, associated with weakening and broadening of the flow, suggesting a collapse of the eyewall over this period.",

            "abstract": "The erosion and sublimation of blowing snow in Antarctica is a considerable source of error in surface mass balance estimates of the Antarctic Ice sheet. These processes are also crucial to an understanding of near-surface atmospheric processes at the margins. Because ground measurements of blowing snow are difficult to capture, regional climate models (RCMs) are crucial to an understanding of the phenomenon. Here, we present a comparison of outputs of two implementations of the Modèle Atmosphérique Régionale (MAR) RCM at a 50 km resolution over Antarctica for the period 2000-2011. While previous versions of MAR have been run for time periods beginning in 1958, this abbreviated run was performed specifically to test the blowing snow routine. The model is forced at the boundaries with 6-hourly reanalysis data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The two MAR configurations are identical except for the implementation of blowing snow dynamics. The differences in surface and atmospheric outputs between the models can therefore isolate the seasonal and regional effects of blowing snow. We determine spatio-temporal patterns of covariance between variables over the entire 11-year period, as well as inter-seasonal trends within each year using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. The most prominent of these patterns pinpoints specific regions and time periods for model outputs which are compared with available temperature, surface pressure, wind speed and relative humidity data from Automatic Weather Stations as well as with radiosonde data generally available at the ice sheet margins (made available by the University of Wisconsin-Madison). Additionally, model outputs in selected areas are compared with satellite data (MODIS surface temperature and pressure) to assess the robustness of these trends. The analysis shows that there are specific regions and weeks in the winter where increased blowing snow flux corresponds to significant humidity differences between the two models.",

            "abstract": "Many of the difficulties in the pollen fossil-based paleoclimate reconstruction in coastal regions derive from the complex sedimentary processes of the near-shore environment. In order to examine this problem, we carried out pollen analysis of surface sediments collected from 35 sites in Osaka Bay, Japan. Using the biomisation method, the surrounding vegetation was accurately reconstructed at all sites. Applying the modern analogue technique to the same data, however, led to reconstructed temperatures that were lower by ca. 5 deg. C and precipitation amounts higher by ca. 5000 mm than the current sea level climate of the region. The range of reconstructed values was larger than the reconstruction error associated with the method. The principal component analysis shows that the surface pollen variation in Osaka Bay reflects sedimentary processes. This significant error associated with the quantitative climatic reconstruction using pollen data is attributed to the fact that the pollen assemblage is not determined solely by climate but reflects non-climatic influences. The accuracy and precision of climatic reconstruction can be improved significantly by expanding counts of minor taxa. Given this result, we re-examined the reconstructed climate using Osaka Bay palynological record reported in Kitaba et al. (2013). This new method did not significantly alter the overall variation in the reconstructed climate, and thus we conclude that the reconstruction was generally reliable. However, some intervals were strongly affected by depositional environmental change. In these, a climate signal can be extracted by excluding the patterns that arise from coastal sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "Much of the geological record can be interpreted in the context of processes operating today at plate boundaries. This works well to explain processes and products during the Phanerozoic era; during Precambrian times when the oldest rocks were forming, however, conditions on the younger, hotter, more ductile Earth were likely very different, making analogies with modern day tectonics less certain. Gathering evidence preserved deep within the plates in the shields is thus essential to improve our understanding of the early Earth. Shields are usually underlain by thick, seismically fast roots that are absent beneath younger portions of Earth's surface. The thermochemically distinct nature of cratonic roots is often associated with Archean processes such as the extraction of komatiitic magmas. However, the cratonic core of North America does not fit easily into this Archean formation paradigm: part of the Canadian shield extends beneath the Archean Superior craton, but much of it persists beneath younger Proterozoic crust as well. We present here a relative arrival-time tomographic study of mantle seismic structure using data from a new seismograph network operating in SE Canada. Our stations extend from the Archean Superior craton around the southern tip of Hudson Bay, through Proterozoic Grenville terranes, and into Paleozoic coastal Maine and Nova Scotia. Tomographic images display three broad zones of mantle wavespeed: slow in the Appalachian terranes; fast in the Grenville Province; very fast within the Superior craton. Archean lithosphere has been modified by the Great Meteor hotspot, but we find no evidence for major plate-scale underthrusting during the Grenville orogeny. The abrupt wavespeed transition from Archean to Proterozoic mantle is thus consistent with the emerging consensus that keels form in two stages: a chemically depleted layer in Archean times followed by the thermal development of a less-depleted lithosphere during Proterozoic times.",

            "abstract": "Farmland resources in Taiwan are limited because about 73% is mountainous and slope land. Moreover, the rapid urbanization and dense population resulted in the highly developed flat area. Therefore, the utilization of slope land for agriculture is more needed. In 1976, “Slope Land Conservation and Utilization Act” was promulgated to regulate the slope land utilization. Consequently, slope land capability was categorized into Class I-IV according to 4 criteria, i.e., average land slope, effective soil depth, degree of soil erosion, and parent rock. The slope land capability Class I-VI are suitable for cultivation and pasture. Whereas, Class V should be used for forestry purpose and Class VI should be the conservation land which requires intensive conservation practices. The field survey was conducted to categorize each land unit as the classification scheme. The landowners may not allow to overuse land capability limitation.\nIn the last decade, typhoons and landslides frequently devastated in Taiwan. The rapid post-disaster reassessment of the slope land capability classification is necessary. However, the large-scale disaster on slope land is the constraint of field investigation. This study focused on using satellite remote sensing and GIS as the rapid re-evaluation method. Chenyulan watershed in Nantou County, Taiwan was selected to be a case study area. Grid-based slope derivation, topographic wetness index (TWI) and USLE soil loss calculation were used to classify slope land capability. The results showed that GIS-based classification give an overall accuracy of 68.32%. In addition, the post-disaster areas of Typhoon Morakot in 2009, which interpreted by SPOT satellite imageries, were suggested to classify as the conservation lands. These tools perform better in the large coverage post-disaster update for slope land capability classification and reduce time-consuming, manpower and material resources to the field investigation.",

Our data from the North Atlantic show a similar but time-transgressive pattern of high-latitude productivity decline from 3.3 to 2.5 Ma. We argue that, taken together, these data are most readily explained by an equatorward migration of the westerly winds in both hemispheres and associated equatorward shift of the zones of Ekman divergence, which would have decreased productivity in polar waters. At 2.7 Ma, tropical and temperate Atlantic sites productivity increases abruptly and persists with orbital pacing thereafter, consistent with a shoaling and meridional contraction of the nutrient-depleted, low latitude, surface ocean, warm pool. This timing coincides with major Southern Ocean changes suggesting a strong influence of Southern Ocean on the fertility of the low latitude ocean.",

            "abstract": "Enhanced dispersion and concentration of contaminants such as trace metals and organic pollutants through storm-induced disturbances and sea level rise (SLR) are major factors that could adversely impact the health and resilience of communities and ecosystems in coming years. As part of the response to Hurricane Sandy, the U.S. Geological Survey collected data on the effects of contaminant source disturbance and dispersion. A major limitation of conducting pre- and post-Sandy comparisons was the lack of baseline data in locations proximal to potential contaminant sources and mitigation activities, sensitive ecosystems, and recreational facilities where human and ecological exposures are probable. To address this limitation, a Sediment-bound Contaminant Resiliency and Response (SCoRR) strategy with two operational modes, Resiliency (baseline) and Response (event-based), has been designed by leveraging existing interagency networks and resources. In Resiliency Mode, sites will be identified and sampled using standardized procedures prioritized to develop baseline data and to define sediment-quality based environmental health metrics. In Response Mode, a subset of sites within the network will be evaluated to ensure that adequate pre-event data exist at priority locations. If deficient, pre-event samples will be collected from priority locations. Crews will be deployed post-event to resample these locations allowing direct evaluation of impacts, as well as redefining baseline conditions for these areas. A tiered analytical and data integration strategy has been developed that will identify vulnerable human and environmental receptors, the sediment-bound contaminants present, and the biological activity and potential effects of exposure to characterized sediments. Communication mechanisms are in development to make resulting data available in a timely fashion and in a suitable format for informing event response and recovery efforts.",

            "abstract": "Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs) can penetrate into the lunar regolith, causing deep dielectric (or subsurface) charging. The regolith discharges with a timescale that depends on temperature. In permanently shadowed regions (PSRs), for example, this timescale is ~20 days. To estimate the effects of subsurface charging, Jordan et al. [2014] created a data-driven, deep dielectric charging model. The model used GCR data from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and SEP data from the Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). Data-driven runs of the model indicated that GCRs create, throughout the top tens of centimeters of regolith, a persistent electric field of up to ~700 V/m. They also indicated that large SEP events could create episodic subsurface electric fields of ≥106 V/m, possibly inducing dielectric breakdown. Over time, such SEP events may drive “breakdown weathering,” preferentially enhancing the fraction of fine and monomineralic grains within PSRs.\nThis model assumed that no other charging processes exist, i.e., that the environment is a vacuum. Solar wind plasma, however, can enter PSRs and charge the regolith’s surface, so we revise the model to include this charging. While it cannot simultaneously nullify or decrease all the subsurface electric fields found using the model’s previous iteration, adding this process does change the depth profile and maxima of the electric fields. Using the data-driven results of the revised model, we estimate the subsurface electric fields due to the solar wind, GCRs, and SEPs. We also show how including solar wind charging affects the possibility of dielectric breakdown and the importance of breakdown weathering to the regolith in PSRs.\n",

            "abstract": "Three-Dimensional Electrical Resistivity Tomography techniques (ERT-3D) have demonstrated to be an efficient tool to study the subsurface of areas of archaeological interest by special arrays designed to ‘illuminate’ the subsoil beneath the structure under study. ‘L’- and ‘Corner’-arrays are applied to design alternative electrode geometries, which attempt to cover the subsurface with enough resistivity observations underneath the studied target. Two examples are presented where novel geometries can be applied to investigate the subsoil of two important pyramids in Mexico. First, the archaeological site of Cuicuilco is studied. The area is found towards the southern portion of the Mexican Basin. This pyramid presents a circular structure of 110 m in diameter and a total height of 25 m. The region is partially covered by the lava flows that came from an eruptive event form the Xitle Volcano 1500 years ago. The geophysical study was carried out at the base of the pyramid. 48 electrodes were deployed along a circular transect, with an electrode separation of 5.4 m. A total of 1716 apparent resistivity observations were measured. The inverted model computed is obtained with an investigation depth of 30 m, approximately (Figure 1, in color). A resistive anomaly can be observed towards the central portion of the model. This anomaly can be associated to a burial chamber, excavated by the archaeologists. The second example corresponds to the pyiramid El Castillo, located in the archaeological site of Chichen Itza, in the southern lowlands of Mexico, within the Yucatan Peninsula. Previous GPR studies carried out within the pyramid’s Plaza provided evidences of a buried tunnel excavated within the limestone rocks. Such feature seemed to run beneath the eastern flank of the pyramide. The geophysical study was carried out by employing 96 flat-surface electrodes, which surrounded the edifice forming a square geometry. A total of 5,350 apparent resistivity observations were measured (Figure 2), with a total depth of investigation of 25 m. The initial models computed have shown encouraging results, unfortunately noisy data did not allow obtaining a better result. A filtering processing is been designed to reject noisy information and to enhance the possible position of a buried cavity beneath the pyramid.",

            "abstract": "Global-scale terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) vary in their underlying driving assumptions, inputs, and parameterizations. As a result, TBM estimates of carbon fluxes and pools vary greatly and the lack of direct observations of land-atmosphere carbon exchange at the same spatio-temporal resolution (e.g., 0.5° x 0.5° degree and sub-daily to monthly) of model estimates makes it difficult to assess TBM performance in terms of their ability to represent the terrestrial carbon cycle. Atmospheric CO2 measurements, however, may be a potentially powerful observational constraint for TBMs because they provide an integrated view of surface sources and sinks of carbon. The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) measures atmospheric CO2 from space at spatio-temporal scales relatively consistent with model estimates. Using TBM estimates from the North American Carbon Program Multi-scale synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), together with estimates of fossil fuel emissions and air-sea fluxes, we translate surfaces fluxes into atmospheric CO2 concentrations using the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model. The performance of MsTMIP TBMs is evaluated by comparing the dry air column-averaged mole fractions of CO2 (ΧCO2) from transported surface fluxes to observations of ΧCO2 from GOSAT. While MsTMIP ΧCO2 signals are generally consistent with GOSAT ΧCO2 in the southern hemisphere, MsTMIP and GOSAT XCO2 show profound differences in the northern hemisphere (NH). In general, MsTMIP XCO2 tends to be higher than GOSAT XCO2 at northern latitudes, especially in the NH summer and fall. Looking specifically at regions in the NH, we compare each MsTMIP ΧCO2 to GOSAT ΧCO2 in terms of its ability to reproduce the spatial distribution, magnitude and timing of the GOSAT ΧCO2 seasonal cycle. We use the information derived from the comparison to link model performance with how certain processes are represented within the models themselves, thus aiding in model development and improvement.",

            "abstract": "The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua Spacecraft was launched on May 4, 2002. AIRS acquires hyperspectral infrared radiances in 2378 channels ranging in wavelength from 3.7-15.4 um with spectral resolution of better than 1200, and spatial resolution of 13.5 km with global daily coverage. The AIRS was designed to measure temperature and water vapor profiles for improvement in weather forecast and improved parameterization of climate processes. Currently the AIRS Level 1B Radiance Products are assimilated by NWP centers worldwide and have shown considerable forecast improvement. AIRS L1 and L2 products are widely used for studying critical climate processes related to water vapor feedback, atmospheric transport and cloud properties. AIRS trace gas products include ozone profiles, carbon monoxide, and the first global maps of mid-tropospheric carbon dioxide.\nThe AIRS radiances are calibrated using a uniform on-board blackbody and full aperture space view. For this reason, all radiometric measurements assume a uniform scene. As with most instruments, the AIRS 2D spatial response functions (tophat functions) are not flat for all channels, nor are they the same. When viewing a non-uniform scene, this causes a radiometric error that is scene dependent and cannot be removed without knowledge of the scene response. The magnitude of the error depends on the non-uniformity of the AIRS spatial response and the non-uniformity of the scene, but typically only affects about 1% of the data.\nIn this effort we use data from the MODIS instrument to provide information on the scene uniformity that can be used to correct the AIRS data. Early results show we can match the AIRS and MODIS radiances to about 0.6K when we include the AIRS tophat functions in the normalization of the MODIS data (Elliott, Proc SPIE 6296, 2006). The method requires use of different infrared bands in MODIS depending on the channels of AIRS being corrected. Resulting improvement in noise and bias will be presented by comparing to the new AIRS Level 1C product that uses PC techniques to correct impacted channels. The method can be used to recover impacted channels, validate the Level 1C product, and identify scene conditions where the error is most significant.",

            "abstract": "The rapid expansion of unconventional oil and gas development in North America has generated intense public concerns about potential impacts to groundwater quality. To address these concerns, we examined geochemical data from a publicly available Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) database. The data consist of over 17,000 samples from 4,756 unique surface and groundwater locations collected since 1990, representing one of the most extensive databases of groundwater quality in relation to oil and gas development anywhere. Following rigorous data QA/QC, we classified groundwater samples with respect to major ion composition and compared the assigned water “types” along with other geochemical parameters to methane concentrations and carbon isotopes in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) and Piceance Basins in Colorado. 88% of samples with elevated methane (defined as > 1 mg L-1) were classified as Na-HCO3 type in the DJ basin and 78% were classified as either Na-HCO3 or Na-Cl type in the Piceance basin. Of the elevated methane samples, 96% and 69% in the DJ and Piceance basins respectively had microbial gas signatures, as determined by d13C values < - 60 ‰. Samples with elevated methane concentrations had higher pH, higher concentrations of chloride and sodium and lower concentrations of calcium in both the DJ and Piceance Basin. Elevated methane concentrations were predominately microbial in origin and correlated to indicators of increased water-rock interactions and anaerobic groundwater conditions, indicating that methane observed in these groundwater samples are largely a result of natural processes. Rare occurrences of stray thermogenic gas (d13C > 55 ‰, gas wetness > 5 % C2+ hydrocarbons) were most frequently associated with the Na-HCO3 water type in the DJ basin (67% of occurrences) and were randomly distributed across water types in the Piceance Basin. Investigation of natural and anthropogenic causes for the presence of methane is ongoing, using the full suite of water quality parameters contained in the COGCC database, combined with information on underlying geological frameworks and industry infrastructure. With these data, we are working towards a more complete and objective understanding of the effects of oil and gas operations on regional groundwater quality.",

We measured organic aerosol (OA) of nascent and aged (4 h) smoke from the Williams Fire during the 2009 airborne San Luis Obispo Biomass Burning Campaign (SLOBB). The net ΔOA/ΔCO2 decreased by ~20%; however, positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of the organic mass spectra supports two factors that enable the OA emissions to be separated into fresh and oxidized OA. The Δfresh BBOA/ΔCO2 had a steeper decline than the ΔOA/ΔCO2 consistent with outgassing of semi-voltile organic compounds (SVOCs) due to dilution, whereas the Δoxidized BBOA/ΔCO2 increased from its initial value, consist with formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). We compare these fresh and oxidized mass spectral signatures, along with chaparral smoke samples measured in the Missoula Fire Lab, to ground-based aerosol measurements made during the Station Fire that occurred one month earlier than the Williams Fire during the Pasadena Aerosol Characterization Observatory Campaign (PACO). Night and daytime aerosol smoke emissions were sampled for one week during the Station Fire. Daytime organic aerosol smoke emissions exhibited larger variability both in mass concentration and composition than nighttime smoke emissions. Both levoglucosan and potassium, known biomass burning tracers, were measured and had distinct time series, supporting diversity in the flaming vs. smoldering initial burning conditions. Similar to the Williams Fire, PMF of the Station Fire mass spectra also reveal two biomass burning factors, one that is less oxidized and correlates strongly with levoglucosan measurements and one that is heavily oxidized and correlates in time with the potassium signal. These two campaigns have allowed us to probe fresh and oxidized smoke in both night and daytime conditions, and PMF results have revealed that at least two emission factors are useful to describe OA smoke emissions.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is an exemplar of the need for improved cyberinfrastructure for its vast holdings of invaluable physical geoscience data. Millions of discrete paleobiological and geological specimens lie in USGS warehouses and at the Smithsonian Institution. These specimens serve as the basis for many geologic maps and geochemical databases, and are a potential treasure trove of new scientific knowledge. The extent of this treasure is virtually unknown and inaccessible outside a small group of paleogeoscientists and geochemists. A team from the USGS, the Integrated Earth Data Applications (IEDA) facility, and the Paleobiology Database (PBDB) are working to expose information on paleontological and geochemical specimens for discovery by scientists and citizens. This project uses existing infrastructure of the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) and PBDB, which already contains much of the fundamental data schemas that are necessary to accommodate USGS records. The project is also developing a new Linked Data interface for the USGS National Geochemical Database (NGDB). The International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) is the identifier that links samples between all systems.\nFor paleontological specimens, SESAR and PBDB will be the primary repositories for USGS records, with a data syncing process to archive records within the USGS ScienceBase system. The process began with mapping the metadata fields necessary for USGS collections to the existing SESAR and PBDB data structures, while aligning them with the Observations & Measurements and Darwin Core standards. New functionality needed in SESAR included links to a USGS locality registry, fossil classifications, a spatial qualifier attribution for samples with sensitive locations, and acknowledgement of data and metadata licensing. The team is developing a harvesting mechanism to periodically transfer USGS records from within PBDB and SESAR to ScienceBase. For the NGDB, the samples are being registered with IGSNs in SESAR and the geochemical data are being published as Linked Data. This system allows the USGS collections to benefit from disciplinary and institutional strengths of the participating resources, while simultaneously increasing the discovery, accessibility, and citation of USGS physical collection holdings.",

            "abstract": "The effect of ocean mixed layer depth on climate is explored in a suite of slab ocean aquaplanet simulations with different mixed layer depths ranging from a globally uniform value of 50–2.4 m. In addition to the expected increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in temperature with decreasing ocean mixed layer depth, the simulated climates differ in several less intuitive ways including fundamental changes in the annual mean climate.\nThe phase of seasonal cycle in temperature differs non-monotonically with increasing ocean mixed layer depth, reaching a maximum in the 12 m slab depth simulation. This result is a consequence of the change in the source of the seasonal heating of the atmosphere across the suite of simulations. For ocean depth less than 12 m, the seasonal heating of the atmosphere is dominated by the surface energy fluxes which are lagged with respect to the insolation due to storage in the oceanic column. In contrast, in the deep ocean runs, the seasonal heating is dominated by direct shortwave absorption within the atmospheric column which is in phase with insolation. Thus the total heating comes back in phase with the insolation as the ocean deepens.\nThe intertropical convergence zone follows the seasonally varying insolation and maximum sea surface temperatures into the summer hemisphere in the shallow ocean runs whereas it stays fairly close to the equator in the deep ocean runs. As a consequence, the tropical precipitation and region of high planetary albedo is spread more broadly across the low latitudes in the shallow runs, resulting in an apparent expansion of the tropics relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the global and annual mean planetary albedo is substantially (20 %) higher in the shallow ocean simulations which results in a colder (7C) global and annual mean surface temperature. The increased tropical planetary albedo in the shallow ocean simulations also results in a decreased equator-to-pole gradient in absorbed shortwave radiation and drives a severely reduced (50 %) meridional energy transport relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the atmospheric eddies are weakened and shifted poleward (away from the high albedo tropics) and the eddy driven jet is also reduced and shifted poleward by 15° relative to the deep ocean run.",

            "abstract": "Modeling heat transfer in porous media has numerous industrial and biological applications. Natural porous structures which can be found in many geological and biological systems are complex and generally heterogeneous over a wide range of length scales. The ability of multicomponent media to transfer heat at the continuum scale depends directly on the transport of heat through interfaces between the different constituents. Therefore constraining heat and also mass balance at a macroscopic level depends on the development of quantitative models that account for the processes occurring at smaller scales. Consequently, one needs to deal with several temporal and spatial scales which makes modeling of transport phenomena a complicated task.\nIn the present study, we first investigate thermal transport in natural heterogeneous structures at the discrete scale. We introduce a new and simple lattice Boltzmann formulation which handles conjugate thermal boundary conditions at interfaces between two phases/components. Verification of the present interface treatment on benchmark problems confirms the accuracy and simplicity of the proposed approach. The model’s implementation is independent of the interface geometry and provides a powerful method to model thermal transport in heterogeneous media with random microstructures. Because we are ultimately interested in developing macroscale (homogenized) conservation laws for heterogeneous media, we introduce a macroscopic thermal model based on variable-order (VO) time and space derivatives. The proposed thermal model maps the heterogeneities in temporal and spatial scales into the order of the fractional derivative, which allows us to steer away from a classical diffusion equation for complex heterogeneous media. We then verify the VO thermal model for benchmark problems and discuss the possible links between values of VO derivatives in the new conservation equation and microstructure through spatial correlation functions.",

            "abstract": "A suite of basalts to rhyolites recovered from the Alarcon Rise, the northern extension of the intermediate spreading-rate East Pacific Rise, provides an unparalleled test of established mechanisms for high-Si lava formation at ridges. Rhyolites are ≤35% phyric and poorly vesicular. Mafic xenoclasts are common, and plagioclase is the dominant phase. Olivine and clinopyroxene are also common, and orthopyroxene, FeTi-oxides, zircon, and rare pyrite blebs are present. Major and trace element glass data are consistent with MELTS models of fractional crystallization from a parental melt, but a diverse mineral population records added complexity. Olivine and plagioclase compositions are broadly consistent with models, with the exception of more variable Fo52-77 and An87-28 in a basaltic andesitic composition where pigeonite is predicted to replace olivine in the crystallizing assemblage between ~1085-1015°C; pigeonites analyzed in an andesite have lower Ca and Fe than predicted. Clinopyroxene variability generally increases with host melt SiO2, from Mg# 86-84 in basalts to Mg# 80-21 in rhyolites, and zoning is common with higher-MgO anhedral cores mantled by lower-MgO euhedral rims. Cooler magmas aided the preservation of disequilibrium and are supported by ~715-835°C Ti-in-zircon and ilmenite-magnetite thermometry in rhyolites. Despite a well-predicted liquid line of decent, multiple signals of chemical disequilibrium in intermediate to silicic melts support mixing of magmatic batches and/or assimilation of partially hydrous crust. Assimilation is permissible given δ18O values that are lower than expected solely from fractional crystallization (i.e., <6.3‰ at 77% SiO2), but assimilation extent is limited on the basis of δD ~82±8 and Pacific MORB-like 87Sr/86Sr. Zircon Hf-isotopes and trace element patterns support a juvenile oceanic crustal source. Whereas depleted Pacific MORB mantle source reservoir is supported by whole rock Sr-Nd isotopes, slight enrichments in zircon 176Hf/177Hf and whole rock 207,206Pb/204Pb may indicate an enriched MORB mantle component. In conclusion, mid-ocean rhyolite at Alarcon formed from a variety of petrogenetic processes including magma-mixing, assimilation, and crystallization following partial melting of slightly heterogeneous mantle source(s).",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration varies seasonally as driven by biospheric productivity. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle strongly depends on location, especially latitude, because it is indicative of the local biospheric CO2 fluxes but also a result of atmospheric transport. The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) provides global data on column-averaged CO2 concentrations (XCO2) and now, after five years of operation, makes it possible to regionally estimate the amplitude of the XCO2 seasonal cycles. However, satellite-retrieved XCO2 can be subject to biases in the retrieval system, and these potential biases are best identified through validation against ground-based measurements and model data.\nIn this study, we quantitatively evaluate the XCO2 seasonal cycle of GOSAT observations from the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) retrieval system, and compare the regional seasonal cycles to those directly measured by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) stations and those predicted by several carbon cycle models (e.g., MACC, CarbonTracker) that assimilate in situ measurements. We extend the analysis with a look to the latitudinal dependence of the seasonal cycle amplitude throughout the northern hemisphere. Although preliminary results show a generally good agreement between models and both satellite and surface observations, they also unveil some surprisingly large discrepancies between the biosphere models, and up to 10% differences in the seasonal cycle amplitudes seen by TCCON and GOSAT. This validation study lays ground work to the analysis of OCO-2 observations that also utilize the ACOS retrieval system, and are anticipated to be a major source of information on local XCO2 seasonal cycles in the near future.",

            "abstract": "Quaternary mountain glaciations have greatly modified landscape and sediment production, especially after the Mid Pleistocene Transition. However, the impact of increased glacigenic sediment yields on continental margin sedimentation is poorly documented during this period in which eustasy is proposed as the dominant control on margin development. We study the provenance of sediment accumulated in the continental shelf during the Late Pleistocene, by performing 40Ar/39Ar geochronology of the bulk silt-size fraction on sediment samples from three sites drilled during IODP Expedition 317 to Canterbury Basin, New Zealand. The results show ages that range from 25 to 90 Ma, which are significantly younger than the cooling ages of the potential rock sources (>100 Ma). Bedrock cooling ages similar to our results are found adjacent to the Main Divide Fault Zone, located near the main drainage divide in Central Southern Alps. This suggests that a large proportion of sediment accumulating in the continental shelf is sourced in this region of highest elevation and maximum glacial erosion. Sediment bulk ages in the cores show younger ages up-section, suggesting that contribution of young sediment has increased and/or that glaciers have eroded younger rocks with time. In addition, sediment ages are younger in the most landward site, while the most offshore site observes young ages later indicating that the input of young sediment across the continental shelf is progressive, likely by means of sediment reworking during sea level transgression and shoreline migration during sea level fall. We propose that sediment transfer from source to sink occurs in steps in which sediment undergoes several cycles of transport and storage until final accumulation. Glacial erosion plays a very important role in this sedimentary system, supplying sediment that is likely eroded in a zone of rock weakness. The age signature of the muddy sediment accumulating in the continental shelf likely reflects Late Pleistocene landscape evolution in the Southern Alps.",

            "abstract": "We examine the influence of the SORCE (Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment) SIM (Spectral Irradiance Monitor) observed spectral solar irradiance (SSI) variations on Earth’s climate. We apply two reconstructed spectral solar forcing scenarios, one SIM based, the other based on the SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance REconstruction) model, as inputs to the GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) GCMAM (Global Climate Middle Atmosphere Model) to examine the climate responses on decadal and centennial time scales. We show that the atmosphere has different temperature, ozone, and dynamic responses to the two solar spectral forcing scenarios, even when the variations in TSI (Total Solar Irradiance) are the same. We find that solar variations under either scenario contribute a small fraction of the observed temperature increase since the industrial revolution. The trend of global averaged surface air temperature response to the SIM-based solar forcing is 0.02 °C/century, about half of the temperature trend to the SATIRE-based SSI. However the temporal variation of the surface air temperature for the SIM-based solar forcing scenario is much larger compared to its SATIRE counterpart. Further research is required to examine TSI and SSI variations in the ascending phase of solar cycle 24, to assess their implications for the solar influence on climate.",

For the last 10-15 years, CP El Nino has been more frequently observed than EP El Nino. The atmospheric dynamics and different effects of the two types of El Nino on local climate have been extensively studied while the corresponding ocean dynamics under the sea surface have been less explored. Using SODA 2.2.4 dataset, we investigate how the subsurface water temperature is differentiated during two types of El Nino, especially focusing on onset and termination of the El Nino. We found that CP and EP El Nino have different origins of subsurface warm water over western Pacific Ocean. And we also show that subsurface cold water along the equator plays a role in terminating the both types of El Nino. The relationship between the subsurface water and wind stress curl is investigated to see whether the ocean-atmospheric teleconnections have different dynamics during CP and EP El Nino. This study will provide better understanding on the CP and EP El Nino dynamics especially under the sea surface and the subsurface dynamics can be exploited as one of the predictors of the El Nino events.",

There are 3 components:\nbiotechnology and nanotechnology, space science, and marine and environmental science. The talk\nwill focus on the space science component. Mornings are spent in group projects that include\nadvanced high school classes, laboratories, and demonstrations while afternoons are spent with the\nUNH space physics faculty involved in actual research projects that are at the core of the faculty\ninterests and efforts. As a group they learn to build electronic circuits, study core physics\nquestions from momentum to relativity, and construct the payload for a high-altitude weather\nballoon that is launched at the end of the third week. This year's payload included cameras,\ntemperature sensors, a miniaturized Geiger counter, a sun sensor, a prototype UV and IR spectrometer,\nGPS, onboard central computer and power bus, and communications. While the balloon payload is a\nlot of fun, it also provides a focus for a wide range of physics and engineering issues that can\nbe incorporated into high school physics education. We have also pioneered the use of descent\nvehicles that do not require parachutes. The research projects spanned the range from magnetometer\nboom design and testing, energetic particle distributions in the magnetosphere, coronal mass ejections,\nthe heliospheric magnetic field, magnetic reconnection, etc. At the end of the month the students\npresent their work in a poster session attended by the UNH faculty.

The regional climate is downscaled using a Regional Earth System Model (RESM) with boundary conditions provided by CESM historical simulation and future projections following the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios at 20km resolution, and then bias-corrected to 0.125 degrees (~12km) resolution. The LULC change projections from a sub-national version of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) that resolves state-level details of the U.S. (GCAM-USA) are also downscaled to 0.05 degree resolution for the RCP scenarios and then aggregated to 0.125 degree resolution for input to CLM.\nCLM is first run over 1975-2004 using the GCAM-USA downscaled LULC for year 2005 to simulate the hydrologic conditions in the historical period. For each RCP scenario, two CLM simulations are configured, one with the GCAM-USA downscaled LULC for the base year (i.e., 2005), the other with the time-varying GCAM-USA downscaled LULC projection from year 2005 to 2095 ingested at an annual time step, and both driven by the RESM downscaled climate. By analyzing key terrestrial hydrologic budget terms, such as runoff, evapotranspiration, root-zone soil moisture, and total terrestrial water storage, in response to simultaneous changes in climate and LULC versus climate alone, this study aims to provide insights to the relative impacts of climate and LULC changes on hydrologic processes and water resources in the U.S.",

            "abstract": "Lateral subsurface flow plays a significant role in redistributing soil water which has a direct effect on biological, chemical, and geomorphologic processes in root zone. However, most of the land surface models (LSMs) are neglecting the horizontal exchanges of water at the grid or subgrid scales, focusing only on the vertical exchanges of entities including water as one-dimensional process. Topography and hydrologic properties are the main controls on the vertical and lateral subsurface flow in heterogeneous land surface. Thus, in this study, we designed three cases to consider the lateral subsurface flow in unsaturated zone using a land surface model (Community Land Model, CLM): Case 1 is to consider only surface topography for the entire soil column, Case 2 is to consider surface topography in upper soil layers and heterogeneous soil hydraulic properties between the soil columns (using uniform anisotropy for lateral hydraulic conductivity) in lower soil layers, and Case 3 is also to consider surface topography and heterogeneous soil hydraulic properties but using spatially distributed anisotropy derived from hydrologic connectivity which can be created by physical controls (e.g., soil type, vegetation cover) at a watershed scale. The results of this study indicated that all of the cases improved the subsurface flow in unsaturated zone compared to the results of original model, especially representing the best performance in the case 3. Hence, this approach could characterize the spatially distributed patterns of subsurface flow and improve a simulation of the hydrologic cycle.",

            "abstract": "Time-lapse three-dimensional seismic surveys have been acquired to monitor the\nevolution of CO2 injected into the Utsira formation at the Sleipner field. The changing\npattern of reflectivity shows that CO2 is accumulating beneath nine impermeable shale\nhorizons. Areal extents of all CO2-filled horizons have been mapped on surveys up\nto 2010, revealing a distinctive change in growth pattern eight years after injection\ncommenced in 1996. Post 2004, five of the nine layers appear to exhibit either no increase\nor a decrease in areal extent. Volumetric measurements of thin CO2 layers (i.e. less than\n∼15 m thick) are difficult to obtain because of tuning effects. However, a combination of\ntravel-time pull-up and reflection amplitude permits improved thickness estimates to be\nmade for the shallowest layer (i.e. layer 9). Travel-time pull-up and amplitude both vary\nnon-linearly with CO2 layer thickness, yielding non-unique solutions when individually\ncorrelated. However, these attributes have different tuning thicknesses, permitting the\nvolume of CO2 beneath layer 9 to be calculated without ambiguity when combined. We\nhave also analyzed the structure of the bounding upper and lower shale units for layer 9\nand the thickness of sandstone between them. We found that CO2 in layer 9 can occupy\nup to half the depth of this sandstone unit. Numerical modelling of gravity currents in\nvariably confined aquifers suggests that the flow of CO2 through thin sedimentary units\nis affected by the proximity of the lower boundary.",

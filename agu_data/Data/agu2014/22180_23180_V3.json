            "abstract": "Experimental data were collected over a year-long period in a transport experiment carried out within a controlled transport volume (represented by a 2m-deep, 1m-diameter lysimeter fitted with bottom drainage). The soil surface was shielded from natural rainfall, replaced by an artificial injection (Poisson process) at the daily timescale. Bottom drainage out-flows were continuously monitored with leakage tipping bucket and evapotranspiration (prompted by a willow tree growing within the system) was measured trough precision load cells, which also allow an accurate and continuous reading of the total water storage. Five artificial soluble tracers (species of fluorobenzoic acid, FBAs, mutually passive) were selected based on low-reactivity and low-retardation in our specific soil and used to individually mark five rainfall inputs of different amplitudes and occurring at various initial soil moisture conditions. Tracer discharge concentration and hydrologic fluxes measurements provide a direct method for the assessment of the bulk effects of transport on the (backward and forward) travel time distributions in the hydrological setting. The large discrepancies observed in terms of mass recovery in the discharge (supported by ex post FBAs quantification in the soil and in the vegetation) and tracer out-fluxes dynamics emphasized the dependence of the forward travel time on the various injection times and the stages experienced by the system during the migration of the pulse. Rescaling the measured travel time distribution by using the cumulative drainage volume as an independent variable instead of the time elapsed since the injection also fails to yield to stationary distributions, as it was argued by Niemi (1997). Our experimental results support earlier theoretical speculations centered on the key role of non-stationarity on the characterization of the properties of hydrologic flow and transport phenomena. A travel time based model, with all in- and out- hydrological fluxes imposed by the experimental measurements, could accurately reproduce the large divergences of the five tracers’ behavior and recovery, using adequate assumptions on the mixing processes occurring within the controlled volume, thus discrediting simple plug-flow (old-water first) and well-mixed processes which fail at this aim.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved neodymium (Nd) isotopes (expressed as εNd) have been widely used as a water mass tracer to reconstruct paleo ocean circulation. However, the marine geochemical cycle of Nd is not well understood. Unclear input mechanisms, scarcity of available data, and observed decoupling between dissolved εNd and Nd concentration patterns ([Nd]) are only a few of the unresolved issues. The latter is often referred to as the Nd paradox(e.g. Goldstein and Hemming 2003).\nHere we revisit this paradox with an unprecedented data set on particulate Nd isotope and concentration data from five stations along the Dutch GEOTRACES transect GA02 in the western North and equatorial Atlantic Ocean (cruises 64PE319 and 64PE321 from April to July 2010). Particulates were collected with in-situ pumps on 0.8 µm Supor filters and subjected to a total digestion procedure in the home laboratory.\nThe particulates collected farthest north (Irminger Sea and Labrador Sea) show a strong affinity to the nearby land masses in their Nd isotope composition: Very negative values (εNd ≈-20) are observed in the Labrador Sea, which is surrounded by old continental rocks. More positive values of up to εNd ≈-4 are found east of Greenland probably derived from the Nansen Fjord Formation’s basaltic rocks. In these two areas the particulate εNd is offset from dissolved Nd isotopes by up to 7.7 ε-units, but reveals a similar vertical distribution. Further downstream of the flow path of the North Atlantic Deep Water, dissolved and particulate Nd isotopic compositions in the water column seem to merge and become indistinguishable from one another south of Bermuda (BATS station). This seems to indicate that particulate and dissolved fractions exchange with increasing distance from source regions and age of water masses. Neodymium concentrations in particulates [pNd] are low (KD<5%) and invariant. However, most stations show a significant increase in [pNd] close to the seafloor, where [pNd] nearly matches [dNd].\nOur new data set provides invaluable information towards addressing the Nd paradox as it constitutes the first regional data set on combined Nd concentrations and isotopes in particulate and dissolved samples.\n",

            "abstract": "The role of solar activity changes in climate variations is a matter of continuous debate. Due to the relatively short period of direct observations sun-climate studies benefit from long-term proxy based evidence of past solar variability during different climate regimes. The most reliable recorders of past solar activity are cosmogenic radionuclides such as 10Be and 14C whose atmospheric production rates are modulated by the strength of the solar and geo- magnetic fields. Since paleo-archives of 10Be and 14C carry additional signals of climatic influences on their respective geochemical cycles a combined analysis of both radionuclides leads to improved solar activity reconstructions. However, reconstructions of past solar activity have so far been largely limited to the Holocene due to the lack of high resolution 10Be and 14C data further back in time. Here we present a solar activity reconstruction for the end of the last glacial based on high-resolution 10Be data from the GRIP ice core supported by 14C records from tree rings and speleothems, providing evidence for solar forcing of Greenland climate during the last glacial maximum (LGM). We find that centennial solar activity variations during the end of the last glacial have been comparable to the Holocene in both patterns and amplitudes. We see evidence for a persistent solar influence on North Atlantic atmospheric circulation during the LGM. Analysis of modern observations and high-top chemistry-climate model experiments suggests that this solar influence can be explained by favorable conditions for the occurrence of high pressure blocking situations south of Greenland during solar minima. This suggests that a similar solar forcing mechanism as today may have been active under a very different climatic setting.",

            "abstract": "We examine the relation of Rossby-Wave-Trains (RWTs) and cyclones in the North Atlantic. Extra-tropical cyclones are known to have high socioeconomic impacts (high windspeed and large amounts of precipitation). Long lived RWTs have been shown to be precursors for extreme events. Therefore they may impact the predictability of mid-latitude (extreme) weather systems. Current results point at the following relationship: The weakening or dissolving of a long lived RWT that was prevalent over the U.S. and the eastern Pacific for up to 5 days facilitates the genesis of a cyclone downstream - in the whole North Atlantic. In turn, the temporal and spacial coincidence of a newly developing or rather reinforcing RWT off the western coast of Europe and these pre-existing cyclone leads to a strengthening of the cyclone and triggers an explosive development just off the European coast. We apply automated schemes for the identification and tracking of RWTs and cyclones, respectively and relate their characteristics, with a focus on the impact for European climate. By evaluating reanalysis and model data of historical/uninitialized hindcast simulations, we aim to identify spatio-temporal connections between these objectively identified RWTs and cyclones. We then evaluate the interplay of RWT and cyclones in initialized hindcasts and a two way nested (TWN) model simulation. All named simulations are part of the MiKlip project (decadal climate prediction; funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research - BMBF). We also evaluate the decadal variability of cyclones and RWTs in the MiKlip simulations. For our TWN model setup, the regional climate model COSMO-CLM (CCLM) is nested into the atmosphere- ocean general circulation model ECHAM6/MPI-OM (MPI-ESM) in order to investigate the feedback of the meso-scales on the large scales and vice versa. Focus is laid on the development and propagation of synoptic systems (e.g. Rossby Wave Trains and cyclones) that are affecting Europe. The Two-Way-Nested region, thus the CCLM domain, covers Central America and the North Atlantic (CANA) and therefore includes the Gulf stream region, whose prevalent strong meridional SST gradients favor the development of perturbations which then propagate downstream, commonly develop into extra-tropical cyclones and strike Europe.",

            "abstract": "We present recent results concerning the extraction of Green’s functions from coda waves.\nCampillo and Paul 2003 used earthquakes codas and found that the causal and anticausal parts of the cross-correlation are asymmetrical for some stations, depending on the earthquake source region.\nThe lapse time in the coda window is a key parameter to understand causal to anticausal amplitude ratio. We show that this ratio result from the competition between the source signature (non-symmetric cross-correlations when the distribution of sources is non-isotropic around the receivers) and the scattering processes which tend to restore the time symmetry of the correlations.\nThe theoretical analysis is derived from wave propagation theory for single scattering and multiple scattering as initiated by Roux 2005. We propose to use the temporal evolution of cross-correlation function amplitude in coda waves to estimate the value of the mean free path in the propagation medium.\nThe equipartition of the energy is clearly observed in the numerical simulations conducted in a two-dimensional acoustic medium. The cross-correlations between the distinct time windows in synthetic coda records at two points are measured for a set of events for which we obtain a good estimate of the medium mean free path.\nWe perform the same analysis on a set of icequakes recorded at Mount Erebus. The correlations averaged over sources and time exhibit a temporal evolution that obeys to convergence patterns similar to those observed in numerical studies.",

            "abstract": "Climate change and growing population are expected to severely affect freshwater availability by the end of 21th century. Many river basins, especially in the Mediterranean region, are likely to become more prone to periods of reduced water supply, risking considerable impacts on the society, the environment, and the economy, thus emphasizing the need to rethink the way water resources are distributed, managed, and used at the regional and river basin scale. This paradigm shift will be essential to cope with the undergoing global change, characterized by growing water demands and by increasingly uncertain hydrologic regimes.\nMost of the literature traditionally focused on predicting the impacts of climate change on water resources, while our understanding of the human footprint on the hydrological cycle is limited. For example, changes in the operation of the Alpine hydropower reservoirs induced by socio-economic drivers (e.g., development of renewable energy) were already observed over the last few years and produced relevant impacts on multiple water uses due to the altered distribution of water volumes in time and space. Modeling human decisions as well as the links between society and environmental systems becomes key to develop reliable projections on the co-evolution of the coupled human-water systems and deliver robust adaptation strategies\nThis work contributes a preliminary model-based analysis of the behaviour of hydropower operators under changing energy market and climate conditions. The proposed approach is developed for the San Giacomo-Cancano reservoir system, Italy. The identification of the current operating policy is supported by input variable selection methods to select the most relevant hydrological and market based drivers to explain the observed release time series.. The identified model is then simulated under a set of future scenarios, accounting for both climate and socio-economic change (e.g. expansion of the electric vehicle sector, load balancing from renewable energy), to eventually estimate the impacts on the multi-sector services involved (i.e., hydropower, flood protection, irrigation supply). Preliminary results show that the magnitude of the socio-economic change impacts is comparable with the one induced by climate change.",

            "abstract": "Numerical studies of mantle convection have attempted to explain tomographic observations that reveal a lower mantle dominated by broad regional areas of lower-than-average shear-wave speeds beneath Africa and the Central Pacific. Termed LLSVPs (“large low shear velocity provinces”), the anomalous regions are often inferred to be thermochemical structures encircled by regions of higher-than-average shear-wave speeds associated with Mesozoic and Cenozoic subduction zones. Geochemical inferences of multiple chemical reservoirs at depth, strong seismic contrasts, an anti-correlation of shear-wave velocity to bulk sound velocity and increased density in the anomalous regions support a thermochemical origin for the LLSVPs. The origin and long-term evolution of the anomalous regions remains enigmatic. It has been proposed that the LLSVP beneath Africa was not present before 200 Ma (i.e. before and during most of the life-time of the supercontinent Pangea), prior to which time the lower mantle was dominated by a degree-1 convection pattern with a major upwelling centred close to the present-day Pacific LLSVP and subduction concentrated mainly in the antipodal hemisphere. The African LLSVP would thus have formed during the time-frame of the supercontinent Pangea as a result of return flow in the mantle due to circum-Pacific subduction. We present new results from a geodynamic-seismology study that investigates the hypothesis that the Pacific LLSVP is indeed much older than its antipodal counterpart by performing 3D numerical models of mantle convection integrated with a new plate tectonic history model. We improve upon previous studies by imposing kinematic surface velocity boundary conditions for a time interval that spans the amalgamation and subsequent break-up of Pangea and by allowing for a lateral heterogeneity difference between the African and the Pacific LLSVP. Our results are distinct from those of previous studies in several important ways: our plate model explicitly includes (i) absolute longitudinal reconstructions and (ii) TPW-correction, (iii) our model extends back to the mid-Paleozoic (410 Ma) and (iii) we include lateral compositional variations between the two antipodal LLSVPs.",

            "abstract": "A new methodology has been developed to measure horizontal groundwater velocities in unconsolidated aquifers. Groundwater velocities are measured with a heat tracer experiment. Temperature is measured along fiber optic cables using a Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) system. Fiber optic cables and a separate heating cable are pushed into the ground to depths of tens of meters. The groundwater is heated with the heating cable and the response is measured along several nearby fiber optic cables. The measured temperature responses are used to estimate the distribution of the magnitude and direction of the horizontal groundwater velocity over the entire depth of the cables. The methodology has been applied in a phreatic aquifer in the dune area along the Dutch coast. Significant variations of groundwater velocities with depth were observed even though the dune sand is relatively homogeneous. Major advantages of the new methodology are that the fiber optic cables are in direct contact with the groundwater and that the cables and installation are relatively cheap. No expensive boreholes are needed and consequently measurements are not affected by movement and mixing of water inside a borehole.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the surface emissivity is essential for retrieving surface skin temperature (Ts), a key parameter for understanding and modeling the surface energy budget, from satellite remote sensors. For a given region, land and ocean Ts is observed at a constant viewing zenith angle (VZA) by any geostationary satellite (GEOsat) imager. Emission from the surface and, hence, Ts is VZA-dependent, varying by 6 K or more with increasing VZA. Although commonly ignored, it has been established that methodologies for angular normalization of Ts are needed to better understand surface emissivity and reduce errors in Ts retrievals. In order to develop corrections for the VZA-dependence of Ts from GEOsats, inter-calibrated GEOsat and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are collocated, in time and space, for clear scenes observed at different viewing and illumination angles. The radiances in these temporally and spatially matched datasets are used to retrieve coincident Ts using the same one-channel retrieval algorithm, by which Ts is computed from the observed 11-μm brightness temperature (T11) through application of atmospheric absorption corrections appropriate for that spectral channel. Matches from the two instruments are used to build an empirical model that describes the dependence of Ts on VZA by calculating the radiance differences between the near-nadir views and off-nadir data. With matched T11 data from GOES-East, GOES-West, and Aqua-MODIS for North and South America, an adjustment can be computed using matched pairs, for which the Aqua-MODIS VZA is set less than 5º. Applying this correction to the same GOES data removes the angle dependence. Errors are assessed using independent matched land surface temperature datasets from Terra- and Aqua-MODIS and in situ measurements from SURFRAD. The approach can be used to develop corrections for each GEOsat, and should also be applicable to low-Earth orbit satellites. These corrections will be valuable for improving estimates of instantaneous surface emissivity, surface radiation, and surface heat exchange in observations and models.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas induced climate change will modify the physical conditions of the atmosphere. One of the projected changes is an acceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation in the stratosphere, as it has been shown in many model studies. This change in the stratospheric circulation consequently bears an effect on the transport and distribution of atmospheric components such as N2O. Since N2O is involved in ozone destruction, a modified distribution of N2O can be of importance for ozone chemistry. N2O is inert in the troposphere and decays only in the stratosphere. Thus, changes in the exchange between troposphere and stratosphere can also affect the stratospheric sink of N2O, and consequently its atmospheric lifetime. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of currently approximately 300 CO2-equivalents in a 100-year perspective. A faster decay in atmospheric N2O mixing ratios, i.e. a decreased atmospheric lifetime of N2O, will also reduce its global warming potential.\nIn order to assess the impact of climate change on atmospheric circulation and implied effects on the distribution and lifetime of atmospheric N2O, we apply the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model, MPI-ESM. MPI-ESM consists of the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM, the land surface model JSBACH, and MPIOM/HAMOCC representing ocean circulation and ocean biogeochemistry. Prognostic atmospheric N2O concentrations in MPI-ESM are determined by land N2O emissions, ocean-atmosphere N2O exchange and atmospheric tracer transport. As stratospheric chemistry is not explicitly represented in MPI-ESM, stratospheric decay rates of N2O are prescribed from a MACC MOZART simulation.\nIncreasing surface temperatures and CO2 concentrations in the stratosphere impact atmospheric circulation differently. Thus, we conduct a series of transient runs with the atmospheric model of MPI-ESM to isolate different factors governing a shift in atmospheric circulation. From those transient simulations we diagnose decreasing tropospheric N2O concentrations, increased transport of N2O from the troposphere to the stratosphere, and increasing stratospheric decay of N2O leading to a reduction in atmospheric lifetime of N2O, in dependency to climate change evolution.",

            "abstract": "We are studying the ocean biogeochemistry during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 55 million years ago) with an Earth System Model (ESM). During this period of abrupt environmental change the climate underwent a significant transformation within short geological timescales (~10 ky). The PETM is globally recorded in proxy-data by a negative δ13C carbon isotope excursion and carbonate dissolution in the ocean, suggesting that the occurred warming was caused by massive carbon release. To investigate the marine biogeochemistry before and during the onset of the PETM we use the ESM of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology to simulate scenarios with different rates of carbon release over several thousand years. Starting from an already warmer background climate than present, the atmospheric CO2 increase and concomitant warming lead to acidification and deoxygenation of mid and deep ocean waters. Our results indicate that a weakening of deep water formation, caused by global warming, plays a major role in producing inhospitable conditions for benthic organisms during the PETM. We show how the interaction between biological and physical responses to the carbon perturbation lead to the observed calcite sediment dissolution in the deep ocean. At the surface a weakening of the physical and biological carbon pump restricts the oceanic uptake capacity of atmospheric CO2 which helps to maintain elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures throughout the event.",

The annual frequencies of earthquakes in a fault zone are determined or extrapolated by magnitude-frequency distributions of earthquakes (Gutenberg-Richter law) of the zone. Given moment (or magnitude) of an earthquake, we first synthesize patterns of differently complex and heterogeneous slip distributions on the fault using stochastic model. Assuming the slip and stress drop distribution are processes of fractional Brownian motion and described by Hurt exponent. According to ω-2 model of earthquakes and following Fourier transform, slip distributions of earthquake are determined by randomly distributing phase spectrum of those with greater than corner wave number kc.

The sensitivity to these criteriais tested by varying the metrics and weights assigned to them. Sensitivity of metrics to observational uncertainty is also examined at regional, sub-regional and grid point levels.",

            "abstract": "Sediments in the foreland basin of the Pamir-Tianshan collision zone provide a rich record of the Cenozoic collision between the Pamir and the Tianshan. Recently, several authors studied the provenance of sediments in the foreland of the Pamir and Tian Shan using detrital zircon U-Pb dating (Bershaw et al., 2012；Sun et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013). Statistical analysis of bedrock U-Pb ages from the Pamir and Tianshan (e.g. Schwab et al., 2004; Lukens et al., 2012) yield distinct age spectra and indicate that almost all the ages from Pamir are no more than 250 Ma, whereas almost all the ages from Tianshan are more than 250 Ma. Additional provenance studies from different sedimentary sections will allow a more detailed description of collision processes.\nWe collected 13 sediment samples from major streams draining the Pamir and the Tianshan on the western margin of the Tarim Basin to analyze the modern detrital zircon signature of the two orogens. We also collected 35 samples for provenance analysis from the Cenozoic sediments of Bieertuokuoyi section which crops out in the hanging wall of Pamir Frontal Thrust (PFT).\nPreliminary results from 4 modern streams draining the Tianshan show two prominent age peaks at 240-300 Ma and 400-490 Ma. Two modern samples from rivers draining the Pamir have prominent peaks at 230-270 Ma and 280-330 Ma.\nEach of the 10 samples from the Bieertuokuoyi section that has been analyzed yields U-Pb ages that are consistent with a mixed provenance from the Tianshan and the Pamir, but the relative contribution of two orogens changes throughout the section. In the late Paleocene a higher contribution comes from the Tianshan followed by a dominant middle Pamir signature during the early-middle Eocene. Minimum U-Pb ages constrain the depositional age of this part of the section to less than~47 Ma. We interpret contrasting provenance signatures as representing changes in the relative rate of rock uplift and denudation of these orogens. In the Late Eocene and the Middle Miocene, age spectra are suggestive of increased activity in the northern Pamir with an intervening quiet period from Oligocene through Early Miocene. In the Late Miocene, thrusting in the hanging wall of PFT begins and the Tianshan starts to deform rapidly.",

            "abstract": "Models for the nelsonite formation are currently highly contentious, with liquid immiscibility and fractional crystallization as frequently proposed formation mechanisms. The nelsonites in the Damiao massif anorthosite complex in the North China Craton and experimental evidence are revisited for the existence of silica-free CaO-FeO-Fe2O3-TiO2-P2O5 immiscible nelsonitic liquids. Our results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrate that nelsonite with the composition of one-third apatite and two-thirds Fe-Ti oxides by weight completely melts well above 1450 ºC, which is in good agreement with numerous experimental studies of the CaO-P2O5-FexO system in connection to metallurgy. Thus, the composition cannot be molten at temperatures relevant for crystallization of the Damiao magma. A review of experimental studies of liquid immiscibility and analyses of natural immiscible glasses show that all the liquids on the Fe- and P-rich side of the miscibility gap have at least 20 wt. % of aluminosilicate components. Main results of this study come from the analyses of apatite-hosted melt inclusions in Damiao nelsonite. The inclusions range from ~3 to 200 µm in diameter. They are ubiquitous and meet all the morphological criteria of primary melt inclusions crystallised into assemblages of daughter minerals. Almost all of them contain vermiculite and chlorite, and some contain biotite, amphibole, phlogopite and Fe-Ti oxides. Out of dozens analysed inclusions, only three have high contents of SiO2 (62.1-73.8 wt. %) and low contents of FeO (0.25-2.35 wt. %). Bulk compositions of other inclusions show large variations in SiO2 (20.79-50.16 wt. %) and FeOt (13.44-32.78 wt. %). With a few exceptions, the inclusions are very low in CaO (0.04-1.51 wt. %, and high in Al2O3 (10-21.17 wt. %). Despite the high Fe content, the compositions differ from those of the typical immiscible Fe-rich melts. It appears that the cumulus apatite crystallised from Fe-rich, hydrated silicate melt. We propose that the inclusions at Damiao record a trend of intercumulus melt evolution, which was strongly affected by separation of a hydrothermal fluid phase and the losses of alkali and Ca silicate components from the melt into the fluid.",

            "abstract": "Drained peatlands contribute around 5% to the total German greenhouse gas emissions. While these areas are hotspots for carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, some re-wetted peatlands may emit large amounts of methane (CH4). To quantify the GHG emission reductions achieved by the re-wetting of peatlands, the reduced CO2 emissions and the potential CH4fluxes need to be balanced.\nWe synthesized methane flux data from 14 peatlands with 122 sites. At each site, methane fluxes were measured for one to three years with static chambers. The sites comprise arable land, intensive and extensive grassland, forest and peat mining areas as well as semi-natural and re-wetted peatlands on both bog peat, fen peat and other soils rich in organic carbon. Besides the groundwater table we consider further potential drivers for the CH4fluxes such as soil properties (carbon, nitrogen, pH, and physical properties), climatic parameters, land use, and vegetation composition.\nAnnual methane fluxes ranged from low uptake rates (around -1 g CH4-C m² a-1) to very high emissions (> 200 g CH4-C m² a-1). Intensively drained sites showed very low emissions, while for annual mean water levels higher than 5-10 cm below ground, elevated emissions of more than 20 g CH4-C may occur. At some re-wetted sites CH4 emissions of more than 100 g CH4-C m² a-1 were measured, which roughly equal the Global Warming Potential of the CO2-emissions from intensively drained agricultural sites. These high fluxes were probably caused by a combination of nutrient-rich conditions, the dieback of poorly adapted plants and a fast accumulation of organic sediments. However, this was the exception and not the rule even for very wet re-wetted sites. Achieving a model efficiency of 0.72 during cross-validation, a boosted regression tree (BRT) model was well able to describe logarithmic CH4-fluxes. Groundwater level, biotope type, soil nitrogen content, and ponding duration during summer were the most important controls. Combining the BRT model with soil, land use, and groundwater table maps as well as weather data, methane fluxes were upscaled for Germany.",

            "abstract": "With an expanding role of wind energy in satisfying energy demands around the world, wind farms are covering increasingly larger surfaces to the point where interaction between wind farms and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) might have significant implications. Furthermore, many wind farm sites lie over existing farmland for which water is a precious resource. In this context, a relevant question yet to be fully understood, is whether large wind farms alter near surface temperatures and evaporation rates and if so, by how much.\n In the present study, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of a geostrophic wind driven ABL with two active scalars, temperature and specific humidity, in the presence of Coriolis forces with an embedded wind farm are performed. Multiple ‘synthetic’ diurnal cycles are simulated by imposing a time-varying surface temperature and specific humidity. Wind turbines are modeled using the “actuator disk” approach along with the flexibility to reorient according to varying flow directions. LES is performed using the “pseudo-spectral” approach implying that an infinitely large wind farm is simulated.\n Comparison of simulations with and without wind farms show clear differences in vertical profiles of horizontal velocity magnitude and direction, turbulent kinetic energy and scalar fluxes. To better understand these differences, a detailed analysis of the constituent terms of budget equations of mean and turbulent kinetic energy and sensible and latent heat fluxes has been performed for different stratification regimes as the ABL evolves during the diurnal cycle. The analyses help explain the effect of wind farms on the characteristics of the low-level jet, depth of the stable boundary layer, formation and growth of the convective boundary layer (CBL) and scalar fluxes at the surface.",

            "abstract": "During the insertion orbit of Cassini in 2004 the Ion and Neutron Camera measured significant fluxes of the energetic neutral atoms (ENA) coming from the area between the D-ring and the Saturn’s atmosphere, what brought up the idea of the possible existence of the innermost radiation belt in this narrow gap (1).\nThere are two main sources of energetic charged particles for such inner radiation belt: the interaction of the Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) with the Saturn’s atmosphere and rings, which due to CRAND process can produce the keV-MeV ions or electrons in the region, and the double charge exchange of the ENAs, coming from the middle magnetosphere, what can bring the keV ions to the region of our interest.\nUsing the particles tracer, which was developed in our group, and GEANT4 software, we study in details those two processes. With a particle tracer we evaluate the GCR access to the Saturn atmosphere and rings. Simulation of the GCR trajectories allows to calculate the energy spectra of the arriving energetic particles, which is much more accurate, compare to the analytically predicted spectra using the Stoermer theory, since simulation includes effects of the ring shadow and non-dipolar processes in the magnetosphere. Using the GEANT4 software the penetration of the GCR through the matter of rings was simulated, and the production of secondaries particles was estimated. Finally, the motion of secondaries was simulated using the particles tracer, and evaluation of the energy spectrum of neutrons the decay of which leads to the production of final CRAND elements in the inner Saturnian radiation belts was done. We show that for inner radiation belt most energetic ions comes from GCR interaction with rings, it’s penetration and from interaction of secondaries with Saturn’s atmosphere.\nThis simulation allows us to predict the fluxes of energetic ions and electrons, which particle detector MIMI/LEMMS onboard the Cassini can measure during the so-called “proximal” orbits in 2017, when the Cassini spacecraft will pass directly through this diverse and enigmatic region extremely close to the planet.\n",

            "abstract": "New regional ice deglaciation models have recently been developed to match a variety of geologic, glaciological, and geodetic observations. In Antarctica, these new models exhibit a smaller East Antarctic ice loss since the Last Glacial Maximum, and hence yield a smaller GIA correction to the Antarctic estimates than those predicted by ICE5G. These revised models yield less negative ice mass losses when using GRACE data. Although these new models represent a significant advance in Antarctic GIA modeling, there are still large uncertainties associated with them. One of the large uncertainties is due to the fact that in the East Antarctica interior, the GIA reconstruction is poorly constrained by observations. These new models assume a monotonic decrease in loading in the last 5000 years. We examine the impact of this assumption on the GIA estimates and how a more realistic non-monotonic loading scenario could impact the results and the GRACE ice mass estimates. We use GRACE in combination with output products from the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) and recent studies of deglaciation history to derive an improved GIA correction, which include a non-monotonic loading scenario, is consistent with available geological and geodetic constraints and reconstruction of recent climate history. We find a larger correction, which implies larger losses of the Antarctica ice sheet by about 70 Gt/yr.",

However, this charge imbalance requires the presence of an additional +1 ion for charge compensation – a role that can be played by dissolved hydrogen species (“water”) in the form of H+ bonded to oxygen. The correlation between the concentrations of aluminum and water in quartz was investigated experimentally and found to be significant. FTIR was used to measure water concentrations in thin (<1mm) doubly-polished samples of synthetic quartz grown over a range of pressures and temperatures. The quartz was grown from a mixture of amorphous silica powder, aluminum hydroxide powder, and distilled water. Two techniques were utilized to obtain accurate measurements representative of the sample. Depending on the size and visible geometry of the crystals, they were measured either with the c-axis parallel to the IR beam or in groups of ten at random orientations. Aluminum was determined via electron microprobe. The molar concentrations of Al and H were found to be positively correlated.",

The WAC is sensitive from 350 nm to 1100 nm. Among the mission highlights thus far for ISS have been discoveries of particulate plumes from Enceladus, details of surface topography along the ‘tiger stripes’, the discovery of an equatorial ridge on Iapetus, detailed images of small inner moons and distant moons Phoebe and Hyperion, features in Saturn’s rings including perturbed edges near embedded moons, ‘propellers’, ephemeral clumps, and evidence for impacts in the rings and free-oscillation modes in Saturn’s interior. The camera documented the aftermath of a methane/ethane ‘rain’ storm on Titan as well as seasonal behavior in the detached haze and visible airglow generated by magnetospheric plasma. The cameras documented the formation and evolution of a giant storm on Saturn, lightning from storms on Saturn, and determined that eddies are powering Saturn’s zonal jets. In the F-ring and Proximal orbits ISS will obtain even better resolution on the rings, planet and inner moons.",

In May-June 2012, a seismic sequence (main shocks of ML 5.9 and 5.8) was occurred closely to the investigated area. Chemical and isotopic analysis were repeated in May 2012, September 2012, June 2013 and July 2014.\nIn the 2006-2009 period, at the pre-seismic conditions, chemical composition of soil gas showed that the southern part of the studied area is CH4-dominated, whereas the northern part is CO2-dominated. Relatively anomalous fluxes and concentrations were recorded with a spotted areal distribution. Anyway, CO2 and CH4 values are within the typical range of vegetative and of organic exhalation of the cultivated soil.\n2012-2013 soil gas results show CO2 values essentially unvaried with respect to pre-earthquake surveys, while the 2014 values highlight an increasing of CO2 flux in the whole study area. On the contrary, CH4 values seem to be on average higher after the seismic sequence, although with a decreasing trend in the last survey (2014).\nIsotopic analysis were carried out only on samples with anomalous values. The δ13C-CO2 value suggests a prevalent shallow origin of CO2 (i.e. organic and/or soil-derived) probably related to anaerobic oxidation of heavy hydrocarbons. Methane isotopic data (δ13C-CH4) indicate a typical biogenic origin (i.e. microbial hydrocarbon production) of the CH4, as recognized elsewhere in the Po Plain and surroundings.\nObtained results highlight a different CO2 and CH4 behaviour before, during and after the seismic events. These variations could be produced by increasing of bacterial (e.g. peat strata) and methanogenic fermentation processes in the first meters of the soil. No hints of deep degassing can be inferred for the study area after the earthquake, as suggested by isotopic analysis.\nThese achieved outcomes constitute the starting point for subsequent geochemical surveys, in order to assess the temporal variations and to better understand the geochemical processes related to the seismic sequence.",

Since fluorosis has no cure, prevention is key, and defluoridation treatment is a primary mitigation approach. Despite the successful development of defluoridation treatments and technologies worldwide, these solutions encounter a range of operational barriers (e.g. lack of economic and chemical resources, scarcity of skilled operators) and uptake is hindered by a lack of user understanding and participation in the development of community treatment options. Preliminary research highlights that plants typically fail after the first three years of installation, we are investigating why and how to overcome this barrier. Monitoring fluoride concentrations, operations, and user attitudes at several defluoridation plants in Maharashtra, we assess the overall success of these installed technologies. The research considers: (1) the fluctuations in source concentrations with respect to climate and changing water use patterns, (2) treatment with regards to performance, operation, and maintenance of implemented technologies to meet fluoride standards, and (3) user understanding, acceptability and uptake of defluoridation technology.

However, beyond the scale of an indivudal lake, quantifying their contribution to global energy and carbon budgets and their responses to climate change is not trivial. In this study we have undertaken an analysis of the results of a multi-lake modelling project in an attempt to characterise how the slope of the net energy exchange vs average annual air temperature relationship is affected by physical lake characteristics. For the initial study, 30 lakes with a variety of morphometries, climatic, hydrological and trophic characteristics were simulated for a period of 2 years using a the General Lake Model (GLM), a simple 1-D hydrodynamic model. The physical mixing parameters used to quantify heat and momentum budgets were determined using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach that optimised model output to observed temperature profile data. Surface energy budget components, as calculated by the model for each lake, were then compared to a variety of lake metrics, such as lake depth, volume and residence time, to quantify relationships between the slope of the net energy and air temperature curve. The analysis demonstrates that integration of numerical models with data from a global sensor network can be an effective way to parameterise complex relationships between limnological characteristics and energy budgets.",

            "abstract": "For the detailed analysis of forest carbon dynamics and CO2 fluxes of urban area, the CO2 concentration measurement techniques with high spatial and temporal resolution are required in the lower atmosphere. We had developed the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system to achieve high accurate measurements of vertical CO2 profiles and the vertical distribution of CO2 concentration from 2 km to 7 km altitude has been observed1. In order to measure the CO2 concentration distribution in the lower altitude, the dynamic range of the photon counter and the output power of transmitter of the CO2 DIAL have improved. We develope the compact 1.6 μm CO2 DIAL with the high-speed photon counter (10 GHz) and the small power transmitter to perform high-precision measurements of CO2 concentration profiles in the lower atmosphere. This compact mobile DIAL system has a 2 mJ OPG transmitter and a 25 cm coaxial telescope for measurements of limitted range. As the transmitter beam of this DIAL system is able to scan from -4 degree to 52 degree with elevation angle, the vertical distribution of lower CO2 concentration as well as the horizontal distribution from short range can be measured with high precision. The compact DIAL was conducted test observations and achieved successfully measurements of CO2 concentration profiles for the range from 0.25 to 3 km with integration time of 30 minutes and range resolution of 300 m.\nThis work was financially supported by the System Development Program for Advanced Measurement and Analysis of the Japan Science and Technology Agency.\nREFERENCES\nY.

            "abstract": "A new database of 500+ olivine crystal timescales from samples that encompass the duration of the 2010 Fimmvörðuháls-Eyjafjallajökull eruption is presented. We also integrate new petrologic, thermometric and barometric data to read a 4D narrative of the magmatic processes within this volcanic plumbing system preceding­­- and during- eruption.\nUsing this perspective we can identify and semi-quantify magmatic componentry, detect new magmatic inputs, and ‘watch’ those crystal chemical populations age. We find that major crystal-liquid disequilibrium events occurred up to several years preceding the eruptions, and inputs fed the plumbing system during the eruption window (days – hours). We place timeframes upon processes including magma-mixing, mush remobilization and erosion, and final-ascent quenching and eruption.\nFe-Mg binary diffusion in olivine modelling conducted upon this scale was made possible using new advances –also presented here– in both the gathering and processing of raw data, and extraction of timescale information. We demonstrate that this streamlined workflow can now produce statistically robust timescale data within an integrated petrologic and geochemical context that may be resolved alongside independent geophysical and other remote sensing data into a common dimension – time. Transposing petrologic information (record of past process) and geophysical observation (phenomenological in the present) into a common language is designed to produce new understanding of both active and palaeo- volcanic systems, the implications of which we discuss here using our case study as an example.",

            "abstract": "Land use has a major influence on the hydrologic processes that take place in soils. Soil compaction on pastures for example leads to infiltration patterns that differ considerably from the ones observable in forests. It is not clear, however, how different forest stands influence soil infiltration and soil moisture distributions. Factors that that vary amongst different stands and potentially affect soil moisture processes in forests are, amongst others, canopy density, throughfall patterns, the intensity and frequency of stem flow, litter type, root distributions and rooting depth. To investigate how different tree species influence the way soils partition, store and conduct incoming precipitation we selected 15 locations under different tree stands within the TERENO observatory in north-east Germany. The forest stands under investigation were mature oak, young pine, mature pine, young beech and mature beech. At each location we installed 30 FDR soil moisture sensors grouped into five depth profiles (monitoring soil moisture from 10 cm to 200 cm) and 5 additional near surface sensors. The profile locations within each forest stand covered most of the anticipated variability by ranging from minimum to maximum distance to the trees including locations under more and less dense canopy. Supplementary to the FDR sensors, throughfall measurements, tensiometers and groundwater data were available to observe dynamics of tree water availability, water fluxes within the soils and percolation towards the groundwater. To identify patterns in space and time we referred to the statistical methods of wavelet analysis and temporal stability analysis. Finally, we tried to link the results from these analyses to specific hydrologic processes at the different locations.",

            "abstract": "Published plate reconstructions typically show the Izu-Bonin Marianas arc (IBM) forming as a result of long-lived ~50 Ma Pacific subduction beneath the Philippine Sea. These reconstructions rely on the critical assumption that the Philippine Sea was continuously coupled to the Pacific during the lifetime of the IBM arc. Because of this assumption, significant (up to 1500 km) Pacific trench retreat is required to accommodate the 2000 km of Philippine Sea/IBM northward motion since the Eocene that is constrained by paleomagnetic data.\nIn this study, we have mapped subducted slabs of mantle lithosphere from MITP08 global seismic tomography (Li et al., 2008) and restored them to a model Earth surface to constrain plate tectonic reconstructions. Here we present two subducted slab constraints that call into question current IBM arc reconstructions:\n1) The northern and central Marianas slabs form a sub-vertical ‘slab wall’ down to maximum 1500 km depths in the lower mantle. This slab geometry is best explained by a near-stationary Marianas trench that has remained +/- 250 km E-W of its present-day position since ~45 Ma, and does not support any significant Pacific slab retreat.\n2) A vanished ocean is revealed by an extensive swath of sub-horizontal slabs at 700 to 1000 km depths in the lower mantle below present-day Philippine Sea to Papua New Guinea. We call this vanished ocean the ‘East Asian Sea’. When placed in an Eocene plate reconstruction, the East Asian Sea fits west of the reconstructed Marianas Pacific trench position and north of the Philippine Sea plate. This implies that the Philippine Sea and Pacific were not adjacent at IBM initiation, but were in fact separated by a lost ocean.\nHere we propose a new IBM arc reconstruction constrained by subducted slabs mapped under East Asia. At ~50 Ma, the present-day IBM arc initiated at equatorial latitudes from East Asian Sea subduction below the Philippine Sea. A separate arc was formed from Pacific subduction below the East Asian Sea. The Philippine Sea plate moved northwards, overrunning the East Asian Sea and the two arcs collided between 15 to 20 Ma. From 15 Ma to the present, IBM arc magmatism was produced by Pacific subduction beneath the Philippine Sea.",

            "abstract": "We present spatiotemporal variations of methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in the UT/LS observed mainly by the CARIBIC passenger aircraft for the years 2005–2011. The CH3Cl mixing ratio in the UT over Europe was higher than that observed at a European surface baseline station year-round, indicative of a persistent positive vertical gradient at NH mid latitudes. A series of flights over Africa and South Asia show that CH3Cl mixing ratios increase toward tropical latitudes, and the observed UT CH3Cl level over these two regions and the Atlantic was higher than that measured at remote surface sites. Strong emissions of CH3Cl in the tropics combined with meridional transport through the UT may explain such vertical and latitudinal gradients. Comparisons with CO data indicate that non-combustion sources in the tropics dominantly contribute to forming the latitudinal gradient of CH3Cl in the UT. We also observed elevated CH3Cl and CO in air influenced by biomass burning in South America and Africa, and the enhancement ratios derived for CH3Cl to CO in those regions agree with previous observations. In contrast, correlations indicate a high CH3Cl to CO ratio of 2.9±0.5 ppt ppb-1 in the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone and domestic biofuel emissions in South Asia are inferred to be responsible. We estimated CH3Cl emissions from South Asia to be 134±23 Gg Cl yr-1, which is higher than a previous estimate due to the higher CH3Cl to CO ratio observed in this study.\nWe also examine the use of CH3Cl as a tracer of tropical tropospheric air in the LMS, where we identified air masses with elevated CH3Cl that were however stratospheric in terms of N2O. Back trajectories suggest recent low-latitude origins of such air masses in early summer. In this season, high CH3Cl LMS air shows a clear branch connecting stratospheric and tropical tropospheric air on N2O-CH3Cl scatterplots. This distinct feature vanishes in late summer when the LMS is ventilated by tropospheric air.",

The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo [DSMC] method is well-suited to modeling the dynamics of such rarefied and non-equilibrium regimes, where continuum techniques break down. Here, we apply DSMC in three-dimensional, transient, and self-consistent neutral density simulations of Earth's rarefied upper atmosphere.\nAn existing planetary-science code base, established in the modeling of the lunar and Ionian environs, is extended to reflect the physics of Earth's upper atmosphere. Comprehensive atmospheric simulations are computed in parallel on a domain extending from the mid-thermosphere, below the continuum-rarefied transition, through 1000 km altitude. The simulation code includes multi-species neutral- and photo-chemistry, tracking of particle rotational and vibrational states, and non-equilibrium radiation transport. Substantial model development is demonstrated in application to the Earth’s atmosphere, including the incorporation of lower-boundary conditions consistent with the NRLMSISE-00 semi-empirical model, ultraviolet radiation and photo-chemistry rates modeled with reference to space weather indices, and radiative absorption attenuated by integrated column density.\nComparisons with results drawn from existing upper atmospheric models and from indirect satellite mass density measurements are employed in benchmarking model accuracy. Avenues for further development include hybridization with continuum global circulation models in the mid-thermosphere, and the extension of the planetary code's magnetic field and charged-particle models to the Earth case.\nResearch supported by the Los Alamos Space Weather Summer School, LANL Institutional Computing, and the Institute of Geophysics, Planetary Physics, and Signatures (IGPPS) at LANL.",

            "abstract": "The transport of magma is controlled by its rheology which, in turn, is a function of its crystal and bubble content. We develop the first empirically-validated model for the rheology of a three-phase magma (i.e. one containing both bubbles and crystals). The model is valid at low bubble capillary number (where bubble deformation is small) which is typical of basaltic magma. We adopt an ‘effective-medium’ approach in which the bubbly melt is treated as a continuous medium which suspends the crystals. The resulting three-phase model combines separate two-phase models for bubble suspension rheology and crystal suspension rheology, which are taken from the literature. The model is validated against new analogue experimental data for three-phase suspensions of bubbles and spherical particles, collected in the low bubble capillary number regime. Good agreement is found across the experimental range of particle volume fraction (0 ≤ Фp ≤0.5) and bubble volume fraction (0 ≤ Фb ≤ 0.3). Consistent with model predictions, experimental results demonstrate that, at low capillarity, bubble growth in a crystal-poor magma increases its viscosity, whilst bubble growth in a crystal-rich magma decreases its viscosity.\nThe validity range of the model makes it particularly applicable to the transport of magma in the sub-volcanic plumbing system. The model is trivially extended to account for variations in crystal shape, and for the high capillarity regime; these extended models await experimental validation.",

            "abstract": "In deep convective storms wet scavenging of soluble species as well as aqueous and ice chemistry affects the net transport of HOx precursors to the upper troposphere (UT), and thus impacts UT O3 production, air quality and climate. The DC3 (Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry) field campaign took place in the central US from May-June 2012 and sampled inflow and outflow of convective storms with different dynamical and emission characteristics. This work compares wet scavenging and net transport of HOx precursors and other soluble trace gases in the DC3 May 29 Oklahoma and May 21 Alabama thunderstorms. WRF-Chem simulations at cloud resolving scales (dx=1km) are conducted with two different wet scavenging schemes. The first scheme, based on Neu and Prather (ACP, 2012), removes gases in precipitation and includes ice deposition of HNO3. However, it does not transport species dissolved in hydrometeors, and uses a constant retention fraction for soluble species during hydrometeor freezing. The second scheme, described in Barth et al. (JGR, 2001), tracks solute in individual hydrometeor classes, and includes aqueous chemistry and ice deposition of additional species. A new capability to specify the fraction of each species that is retained in ice upon hydrometeor freezing is added, and sensitivity simulations are compared with observations to determine the best estimate of the retention factor for each species. Simulated vertical distributions of trace gases of varying solubilities within the storm and immediately surrounding the storm are compared with aircraft observations in storm inflow and outflow regions. Scavenging efficiencies are calculated from the model by several flux methods and compared with scavenging efficiencies derived from observations. For the Oklahoma storm, using the Neu and Prather scheme, observed mean vertical profiles of SO2, HNO3, H2O2 and CH3OOH in outflow are better represented in the model when scavenging is included. While H2O2 is two orders of magnitude more soluble than CH3OOH, and twice as much H2O2 than CH3OOH is removed in the simulation with scavenging, its observed net transport is the same as for CH3OOH. In addition, half as much CH2O is transported in the model as observed. Conclusions are presented about the role of different microphysical processes in the removal of soluble species.",

            "abstract": "The next phase of offshore wind projects in the UK focuses on the development of very large wind farms clustered within several allocated zones. However, this change in the distribution of wind capacity brings uncertainty for the operational planning of the power system. Firstly, there are concerns that concentrating large amounts of capacity in one area could reduce some of the benefits seen by spatially dispersing the turbines, such as the smoothing of the power generation variability. Secondly, wind farms of the scale planned are likely to influence the boundary layer sufficiently to impact the performance of adjacent farms, therefore the power generation characteristics of the clusters are largely unknown.\nThe aim of this study is to use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate the power output of a cluster of offshore wind farms for a range of extreme events, taking into account the wake effects of the individual turbines and the neighbouring farms. Each wind farm in the cluster is represented as an elevated momentum sink and a source of turbulent kinetic energy using the WRF Wind Farm Parameterization.\nThe research focuses on the Dogger Bank zone (located in the North Sea approximately 125 km off the East coast of the UK), which could have 7.2 GW of installed capacity across six separate wind farms. For this site, a 33 year reanalysis data set (MERRA, from NASA-GMAO) has been used to identify a series of extreme event case studies. These are characterised by either periods of persistent low (or high) wind speeds, or by rapid changes in power output. The latter could be caused by small changes in the wind speed inducing large changes in power output, very high winds prompting turbine shut down, or a change in the wind direction which shifts the wake effects of the neighbouring farms in the cluster and therefore changes the wind resource available.",

            "abstract": "Long-lived radionuclides, such as 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl, are produced by cosmic rays in surficial materials on Earth, and used for determinations of cosmic-ray exposure ages and erosion rates. Quartz and limestone are routinely used as the target minerals for these geomorphological studies. Magnetite also contains target elements that produce abundant cosmogenic nuclides when exposed to the cosmic rays.\nMagnetite has several notable merits that enable the measurement of cosmogenic nuclides: (1) the target elements for production of cosmogenic nuclides in magnetite comprise the dominant mineral form of magnetite, Fe3O4; (2) magnetite can be easily isolated, using a magnet, after rock milling; (3) multiple cosmogenic nuclides are produced by exposure of magnetite to cosmic-ray secondaries; and (4) cosmogenic nuclides produced in the rock containing the magnetite, but not within the magnetite itself, can be separated using nitric acid and sodium hydroxide leaches.\nAs part of this initial study, magnetite was separated from a basaltic sample collected from the Atacama Desert in Chili (2,995 m). Then Be, Al, Cl, Ca, and Mn were separated from ~2 g of the purified magnetite. We measured cosmogenic 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl concentrations in the magnetite by accelerator mass spectrometry at PRIME Lab, Purdue University. Cosmogenic 3He and 21Ne concentrations of aliquot of the magnetite were measured by mass spectrometry at the University of Tokyo. We also measured the nuclide concentrations from magnetite collected from a mine at Ishpeming, Michigan as a blank. The 10Be and 36Cl concentrations as well as 3He concentration produce concordant cosmic ray exposure ages of ~0.4 Myr for the Atacama basalt. However, observed high 26Al and 21Ne concentrations attribute to those nuclides incorporation from silicate impurity.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of subsurface stratigraphic relationships is guided by stratigraphic concepts that were developed using many varieties and scales of data including paleontological samples, cuttings and core, outcrop analogs, well logs, and seismic. Subsurface stratigraphic correlations are strongly influenced by the type, density, and distribution of the data available. The exploration geologist typically interprets 2D and 3D seismic reflections to define prospects and plays. In structurally simple areas, he or she often assumes that seismic reflectors mark depositional boundaries that are essentially time-synchronous events represented by a single wavelet character. In reality, seismic reflectors usually display spatial wavelet variability, seldom resolve individual beds and are the product of the amplitude expression of a range of lithologic changes that encompasses a range of geologic time and depositional processes. Our assumption that seismic reflections are time-synchronous can lead to errors in stratigraphic correlation that only become evident when our prediction of well or field performance is unrealized. To mitigate the potential for this correlation error, we must modify how we interpret seismic data. \n In this presentation we will focus on the concept of defining or approximating time-correlative surfaces in seismic data, leverage concepts of the Wheeler transform to place these seismic reflectors into the relative time domain and then examine the diachronous nature of these time-mapped surfaces in 3D. We will then explore how the 3D mapping of time-correlative surfaces fits sequence stratigraphic concepts and discuss whether this new approach requires us to change our interpretation paradigms.",

The groundwater wells are located on the recharge area of LiWu and Hualien river basins. 10 groundwater samples have been collected from different monitoring wells, which are artificial and all around 21-97 meters deep, and the altitude of them are less than 125-953 meters. Samples sent to University of Tokyo for further T-He dating analysis. We could obtain total helium-3 concentrations in groundwater samples, although they might contain different signatures other than radiogenic source from tritium decay. In order to obtain the radiogenic helium-3 concentration, we needed to eliminate helium-3 concentrations of air-saturated water and terrigenic source in spite of air contamination. In this study, we can successfully separate the radiogenic source of helium-3 from terrigenic (crustal and mantle) source, as well as air contamination for the studied samples. After helium-3 corrections, we can obtain the age results, which are not older than 40 years, with terrigenic signature of 0.13 Ra. The result suggests that the T-He dating technique could be a good method for determining the age of young groundwater in Taiwan.",

            "abstract": "The accelerating loss of biodiversity is a major environmental trend. Tropical ecosystems are particularly threatened due to climate change, invasive species, farming and natural resources exploitation. Recent advances in remote sensing of biodiversity confirmed the potential of high spatial resolution spectroscopic imagery for species identification and biodiversity mapping. Such information bridges the scale-gap between small-scale, highly detailed field studies and large-scale, low-resolution satellite observations. In order to produce fine-scale resolution maps of canopy alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of the Peruvian Amazonian forest, we designed, applied and validated a method based on spectral variation hypothesis to CAO AToMS (Carnegie Airborne Observatory Airborne Taxonomic Mapping System) images, acquired from 2011 to 2013. There is a need to understand on a quantitative basis the physical processes leading to this spectral variability. This spectral variability mainly depends on canopy chemistry, structure, and sensor’s characteristics. 3D radiative transfer modeling provides a powerful framework for the study of the relative influence of each of these factors in dense and complex canopies. We simulated series of spectroscopic images with the 3D radiative model DART, with variability gradients in terms of leaf chemistry, individual tree structure, spatial and spectral resolution, and applied methods for biodiversity mapping. This sensitivity study allowed us to determine the relative influence of these factors on the radiometric signal acquired by different types of sensors. Such study is particularly important to define the domain of validity of our approach, to refine requirements for the instrumental specifications, and to help preparing hyperspectral spatial missions to be launched at the horizon 2015-2025 (EnMAP, PRISMA, HISUI, SHALOM, HYSPIRI, HYPXIM). Simulations in preparation include topographic variations in order to estimate the robustness of image processing methods for mountainous ecosystems.",

The review of geochronological and historical data documents that the bulk of the four largest northern Mediterranean and Black Sea deltas (Ebro, Rhone, Po and Danube) formed during two short and synchronous intervals during which anthropogenic land cover change was the main driver for enhanced sediment production. These two major growth phases occurred under contrasting climatic regimes and were both followed by generalized delta retreat, supporting the hypothesis of human-driven delta progradation. Delta retreat, in particular, was the consequence of reduced soil erosion for renewed afforestation after the fall of the Roman Empire, and of river dams construction that overkilled the still increasing sediment production in catchment basins since the Industrial Era. In this second case, in particular, the effect of a reduced sediment flux to the coasts is amplified by the sinking of modern deltas, due to land subsidence and sea level rise, that hampers delta outbuilding and increases the vulnerability of coastal zone to marine erosion and flooding.",

The appearance of high correlation between tidally-induced stresses and earthquake occurrence frequency several to ten years before these megathrust earthquakes suggests that such statistical analysis could be useful in improving forecasting of future subduction zone earthquakes. Using this statistical method, we analyzed the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone which has been known to produce devastating tsunamigenic earthquakes, and specifically the Semidi Segment that is probably late in its earthquake cycle (Davies et. al. 1981). Our study aims to understand if significant tidal triggering of earthquakes were present precursory to historical great earthquakes in this region. We also aim to understand if any segment along the subduction zone is currently displaying statistically significant tidal triggering of earthquakes and whether such observations are indicative of the stress state of the segment. Finally, we test if the strength of tidal triggering captured by this statistical method is sensitive to the tidal stress azimuth used. Such sensitivity could be indicative of the predominant fault slip direction in the specific segment.",

They represent critical archive of climate changes in this region but more specifically may have recorded the flexural, unroofing and shortenning history of the Himalaya. As mainly continental in origine the Siwaliks are often poorly dated via classic biostratigraphy. Hence, numerous magnetostratigraphic analyses have been carried out providing a rather good chronology of the Siwaliks group. However, these studies have several flaws. The proposed correlations to the reference scale of each individual magnetostratigraphic columns remain subjective and therefore ambiguous. Only one unique correlation is often presented while the other likelihood possibilities are not mentioned. Hence, the possible derived uncertainties and ambiguities are never discussed. Moreover, most of the studied sections expose fine grained sediments shed by relatively small rivers which catch only a limited part of the Himalaya. The past sediments of larger Himalayan rivers (Yamuna, Ganga, Karnali, Narayani and Kosi) draining the entire range are more relevant to decipher the tectono-climatic hystory of the Himalayas. However, these rivers mainly deposited in the foreland large and coarse grained fans less suitable for paleomagnetic analyses. At last, very few magnetostratigraphic studies have documented sediments younger than 4-5Myrs while important climate changes occurred during this period.\nTherefore our study aims to reconsider the previous magnetostratigraphic correlations using a numerical method based on the dynamic time wraping algorithm. This new method automatically provides a set of reasonably likely correlations and hence enables to discuss possible ambiguities in the magnetostratigraphic correlations. It also provides uncertainties on sediment accumulation rates which will be used to better estimate the flexural and shortening history of the Himalayas.\nOur study also aims to better constrain the depositional ages of young Siwalik sediments deposited by a large river. Therefore, we carried out three new magnetostratigraphic sections located in the Valmiki National Park in India which expose coarse and young sediments deposited by the recent Narayani river through a large paleo-fan.",

The evolution of Me197Hg and DGM197 was followed. In addition, we have performed Hg speciation of the water column and sediment, determined diversity of microbial community and investigated microbial resistance to Hg through presence of merA and merB genes. Our results showed repeatedly that methylation does not occur in the water column of the GoT, and confirmed that sediments are the principal methylation site, as well as the source of MeHg to the water column. Its formation seems to be closely linked to nutrient cycling at the sediment-water interface, where degradation of organic matter with accompanying oxygen consumption significantly stimulates MeHg production (range 0.85 pM – 3.39 pM). The water column showed a pronounced capability for 197Hg2+ reduction (up to 25% d-1), confirming that the GoT is a source of Hg to the atmosphere. Whether reduction was directly linked to genetic resistance; was a consequence of non-specific redox reactions or of other microbial mechanisms could not be demonstrated. Neither merA nor merB genes were detected, but the microbial community structure was changing in the water column seasonally, as did the reduction rates in the experiments. Most importantly, it was shown that 197Hg methodology is sensitive enough to follow Hg biogeochemical transformations at environmental levels. The advantage is that the minimal additions of 197Hg do not disturb the natural processes occurring in the environment and that very small changes can be detected. Hg stress in the Gulf can directly manifest itself in biota and consequently result in a threat to environmental and public health and therefore needs to be seen in the light of changing global climate and marine environment.",

However, conventionally, α has not been investigated much in the calculation of pH. Therefore, when calculating the propagation distance in the sonar equation, pH =8~8.1 (Weak alkaline) are used empirically. Therefore we used an actual value of pH of 30 years from 1984 in the sea near the Japan, and investigated change over the years of absorption loss (α) at some frequency. As a result, we found that α value decreases gradually in the past 30 years, as high-latitude decreases. Further, the future, assuming that ocean acidification is more advanced, and to simulate a change of the absorption loss and propagation loss in end of this century using the pH value reported from the \"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\" (IPCC). As a result, it was just suggested that α decreased more in the end of this century and affected the submarine detection. In addition, in recent years, we examined the effects of noise that offshore wind power construction proceeds in each country emits gives to the underwater sound. As a result, in the end of this century, an underwater noise increases about 17%, and underwater sound environmental degradation of the sea is concerned.",

            "abstract": "An understanding of the thermal structure of subduction zones is important to gain insight into metamorphic dehydration reactions, the flow of fluids, generation of intermediate depth seismicity and the production of melts that generate arc volcanism. A tradition approach to subduction zone modeling relies on 2D cross-sections. While this approach appears adequate for subduction systems that have near-normal convergence and small changes in structure along-strike, it fails to fully represent the thermal and velocity structure of subduction systems with curved trenches or oblique subduction (van Keken & Bengston, JGR, 2003). Two-dimensional models will also likely fail near slab edges and in regions with strong changes in convergence parameters such as slab velocity, age of incoming slab, and variations in overriding plate structure. The Alaska-Aleutian arc is a prime example of a subduction zone with strong along-arc variations, which made it of key interest for interdisciplinary studies with the GeoPRISMS program (geoprisms.org). As the Pacific Plate subducts beneath North America, the Aleutian trench curves southward. Subduction also trends from trench normal near Alaska to nearly trench parallel in the far western Aleutians. These changes in the subduction zone geometry are accompanied by changes in volcanic activity, arc size, and changes in the arc to slab distance.\nWe have developed a full 3D model of the Aleutian-Alaska subduction system using a kinematic slab surface (following the geometry from Syracuse and Abers, G-cubed, 2006). In a comparison of 2D models we found that where subduction is most oblique the thermal structure of 2D cross-sections can differ up to ~60°C depending on whether the cross-section is normal to the trench or parallel to convergence. Due to the predicted strong 3D flow in the mantle wedge the discrepancies between 2D and 3D models will be higher.\nWe use the 3D model to investigate the nature of the metamorphic changes in the slab using Perplex modeling, which also provides insights into the dehydration of the slab and the seismic velocity structure. The resulting thermal-petrological-seismological structure will be made available for general use and comparisons seismological, petrological and geochemical investigations of this complicated subduction system.",

            "abstract": "In situ thermal treatment (ISTT) technologies, such as electrical resistance heating (ERH) and thermal conductive heating (TCH), rely on the in situ production of a gas phase composed of steam and vaporized volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This gas phase must be captured, extracted, and processed in an aboveground treatment system to meet remediation objectives. When used to treat volatile non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), gases can be created at temperatures below the boiling points of both the groundwater and the NAPL, in a process commonly referred to as co-boiling, and vaporized VOCs can condense if gases are transported to colder regions or are not captured before thermal treatment has stopped. As such, an understanding of gas formation, connection, and flow is important for the design and operation of ISTT technologies. A recent series of laboratory experiments focused on the visualization and quantification of gas dynamics during water boiling and NAPL-water co-boiling, and the investigation of potential NAPL redistribution. Experiments were conducted in a sand-packed glass-walled chamber (40 cm tall × 20 cm wide × 1 cm thick) heated by electrical resistance. Temperatures and electric currents were measured, and digital images were captured throughout the experiments to quantify gas saturations using light transmission techniques. Additional experiments also investigated the exsolution of dissolved gas as a technique to enhance gas production at lower temperatures. Results showed the development of disconnected and connected gas flow regimes, with disconnected flow occurring at early times and during co-boiling. Results also showed the potential for NAPL redistribution due to displacement by gas formed within pools, and due to condensation in colder regions. These results highlight the need to carefully consider gases in the design of ISTT heating and gas extraction systems to ensure remediation performance.",

In total, this study used 15 indicators to create an IFRI map for the region, and 5 categories of flood risk were distinguished: “very high,” “high,” “medium,” “low,” and “very low.” The results, which were presented in ternary diagrams to illustrate the relative importance of the three different components, show that urban areas in the Korean Han River basin have experienced a decrease of 1.0% in terms of the hydrologic component. However, the socio-economic and ecological components have increased by 3.2% and 4.4%, respectively. In rural areas, an increase of 4.8% was found in the hydrologic component alongside decreases in the socio-economic (1.6%) and ecological (2.2%) factors. In addition, the IFRI map shows that 20.02% of the total area of the Han River Basin was classified as having “very high” or “high” flood risk; the size of this high-risk zone has increased significantly by since 1990. This study also evaluated flood risks according to the different phases of conditions, and the results from the analysis indicate that flood risks were worse during strong cold-tongue (CT) and warm-pool (WP) El Niño years. Further analyses of possible factors that affect the vulnerability and resilience of communities to flood hazards in the Han River basin should be conducted on the basis of this research. Accordingly, the results from this study may provide useful data for reducing flood risks in developing areas that are experiencing.",

            "abstract": "Submarine melting of Greenland’s outlet glaciers has been implicated as a driver of dynamic glacier changes in the past decade. Yet, we have a limited understanding of this melting, with no direct measurements of it. A growing number of studies attempt to infer submarine melting from measurements of ocean heat transport in the fjords where outlet glaciers terminate. Water properties and velocity are measured at some distance from the glacier to calculate heat transport through the fjord, which is then assumed to be deposited at the glacier and used to infer a submarine melt rate. However, the prevalent equations of this method are oversimplified and the implicit assumptions are typically untested. Here, we develop a more thorough framework for assessing fjord heat and salt budgets. We assess the validity of common approximations and the measurements needed for an adequate heat budget. We find that the feasibility of inferring submarine melting from oceanic measurements will vary with certain parameters and properties of the glacier/fjord system. Two years of moored ocean measurements from Sermilik Fjord, near the terminus of Helheim Glacier, are used to inform the discussion, though many of the results are generalizable to any glacier/fjord system.",

            "abstract": "Operational earthquake forecasting is rapidly becoming a 'hot topic' as civil protection authorities seek quantitative information on likely near future earthquake distributions during seismic crises. At present, most of the models in public domain are statistical and use information about past and present seismicity as well as b-value and Omori's law to forecast future rates. A limited number of researchers, however, are developing hybrid models which add spatial constraints from Coulomb stress modeling to existing statistical approaches. Steacy et al. (2013), for instance, recently tested a model that combines Coulomb stress patterns with the STEP (short-term earthquake probability) approach against seismicity observed during the 2010-2012 Canterbury earthquake sequence. They found that the new model performed at least as well as, and often better than, STEP when tested against retrospective data but that STEP was generally better in pseudo-prospective tests that involved data actually available within the first 10 days of each event of interest. They suggested that the major reason for this discrepancy was uncertainty in the slip models and, in particular, in the geometries of the faults involved in each complex major event. Here we test this hypothesis by developing a number of retrospective forecasts for the Landers earthquake using hypothetical slip distributions developed by Steacy et al. (2004) to investigate the sensitivity of Coulomb stress models to fault geometry and earthquake slip, and we also examine how the choice of receiver plane geometry affects the results. We find that the results are strongly sensitive to the slip models and moderately sensitive to the choice of receiver orientation. We further find that comparison of the stress fields (resulting from the slip models) with the location of events in the learning period provides advance information on whether or not a particular hybrid model will perform better than STEP.",

We collected 38 directional samples in Liugou and Longmenkou. The microtectonic features in this zone mainly consist of sub solidus plastic deformation and high temperature ductile deformation, the reason why they co-exist can be explained by multiple pulse of magma and the earlier cooling into sub solidus of magmas.\nIn the sampling route parallel to the diameter of Fangshan Rock, the microtectonic feature mainly consists of high-temperature ductile deformation, such as myrmekite and GBM. In particular, the high-temperature ductile deformation becomes more obvious when closer to the center, indicating the condition of 500-700℃. In the sampling route which meets diameter at a right angle, the microteconic feature mainly consists of lower-temperature ductile deformation, including more BLG, indicating the condition of 300-500℃. We assume the superposition of microtectonic features in different period and different temperature condition is caused by multiple pulses of magmas.\nFangshan intrusive body mainly consist of Yanshan granite, and its quartz is an appropriate finite strain gauge. Study of finite strain shows the X/Z ratio of 1.74~2.59 and X/Y ratio of 1.59 ~ 2.52. The S (indication of length ration of shear zone’s thickness before and after deformation) of 96% samples are less than 1, revealing that the shear zone has being thinned and quartz has experienced shearing dominated by pure shearing. 80% samples’ Kinematic vorticity is less than 0.71, which also shows that pure shear is dominate. Samples whose Kinematic vorticity is more than 0.71 is close to the center of the pluton, indicating possible spiral emplacement of pluton.\nEBSD analysis of quartz C-axis shows a complex preferred orientation, which indicates that the sample have experienced at least two periods of deformation. The more evident pattern is prism <a> slip,which also indicates the degormation condition of 500-600℃. Besides the projection points close to Z-axis indicate another lower temperature deformation, which supports the results of study in microstuctural features.",

During El Nino, the warm pool moves to the east so that convection and precipitation over the MC decreases; in contrast, more active convection and precipitation occurs in the region during La Nina. In this study, we used global precipitation data sets including TRMM and GPCP to demonstrate that precipitation in the MC has an asymmetric response over the land and nearby oceans during different phases of ENSO. Using Ocean Nino Index as a metric for ENSO strength, we show that El Nino significantly reduces precipitation in Celebes Sea and the oceanic regions between Koror and Papua Barat, but causes significantly smaller reductions in nearby islands including Papua and Borneo. The cloud amount decreases over the MC during the El Nino, which may lead to increases in incoming solar radiation. Greater land heating rates, in turn, may enhance land-sea breezes, causing greater precipitation on these islands than in nearby ocean areas. In addition, evapotranspiration over the islands might mitigate the precipitation changes over the land, making precipitation over land less variable during El Nino. Further investigation and model experiments are needed to explore what kinds of mechanisms dominate such asymmetric precipitation responses over the MC.",

            "abstract": "With a growing urbanisation and the emergence of climate change, the world is facing a more water constrained future. This phenomenon will have direct impacts on the resilience and performance of energy sector as water is playing a key role in electricity generation processes. As energy is becoming a thirstier resource and the pressure on finite water sources is increasing, modelling and analysing this closely interlinked and interdependent loop, called ‘water-energy nexus’ is becoming an important cross-disciplinary challenge. Conflict often arises in transboundary river where several countries share the same source of water to be used in productive sectors for economic growth. From the perspective of the upstream users, it would be ideal to store the water for hydropower generation and protect the city against drought whereas the downstream users need the supply of water for growth. This research use the case study on the transboundary Blue Nile River basin located in the Middle East where the Ethiopian government decided to invest on building a new dam to store the water and generate hydropower. This leads to an opposition by downstream users as they believe that the introduction of the dam would reduce the amount of water available downstream. This calls for a compromise management where the reservoir operating rules need to be derived considering the interdependencies between the resources available and the requirements proposed by all users. For this, we link multiobjective optimization algorithm to water-energy use simulation model to achieve effective management of the transboundary reservoir operating strategies. The objective functions aim to attain social and economic welfare by minimizing the deficit of water supply and maximizing the hydropower generation. The study helps to improve the policies by understanding the value of water and energy in their alternative uses. The results show how different optimal reservoir release rules generate different trade-off solutions inherently involved in upstream and downstream users requirements and decisions. This study stimulates the research in this context by using simulation based optimization techniques to manage for security for food, water and energy generation, which leads to improve sustainability and long-term political stability.",

            "abstract": "Scattering and backscattering coefficients of atmospheric aerosol are crucial parameters for numerous climate-relevant applications, including studies related to the Earth’s radiation budget. Due to their strong connection to aerosol chemical and microphysical characteristics, in situ measurements have been commonly used for evaluating optical properties routines in global and regional scale models. However, these in situ measurements, including size distribution and chemical composition data, can be subject to uncertainties. Techniques for obtaining these data depend on particle size (submicron versus supermicron) and relative humidity range (dry versus wet conditions). In this study, we examine how the data uncertainties can impact the level of agreement between the calculated and measured optical properties (commonly known as optical closure). Moreover, we put forth a novel technique for inferring in parallel the effective density and real refractive index of weakly absorbing aerosols from simultaneously measured size distributions (with mobility and aerodynamic sizes), and two optical properties, namely the scattering coefficient and hemispheric backscatter fraction, measured by integrating nephelometer. We demonstrate the performance of our technique, which permits discrimination between the retrieved aerosol characteristics of sub-micron and sub-10-micron particles, using both a sensitivity study with synthetically generated inputs with random noise and a six-week case study with real measurements. These measurements cover a wide range of coastal summertime conditions observed during the recent Two-Column Aerosol Project (TCAP,\nhttp://campaign.arm.gov/tcap/\n) and include periods with a wide range of aerosol loading and relative humidity. Finally, we discuss how in situ data and retrievals of aerosol characteristics can be applied for model evaluation. ",

            "abstract": "It is widely recognized that the study of clouds has nowadays become one of the major concern of the climate research community. Consequently, a multitude of retrieval methodologies have been developed during the last decades in order to obtain accurate retrievals of cloud properties that can be supplied to climate models. Most of the current methodologies have proven to be satisfactory for separately retrieving ice or liquid cloud properties, but very few of them have attempted simultaneous retrievals of these two cloud types. Recent studies nevertheless show that the omission of one of these layers can have strong consequences on the retrievals and their accuracy. In this study, a new methodology that simultaneously retrieves the properties of ice and liquid clouds is presented. The optical thickness and the effective radius of up to two liquid cloud layers and the ice water path of one ice cloud layer are simultaneously retrieved, along with an accurate estimation of their uncertainties. Radiometric measurements ranging from the visible to the thermal infrared are used for performing the retrievals.\nIn order to quantify the capabilities and limitations of our methodology, the results of a theoretical information content analysis are first presented. This analysis allows obtaining an a priori understanding of how much information should be expected on each of the retrieval parameters in different atmospheric conditions, and which set of channels is likely to provide this information. After such theoretical considerations, global retrievals corresponding to several months of A-Train data are presented. Comparisons of our retrievals with operational products from active and passive instruments are effectuated and show good global agreements. These comparisons are useful for validating our retrievals but also for testing how operational products can be influenced by multi-layer configurations.",

            "abstract": "A Rayleigh/Raman lidar system has been operated by the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) since February, 2011 (JARE 52nd) in Syowa Station Antarctica (69.0S, 39.5E). The lidar system consists of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (355nm) as a transmitter and two telescopes with four photo multiplier tubes which are to detect Rayleigh scattered light from low and high atmosphere at 355 nm and N2 Raman emission at 387nm. Polar Mesospheric Cloud (PMC) was detected by the lidar at 22:30UT (+3hr for LT) on Feb 4th, 2011, the first day of a routine operation. This event was the first time to detect PMC over Syowa Station by a lidar [Suzuki et al., Ann. Geophys., 2013]. However, signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the PMC event was not so good due to large shot noises from daytime background signals. Moreover, a receiver system was designed mainly for nighttime observations. In this way, observation of PMC during the midnight sun, which also corresponds to most frequent PMC season, was difficult. Thus, to improve SNR of the PMC observation with the lidar during daytime, a narrow band-pass Fabry-Perot etalon unit has been developed and installed in the receiver system on Dec 2013 by JARE 55th. By using this new system, clear PMC signals were successfully detected under daylight condition during the period of summer operation of JARE55th. During this period of 53 days (from 17 Dec. 2013 to 7 Feb. 2014), only 11 days were with a clear sky and suitable for PMC observation. Thus, it was difficult to study temporal variations on a PMC activity only by using the lidar data. Fortunately, NASA’s AIM satellite had passed near Syowa Station and provided with complimentary PMC data during observation gap of the lidar. By combining our lidar data with the AIM/CIPS data, nearly continuous monitoring of PMC variability over Syowa Station was achieved for period between 13th and 18th in January 2014. PMC occurrence with an interval of two days over Syowa Station during the period was clearly confirmed. Co-located MF radar also showed clear two days fluctuation in horizontal wind velocities around PMC altitude during the same period. In this presentation, we will discuss the cause of the two-day oscillation found in PMC occurrence and horizontal wind velocity. In particular, two-day planetary wave will be quantitatively investigated as a potential cause of the fluctuation.",

            "abstract": "Coastal mangroves lose large amounts of water through evapotranspiration (ET) that can be equivalent to the amount of annual rainfall in certain years. Satellite remote sensing has been used to estimate surface energy and ET variability in many forested ecosystems, yet has been widely overlooked in mangrove forests. Using a combination of long-term datasets (30-year) acquired from the NASA Landsat 5 and 7 satellite databases, the present study investigated ET and surface energy balance variability between two mangrove forest sites in the Caribbean: 1) Everglades National Park (ENP; Florida, USA) and 2) Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve (SKBR; Quintana Roo, Mexico). A satellite-derived surface energy balance model was used to estimate ET in tall and scrub mangroves environments at ENP and SKBR. Results identified significant differences in soil heat flux measurements and ET between the tall and scrub mangrove environments. Scrub mangroves exhibited the highest soil heat flux coincident with the lowest biophysical indices (i.e., Fractional Vegetation Cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and ET rates. Mangrove damage and mortality was observed on the satellite images following strong tropical storms and associated with anthropogenic modifications and resulted in low values in spectral vegetation indices, higher soil heat flux, and higher ET. Recovery of the spectral characteristics, soil heat flux and ET was within 1-2 years following hurricane disturbance while, degradation caused by human disturbance persisted for many years. Remotely sensed ET of mangrove forests can provide estimates over a few decades and provide us with some understanding of how these environments respond to disturbances to the landscape in periods where no ground data exists or in locations that are difficult to access. Moreover, relationships between energy and water balance components developed for the coastal mangroves of Florida and Mexico could be extrapolated to other mangroves systems in the Caribbean to measure changes caused by natural events and human modifications.",

The processes that lead to this variability are not well understood. It must be that the variable solar flux at energetic EUV wavelengths as well as changes in the underlying thermosphere play a role in determining the density, shape, and altitude of this layer of the atmosphere, but the relative importance of these effects and the consequences for the atmosphere as a whole is still an open question. In this presentation, the Mars Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (M-GITM) is used to investigate this variability and to determine the extent to which solar processes directly shape the M1 region while constraining the role of the underlying thermosphere.",

            "abstract": "This study aims at exploring the potential climate change effect on the regime of Summer-Fall probable maximum flood (PMF). To achieve this objective, probable maximum precipitation (PMP) was estimated and was used as an input into the SWAT hydrological model. Climate change conditions were modeled by simulating climate for the period from 1961 to 2095. This period was divided into three horizons: recent past (1961-2005), near future (2006-2050) and far future (2051-2095). Climate data are from the 4th version of Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM). CRCM was driven by Canadian Global Coupled Model. The climate projection is based on greenhouse gas emission scenario of SRES-A2. Daily Summer-Fall PMP was estimated for each horizon at Moisie watershed in the center of the province of Quebec, Canada. PMP estimation method is derived from moisture maximization method proposed by the World Meteorological Organization. The estimated PMP was then inserted randomly into climate data of corresponding horizon. The random insertion helped to take into account all possible conditions prior to the occurrence of PMP according to the initial soil saturation level. Around 3000 simulations of random insertions were completed for each horizon. Summer-Fall season was divided into three sub-seasons: June-July, August-September and October-November. Under this classification, the potential climate change effect on soil saturation level, extreme rainfall and flood events could be precisely identified. The PMF is influenced by the mean annual rainfall which influence soil saturation level, PMP and change in regime of extreme rainfall events. Results indicated that the June-July and the August-September PMF will increase by 22% when moving from recent past climate to near future and the PMF will not change in the transition from near future to far future. In October-November sub-season, the PMF will be reduced by 16% in near future; and then it will increase to reach almost the same value as the recent past in far future horizon. Finally, it is worth mentioning that based on results of this study, rise or reduction of PMP does not necessarily imply rise or reduction of PMF.",

Because of the sparse mas balance observations, the quantification of ENSO influence on tropical glaciers is difficult. The starting point of this study is a four-year long time series of distributed surface energy and mass balance (SEB/SMB) at Shallap Glacier, southern Cordillera Blanca, calculated using a process-based model driven by in-situ observations. We use these data to calibrate a fully automated regression-based statistical downscaling tool, developed especially to downscale the individual SEB/SMB fluxes from large-scale gridded atmospheric data on a monthly basis (in this study, ERA-Interim) and for regularly spaced altitude slices on the glacier. Albeit some limitations inherent to the mass balance model and to the statistical downscaling strategy, the skill of the model evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation allows a robust evaluation of the ENSO influence on glacier SEB/SMB fluxes for the longer period 1980 – 2013. The presented downscaling tool can be applied easily to other glaciers and/or atmospheric datasets, providing a new way to extend observed SEB/SMB time series to much longer time scales.",

Data sets with relative roughness (A/kn) ranging from 0.7 to 9.5 were analyzed to build a depiction of the different mechanisms responsible for transferring momentum into the bed. The analysis shows form stresses dominating the total small-scale stress for low relative roughness, and Reynolds stresses prevailing at higher relative roughness. The associated eddy viscosity estimates using the overall mean velocity as the velocity scale, agree with the model by Zedler and Street (2006), with a slight modification to their nearbed augmentation function. Bedform-induced pressure was estimated by solving the double-averaged momentum balance. Examination of its depth-dependent behavior indicates a close relationship with the presence of beform-induced coherent motions. Furthermore, comparisons between form drag estimates achieved from both, bedform-induced pressure and velocity-vorticity correlations, suggest a substantial role of coherent vortices in the depiction of the pressure field near bedforms.",

By direct calculation of Earth’s inertia tensor perturbation due to observed glacier mass changes (twenty year average), we found the yearly drift polar motion excitation as (ψ1, ψ2)=(1.00, 0.05) milliarcsec. This direction closely matches the observed pole drift, and we infer that glacier melting is the primary driver of the observed polar wander. Analysis of polar motion data indicates that a substantial portion of the observed eastward pole drift has occurred since the late 1990s, also consistent with the accelerated rate of glacier melting. The associated change in LOD due to average glacier melting for the last twenty years is estimated as +114 microsec, which implies total 0.42 s delay in UT1 for the same time span.",

The pore pressure, sediment particle size composition, microstructure, physical and mechanical properties at different depths inside the seabed were observed during the experimental process under the weight of the soil and under the action of waves of different heights. The results showed that wave-induced sediment responses significantly controlled the occurrence and evolution of inhomogeneity in the strength and sediment distribution of a uniform-originated silty seabed. The variations in the strength, composition and structure of during the wave-sediment interaction processes are closely related to the pore water seepage inside the seabed. The driving machanism can be devided into three modes: transient seepage caused by pore pressure oscillation, seepage failure caused by pore pressure accumulation and liquefaction failure caused by pore pressure accumulation, during which the latter is the main cause of vertical transport of pore water carrying a large amount of fine particles inside the seabed of the subaqueous Yellow River delta. The array of features observed in these experiments can be incorporated into a new model of seabed stratification in uniform-originated silty sediments during wave-sediment interaction. In addition, the implications of this model for traditional sedimentology are explored from a sediment dynamic perspective.",

            "abstract": "Supercycles in subduction zones describe a long-term cluster of megathrust earthquakes, which recur in a similar way (Sieh et al. 2008,Goldfinger et al. 2013). It consists of two complete failures of a given subduction segment in between which, after a long period of relative quiescence, partial ruptures occur. We recognize that supercycles were proposed in those subduction zones (Sieh et al. 2008,Goldfinger et al. 2013, Metois et al. 2014, Chlieh et al. 2014) for which the seismogenic zone downdip width is estimated to be larger than average (Heuret et al. 2011, Hayes et al. 2012). We show with a two-dimensional numerical model of a subduction zone that the seismogenic zone downdip width indeed has a strong influence on the long-term seismicity pattern and rupture styles. Increasing the downdip width of the seismogenic zone leads to a transition from ordinary cycles of similar sized crack-like ruptures to supercycles consisting of a range of rupture sizes and styles. Our model demonstrates how interseismic deformation accompanied by subcritical and pulse-like ruptures effectively increases the stress throughout the seismogenic zone towards a critical state at which a crack-like superevent releases most of the accumulated stresses. We propose such stress evolution along the dip of the megathrust as the simplest explanation for supercycles. This conceptual model suggests that larger than thus far observed earthquakes could occur as part of a supercycle in subduction zones with a larger than average seismogenic zone downdip width (>120-150 km).",

            "abstract": "In the boreal zone lakes cover on average 7 % of land area, and furthermore in some parts in Finland and northern Canada they occupy up to 20 % and 30 % of the landscape. Many of the water bodies are small. The arctic tundra is similarly occupied by numerous small ponds, the response of which to high-latitude warming and the resulting changes in CO2 and CH4 effluxes is very uncertain. The present outgassing estimates are still provisional and probably underestimated. The eddy covariance (EC) technique would be an indispensable tool for directly assessing the fluxes from lakes, rather than using chambers, although there is the expectation that agreement between methods can be found with appropriate chamber design.\nThe influence of energy and mass fluxes from lakes and other water bodies on atmospheric circulation and climate may be considered as a three-step chain of processes. First, coupled thermo-, hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry of “lake-sediments” system produces energy source/sink and a source of greenhouse gases for the atmosphere. Second, the structure and dynamics of Atmospheric Boundary-Layer (ABL) creates conditions for the rate of energy and mass transfer between the hydrologically heterogeneous surface and the atmosphere. Finally, the mesoscale dynamics of atmosphere is likely to cause upscale propagation of energy and tracers emitted from the heterogeneous surface towards synoptic scales. The interaction of these scales is still poorly understood, and modelling approach involving high resolution spatial grids and process-based formulations can give much insight in the problem and bring a new knowledge of the physical mechanisms involved.\nThe crucial questions are the following: What are the ultimate processes determining the gas exchange between lakes and rivers and the atmosphere? What are the site specific factors and do small lakes differ from large lakes? To what extent the gas exchange on rivers is similar to lakes? How much information we can deduce from flux measurements above the surface and what is the crucial information required from the water-side? What are the major features and how to assess multiscale gas and energy transfer in the ABL over hydrologically heterogeneous land?",

            "abstract": "Rapid regional warming at an increasing pace ever since the end of the Little Ice Age (c. AD 1900) causes significant change in the coastal marine environments of the West Antarctic Peninsula and beyond. A comprehensive set of hydroacoustic ground-discrimination data (RoxAnn GDX) was gathered to develop a high resolution characterization of the seafloor habitats in the Potter Cove, King George Island, a small fjord with a retreating former tidewater glacier at its head. Sediment samples and underwater video footage are used for ground truthing. Seven habitat zones are distinguished. These include the shallow high-energy wave zone exposing unvegetated rocks to the low-energy deeper basins characterized by muddy sediments and the typical biota including ophiuroids, ascidians, sponges, sea pens. The results allow to subdivide the Potter Cove into a “dynamic zone” (DZ) with rocks and mixed fine sediments covering the inner cove, a large transition zone that we call the “subrecent zone” (SZ) buried under fine meltwater sediments and the “quasi persistent zone” (QPZ) that reveals more mature conditions in many aspects further downfjord. These zones represent development stages resulting from the increasing distance to and decreasing influence of the glacier front. The DZ is trailing directly behind the retreating glacier front. As long as there is strong discharge of sediment-loaded meltwater the DZ transitions into the SZ after a period of time (under recent conditions: decades) which itself transitions into the QPZ after centuries. We assume that during the Medieval Warm Period (c. AD 800-1350) the glacier terminus was at or even behind its present position. Until the maximum of the Little Ice Age the glacier advanced to form a prominent moraine complex. Ever since the glacier retreated at increasing speed to its recent position. If the warming trend continues the glacier will retreat further away from the fjord head and the QPZ will likely cover the entire fjord after several centuries.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand marine ecosystems and to provide basic data for a sustainable management in these vulnerable areas, seafloor mapping has become increasingly important. Since the knowledge regarding the seabed environments and their dynamics are still sparse, new mapping techniques have evolved in the last years and hydroacoustic devices became an important tool for quick and reliable mapping. In 2007 we started a monitoring program in the German Bight (North Sea) using sidescan sonar (Imagenex YellowFin, 330 kHz) in a study site comprising approximately 1,500 km2. In subsequent years, the area was mapped repeatedly with a resolution of ~25 cm. For ground truthing, several hundred sediment samples were taken. The investigations reveal that the area is mainly characterized by fine to coarse sand which is arranged in different seafloor features such as subaquatic dunes or relicts of Pleistocene moraines. While the alignment and position of the moraines was stable throughout the years, the dunes can be highly dynamic. Their migration indicates the amount of sediment transport in these areas. Some seafloor features could be identified as so-called sorted bedforms, which are spatially-grain-size-sorted patterns on the seafloor consisting of small rippled medium sand surrounded by smooth fine sand. These flow-transverse features are morphological linked to ridges and depressions and are further maintained by ebb and flood currents of almost equal strengths. The medium sand is separated from the fine sand by sharp boundaries in all directions which were generated by the bidirectional flow field. The extend and alignment of the sorted bedforms seem to be relatively stable in a time frame of 6 years, however small-scale variabilities up to serveral meters could be detected. We suppose that these processes mainly occur during storm surges while the fine-sand layers are winnowed away and hence the shapes of the bedforms changes.",

            "abstract": "The flow of three immiscible fluids - water, NAPL, air - in porous media is important in many subsurface processes. To model the three-fluid flow, the relation of relative permeability-saturation-capillary pressure (k-S-P) of three fluids is of central importance. In this experimental study, we directly measure the k-S-P of the water (wetting phase) when three fluids are coexist in a micromodel during the water drainage and imbibition.\nThe results show that the sequence of the non-wetting fluids (air and NAPL) entering into the micromodel affects the fluid distributions as well as the relative permeability of water. During the drainage process, the relative permeability of water dropped drastically when the pathway of water from inlet to outlet of the micromodel was visually blocked by the non-wetting fluids. At this stage, the relative permeability of water was low but not down to zero. The water was still able to move via corner flows or thin-film flows. During the imbibition process, the water displaced two non-wetting liquids via both \"snap-off\" and \"piston-type\" motions. The relative permeability of water jumped when the water pathway was formed again. In addition, we found that the well-known scaling format proposed by Parker et al. [1] might fail when the interfaces between the most non-wetting (air) and the most wetting (water) fluids occurs in the three-fluids system.\n",

            "abstract": "During the seismic cycle of repeated earthquake failure, faults regain strength in a process known as frictional healing. Laboratory studies have played a central role in illuminating the processes of frictional healing and fault re-strengthening. These studies have also provided the foundation for laboratory-derived friction constitutive laws, which have been used extensively to model earthquake dynamics.\nWe conducted laboratory experiments to assess the affect of shear load on frictional healing. Frictional healing is quantified during slide-hold-slide (SHS) tests, which serve as a simple laboratory analog for the seismic cycle in which earthquakes (slide) are followed by interseismic quiescence (hold). We studied bare surfaces of Westerly granite and layers of Westerly granite gouge (thickness of 3 mm) at normal stresses from 4-25 MPa, relative humidity of 40-60%, and loading and unloading velocities of 10-300 μm/s. During the hold period of SHS tests, shear stress on the sample was partially removed to investigate the effects of shear load on frictional healing and to isolate time- and slip-dependent effects on fault healing. Preliminary results are consistent with existing works and indicate that frictional healing increases with the logarithm of hold time and decreases with normalized shear stress τ/τf during the hold. During SHS tests with hold periods of 100 seconds, healing values ranged from (0.013-0.014) for τ/τf = 1 to (0.059-0.063) for τ/τf = 0, where τ is the shear stress during the hold period and τf is the shear stress during steady frictional sliding. Experiments on bare rock surfaces and with natural and synthetic fault gouge materials are in progress.\nConventional SHS tests (i.e. τ/τf = 1) are adequately described by the rate and state friction laws. However, previous experiments in granular quartz suggest that zero-stress SHS tests are not well characterized by either the Dieterich or Ruina state evolution laws. We are investigating the processes that produce shear stress dependent frictional healing, alternate forms of the state evolution law, and comparing results for friction of bare rock surfaces and granular fault gouge.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic Holocene Transitions (AHT) Project is a community-based, PAGES-endorsed effort to investigate centennial-scale variability in the Arctic climate system during the Holocene, and to understand the feedbacks that lead to pronounced changes. The AHT project recently released a major database of Arctic Holocene proxy climate records (Clim. Past–Disc. 10:1). The systematic review of marine and terrestrial proxy climate time series is based on quantitative screening criteria with new approaches for assessing the geochronological accuracy of age models and for characterizing the climate variables represented by the proxies. Records from only 39% of the sites could be found in the primary paleoclimate data repositories, underscoring the importance of such community-based efforts to assembling a comprehensive product. The database authors, including representatives from six Arctic regions, considered published records from nearly 500 sites. Of these, time series from 170 sites met the criteria for inclusion in the database. Namely, the records are located north of 58°N, extend back at least to 6 cal ka (84% extend back > 8 ka), are resolved at sub-millennial scale (at least one value every 400 ± 200 yr) and have age models constrained by at least one age every 3000 yr. The database contains proxy records from lake sediment (60%), marine sediment (32%), glacier ice (5%), and other sources. Most (60%) reflect temperature (mainly summer warmth) and are primarily based on pollen, chironomid or diatom assemblages. Many (15%) reflect some aspect of hydroclimate as inferred from stable isotopes, pollen assemblages, and other indicators. Principal component (PC) analyses indicates that the predominant pattern of change in temperature-sensitive time series is a ramp between 5 and 3 ka that separates millennial-long intervals of less-pronounced change. This shift corresponds to cooling at most sites, but a substantial fraction of sites warm across this transition. Between 6 and 2 ka, 23% of the 124 sites warm (5% with p < 0.05), whereas 77% cool (47% with p < 0.05). The trend represented by the first PC is likely driven by orbital changes and shifting synoptic features; it does not capture other important features of the spatial-temporal pattern that are likely present in the database and that we are currently exploring.",

            "abstract": "The Venice Lagoon represents an outstanding example of man-landscape co-existence, where salt marshes are currently exposed to possibly irreversible transformations due to the effects of climate changes and human activity. The increasing rate of relative sea level rise and the decreasing sediment supply are the dominant forcings controlling salt-marshes survival, as in other cases worldwide. Analysing signatures of landscape changes in the stratigraphic record is crucial to refine our knowledge of tidal landform dynamics and it is a first step to develop predictive morphodynamic models. The southern Venice lagoon is suited to analyze the response of tidal landscape to changes in environmental forcing. The upper part of the Holocene sedimentary succession accumulated as the effect of a “human-induced transgression”, which caused a considerable salt-marshes contraction since the 16th century. In the southern Venice lagoon, re-directions of the Brenta River during 16th and the 19th century caused significant changes in terms of freshwater and sediment supply. To analyze the paleomorphodynamic response to these main changes, we collected 25 cores (1.0 to 1.5 m deep) along a NE-SW linear transect about 5 km long cutting through salt-marsh, tidal-flat and subtidal-platform deposits. Through sedimentological analyses we defined the spatial arrangement of swamp, salt-marsh, wave-worked and tidal-flat mud deposits along this transect. Magnetic susceptibility and organic/inorganic content were measured in the study succession, which was dated through 14C and 137Cs geochronological analyses. Our results suggest that salt-marsh sedimentation occurred above deltaic deposits since the 14th century. Salt-marsh aggradation stemmed out from both mud settling and organic accumulation, although magnetic susceptibility revealed some intervals during which the inorganic deposition dominates over organic accumulation. Salt-marsh aggradation occurred in parallel with the decrease in salt-marsh extent and the tidal-flat expansion.",

            "abstract": "Mt. Makiling is an inactive stratovolcano located in the province of Laguna. Semi-detailed geologic field mapping on the northwestern low-level flanks and apron of the volcano was conducted. Exposures reveal a volcanic terrain hosting a wide variety of volcanic rocks: lava flows, pyroclastic surges, pyroclastic flows, and tuff deposits. Stratigraphic logging of the volcanic deposits showed differences in occurrence of the deposit types as well as their characteristics. The pyroclastic flow deposits are found at the base of the column overlain by pyroclastic surges which were more common in the area. Capping the pyroclastic surges is a thin layer of tuffaceous units. Isolated deposits of lava flows of andesitic composition were mapped in the western flank of Mt. Makiling. These varying volcanic deposits are derived from different eruptive activities of Mt. Makiling, with at least three separate eruptive episodes indicated by the exposed deposits. Two separate explosive eruptions are marked by two different pyroclastic deposits, while an effusive episode, marked by andesitic lava flows, can also be identified. The pyroclastic surge deposit is uncharacteristically thick, around a hundred meters or more exposed, providing further questions as to the magnitude of past eruptions or the mechanism of pyroclastic material deposition around the volcano. Mt. Makiling, thus, has historically undergone different eruption types, but still releases generally the same material composition across varying deposits: intermediate or andesitic composition. This is consistent with the trend of Philippine volcanoes, and with the Macolod corridor which hosts this volcanic system.",

            "abstract": "The MISR instrument on NASA’s Terra platform has been operating for almost 15 years. Standard products are generated at a spatial resolution of 1.1 km or coarser, but a recently developed method to re-analyze the Level-1B2 data allows the retrieval of biogeophysical products at the native spatial resolution of the instrument (275 m). This development opens new opportunities to better address issues such as the management of agricultural production and food security.\nSouth African maize production is of great economic and social importance, not only nationally, but on the global market too, being one of the top ten maize producing countries. Seasonal maize production statistics are currently based on a combination of field measurements and estimates derived from manually digitizing high resolution imagery from the SPOT satellite. The field measurements are collected using the Producer Independent Crop Estimate System (PICES) developed by Crop Estimates Committee of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. There is a strong desire to improve the quality of these statistics, to generate those earlier, and to automate the process to encompass larger areas.\nThis paper will explore the feasibility of using the MISR-HR spectral and directional products, combined with the finer spatial resolution and the relatively frequent coverage afforded by that instrument, to address these needs. The study area is based in the Free State, South Africa, one of the primary maize growing areas in the country, and took place during the 2012-2013 summer growing season. The significance of the outcomes will be evaluated in the context of the 14+ years of available MISR data.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decade, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have emerged as a precise and cost-effective tool for studying the composition of the atmosphere. GNSS-derived information about tropospheric delay can be used for climate change and variability analysis on a global scale using homogeneously reprocessed GNSS solutions. At the University of Luxembourg, two such reprocessed global datasets of GNSS-derived zenith total delay (ZTD) and position estimates, covering 1994-2012, have been produced recently using the Bernese GNSS Software 5.2 and the reprocessed products from the Centre for Orbit Determination in Europe. One of these datasets is based on the network double differencing (DD) strategy whereas the other dataset is computed using precise point positioning (PPP). Both of these include over 400 GNSS stations and have been obtained using nearly identical processing settings. The two processing strategies, i.e. DD and PPP, each have their own strengths and weaknesses and could affect the solutions differently at different geographical locations.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of the two GNSS-derived tropospheric delay datasets by comparing them to those derived from other techniques, e.g. radiosonde and Doppler Orbitography Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) observations, as well as reanalysis data from, e.g. the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Following this, we investigate inter-annual climate variability and trends in the tropospheric delay datasets on various regional to global spatial scales.",

There are studies on lay people’s perception of science and technology. However, what is the scientists’ perspective on public communication of science? Objectives - To describe and characterize the concepts that coordinators of Brazilian public health graduate programs have about public communication of science. Methods – This is an analytical and descriptive report of an exploratory research (doctoral study). The answers of fifty-one coordinators to two questionnaires were submitted for content analysis. The categories were transformed into variables that allowed the data processing by the Hiérarchique Classificatoire et Cohésitive (CHIC®) software. Results - Similarity analysis strongly suggested (0,99) that coordinators understand public communication as a communication directed to academic peers and students, also as a form of participation in scientific events and communication by scientific papers. Likewise, the implication analysis suggested a strong implication (0,98) between scientific communication understood as public communication. Conclusion - The notion of public communication of science as a social right and as a commitment and responsibility of researchers and research centers is not explicitly present in the narrative of the coordinators, although in general the coordinators conceive it as a relevant activity. This study thus contributes to a reflection on the role of scientists, researchers and research centers in public communication of science and technology.",

However, there remains significant uncertainty on the formation yields and fates of organic nitrates in the atmosphere. This certainly applies to the biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), which can often be the dominant reaction partner for OH and thus precursors to the peroxy radicals that produce ozone. Observations of BVOCs and total isoprene and monoterpene nitrates were measured as part of the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study in the summer of 2013, at the SEARCH Centreville site in rural, central Alabama. A 0-D box model was constructed to observe the effect of individual and total organic nitrates on ozone production potential, to determine the relative importance of each species in organic nitrate formation. Here we examine the impact of yield uncertainty, and secondary oxidation reactions that might release NOx from the primary organic nitrates.",

            "abstract": "Within coastal areas like the North Sea, nutrient and carbon cycles are driven by a close coupling of benthic-pelagic processes. Due to shallow water depths, most of the organic matter which is produced via primary production in surface waters is transferred to the seafloor. Most of the organic matter is degraded within surface sediments and nutrients such as NH4 or PO4are transported back into the water column, whereas only a small amount of organic carbon is buried within the sediment. Consequently, benthic carbon and nutrient fluxes have a direct impact on biological and geological processes such as the availability of nutrients in the water column, nutrient budgets or the storage of carbon within marine sediments.\nBy in situ as well as ex situtechniques, benthic nutrient fluxes and carbon mineralization rates were quantified within the years 2012 to 2014 at different time series sites in the southern North Sea. Benthic nitrogen and carbon fluxes are close to the Redfield ratio of 106 moles of carbon to 16 moles of nitrogen, indicating that mainly marine organic matter is settling at the seafloor.\nIn situ flux measurements by the benthic lander system NuSObs (Nutrient and Suspension Observatory) revealed considerable seasonal and spatial variations of benthic fluxes. For example, benthic mineralization rates of organic carbon are about three to five times higher in summer when compared to winter. Our In situ studies, investigations of pore water and macro fauna, as well as tracer studies revealed that seasonal and spatial variations are dominantly controlled by the activity and abundance of benthic macro fauna. For example, in situasphyxiation experiments during the lander deployments suggests that carbon mineralization rates can be about 20 to 30 times higher when benthic macro fauna is active.\nEstimated rain rates of organic carbon and organic nitrogen to the seafloor are up to 200 g C m-2 yr-1 and up to 56 g N m-2 yr-1 respectively, while approximately 80 % of the organic carbon and 90 % of the organic nitrogen reaching the seafloor are recycled at the sediment-water interface. These datasets show that the southern North Sea is a highly dynamic system in terms of deposition and mineralisation of organic matter at the sediment-water interface and underlines the importance of the benthic macro fauna as ecosystem engineers.",

            "abstract": "Lithospheric and mantle dynamics beneath the European Alps have been linked to surface deformation and uplift, but the deep structure itself remains a matter of debate. Some tomographic studies suggest a subduction polarity flip along strike, whereas others infer that there are two vertical and/or partly detached slabs. Both scenarios may affect the dynamics of the lithosphere and flow in the upper mantle in distinct ways. We set out to explore the dynamic predictions of these models so as to understand the range of likely scenarios, and also to guide future geological and geophysical studies. We perform high-resolution, regional scale models of coupled mantle-lithospheric deformation. These 3D geomechanical models are discretized with finite differences and realized with a parallel code (LaMEM). It includes an internal free surface and a detailed, isostatically balanced crustal/lithospheric model based on seismological interpretations. Quasi-instantaneous computations are performed for various geometries (a single vertical slab, a slab that is partly detached, and two slabs with opposite vergence) and we vary both, the densities and effective viscosities of the slabs. We find that the effect of geometry is much smaller than the effect of effective viscosity of the slabs. If the viscosity contrast between slab and asthenosphere is relatively small, mantle flow is predominantly vertical, whereas significant (anticlockwise) toroidal flow occurs at the eastern edge of the Alps for larger viscosity contrasts (> 500). This toroidal flow is not very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the sub-Alpine slab configuration but is rather caused by the slab roll-back underneath the northern Apennines. Partial slab breakoff, however, has a discernable effect with higher average elevations above locations where the slab detached. In some of our models, we obtain Alp-parallel flow, which roughly corresponds to inferences from recent studies on azimuthal seismic anisotropy. Our results suggest that future seismological studies should not only focus on the Alpine chain itself but also include the wider region.\nThis study was funded by ERC Starting Grant 258830",

            "abstract": "Medium-to-long range streamflow forecast provide a key assistance in anticipating hydro- climatic adverse events and prompting effective adaptation measures. For instance, accurate medium-long range streamflow forecasts have a great potential to improve water reservoir operation by enabling more efficient allocation of water volumes in time (e.g. via hedging). Unfortunately, these forecasts often lacks reliability and accuracy, especially when low-frequency climate forcing (e.g. ENSO) is not intense enough to improve the forecast lead time (e.g. in Europe), and might be computationally very demanding,\nIn this work, we explore the direct use of both rough snow data (e.g. snow depth) and snow water equivalent estimates as surrogate of medium-to-long range streamflow forecast to inform the operation of a regulated lake. The underlying idea is that snow data contains key information on current and future water availability throughout the snow melting season that might significantly improve the operation’s anticipation potential. We adopt a three step methodology: First, we compute the upper bound of the system performance by assuming perfect foresight and we assess the value of additional information as the difference between this ideal solution and current operation. Using input variable selection, we then select the most relevant snow information to explain the release trajectory associated to the upper bound operating policy. Finally, we derive the optimal policy conditioned upon the selected variables by Multi-Objecting Evolutionary Direct Policy Search.\nThe methodology is demonstrated on the snow-dominated Lake Como river basin, in the Italian Alps. Lake Como is a regulated lake primarily used to supply water to a large cultivated area and snowmelt from May-July is the most important contribution to the creation of the seasonal storage.\nResults show that using raw data or simple SWE estimates can largely improve anticipation capability in the daily operation of the lake thus increasing the reservoir hedging potential and the overall system performance over irrigation deficit.",

In a collaborative effort between Chilean/Peruvian/French/German and USA institutions, we performed seismic and geodetic intervention campaigns in response to the Pisagua earthquake, with the ultimate goal of achieving a better understanding of the mechanical properties and physical processes occurring at the subduction zone that control, for instance, the generation of large earthquakes and potential tsunamis.

            "abstract": "The transition at the end of the Archean between the generation of cratonic and mobile belt continental lithosphere is regarded as a first-order change in the mode of generation of continental lithosphere. It is widely debated whether this transition represented a fundamental change in the process by which the lithospheric mantle was generated (i.e., as melting residues of deep-seated mantle upwellings to residues of relatively shallow mantle melting at subduction zones), or whether it primarily reflected a more gradual change in the conditions (i.e., temperatures, depths and degrees of melting) of lithosphere generation in a suprasubduction zone setting. The marked contrast, in many cases, between the major element compositions of peridotite xenoliths from Archean cratons and those from adjacent post-Archean mobile belts has accentuated the significance of this transition. Peridotite xenoliths from the post-Archean mobile belt terranes surrounding the Kaapvaal craton in southern Africa are clearly Proterozoic in age from Re-Os isotope constraints, but they are unusual in that they share several key similarities in composition and mineralogy with Archean Kaapvaal peridotites (e.g., low bulk-rock Al2O3, relatively low modal olivine and high modal orthopyroxene). Although they lack the low FeO and high olivine Mg# values of the most extreme Kaapvaal samples, they show a very large degree of overlap (extending to olivine Mg# values of greater than 93 for example). These similarities support a common mode of origin for cratonic and post-cratonic lithosphere in southern Africa (although varying somewhat in the degrees and depths of melt extraction) and a similar history of post-formation modification. A comparison of the conditions of melt extraction for cratonic and post-cratonic lithosphere inferred from compatible and mildly incompatible trace elements will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The sustainability of water resources is threatened by urbanization, as increasing demands deplete water availability, and changes to the landscape alter runoff and the flow regime of receiving water bodies. Utility managers typically manage urban water resources through the use of centralized solutions, such as large reservoirs, which may be limited in their ability balance the needs of urbanization and ecological systems. Decentralized technologies, on the other hand, may improve the health of the water resources system and deliver urban water services. For example, low impact development technologies, such as rainwater harvesting, and water-efficient technologies, such as low-flow faucets and toilets, may be adopted by households to retain rainwater and reduce demands, offsetting the need for new centralized infrastructure.\nDecentralized technologies may create new complexities in infrastructure and water management, as decentralization depends on community behavior and participation beyond traditional water resources planning. Messages about water shortages and water quality from peers and the water utility managers can influence the adoption of new technologies. As a result, feedbacks between consumers and water resources emerge, creating a complex system. This research develops a framework to simulate the diffusion of water-efficient innovations and the sustainability of urban water resources, by coupling models of households in a community, hydrologic models of a water resources system, and a cellular automata model of land use change. Agent-based models are developed to simulate the land use and water demand decisions of individual households, and behavioral rules are encoded to simulate communication with other agents and adoption of decentralized technologies, using a model of the diffusion of innovation. The framework is applied for an illustrative case study to simulate water resources sustainability over a long-term planning horizon.",

In this presentation we suggest that this may be a consequence of the action of kinetic scale ultra-low frequency electromagnetic field variations or kinetic Alfven waves and eigenmodes. We show how these waves originate in the plasma sheet and subsequently fill a large fraction of the inner magnetosphere during storm times. The amplitude of the eigenmodes can exceed 100 mV/m. These fluctuations have the capacity to break the traditional invariants constraining ion motion to drive very rapid energisation and heating of the ion plasma. We show how these waves can lead to large increases in particle pressure due to the extraction and continuous acceleration of oxygen ions from the ionosphere and injected ions from the plasma sheet. These waves present a new mechanism for enhancing the ring current that both observations and simulations indicate should be active during storm times.",

            "abstract": "Advances in multi-collection plasma source mass spectrometry have allowed the determination of stable isotope composition of transition metals to address questions relevant to both high and low temperature geochemistry. However, titanium has received only very limited attention. Here we present a new technique allowing the determination of the stable isotope composition of titanium in geological samples (d49Ti or deviation of the 49Ti/47Ti ratio from the OL-Ti in-house standard of reference) using double-spike methodology and high-resolution MC-ICP-MS. We have carried out a range analytical tests for a wide spectrum of samples matrices to demonstrate a external reproducibility of ±0.02‰ on the d49Ti while using as little as 150ng of natural Ti for a single analysis.\nWe have analysed a comprehensive selection of mantle-derived samples covering a range of geodynamic contexts (MORB, IAB, OIB, adakites, eclogites, serpentines) and geographical distribution (MORB: Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Southwest Indian Ridge and Eastern Pacific Ridge; IAB: New Britain reference suite and Marianas Arc). The samples show a very limited range from -0.06‰ to +0.04‰ with a main mode at +0.004‰ relative to the OL-Ti standard. Average values for MORB, IAB and eclogites are similar within uncertainty and thus argue for limited mobility of Ti during subduction zone processes and homogeneity of the Ti stable isotope composition of the upper mantle. However, preliminary data for more evolved igneous rocks suggest that they display heavier Ti stable isotope compositions, which may reflect the removal of isotopically light Ti as a function of Fe-Ti oxide crystallisation. This is in good agreement with Ti being present in 5-fold and 6-fold coordination in basaltic melts and preferential uptake of 6-folded Ti by Ti-bearing oxides [1].\nThis dataset will be complemented by analysis of abyssal peridotites to confirm the homogeneity of the mantle as well as data for a range of ferromanganese crusts in order to explore the potential applications of Ti stable isotopes as a new tracer in paleoceanography.\n[1] Farges F. and Brown G.E., 1997, GCA, 1863–1870",

            "abstract": "Tropical Storm Irene generated devastating floods in New England in 2011, causing more than $500 million of damage. In intervening years, many geomorphic signs of disturbance have attenuated, suggesting that impacts may be ephemeral. Yet persistent impact continues: channel-proximal landslide scars linger as point sources of fine sediment 3 yrs post-Irene. We evaluate the legacy of this major disturbance while also testing conceptual models of hillslope-channel connectivity and subsequent downstream sediment routing. We measure sustained landslide erosion by comparing DEMs generated by a Terrestrial Laser Scanner and trace sediment mobility using in-channel measurements of embeddedness, sediment concentration, and fallout radionuclide activity. We augmented detailed temporal sampling of an 850 m2 landslide along a 2nd-order stream with a spatially robust summer 2014 field campaign, scanning an additional 12 landslides. The initially sampled landslide eroded 250 m3 of sediment between fall 2013 and May 2014, averaging 0.3 m of erosion with nearly all erosion occurring during a two-week spring snowmelt. Landslide sediments had high measured 7Be activity (t1/2=53.4 d), caused by subaerial exposure; sediment collected downstream of the landslide had higher 7Be activity than that collected upstream, suggesting landslide provenance. Channel sediment upstream of the landslide had remained in the channel long enough for 7Be to decay below detectable activity. Embeddedness, a measure of fine sediment on a channel bed, was higher downstream of the landslide than upstream. Remote sensing reveals >50 similar landslides within the White River alone, and hundreds more in Vermont. Thus, landslide scar inputs may continue to influence the regional fine sediment budget. Ongoing successive scans in multiple watersheds show erosion continues in summer, an observation corroborated by elevated suspended sediment concentrations downstream of landslides after rain events. Summertime erosion has generally been low, but one extreme storm triggered >4000 m3 of erosion on a 3500 m2 landslide along the 5th-order Williams River, averaging 1.3 m erosion across the landslide. Understanding the loci of affected reaches and the magnitude of the continued effect is critical in assessing the long-term legacy of extreme events.",

            "abstract": "Recent global climate models for Late Noachian Mars have underlined the difficulty of producing and sustaining a “warm and wet” early Mars, suggesting instead a cold and icy late Noachian climate dominated by stable ice sheets in the highlands and a horizontally stratified hydrological system. If Late Noachian Mars was “cold and icy”, how can one explain the origin and distribution of the extensive valley networks and abundant open basin lakes? Could periodic or catastrophic melting of highland ice sheets produce the observed features? Are there areas where the horizontally stratified hydrological system is breached to enable communication with the groundwater system below? Would such scenarios lead to habitable environments? Analogs of aqueous environments and biological settings from the McMurdo Dry Valleys are combined with assessment of several top-down and bottom-up melting mechanisms for the Late Noachian Icy Highlands to outline predictions for the location and duration of potential habitable environments. Explored are 1) the volumes of ice available and the possibility that ice distribution and thickness are “supply-limited”, 2) the areal distribution of available ice, 3) the total amount of meltwater necessary to account for the observed features, 4) the predicted duration of aqueous production and longevity of aqueous environments under different melting scenarios, 5) the predicted geomorphic features formed by these mechanisms, and 6) similarities of these predicted features to the distribution and morphologic/morphometric characteristics of observed valley networks and open-basin lakes. The results are interpreted in the context of known habitable environments in the Mars-like hyperarid, hypothermal McMurdo Dry Valleys, comparing and assessing the locations of meltwater production and biological activity, the stratification of the hydrological system, and communication with the groundwater system below. Predictions are made for remote sensing signatures of these environments that might be recognized on Mars as candidates for ExoMars and Mars 2020 landing sites.\n ",

Although engineered structures are still preferred for coastal safety there is an increasing number of applications of ecosystem-based solutions worldwide as the building with nature approaches and the arising natural capital evaluation.\nA question to which we should respond, is the possibility of using the wide range of satellite data and the already available Earth Observation based products to make a synoptic structural and environmental vulnerability assessment. By answering to this, we could also understand, if and how many markers/signals can be identified in the landscape components, to define transitions to and from nonlinear processes - to and from scale invariant spatial distributions- characterizing the evolution of the environmental patch size mosaic, the landscape.\nThe Wadden Sea, in example, is a productive estuarine area in the south-eastern coastal zone of the North Sea. It is characterized by extensive tidal mud flats, saltmarshes and by the tidal channel network between the mainland and the chain of islands along the North Sea side. The area has a UNESCO World Heritage Status and a Natura 2000 status.\nHere, we identified thresholds to distinguish spatial and temporal patterns controlled by changes in environmental variables. These patterns are represented by the cover percent and by the structural level of vegetation and sediment/soil in each identified patch. The environmental variables are those able to act on the patch size distribution as the forcing factors from the sea (wind and waves fields) or from the climate and the hydrology drivers.\nThe Bayesian approach defines the dependencies of the spatial patch size distribution from the major flooding and erosion environmental variables. When the analysis is scaled up from the ecosystem units to the landscape level thanks to the satellite-based observations, new spatial and temporal distributions are highlighted and new Bayes models can be implemented.\nResults are useful to better understand the relative contributions of different components to coastal vulnerability and highlight the protective services offered by Earth Observation based products to coastal populations.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation and climate during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) were considerably different than during the current interglacial (Holocene). In Europe large areas north of 40°N were entirely covered by continental ice-sheets and widespread permafrost, with temperatures around 10-20°C lower than at present, whereas further south aridity and temperatures 7-10°C cooler than today occurred. Cool climatic conditions and growing ice-sheets during the LGM radically reduced forest extent and diversity in Europe to a restricted number of so-called “refugia”, mostly located in the southern part of the continent. The Euganian Hills in northeastern Italy are supposed to be one of the northernmost refugia of thermophilous mixed oak forest species (e.g. deciduous Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer, Carpinus, Castanea) as well of some temperate mesophilous species (e.g. Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba) in Europe. In this study we present the first European chironomid-based quantitative temperature reconstruction for the LGM and address the question whether climate conditions were warm enough to permit the local survival of Quercetum mixtum species between ca. 31’000-17’000 cal yr BP.\nChironomids preserved in a lake sediment core from Lago della Costa (7m a.s.l.), a lake on the border of the Euganean Hills in northeastern Italy, allowed quantitative reconstruction of Full and Late Glacial July air temperatures using a combined Swiss-Norwegian temperature inference model based on chironomid assemblages from 274 lakes. Our results suggest that July air temperatures never fell below 10°C which are considered necessary for forest growth. In general, mild climatic conditions prevailed between ca. 31’000-17’000 cal yr BP with temperatures ranging from ca. 11°C to 15.7°C. The expansion of thermophilous trees such as Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer, Carpinus, Castanea (Quercetum mixtum) between ca. 30’000-23’000 cal yr BP can most likely be explained by climate warming (ca. 14°C), conversely, the local contraction of these taxa between ca. 23’000-18’500 cal yr BP was possibly triggered by cooler summer air temperatures (ca. 13.4°C) and a significant moisture decline during the LGM.",

            "abstract": "The New Hebrides island arc, located in the southwestern Pacific, is associated with the fast subduction of the Australian Plate under the North Fiji Basin. It extends over 1500 km including the entire Vanuatu archipelago. Several studies dealing with the geochemistry of the most important islands interpret the chemical variability to originate from the heterogeneities in the sub-arc mantle wedge1 and variable addition of the subduction component along the arc2. In order to trace the differences between the source(s) of New Hebrides volcanic arc and back-arc magmatism, five submarine cones (4 of them aligned NE-SW), located in the Futuna Through, were sampled. The lavas range from basalt to andesite with fractionation of olivine being the main magma evolution mechanism until MgO ≈ 6 wt.%. The most primitive lavas have similar fractionation-corrected TiO2 (0.90–1.18 wt.%) and Na2O (2.89–3.41 wt.%) contents suggesting comparable degrees of partial melting. The comparison with published data from adjacent islands shows a more important contribution of the slab closer to the trench (Tanna) where the erupted basalts, basaltic trachyandesites and trachyandesites have considerably higher U/Nb and Ba/Nb ratios. Yet, these lavas display significant negative Sr anomalies (PM-normalized). This could provide evidence of input of continental derived sediments or could reflect the role of plagioclase in the source / evolution of these magmas. The first hypothesis is not supported by published data from the Vanuatu trench3 and the second is not supported by the decoupled behavior of Sr and Eu in normalized-diagrams. On the other hand, island crust samples collected along the northern flank of Futuna Island display strong positive anomalies of Sr and, although more modest, the submarine cones show a similar behavior. Based on source chemical tracers, an increasing depletion of the source is observed from east to west, consistent with progressive mantle flow towards the arc front4.\n1Greene et al.

In humid regions where variable source area (VSA) hydrology dominates, such as the Northeastern US, topographic wetness indices (TWI) are good approximations of relative soil moisture patterns. Mapping areas of the landscape likely to generate saturation-excess runoff and carry NPS pollution to surface waters could allow for more efficient, targeted best management practices in agricultural fields. Given the relationship between saturation excess runoff and soil water storage, we used volumetric water content (VWC) measured in five agricultural fields in central New York over two years (2012-2014) to develop runoff probability maps based on a soil topographic index (STI). The relationship between VWC and STI was strongest during the fall season after leaf fall at all sites except one. We calculated the probability of runoff occurring based on soil moisture and precipitation distributions during the sampling period. The threshold for runoff occurs when the depth of soil water and rainfall reach saturation of the soil, and appears to be at the average porosity of the soil at all sites. Counter to our initial hypothesis of a higher probability of saturation excess runoff during the spring when conditions are wetter, some sites showed higher frequencies of runoff during the fall season.",

            "abstract": "Over the last two centuries, convergence between India and Tibet has outpaced the cumulative slip released through Himalayan earthquakes and have resulted in seismic gap across Kashmir Himalaya. Recent GPS geodetic data from Kashmir show that the ongoing convergence is accumulated as elastic strain within a ~200 km wide locked decollement and is sufficiently stressed to drive a magnitude 8 or greater event. Recently published focal mechanism of the mb 5.7 (2013) Kishtwar earthquake and hypocentral distribution of small-to-moderate seismicity for the past 60 years, showed that the down dip end of the locked decollement is currently active and could possibly be the site of initiation of a future great earthquake. In order to assess the seismic hazard in this Kashmir gap, we require a detailed knowledge of the lithospheric structure and use it to reliably locate active faults. A pilot seismological experiment, of nine broadband seismographs, have been deployed across the Kashmir Himalaya to achieve this goal. These stations are sited on the Siwalik Himalaya (AKNR, NGRT, SMVD, SUND and TAPN), the Lesser Himalaya (RAMN and UDHM) and the Higher Himalaya (BADR and PHAG), and straddle major Himalayan thrust zones. Most of these stations have recorded high quality broadband data for a year, which has been used to compute receiver functions and relocate local earthquakes. The Moho Ps is the strongest arrival on all the receiver functions, and highlights the base of the underthrusting Indian crust as a large impedance contrast boundary. Forward modeling of receiver functions show that the crustal thickness increases from ~40 km beneath the Siwalik Himalaya to ~48 km beneath the Lesser Himalaya and to ~52 km beneath the Higher Himalaya. The average crustal Vp/Vs points to a felsic Indian crust underthrusting the Kashmir Himalaya. Relocated local earthquakes cluster around the hypocenter of the Kishtwar earthquake and attests to the active downdip end of the locked decollement.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations show that the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has been losing mass with an increasing speed during the past decades. Predicting the GrIS changes and their climate consequences relies on the understanding of the interaction of the GrIS with the climate system on both global and local scales, and requires climate model systems with an explicit and physically consistent ice sheet module.\nA fully coupled global climate model with a dynamical ice sheet model for the GrIS has recently been developed. The model system, EC-EARTH – PISM, consists of the EC-EARTH, an atmosphere, ocean and sea ice model system, and the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM). The coupling of PISM includes a modified surface physical parameterization in EC-EARTH adapted to the land ice surface over glaciated regions in Greenland. The PISM ice sheet model is forced with the surface mass balance (SMB) directly computed inside the EC-EARTH atmospheric module and accounting for the precipitation, the surface evaporation, and the melting of snow and ice over land ice. PISM returns the simulated basal melt, ice discharge and ice cover (extent and thickness) as boundary conditions to EC-EARTH. This coupled system is mass and energy conserving without being constrained by any anomaly correction or flux adjustment, and hence is suitable for investigation of ice sheet – climate feedbacks.\nThree multi-century experiments for warm climate scenarios under (1) the RCP85 climate forcing, (2) an abrupt 4xCO2 and (3) an idealized 1% per year CO2 increase are performed using the coupled model system. The experiments are compared with their counterparts of the standard CMIP5 simulations (without the interactive ice sheet) to evaluate the performance of the coupled system and to quantify the GrIS feedbacks. In particular, the evolution of the Greenland ice sheet under the warm climate and its impacts on the climate system are investigated. Freshwater fluxes from the Greenland ice sheet melt to the Arctic and North Atlantic basin and their influence on the ocean stratification and ocean circulation are analysed. The changes in the surface climate and the atmospheric circulation associated with the impact of the Greenland ice sheet changes are quantified. The interaction between the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic sea ice is also examined.",

From north to south, along the western side of the Panamint Range, the Mosaic Canyon fault yields an authigenic illite age of 16.9±2.9 Ma, the Emigrant fault has ages of less than 10-12 Ma at Tucki Mountain and Wildrose Canyon, and an age of 3.6±0.17 Ma was obtained for the Panamint Front Range LANF at South Park Canyon. Across Death Valley, along the western side of the Black Mountains, Ar ages of clay minerals are 3.2±3.9 Ma, 12.2±0.13 Ma and 2.8±0.45 Ma for the Amargosa Detachment, the Gregory Peak Fault and the Mormon Point Turtleback detachment, respectively. Complementary analysis of the δH composition of neoformed clays shows a primarily meteoric source for the mineralizing fluids in these LANF zones. The ages fall into two geologic timespans, reflecting activity pulses in the Middle Miocene and in the Upper Pliocene. Activity on both of the range front LANFs does not appear to be localized on any single portion of these fault systems. Middle Miocene fault rock ages of neoformed clays were also obtained in the Ruby Mountains (10.5±1.2 Ma) to the north of the Death Valley region and to the south in the Whipple Mountains (14.3±0.19 Ma). The presence of similar, bracketed times of activity indicate that LANFs in the Death Valley region were tectonically linked, while isotopic signatures indicate that faulting pulses involved surface fluid penetration.",

            "abstract": "Cryoturbation is the movement of soil particles through repeated freeze-thaw events, resulting in the burial of large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Non-sorted circles are a common type of cryoturbated ground in arctic and alpine areas underlain by permafrost. They appear as sparsely vegetated areas surrounded by denser tundra vegetation. Climate change in arctic environments will likely increase winter precipitation in large parts of the Arctic in Europe, Asia and America, resulting in deeper snow cover. Snow is a good thermal insulator and modifications in freezing intensity and freeze-thaw cycles are therefore likely, which could affect the burial of organic matter. Moreover, vegetation, soil fauna and soil microbial communities, which are important drivers of SOC dynamics, may be impacted directly by the altered winter conditions and indirectly by reduced cryoturbation. We aimed to investigate this, and therefore subjected non-sorted circles in North-Swedish subarctic alpine tundra to two years of increased thermal insulation in winter and spring, using snow fences or fibre cloth (Figure 1).\nBoth snow fences and fibre cloth manipulations increased surface soil temperatures, especially daily minimum temperatures, and strongly reduced freeze-thaw frequency. We compared the impacts of these manipulations on plant performance, soil chemistry, soil fauna and soil microbial communities between the centre of the circles and the dense tundra heath just outside. Directly after snowmelt, the extra winter insulation decreased plant leaf damage, both in the centre and in adjacent tundra, but responses differed between species. We will further present the responses of plant phenology and growth, soil pH and dissolved organic carbon content, soil fauna activity, Collembola community composition and body size distribution, as well as fungal and bacterial diversity profiles and functional groups abundance.\nWe expect that winter warming due to increased snow cover and its effects on cryoturbation will stimulate the biotic components of non-sorted circles, but may change the interactions between organisms at different trophic levels of this ecosystem. The resulting new balance between increased productivity and decomposer activity might have large implications for this important carbon pool.",

Its main scientific objective is to elucidate the universal physical processes at work in the Auroral Acceleration Region (AAR). The AAR is a unique laboratory for investigating strongly magnetized plasmas at an interface where ideal magneto-hydrodynamics does not apply. The Alfvén mission will investigate fundamental and multi-scale physical processes that govern what Nobel Prize laureate Hannes Alfvén named the Plasma Universe. The mission concept is designed to teach us where and how the particles that create the aurorae are accelerated, how they emit radiation, and to elucidate the ion heating and outflow processes which are slowly removing the Earth's atmosphere. The only way to distinguish between the models describing acceleration processes at the heart of Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MI) coupling is to combine high-time resolution in situ measurements (as pioneered by the FAST mission), multi-point measurements (as pioneered by CLUSTER), and auroral arc imaging in one mission. Taking advantage of the existing dense network of ground based observatories the Alfvén mission will also allow a major breakthrough in our understanding of solar terrestrial relationships by providing key experimental measurements to large scale models of MI electrodynamics.\n ",

            "abstract": "The recent release of the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) model for Europe by the SHARE project (Giardini et al., 2013,\nwww.share-eu.org\n) arises questions about the comparison between its results for Italy and the official Italian seismic hazard model (MPS04; Stucchi et al., 2011) adopted by the building code. The goal of such a comparison is identifying the main input elements that produce the differences between the two models. It is worthwhile to remark that each PSHA is realized with data and knowledge available at the time of the release. Therefore, even if a new model provides estimates significantly different from the previous ones that does not mean that old models are wrong, but probably that the current knowledge is strongly changed and improved.\nLooking at the hazard maps with 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years (adopted as the standard input in the Italian building code), the SHARE model shows increased expected values with respect to the MPS04 model, up to 70% for PGA. However, looking in detail at all output parameters of both the models, we observe a different behaviour for other spectral accelerations. In fact, for spectral periods greater than 0.3 s, the current reference PSHA for Italy proposes higher values than the SHARE model for many and large areas. This observation suggests that this behaviour could not be due to a different definition of seismic sources and relevant seismicity rates; it mainly seems the result of the adoption of recent ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) that estimate higher values for PGA and for accelerations with periods lower than 0.3 s and lower values for higher periods with respect to old GMPEs. Another important set of tests consisted in analysing separately the PSHA results obtained by the three source models adopted in SHARE (i.e., area sources, fault sources with background, and a refined smoothed seismicity model), whereas MPS04 only uses area sources. Results seem to confirm the strong impact of the new generation GMPEs on the seismic hazard estimates.\nGiardini D. et al., 2013.

High resolution DEM gathered by LiDAR could denote actual terrain information despite the existence of plantation. 1-meter interval DEM of mountain region at Taiwan is utilized by fractal, entropy and roughness calculating with MATLAB code. By jointing these handing, the regions of non-sediment deposit are charted automatically. Possible blind fault associated with Chia-Sen earthquake at southern Taiwan is served as testing ground. GIS layer help in removing the difference from various geological formation, then multi-resolution fractal index is computed around the target region. The type of fault movement controls distribution of fractal index number. The scale of blind fault governs degree of change in fractal index. Landslide induced by rainfall and/or earthquake possesses larger degree of geomorphology alteration than blind fault; special treatment in removing these phenomena is required. Highly weathered condition at Taiwan should erase the possible trace remained upon DEM from the ruptured of blind fault while reoccurrence interval is higher than hundreds of years.

            "abstract": "This paper highlights the findings from a couple of recent investigations aimed at characterizing and predicting the long-term drought propensity at a region for effective water management. A probabilistic index, named as Drought Management Index (DMI), was proposed for assessing the drought propensity on a multi-year scale at the chosen study area. The novelty of this index lay in the fact that it employed the Reliability-Resilience-Vulnerability (RRV) rationale, commonly used in water resources systems analysis, with the assumption that depletion of soil moisture across a vertical soil column is analogous to the operation of a water supply reservoir. This was the very first attempt to incorporate into a drought index the resilience of soil moisture series, which denotes the readiness of soil moisture to bounce back from drought to normal state. Further, the predictability of DMI was explored to assess the future drought propensity, which is essential for adopting suitable drought management policies at any location. For computing DMI, the intermediate measures i.e., RRV were obtained using the Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) as the threshold, indicative of transition into water stress. The joint distribution of resilience and vulnerability of soil moisture series was subsequently determined using Plackett copula. The DMI was designed such that it increases with increase in vulnerability as well as with decrease in resilience and vice versa. Thus, it was expressed as the joint probability of exceedence of resilience and non-exceedence of vulnerability of a soil moisture series. An assessment of the sensitivity of the DMI to the length of the data segments indicated that a 5-year temporal scale is optimum to obtain stable estimates of DMI. The ability of the DMI to reflect the spatio-temporal variation of drought propensity was illustrated using India as a test bed. Based on the observed behaviour of DMI series across India, on a climatological time scale, a DMI prediction model comprising of deterministic and stochastic components was developed. It was found to indicate a reasonably good prediction skill at many, if not most, locations over the country thereby establishing the potential of DMI for drought management in the medium term water resources planning horizon.",

            "abstract": "The growth and decay of ocean island volcanoes is intrinsically linked to vertical movements; whilst mechanisms for subsidence are well understood, uplift mechanisms are still very enigmatic. Santa Maria Island in the Azores is an ocean island volcano with a complex evolutionary history with subsidence followed by uplift. The island emerged by surtseyan activity at approximately 6 Ma, entailing in the formation of a subaerial shield volcano that was fully developed by ~5.6 Ma. The edifice then experienced a period of intense erosion and subsidence, during which it was partially or completely truncated to a shallow submarine bank. Around 5 Ma, volcanism resumed on the eastern side of the edifice, with occasional submarine/surtseyan activity synchronous with marine deposition. By ~4.3 Ma, volcanism grew in intensity forming a new edifice centred on the eastern flank of the underlying edifice. This new volcanic edifice started as submarine and then, as it gradually grew upwards and outpaced subsidence, breached sea level and formed a new island. The new edifice kept growing eastwards and northwards until ~3.5 Ma, when volcanic activity waned. At 3.5-3.2 Ma, however, subsidence reversed to an uplift trend that extended throughout the Upper Pleistocene into the present. This uplift trend is responsible for the generation of a staircase of shore platforms on the windward side of the island, which extends up to ~230 m in elevation. The fact that an island located in very young lithosphere experienced such a pronounced uplift trend is remarkable and raises important questions concerning possible uplift mechanisms. The loading of the neighbouring island of São Miguel may account for part of the uplift, but not the majority. Vertical tectonics along the nearby Gloria Fault is not completely implausible but unlikely to be a source of significant uplift due to its dominant strike-slip character. Thus, other mechanisms need to be considered, most notably intrusions at the base of the edifice and crustal thickening, suggesting that these play a significant role even on islands standing on a young lithosphere, such as in the Azores.",

Since then the KCC has not only maintained curatorial standards of the IODP, but also added many services for convenience of the IODP researchers that include curation of cuttings and deep frozen aliquots of cores, open access to logging equipment in the KCC for core measurements, virtual core library to provide quick online access to 3-D XCT images of the cores collected by the D/V Chikyu, online summary of the cores being curated in the KCC, and up-to-date online images of working half to show status of samples available for prospective users. With its existing stock of 104 km of the IODP & Legacy cores and cores to be recovered from the Indian Ocean in near future by the JOIDES Resolution, and a huge new reefer building with storage capacity of ca. 150 km core becoming part of the KCC this August, the KCC is bound to play a significant role in promoting earth and biogeo-sciences throughout the world, especially in neighboring Asian countries.",

Based on a multi-stranded model of coronal loops satisfying the one-dimensional hydrodynamics equations, we study the cooling of coronal loops from a steady state. We perform the analysis of the cooling phases by comparing the evolution of the loops in different SDO/AIA EUV channels. The appearance and timing of the cooling in a SDO/AIA channel depend on the initial thermodynamics parameters of the loop: hotter is the loop, faster the loop will cool. Therefore, based the temperature response function of individual filters, we deduce the temperature of the steady-state loop from the ordering of the observed light curves. The time evolution of the temperature during the cooling phase can also be approximated from the light curves. This method providing a temperature diagnostic of coronal loops is successfully applied to published data of flaring loops.",

            "abstract": "At present, there are no globally available Earth observation (EO) derived products on crop maps. This issue is being addressed within the Sentinel-2 for Agriculture initiative where a number of test sites (including from JECAM) participate to provide coherent protocols and best practices for various global agriculture systems, and subsequently crop maps from Sentinel-2. One of the problems in dealing with optical images for large territories (more than 10,000 sq. km) is the presence of clouds and shadows that result in having missing values in data sets. In this abstract, a new approach to classification of multi-temporal optical satellite imagery with missing data due to clouds and shadows is proposed.\nFirst, self-organizing Kohonen maps (SOMs) are used to restore missing pixel values in a time series of satellite imagery. SOMs are trained for each spectral band separately using non-missing values. Missing values are restored through a special procedure that substitutes input sample's missing components with neuron's weight coefficients. After missing data restoration, a supervised classification is performed for multi-temporal satellite images. For this, an ensemble of neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is proposed. Ensembling of neural networks is done by the technique of average committee, i.e. to calculate the average class probability over classifiers and select the class with the highest average posterior probability for the given input sample. The proposed approach is applied for large scale crop classification using multi temporal Landsat-8 images for the JECAM test site in Ukraine [1-2]. It is shown that ensemble of MLPs provides better performance than a single neural network in terms of overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient. The obtained classification map is also validated through estimated crop and forest areas and comparison to official statistics.\n1. A.Yu.

We describe the feature of terraces derived from deposit or down-cutting of the Yellow River in Zhongwei Basin that records the evolution of landform in this region. After clarifying the correlation among terrace remnants, we determine the age of certain terraces by TCN and ESR. The TCN dating yields age for lowest terrace buried in the basin of 2.40±0.38 Ma, and the ESR dating for upper three terraces on hillslope adjacent the margin of the basin of 2.08±0.21Ma, 1.88±0.35Ma and 1.48±0.11Ma respectively. The fact that buried terrace is older than the ones distribute on high elevation suggests that spatial variation in vertical motions of the basin. Taken with the observation and ages of these landform features, we infer to a deceleration of depression in center of the basin after terrace was buried in Late Piocene, then the basin started to uplift rapidly, causing the river gradient to steepen locally and erosion of the channel to intensify, resulting to the terrace on high elevation nearby the basin.",

Here we presented the first in situ aircraft measurements of IO using broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy with 1s -sensitivity of ~1.5 ppt Hz-1/2 on the surface level during the Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics (CAST) campaign between January – February 2014. IO was retrieved from analysis of absorption spectrum recorded between 415 nm – 452.5 nm. Instrument baseline corresponding to the “zero” signal of IO was obtained by injection of ~20 ppb of nitric oxide (NO) into the sample air at chosen frequency and period. No clear absorption feature was observable from the spectra by eye with up to 100 seconds averaging, pointing to very low mixing ratios (<~0.5 ppt) of IO over the sampled area. A small positive bias (~0.3 ppt) of IO (against the baseline signal during NO titration) was obtained in the statistical histogram of retrieved IO from average of each straight and level run, but little altitude dependence was noted. In summary, our observation appears to support the existence of IO in the remote marine boundary above the Pacific Ocean at sub ppt levels, but the limited sensitivity precludes us from quantifying spatial gradients more accurately.",

The first NASA Eearth Venture Instrument TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution) instrument is being developed to measure backscattered solar radiation in two channels (~290-490 and 540-740 nm) and make atmospheric pollution measurements over North America from the Geostationary orbit; the primary purpose of including the second channel is to improve lower tropospheric ozone retrieval for air quality monitoring. However, this retrieval enhancement has yet to be solidly demonstrated from existing measurements due to the weak ozone absorption in the visible and strong interference from surface reflectance.\nWe present retrievals from GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring and Experiment-2) UV and visible measurements using the SAO optimal estimation based ozone profile retrieval algorithm, to directly explore the retrieval improvement in lower tropospheric ozone from additional visible measurements. To reduce the retrieval interference from surface reflectance, we add characterization of surface spectral reflectance in the visible into the ozone profile algorithm based on existing surface reflectance spectra and MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) climatology. We evaluate the retrieval performance of UV/visible retrieval over the UV retrieval in terms of retrieved lower tropospheric ozone and increase in degree of free for signal (DFS) over the globe in different seasons, and we validate both retrievals against ozonesonde measurements.",

They are used in climate mitigation scenarios within integrated assessment models, complex climate model emulation, and uncertainty analyses. Here we describe, Hector an open source, object-oriented, simple global climate carbon-cycle model. This model runs essentially instantaneously while still representing the most critical global scale earth system processes, e.g., carbon fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere, and respiration and primary production on land. Hector has three main carbon pools: an atmosphere, land, and ocean. The terrestrial carbon cycle is represented by a simple design with respiration and primary production, accommodating arbitrary geographic divisions into, e.g., ecological biomes or political units. The ocean carbon cycle actively solves the inorganic carbon system in the surface ocean, directly calculating air-sea fluxes of carbon and ocean pH. Hector reproduces the large-scale global trends found in historical data of atmospheric [CO2] and surface temperature and simulates all four Representative Concentration Pathways. Hector’s results compare well with current observations of critical climate variables, MAGICC (a well-known simple climate model), as well as, model output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5. Hector has the ability to be a key analytical tool used across many scientific and policy communities due to its modern software architecture, open source, and object-oriented structure. In particular, Hector can be used to emulate larger complex models to help fill gaps in scenario coverage for future scenario processes.",

            "abstract": "The global average temperature is rising as a result of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. The two organic carbon gases that contribute most to this warming are carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). CH4, however, is 34 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 on a 100-year timescale, and 86 times more potent on a 20-year timescale. The ~12 year lifetime of CH4 means that measures to control methane emissions on the near-term time scale may have a relatively large climate benefit. The past decade has witnessed a dramatic increase in the reliance on natural gas (NG) to meet the energy needs of the U.S. To enable informed greenhouse gas policy and mitigation efforts, a comprehensive understanding of the nature and magnitude of CH4 emissions for various related NG technologies and engineering practices is required. Here we report results of our recent studies of the CH4 emission rate observed at eight different biogenic and NG point sources in the Barnett shale basin and a dozen well pads in the Eagle Ford shale region of Texas. We compare our field measurements to reported inventory estimates from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). Using an aircraft-based mass balance approach, we found that the summed observed CH4 emission rates for our study sites were a factor of 2.5 to 4.5 greater than the GHGRP-based estimates, for the 8 sources we investigated in the Barnett shale region. The sum of the 5 Barnett NG sources we quantified had on average CH4 emissions 17.5X higher than the GHGRP inventory indicates. The sum of the 3 landfill emission rates were on average 1.5X greater than the inventory values. In the Eagle Ford shale region, high variability was observed in repeated measurements at the same well pads, highlighting the difficulty of assessing the character and statistics of the distribution of emissions from individual pads. These results indicate a need for better methods of emissions monitoring and reporting and highlight the continuing importance of effectively connecting bottom up and top down methods.",

Samples from 67 locations were extracted from shallow snow pits and analyzed for trace elements, black carbon (see Polashenski et al. and Dibb et al. in session C004: Aerosols and the Cryosphere), and snow grain size (in terms of specific surface area) at depths comprising at least the previous year’s worth of snow accumulation at each site. In addition, surface characteristics of the snow including albedo, surface roughness and meteorological forcing were determined. Here, we present the spatial distribution of grain size reported as specific surface area determined from field measurements using the Takuvik International Laboratory DUal Frequency Integrating Sphere for Snow Specific area measurement (DUFISSS) instrument and from laboratory-based stereology and micro-CT measurements from snow samples that were preserved and shipped back to the lab. Grain sizes from 2014 are compared to 2013 results at coincident locations and comparable depths, and compared to the intervening year’s worth of meteorological data from Automated Weather Stations (AWSs) assembled by the SAGE field team at four locations along the 2013 and 2014 routes.",

            "abstract": "The coupling between subsurface flow and geomechanical deformation is critical in the assessment of the environmental impacts of groundwater use, underground liquid waste disposal, geologic storage of carbon dioxide, and exploitation of shale gas reserves. In particular, seismicity induced by fluid injection and withdrawal has emerged as a central element of the scientific discussion around subsurface technologies that tap into water and energy resources. Here we present a new computational approach to model coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics of faulted reservoirs. We represent faults as surfaces embedded in a three-dimensional medium by using zero-thickness interface elements to accurately model fault slip under dynamically evolving fluid pressure and fault strength. We incorporate the effect of fluid pressures from multiphase flow in the mechanical stability of faults and employ a rigorous formulation of nonlinear multiphase geomechanics that is capable of handling strong capillary effects. We develop a numerical simulation tool by coupling a multiphase flow simulator with a mechanics simulator, using the unconditionally stable fixed-stress scheme for the sequential solution of two-way coupling between flow and geomechanics. We validate our modeling approach using several synthetic, but realistic, test cases that illustrate the onset and evolution of earthquakes from fluid injection and withdrawal. We also present the application of the coupled flow-geomechanics simulation technology to the post mortem analysis of the Mw=5.1, May 2011 Lorca earthquake in south-east Spain, and assess the potential that the earthquake was induced by groundwater extraction.",

            "abstract": "Turkey is a region of active faulting and contains several strike-slip fault zones, which have generated both historical and recent large earthquakes. Two active fault zones in Turkey, the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) and the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ), divide the area into the Anatolian micro-plate accommodating WSW-directed movement. The southeastern continuation of the NAFZ is often referred to the Varto Fault Zone (VFZ). The VFZ cuts mainly Pliocene volcano-sedimentary units and/or Quaternary deposits and is characterized by multiple fault strands and multiple, closely spaced, active seismogenic zones. Fault motions in the zone are primarily right-lateral, with a subordinate component of NNW-SSE shortening.\nStudy area is Varto region in which indications of active faulting are very well preserved. We recognized three coseismic ruptures from five trench exposures. It is referred to these as events 1 (youngest) through 3 (oldest). The best evidence of event 3 comes from fault traces and its upward terminations. The major components of this fault are fault core and damage zone. The fault is not just one plane of discontinuity and bifurcates and creates additional slip surfaces, which propagate out of the plane of the original fault. Event 2 and event 1, referring to 1946 and 1966 earthquakes, are characterized primarily by discrete, regularly spaced normal faults with and 55-80 cm and 105-270 cm throws, respectively and geometry of growth strata.\nThe VFZ in the study area include typical structures of strike-slip fault zone. It forms a number of parallel and slightly sub-parallel strands striking N50°-72°W including contractional and extensional brittle structures. Several meters to tens of meters wavelength active folds with ENE-WSW and WNW-ESE trending fold axis. These folds deform the Plio-Quaternary units and show classic asymmetry associated with both a south- and north-vergent fault propagation fold. Meso-scale normal faults are also well developed in the region, where they strike NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE and usually dipping steply towards NE and SW. Almost all rocks display joints and shear fractures dipping moderately and steply. Our field and paleoseismological studies suggest that contractional structures are overprinted by extensional structures.",

            "abstract": "Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emission estimates from inland waters include emissions at ice melt that are based on simple assumptions rather than evidence. To account for CO2 accumulation below ice and potential emissions into the atmosphere at ice melt we combined continuous CO2 concentrations with spatial CO2 sampling in an ice-covered small boreal lake. From early ice cover to ice melt, our continuous surface water CO2 concentration measurements at 2 m depth showed a temporal development in four distinct phases: In early winter, CO2 accumulated continuously below ice, most likely due to biological in-lake and catchment inputs. Thereafter, in late winter, CO2 concentrations remained rather constant below ice, as catchment inputs were minimized and vertical mixing of hypolimnetic water was cut off. As ice melt began, surface water CO2 concentrations were rapidly changing, showing two distinct peaks, the first one reflecting horizontal mixing of CO2 from surface and catchment waters, the second one reflecting deep water mixing. We detected that 83% of the CO2 accumulated in the water during ice cover left the lake at ice melt which corresponded to one third of the total CO2 storage. Our results imply that CO2 emissions at ice melt must be accurately integrated into annual CO2 emission estimates from inland waters. If up-scaling approaches assume that CO2 accumulates linearly under ice and at ice melt all CO2 accumulated during ice cover period leaves the lake again, present estimates may overestimate CO2 emissions from small ice covered lakes. Likewise, neglecting CO2 spring outbursts will result in an underestimation of CO2 emissions from small ice covered lakes.",

            "abstract": "Geostationary satellites provide continuous cloud and meteorological observations over a fixed portion of the Earth’s surface, allowing them to monitor and track the development and movement of severe storm systems in real time. For climate studies, geostationary observations provide valuable insight of cloud formation and evolution and how they influence the Earth’s radiation budget. Five well-positioned geostationary satellites can cover most of the globe and their products can be merged into a uniform data set. Presently the constellation of these geostationary satellites consists of the NOAA GOES-West (135° W) and East (75° W), the EUMETSAT Meteosat-9 (9.5° E), the Chinese Feng-Yun (105° E), and the Japanese MTSAT-2 (140° E) platforms.\nStitching together observations from these imagers requires an understanding of their different spectral characteristics and calibrations. This paper presents the cloud detection algorithms developed using the imager data on the five geostationary satellites. The algorithms are used operationally in NASA’s Cloud and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Time and Space Averaging (TISA) gridded cloud products and for near-real-time retrievals used for weather and nowcasting applications. Examples of cloud mask results for different surface background (ocean, land, desert) and their diurnal changes will be described. Additionally, merged global cloud fractions and zonal cloud distributions are compared with CERES-MODIS, CALIPSO, and NASA LaRC AVHRR cloud fractions. Potential future improvements are discussed.",

            "abstract": "A slow-slip event is detected from June 2009 to October 2009 based on the analysis of coordinate time series from 22 continuous GPS stations in northeastern Taiwan, belonging to the backarc extension region of the Ryukyu subduction zone. The GPS data from 2006 to 2011 were processed using GAMIT software. The seasonal signals and common-mode errors were removed from the coordinate time series. Accumulative displacement pattern shows horizontal displacement direction towards SSE with the maximum value of ~9 mm. However, no significant vertical displacements are detected. The accumulative slip distribution and fault geometry parameters are inverted by surface accumulative displacements using the uniform stress drop inversion. The optimized model indicates a normal fault with a shallow dip angle of ~5° and a depth of ~8 km. A maximum of ~40 mm of slip is inferred near the eastern part of the study area. Comparison with rainfall data indicates that this slow slip event is not the seasonal response. Seismicity distribution and focal mechanism solutions imply that several nearly east-west-striking seismogenic zones develop and mainly act as left-lateral strike-slip faulting and normal faulting accompanying the opening of the backarc basin. The bottom depth of these seismogenic zones is ~10 km, corresponding to the depth of our inferred fault plane. A low Qp/Qs layer is also discovered at the same region, which suggests a high fluid within this layer. Therefore we suggest a shallow south-dipping décollement under the backarc basin in northeastern Taiwan. The relationship between this slow slip event and other regular large earthquakes in this region will be studied soon.",

            "abstract": "On the base of field work on the Franz Josef Land archipelago (FJL) in 2010 and 2011 the new paleomagnetic data are obtained from the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous magmatic complexes. Main focus of this work was concentrated on the Early-Jurassic basalts widely represented on the Hooker island [1]. Together with the previous data [2] statistically reasonable paleomagnetic pole for the age boundary of 190 million years for the FJL is received (PLat.=62.4; PLon.=140.2; dp/dm=5.5/5.0; N=13). Paleomagnetic data allow to assume that the position of the FJL relative to the Europe in the Early Jurassic significantly differs from the present one. But to the Early Cretaceous it reached relative position very close to the presently observed [2]. We suggest that at least during Early-Middle Jurassic there was rifting processes between the North Barentz terrane (FJL and (may be) Svalbard) and the other part of the European tectonic domain. This rift was accompanied by shifting of the FLJ to the north-eastward on about 500 km.\nAlso obtained paleomagnetic data agree with a hypothesis assuming that the FJL was passing over the Icelandic-Siberian hot spot during Jurassic-Cretaceous time: main paleolatitudes correspond to the Island’s present latitude and the paleolatitude of the Siberian trapps. Paleomagnetic study of FJL has a reconnaissance character and cannot lead to any ultimate deductions as the data is obviously not enough. And further work on the basaltic covers of the archipelago seems to be very promising. Research was supported by grant RFBR 13-05-00177.\n 1. Karyakin Yu.V., Shipilov E.V.

            "abstract": "The East African rift valley contains an outstanding record of hominin fossils that document human evolution over the Plio-Pleistocene when the global and regional climate and the rift valley itself changed markedly. The sediments of fossil localities typically provide, however, only short time windows into past climatic and environmental conditions. Continuous, long-term terrestrial records are now becoming available through core drilling to help elucidate the paleoenvironmental context of human evolution. Here we present a 500,000 year long high-resolution drill core record obtained from a key fossil and archeological site – the Olorgesailie Basin in the southern Kenya Rift Valley, well known for its sequence of archeological and faunal sites for the past 1.2 million years. In 2012 two drill cores (54 and 166 m long) were collected in the Koora Plain just south of Mt. Olorgesailie as part of the Olorgesailie Drilling Project (ODP) to establish a detailed climate and ecological record associated with the last evidence of Homo erectus in Africa, the oldest transition of Acheulean to Middle Stone Age technology, and large mammal species turnover, all of which are documented in the Olorgesailie excavations. The cores were sampled at the National Lacustrine Core Facility. More than 140 samples of tephra and trachytic basement lavas have led to high-precision 40Ar/39Ar dating. The cores are being analyzed for a suite of paleoclimatic and paleoecological proxies such as diatoms, pollen, fungal spores, phytoliths, ostracodes, carbonate isotopes, leaf wax biomarkers, charcoal, and clay mineralogy. Sedimentological analyses, including lithological descriptions, microscopic smear slide analysis (242 samples), and grain-size analysis, reveal a highly variable sedimentary sequence of deep lake phases with laminated sediments, diatomites, shallow lake and near shore phases, fluvial deposits, paleosols, interspersed carbonate layers, and abundant volcanic ash deposits.

            "abstract": "Snow density near the surface, i.e. the first 5 – 10 first centimeters, is essential for surface mass balance retrieval from satellite or stakes, thermal diffusion for surface energy budget, firn densification for ice-core interpretation and air / snow chemistry exchange on ice sheets. It is related to the local meteorological conditions such as precipitation, wind and temperature (metamorphism). A long term temporal and spatial evolution of the snow density near the surface on ice sheets could be use to monitor climate evolution. Passive and active microwave offer the possibility to study recent climate evolution with respectively 30 and 20 years of measurements, a very good temporal repeatability and a large spatial coverage. The aim of this paper is (1) to derive the snow density near the surface, called “surface snow density”, from AMSR-E passive microwave observations and ENVISAT radar altimetry measurements, and (2) to study the temporal evolution of this density. Surface snow density is also jointly estimated from passive microwave observations and radar altimetry measurements by two independent methods. For both methods, the estimation of density is based on the surface reflection of electromagnetic wave in the microwave domain, which mainly depends on dielectric contrast between air and snow. For passive microwave observations, the polarization ratio is derived in order to be most sensitive to snow density variations near the surface. Then, the Dense Media Radiative Transfer theory is used for modeling and quantify the relationship between polarization ratio and surface snow density. For radar altimetry measurements, the total microwave backscatter coefficient is used because it depends on surface snow density and roughness. Validation of the surface snow density estimations is performed at Dome C on the Antarctica Plateau from in situ measurements of snow density. Uncertainties about the two retrieval methods (from AMSR-E and ENVISAT observations) are also discussed and the results show that the two estimated temporal evolutions of density are consistent together, with a huge decrease around 10 – 15 kg m-3 y-1. In addition, a large area around Dome C (about 1.106 km2) shows the same decrease. Finally, no physical atmospheric processes are now found to explain the reasons of this decrease.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade two large geothermal energy projects were launched in Switzerland (Basel 2006, St Gallen 2013). Both of them were stopped after the occurrence of strongly felt earthquakes (Ml3.4 and 3.5, respectively). This illustrates that one of the key challenges for the use of deep geothermal energy remains to control the risk of inducing felt and potentially hazardous seismic events during the development and operation of an underground heat exchangers.\nCurrent monitoring techniques of induced seismicity, e.g. traffic light systems, attempt to forecast seismic hazard during and after stimulation based on observed seismicity and hydraulic data. A limitation of these techniques is their focus on seismic processes.\nWe demonstrate the potential of ambient seismic noise correlation techniques to monitor aseismic reservoir dynamics related to the 2013 geothermal project in St. Gallen. In St. Gallen, reservoir characterization tests lead to an unexpected leakage of methane gas into the well. Well-head pressure rose rapidly and operators decided to prevent a possible well blow-out with counter-pressure. The result was an immediate increase of induced seismicity with a maximum event of Ml3.5. While the reservoir characterization was not accompanied by any significant induced seismicity that could have given an indication for the ongoing processes in the reservoir, ambient noise cross-correlations reveal a significant aseismic perturbation in the system that can be clearly linked to the stimulation tests. These additional constraints may help to better understand reservoir dynamics. We also discuss the future role of noise correlation based techniques for monitoring/mitigation purposes.",

            "abstract": "In the last ten years, a number of numerical dynamo models have successfully represented basic characteristics of the geomagnetic field.\nHowever, to approach the parameters regime of the Earth's outer core, we need massively parallel computational environment for extremely large spatial resolutions. Local methods are expected to be more suitable for massively parallel computation because the local methods needs less data communication than the spherical harmonics expansion, but only a few groups have reported results of the dynamo benchmark using local methods (Harder and Hansen, 2005; Matsui and Okuda, 2005; Chan et al., 2007) because of the difficulty treating magnetic boundary conditions based on the local methods. On the other hand, some numerical dynamo models using spherical harmonics expansion has performed successfully with thousands of processes. We perform benchmark tests to asses various numerical methods to asses the next generation of geodynamo simulations.\nThe purpose of the present benchmark test is to assess numerical geodynamo models on a massively parallel computational platform. To compare among many numerical methods as possible, we consider the model with the insulated magnetic boundary by Christensen et al. (2001) and with the pseudo vacuum magnetic boundary, because the pseudo vacuum boundaries are implemented easier by using the local method than the magnetic insulated boundaries. In the present study, we consider two kinds of benchmarks, so-called accuracy benchmark and performance benchmark.\nIn the present study, we will report the results of the performance benchmark. We perform the participated dynamo models under the same computational environment (XSEDE TACC Stampede), and investigate computational performance. To simplify the problem, we choose the same model and parameter regime as the accuracy benchmark test, but perform the simulations with much finer spatial resolutions as possible to investigate computational capability (e.g. parallel scalability and capability, maximum spatial resolutions)\nunder the closer condition to the Earth's outer core. We compare the results of the performance benchmark tests by various codes and discuss characteristics of the simulation methods for geodynamo problems.",

            "abstract": "There is a wide range of numerical models capable of modeling tsunamis, most of which have been properly validated and verified against standard benchmark cases and particular field or laboratory cases studies. Consequently, these models are regularly used as essential tools in estimating the tsunami hazard on coastal communities by scientists, or consulting companies, and treating model results in a deterministic way. Most of these models are derived from the same set of equations, typically the Non Linear Shallow Water Equations, to which ad-hoc terms are added to include physical effects such as friction, the Coriolis force, and others. However, not very often these models are used in unison to address the variability in the results. Therefore, in this contribution, we perform a high number of simulations using a set of numerical models and quantify the variability in the results. In order to reduce the influence of input data on the results, a single tsunami scenario is used over a common bathymetry. Next, we perform model comparisons as to asses sensitivity to changes in grid resolution and Manning roughness coefficients. Results are presented either as intra-model comparisons (sensitivity to changes using the same model) and inter-model comparisons (sensitivity to changing models). For the case tested, it was observed that most models reproduced fairly consistently the arrival and periodicity of the tsunami waves. However, variations in amplitude, characterized by the standard-deviation between model runs, could be as large as the mean signal. This level of variability is considered too large for deterministic assessment, reinforcing the idea that uncertainty needs to be included in such studies.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of marine magnetic data of the Bay of Bengal (BOB) led to suggest two different tectonic models for the evolution of lithosphere between India and East Antarctica. The first model explains the presence of M-series (M11 to M0) magnetic anomalies in BOB with a small room leaving for accommodating the crust evolved during the long Cretaceous Magnetic Quiet Period. Second model explains in other way that most part of the crust in BOB was evolved during the quite period together with the possible presence of oldest magnetic chron M1/ M0 in close vicinity of ECMI. It is with this perspective we have reinvestigated the existing and recently acquired magnetic data together with regional magnetic model of BOB for identification of new tectonic constraints, thereby to better understand the evolution of lithosphere. Analysis of magnetic data revealed the presence of spreading anomalies C33 and C34 in the vicinity of 8°N, and internal time marker (Q1) corresponding to the age 92 Ma at 12°N in a corridor between 85°E and Ninetyeast ridges. The new time marker and its location, indeed, become a point of reference and benchmark in BOB for estimating the age of oceanic crust towards ECMI. The magnetic model further reveals the presence of network of fracture zones (FZs) with different orientations. Between 85°E and Ninetyeast ridges, two near N-S FZs, approximately followed 87°E and 89.5°E are found to extend into BOB up to 12°N, from there the FZs reorient in N60°W direction and reach to the continental margin region. Along ECMI two sets of FZs are identified with a northern set oriented in N60°W and southern one in N40°W direction. This suggests that both north and south segments of the ECMI were evolved in two different tectonic settings. The bend in FZs marks the timing (92 Ma) of occurrence of first major plate reorganisation of the Indian Ocean and becomes a very critical constraint for understanding the plate tectonic process in early opening of the Indian Ocean.",

            "abstract": "After the crossing of the termination shock by the Voyager spacecraft, it became clear that pickup ions (PUIs) dominate the thermodynamics of the heliosheath. Particle-in-cell simulations by Wu et al. [2010] have shown that the sum of the thermal solar wind and non-thermal PUI distributions downstream of the termination shock can be approximated with a 2-Maxwellian distribution. Therefore the heliosheath can be described as multi-fluid plasma comprising of cold thermal solar wind ions, hot pickup ions (PUI) and electrons. The abundance of the hot pickup ion population has remained unknown, since the plasma instrument on board Voyager 2 can only detect the colder thermal ion component. Upstream of the termination shock, where the solar wind bulk flow is quasi-perpendicular to the Parker spiral-like heliospheric magnetic field, the two ion fluids are fully coupled. However, in the heliosheath, where the ion flows start to divert from the radial direction, PUIs and thermal solar wind ions become decoupled in the parallel direction, resulting in differential ion flow velocities. This multi-fluid nature of the heliosheath cannot be captured in current single-fluid MHD models of the heliosphere. Here we present our new multi-ion Hall MHD model of the termination shock, which is able to resolve finite gyroradius effects [Zieger et al., 2014]. The addition of hot PUIs to the mixture of thermal solar wind protons and cold electrons results in the mode splitting of fast magnetosonic waves into a high-frequency fast mode (or PUI mode) and a low-frequency fast mode (or thermal proton mode). We show that the multi-fluid nature of the solar wind predicts two termination shocks, one in the thermal and the other in the pickup ion component. We demonstrate that the thermal ion shock is a dispersive shock wave, with a trailing wave train, which is a quasi-stationary nonlinear wave mode, also known as oscilliton. We constrain the previously unknown PUI abundance and the PUI temperature by fitting simulated multi-fluid termination shock profiles to Voyager 2 observations. Our model provides self-consistent energy partitioning between the ion species across the termination shock and predicts the preferential heating of the thermal ion component. The nonlinear oscilliton mode can be a source of compressional turbulence in the heliosheath.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the Midwest region of the United States, slopes are relatively flat, soils tend to have low permeability, and local water tables are high. In order to make the region suitable for agriculture, farmers have installed extensive networks of ditches to drain off excess surface water and subsurface tiles to lower the water table and remove excess soil water in the root zone that can stress common row crops, such as corn and soybeans. The combination of tiles, ditches, and intensive agricultural land practices radically alters the landscape and hydrology. Within the watershed, tiles have outlets to both the ditch/stream network as well as overland locations, where the tile discharge appears to initiate gullies and exacerbate overland erosion. As part of the Minnesota River Basin Integrated Study we are explicitly simulating the tile and drainage systems in the watershed at multiple scales using the physics-based watershed model GSSHA (Gridded Surface Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis). The tile drainage system is simulated as a network of pipes that collect water from the local water table. Within the watershed, testing of the methods on smaller basins shows the ability of the model to simulate tile flow, however, application at the larger scale is hampered by the computational burden of simulating the flow in the complex tile drain networks that drain the agricultural fields. Modeling indicates the subsurface drains account for approximately 40% of the stream flow in the Seven Mile Creek sub-basin account in the late spring and early summer when the tile is flowing. Preliminary results indicate that agricultural tile drains increase overland erosion in the Seven Mile Creek watershed.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive analysis of the δ13C composition of sedimentary organic matter from Euramerican Carboniferous successions indicates there are significant shifts in δ13C through this key time interval. Our studies have revealed that, at an individual location, the source and delivery mechanism of the sediment contribute to the type of organic matter preserved and, in turn this influences the measured δ13C values from bulk sedimentary organic matter of organic matter. In general, where marine-derived organic matter is dominant in these Carboniferous successions then δ13C values are characteristically lower compared to the higher values encountered where terrestrial plant-derived material is most abundant. The implication of these observations is that an apparent carbon isotope excursion identified from the bulk organic matter may reflect a change in transport processes, or depositional environment, rather than a perturbation in the global carbon cycle. In our most recent studies, however, we compare δ13C values from specific wood fragments and bulk sedimentary organic matter from non-marine, marine basinal, and marine shelfal successions from the earliest Mississippian through to the early Pennsylvanian. These data indicate that early Mississippian δ13C of organic matter is far less negative (around –22%0) than material of Late Mississippian age (around –26%0), however by the early Pennsylvanian, δ13C values return to –22%0. There are some δ13C data from brachiopod carbonate from this time interval and similar shifts are indicated. Our data are beginning to address whether we can identify a primary carbon cycle signal from the Carboniferous record using δ13C from a range of sedimentary environments. If we can, there are still questions around what the record is telling us about the global carbon cycle during a period when plant groups, including lycopods and seed ferns, rapidly diversified.",

The U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) in cooperation with the many federal, academic, and open-source software partners, has been working to make base datasets and useful summaries available in formats that are readily usable by scientists and managers familiar with GIS and modeling of landscape-phenomena.\nWhen an analyst needs information such as decadal average growing degree day estimates for historical and future periods, she shouldn’t have to download and process terabytes of historical and projected data to produce a few summary values, or a simple map. A USGS project, known as the Geo Data Portal (GDP), has assembled a catalog of web-service available gridded climate datasets at the USGS, NASA, NOAA and several universities. GDP processing services provide model-ready spatially summarized gridded time series data for user-submitted polygons for any dataset in the catalog or any dataset published using supported open standards. Recently, progress has been made toward providing annual climate indices from monthly and daily data in common GIS formats.\nUsing the GDP system, a person can execute processing tasks that run on USGS servers and use custom datasets, statistic types, and statistic thresholds. This work has been made possible by numerous organizations committed to publishing software and data that scale well, use standards, and are freely available for anyone to use. A high-level overview of assembling the Geo Data Portal system’s capabilities will be presented, reflecting on technical and strategic difficulties experienced, and the future of open data and processing between the climate and landscape domains.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of the H2O-undersaturated lherzolite solidus places important constraints on the process of melt generation and mantle potential temperatures beneath oceanic spreading centers. The small concentration of H2O (~50-200 µg/g) dissolved in the oceanic mantle is thought to exert a strong influence on the peridotite solidus, but this effect has not been directly determined. The utility of existing experimental data is limited by a lack of information on the concentration of H2O dissolved in the peridotite and uncertainties involved with identifying small amounts of partial melt. We have developed an experimental approach for determining the peridotite solidus as a function of H2O content that overcomes these difficulties. Our initial results demonstrate that the solidus temperature for spinel lherzolite containing 150 µg/g H2O is higher than existing estimates for the anhydrous solidus. Our approach to determining the H2O-undersaturated lherzolite solidus is as follows. First, a small proportion (~5 %) of San Carlos olivine spheres, ~300 μm in diameter, are added to a peridotite synthesized from high-purity oxides and carbonates. Melting experiments are then conducted in pre-conditioned Au80Pd20 capsules over a range of temperatures at a single pressure using a piston-cylinder device. Water diffuses rapidly in olivine resulting in thorough equilibration between the olivine spheres and the surrounding fine-grained peridotite, and allowing the spheres to be used as hygrometers. After the experiment, the concentration of H2O dissolved in the olivine spheres is determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry.\nMelting experiments, spaced 20°C apart, were performed from 1250 to 1430°C at 1.5 GPa. The starting material has the composition of the depleted MORB mantle of Workman and Hart (2005) containing 0.13 wt% Na2O and 150 µg/g H2O. The concentration of H2O in the olivine spheres remains constant up to 1350°C, and then decreases systematically with increasing temperature. This indicates a solidus temperature of ~1360°C, which is ~25-50°C above the existing estimates for anhydrous solidus corrected for our starting composition. The H2O-undersaturated solidus indicated by our experimental results suggests that potential temperatures for the oceanic mantle are higher than current estimates.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) is key tracer of composition and process in the mantle. It is interesting to notice that some alkalic basalts occur in amagmatic spreading center of ultraslow spreading ridges, for examples, 9-16˚E of the Southwest Indian ridge (Standish et al., 2008) and Lena Trough of Arctic Ocean (Snow et al., 2011). The latter is interpreted as the result of the pre-existence of continental transform fault or the especially cold thermal structure of ancient continental lithosphere.\n53˚E segment, east of the Gallieni transform fault, was discovered as an amagmatic segment (Zhou and Dick, 2013). On both sides of the ridge axis, peridotites with a little gabbro are exposed in an area more than 3200 km2. Basalts exist in the southern portion of 53˚E segment, indicating the transformation from magmatic to amagmatic spreading about 9.4 million years ago.\nIn April of 2014, Leg 4 of the RV Dayang Yihao cruise 30, basaltic glasses was dredged at one location (3500 m water depth) in the ridge axis of 53˚E segment center. It is shown by electric probe analysis that the samples have extremely high sodium content (4.0-4.49 wt% Na­2O ), relative higher potassium content (0.27-0.32 wt% K2O) and silica (50.67-51.87 wt% SiO2), and lower MgO content (5.9-6.4 wt% MgO). Mg-number is 0.55-0.59. It is distinctly different from the N-MORB (2.42-2.68 wt% Na2O, 0.03-0.06 wt% K2O, 48.6-49.6 wt% Si2O, 8.8-9.0 wt% MgO, Mg-numbers 0.63) distributed in the 560-km-long supersegment, west of the Gallieni transform fault, where the active Dragon Flag hydrothermal field was discovered at 49.6˚E in 2007. The reasons for the alkalic basalt in the ridge axis of 53˚E amagmatic segment center, either by low melting degree of garnet stability field, by melting from an ancient subcontinental lithospheric mantle, or by sodium-metasomatism or even other mantle processes or their combination in the deep mantle, are under further studies.",

In this study defining the old stream bed and flood risk of Saricay passing through the Canakkale settlement area are aimed. The Canakkale Province is situated in the northwest of Turkey.\nGeological, geomorphological, sedimentologic and hydrological properties of the region examined while investigating the flood risk of Saricay from past to present. Furthermore, stream deposits were dated using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) method. Based on the dates it was defined that Saricay bed changed approximately 30 thousand years ago. While the old bed was with NW-SE direction, now it was moved to current bed (with E-W direction) passing through the settlement area. Geological and geomorphological data were showed that Saricay bed had changed as well. Marsh land dominates far from stream bed whereas silty and sandy gravel was observed near of stream bed.\nThe flood risk map was carried out using GIS techniques. Processes were performed using the Spatial Analysis module of the ArcGIS 10. Five parameters such as geologic units, land use, slope, aspect and elevation were considered affecting the flood risk in this region. Sub-criterias were defined for each main parameter and susceptibility analysis was performed using weighted overlay method. Each criteria was assessed according to their effect. Based on the results, risk map of the study area was carried out. The region was divided into 5 categories from very low risky (1) to very high risky (5).",

            "abstract": "Wind erosion and dust emissions occur in many dryland environments from a range of surfaces with different types and amounts of vegetation. Understanding how vegetation modulates these processes remains a research challenge. Here we present results from a study that examines the relationship between an index of shelter (SI=distance from a point to the nearest upwind vegetation/vegetation height) and particle threshold expressed as the ratio of wind speed measured at 0.45 times the mean plant height divided by the wind speed at 17 m when saltation commences, and saltation flux. The results are used to evaluate SI as a parameter to characterize the influence of vegetation on local winds and sediment transport conditions. Wind speed, wind direction, saltation activity and point saltation flux were measured at 35 locations in defined test areas (~13,000 m2) in two vegetation communities: mature streets of mesquite covered nebkhas and incipient nebkhas dominated by low mesquite plants. Measurement positions represent the most open areas, and hence those places most susceptible to wind erosion among the vegetation elements. Shelter index was calculated for each measurement position for each 10° wind direction bin using digital elevation models for each site acquired using terrestrial laser scanning. SI can show the susceptibility to wind erosion at different time scales, i.e., event, seasonal, or annual, but in a supply-limited system it can fail to define actual flux amounts due to a lack of knowledge of the distribution of sediment across the surface of interest with respect to the patterns of SI.",

            "abstract": "Partial melting occurs along grain boundaries and migrates through porous flow, leading to magma segregation in the mantle. Solitary porosity waves created by a perturbation in melting have been studied in the flow of a low viscosity fluid in a deformable matrix (McKenzie 1984, Scott and Stevenson 1986, Barcilon and Richter 1986, Spiegelman 1993, Wiggins and Spiegelman 1995). However, in a fairly complicated multi-physics, multi-scale process of magma migration, the geometry and instability of porosity waves can be affected by both mechanical and thermal factors, leaving different propagation signatures. In this work we develop a two-dimensional, two-phase damage model of magma-fracturing, and study the influence of viscosities and damage (void generation and microcracking) on the geometry properties of porosity waves. We first benchmark our solitary solutions with previous works and solve 2-D finite-amplitude waves numerically using spectral and semi-spectral method. We show that damage, decompaction weakening of the matrix and porosity-driven viscosities can alter the geometry of stable porosity waves, and result in an elongated or flattened wave front with a trail of smaller porosity. Such trails may localize subsequent waves and form porosity passage in the matrix. Scaling analysis of the time-dependent porosity waves are conducted and amount of magma reaching to the top of the melting region are estimated. Future work will include evaluating the thermal and seismic signatures during and after melt migration in two-phase porous flow.",

The PSM is using diethylene glycol (DEG) as condensing liquid, which has a low saturation vapour pressure and is hygroscopic. The high supersaturation needed for activating sub-3 nm particles is reached by mixing the sample with clean air saturated with DEG.\nThe measurements took place in Sept-Oct, when typical temperatures at the measurement site are around 303 K, and relative humidity (RH) around 90%. Due to these challenging conditions, in combination with the hygroscopicity of the DEG, careful design and testing of the instrument was required. We developed an inlet reducing the RH at the inlet of the PSM while keeping the diffusion losses of particles in the inlet as low as possible.\nThe inlet design is based on a sintered tube, where dry, pressurized dilution flow is added. Downstream of the sintered tube, a core sampling probe is used. The core sampling allows to sample from the center of the tube, where the highest particle concentration is, while an additional make-up flow allows for a higher sample flow rate. The RH of the ambient, dilution flow and PSM inlet flow are monitored continuously. Tests in the laboratory have shown that the RH could be reduced down to less than 30%, while the ambient RH was 90-100%. The characterization of the inlet regarding diffusion losses lead to a cut off diameter of 1.6 nm, compared to 1.3 nm without inlet. Thus, this new inlet design allows measurements of sub-3 nm particles in tropical rainforest condition.",

            "abstract": "Several important equilibrium Si isotope fractionation factors are calculated here. We use a so-called volume-variable-cluster-model (VVCM) method for solids and the “water-droplet” method for aqueous species for isotope fractionation calculation at the same quantum chemistry level. The calculation results show that several silicate minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, kaolinite, etc., all enrich heavy Si isotopes relative to aqueous H4SiO4 and can be up to 3.3‰ at 25°C, different from most field observations. Meanwhile stable organosilicon complexes can enrich even lighter Si isotopes than aqueous H4SiO4. For explaining the difference between the calculation results and field observations, we calculate the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) associated with the formation of amorphous silica, and find that amorphous silica will enrich extremely light Si isotopes. From amorphous silica to crystalline quartz, the structural adjustment & transition needs getting rid of small amount of Si to re-organize the structure. Light Si isotopes will be preferentially lost and let the final crystalline quartz with a little bit more heavy Si isotopes. However, such late-stage Si heavy isotope enrichment cannot erase the total isotopic signal, crystalline quartz still inherit much light Si isotopic composition from amorphous quartz. That is the reason for the discrepancy between the calculation results and the field observations, because the formation of amorphous quartz is under a non-equilibrium process but theoretical calculations are for equilibrium isotope fractionations. With accurate equilibrium fractionation factors provided here, Si isotope distributions in earth surface environments including soil, groundwater and plants can be further interpreted. We find that δ30Si variations in soil are mainly driven by secondary minerals precipitation and adsorption. Also, bulk soil δ30Si maybe have a parabolic distribution with soil age, with a minimum value at where allophane is completely dissolved and the total amount of sesqui-oxides and poorly crystalline minerals reach their maximum. Similarly, precipitation of clay minerals can explain δ30Si variation in ground water profile.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is a very potent greenhouse gas with many and diverse natural and anthropogenic emission sources such as wetlands, animals, biogas production, waste and sewage management systems. It has increased 2.5-fold since 1750 and is expected to continue to rise, with possible large implications for future climates. Although many individual sources have unknown fluxes, and distributions could be both hotspots or continuous, measurements are mostly made on either a very small scale (chambers or flux towers) with point-like or uncertain footprints, or on the very large scale of satellites with km-sized footprints. There is thus a missing intermediate scale, a scale which would allow both pin-pointing of individual CH4 emission sources and mapping a large enough area to cover a whole landscape. A general such method would be beneficial for connecting scattered local measurements and integrated large scale estimates. Remote sensing is a tool that is often used to map surface materials and the atmosphere from space. This technique, optimized for ground-based or near-ground, sensitive CH4 detection using high spectral resolution, could be a future method for detecting and mapping CH4 sources and fluxes in the environment.\nWe present a new camera system with the ability to both detect and quantify CH4 at low levels in landscapes using remote sensing. Detection is made through thermal infrared (IR) imaging spectroscopy, using the heat radiation of objects in a scene to provide background light (e.g. tree leaves, rocks, grass or the sky). Using spectroscopic and radiative transfer modelling for each pixel (spectrum) in an image, we can calculate a CH4 distribution map from the measured spectra. The system uses imaging at high frequency (hundreds of Hz) to build the spectra – this also enables us to make simultaneous CH4 flux movies that can be used to calculate flows. Our method has broad applications and we will present examples from different environments.",

            "abstract": "With the deployment of dense seismic arrays and the continuous growth of computing facilities, full-waveform inversion (FWI) of teleseismic data has become a method of choice for high-resolution lithospheric imaging. FWI can be recast as a local optimization problem that seeks to estimate Earth's elastic properties by iteratively minimizing the misfit function between observed and modeled seismograms.\nIn passive teleseismic configurations, the seismic source no longer corresponds to a point source embedded in the targeted medium but rather corresponds to a wavefront incoming from the outside of the model. We develop a 3-dimensional time-domain full-waveform inversion program that is more designed for this configuration. The gradient of the misfit function is efficiently computed with the adjoint-state method. A velocity-stress finite-difference time-domain modeling engine, which is interfaced with the so-called total-field/scattered-field method, is used to propagate in the targeted medium the incident wavefield inferred from a global Earth simulation (AxiSEM). Such interfacing is required to account for the multiple arrivals in the incoming wavefield and the sphericity of the Earth. Despite the limited number of nearly plane-wave sources, the interaction of the incident wavefield with the topography (P-Sv conversions and P-P reflections acting as secondary sources) provides a suitable framework to record both transmitted wavefields and reflected wavefields from lithospheric reflectors. These recordings of both transmitted and reflected waves makes FWI amenable to a broadband-wavenumber (i.e., high resolution) reconstruction of the lithosphere.\nFeasibility of the method is assessed with a realistic synthetic model representative of the Western Alps. One key issue is the estimation of the temporal source excitation, as there might be some trade-off between the source estimation and the subsurface update. To avoid being trapped in a local minimum, we follow a multiscale approach, which hierarchically proceeds from the low frequencies to the higher ones and from the transmission regime to the reflection one. A real data case study will focus on the inversion of the CIFALPS array data up to a maximum frequency of 1 Hz to investigate the lithospheric structure of the Alps.",

Libraries with a time series of sub-meter scale optical satellite imagery capture the summer evolution of these melt ponds. Using this imagery, we apply a semi-supervised algorithm to extract information on melt pond formation and evolution. The algorithm combines K-Nearest Neighbors segmentation and a machine learning random forest classification scheme to segment and classify Worldview and Quickbird imagery into categories of open water, snow and bare ice, and melt ponds. The partitioned imagery is processed to quantify melt pond coverage, size, and connectivity. We analyze the growing library of processed images to quantify seasonal progression of melt pond characteristics at many repeatedly imaged sites. We estimate the evolution of solar partitioning at these sites. These high resolution satellite images are used to derive melt pond statistics and solar partitioning, which are crucial for determining the strength of the sea-ice albedo feedback.",

            "abstract": "Enceladus' plume provides a unique laboratory for dust-plasma interactions. Negatively charged nanograins, which represent the vast majority of grains, have been measured by Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS). Even a small fraction of positively charged nanograins has been detected by CAPS. However, there is a crucial lack of information on uncharged grains. Thus, no information on the total grain production rate of Enceladus or its total contribution to Saturn's E-ring are available yet. We present an estimation of uncharged grains as well as a total grain production rate by an analytical model and simulations. First, we derive an analytical model from basic equations of grain charging and quasi-neutrality connecting the amount of uncharged grains to negatively and positively charged grains. A first estimate for uncharged grains then results from the ratio of negatively-to-positively charged nanograins. For more accurate estimations we compare results from combined dust and plasma simulations with our analytical ones and CAPS data for charged nanograins to determine Enceladus' total grain production rate and a global profile of uncharged nanograins in the plume. The dust simulations of the plume and the plasma simulations with A.I.K.E.F. for plasma-plume interactions are performed iteratively allowing for the different time scales for dust and plasma dynamics.",

            "abstract": "A large number of observations were collected during the DYNAMO (Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation) field campaign in the tropical Indian Ocean during 2011. These data ranged from in-situ measurements of individual hydrometeors to regional precipitation distribution to large-scale precipitation and wind fields. Many scientific findings have been reported in the three years since project completion, leading to a better physical understanding of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) initiation and providing insight to a roadmap to better predictability.\nThe NOAA P-3 instrumented aircraft was deployed from 11 November – 13 December 2011, embarking on 12 flights. This mobile platform provided high resolution, high quality in-situ and remotely sensed observations of the meso-γ to meso-α scale environment and offered coherent cloud dynamic and microphysical data in convective cloud systems where surface-based instruments were unable to reach. Measurements included cloud and precipitation microphysical observations via the Particle Measuring System 2D cloud and precipitation probes, aircraft altitude flux measurements, dropsonde vertical thermodynamic profiles, and 3D precipitation and wind field observations from the tail-mounted Doppler X-band weather radar. Existing satellite (infrared, visible, and water vapor) data allowed the characterization of the large-scale environment. These comprehensive data have been combined into an easily accesible product with special attention paid to comparing observations to future numerical simulations.\nThe P-3 and French Falcon aircraft flew a coordinated mission, above and below the melting level, respectively, near Gan Island on 8 December 2011, acquiring coincident cloud microphysical and dynamics data. The Falcon aircraft is instrumented with vertically pointing W-band radar, with a focus on ice microphysical properties. We present this case in greater detail to show the optimal coincident measurements. Additional facilities provided data from this day including the S-band National Center for Atmospheric Research SpolKa weather radar. This unique dataset will be valuable not only for improving our understanding of convective cloud systems but also for evaluating cloud resolving models and future model development.",

            "abstract": "Unsaturated flow in fractured porous media exhibits highly complex flow dynamics and a wide range of intermittent flow processes. Especially in wide aperture fractures, flow processes may be dominated by gravitational instead of capillary forces leading to a deviation from the classical volume effective approaches (Richard’s equation, Van Genuchten type relationships). The existence of various flow modes such as droplets, rivulets, turbulent and adsorbed films is well known, however, their spatial and temporal distribution within fracture networks is still an open question partially due to the lack of appropriate modeling tools. With our work we want to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying flow and transport dynamics in unsaturated fractured media in order to support the development of more refined upscaled methods, applicable on catchment scales. We present pore- and fracture-scale flow simulations obtained with a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model. The model allows to simulate free-surface flow dynamics including the effect of surface tension for a wide range of wetting conditions. Several empirical and semi-analytical solutions are used to verify the model. We show that our results satisfy the empirical scaling laws for droplet velocity and critical contact angle. Due to the efficient generation of surface tension via particle-particle interaction forces the dynamic wetting of surfaces as well as the velocity enhancement of droplets on saturated surfaces can readily be obtained. Furthermore, we study the effect of surface roughness on droplet velocities. Lastly, we present flow and transport simulations in the presence of an adjacent porous matrix in order to investigate its influence on the fracture surface flow dynamics and transport across the matrix-fracture interface.",

            "abstract": "Experimentally-determined mechanical properties of clay-rich fault rock, and the associated micromechanical processes, are used to constrain the conditions of slip instability along the San Andreas Fault (SAF). Using smectite-rich fault gouge collected from the Central Deforming Zone (CDZ) of the SAF in the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD), rotary and triaxial shear deformation experiments were conducted at rates that correspond to co-seismic slip (1 m/s) and in-situ creep (~10-10 s-1). Frictional strength depends on rate, temperature, availability of pore water, and fabric development, all of which reflect operation of different microscopic mechanisms at high and low shear rates. On the basis of the results, we use an energy balance for a propagating rupture to evaluate the potential for seismic slip along the CDZ.\nAppropriate scaling of the gouge strength from experimental to in-situ conditions, particularly for seismic slip rates, is critical to evaluating seismic hazards. Accordingly, the micromechanical processes identified from results of the deformation experiments are used to constrain and evaluate several different scaling relations between strength, critical displacement, and normal stress for the CDZ gouge. Experiments show that, at in situ creep rates, dislocation glide in clay is the rate-controlling mechanism and is responsible for the low strength (µ = 0.11), which limits the potential energy available for sustaining co-seismic frictional slip. As a consequence, microseismic patches within the CDZ are predicted to arrest for all scaling relationships under in-situ deformation conditions. Dynamic weakening at co-seismic rates involves thermal fluid pressurization, and for some scaling relations may be sufficient to sustain propagation of a rupture that nucleates within the adjacent locked segment into the CDZ",

In the past few years, our research team has identified over 1500 DSGSD sites by using airborne LiDAR derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In this study, we used the multi-disciplinary approach including tectonic geomorphology, remote sensing, and geodesy to monitor their activity and susceptibility in mountainous area.

However, the transport and retention of carbon and nutrients in headwater streams is strongly influenced by biofilms (surface-attached microbial communities), which results in strong feedbacks between stream hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry. Mechanistic understanding of the interactions between streambed biofilms and nutrient dynamics is lacking.\nHere we present experimental results linking microscale observations of biofilm community structure to the deposition and resuspension of clay-sized mineral particles in streams. Biofilms were grown in identical 3 m recirculating flumes over periods of 14-50 days. Fluorescent particles were introduced to each flume, and their deposition was traced over 30 minutes. Particle resuspension from the biofilms was then observed under an increased stream flow, mimicking a flood event. We quantified particle fluxes using flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy. We directly observed particle adhesion to the biofilm using a confocal laser scanning microscope. 3-D Optical Coherence Tomography was used to determine biofilm roughness, areal coverage and void space in each flume. These measurements allow us to link biofilm complexity to particle retention during both baseflow and floodflow. The results suggest that increased biofilm complexity favors deposition and retention of fine particles in streams.",

With the increased number of ET stations and increased amount of data flowing from each station, modern tools are needed to effectively and efficiently handle the entire infrastructure (hardware, software and data management). These tools can automate key stages of ET network operation, remotely providing real-time ET rates and alerts for the health of the instruments. This can help maximize time dedicated to answering research questions, rather than to station management. This year, the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) within the Chinese Academy of Sciences implemented a large-scale 27-station national ET network across China to measure and understand the water cycle from a variety of ecosystems. It includes automated eddy covariance systems, on-site flux computations, wireless communication, and a network server for system, data, and user management. This presentation will discuss the latest information on the CERN network, methods and hardware for ET measurements, tools for automated data collection, data processing and quality control, and data transport and management of the multiple stations. This system description is beneficial for individuals and institutions interested in setting up or modifying present ET networks consisting of single or multiple stations spread over geographic locations ranging from single field site or watershed to national or continental scale.",

            "abstract": "On April 1st, 2014, a moment magnitude (MW) 8.2 earthquake occurred offshore Iquique, Northern Chile. There were numerous smaller earthquakes preceding and following the mainshock, making it an ideal case to study the spatio-temporal relation among these events and their association with the mainshock. We applied a matched-filter technique to detect previously missing foreshocks and aftershocks of the 2014 Iquique earthquake. Using more than 900 template events recorded by 19 broadband seismic stations (network code CX) operated by the GEOFON Program of GFZ Potsdam, we found 4392 earthquakes between March 1st and April 3rd, 2014, including more than 30 earthquakes with magnitude larger than 4 that were previously missed in the catalog from the Chile National Seismological Center. Additionally, we found numerous small earthquakes with magnitudes between 1 and 2 preceding the largest foreshock, an MW 6.7 event occurring on March 16th, approximately 2 weeks before the Iquique mainshock. We observed that the foreshocks migrated northward at a speed of approximately 6 km/day. Using a finite fault slip model of the mainshock determined from teleseismic waveform inversion (Hayes, 2014), we calculated the Coulomb stress changes in the nearby regions of the mainshock. We found that there was ~200% increase in seismicity in the areas with increased Coulomb stress. Our next step is to evaluate the Coulomb stress changes associated with earlier foreshocks and their roles in triggering later foreshocks, and possibly the mainshock. For this, we plan to create a fault model of the temporal evolution of the Coulomb behavior along the interface with time, assuming Wells and Coppersmith (1994) type fault parameters. These results will be compared with double-difference relocations (using HypoDD), presenting a more accurate understanding of the spatial-temporal evolution of foreshocks and aftershocks of the 2014 Iquique earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Highly evolved, silica-rich lavas have been recovered from several different locations along the global MORB system. Petrographic and geochemical data from basalt, andesite (52-55 % SiO2), and dacite (56-59 % SiO2) glasses collected on the East Pacific Rise from 8°-15°50’N, give insight into the petrogenesis and eruption characteristics of these highly silicic melts. Although most geochemical variability in MOR basalts is commonly attributed to either low-pressure fractional crystallization of mantle derived melts or to a small degree of partial melting from a hydrated gabbro, the chemical anomalies in the trace element and isotopic abundances in the dacite and andesite samples at 8°37’N suggest that these lavas have had a more complicated petrogenesis. Andesite and dacite samples are characterized by significantly elevated Ce, Nd, Yb, Zr, Sr, and Ba concentrations. Coeval basaltic glasses from this region are typically “N-type” and “E-type”. The 8°37-8°39’N andesite glasses are predominantly phaneritc, with xenocrystic-clots of plagioclase commonly having discontinuous, oscillatory reverse zoning that vary from An57 to An77. Several of the samples contain gabbroic xenoliths composed of rounded olivines, euhedral clinopyroxene, and plagioclase xenocrysts with sieve textures. The composition of olivine xenocrysts from the andesitic glasses ranges from Fo77 to Fo81. Dacite glasses from 8°-15°50’N are unanimously aphyric with sparse micro-xenocrysts. The composition of plagioclase grains varies from An47 to An66. Olivine xenocrysts from the 9°03’N locality average Fo67 for their composition. However, the dacite glasses on the west portion of the 8°37’N 1-2 km offset are characterized by phaneritic samples with basaltic xenoliths that contain spherulitic-clots of plag/ol/cpx. Geochemical and petrologic modeling of the andesite and dacite lavas suggests that they are derived by the partial melting (3-5%) of a hydrated basaltic/gabbroic crust. Furthermore, the phase chemistry and textural relationships of the xenocrystic-clots in the high silica glasses suggests these melts were rapidly transported to the eruptions sites with little interaction with the existing basaltic plumbing system.",

            "abstract": "Land use and its spatial pattern and dynamics strongly influence water resources and water demand. Therefore, integrated water resources management coordinating water supply and demand is using modeling tools in order to assess the impact of land use changes on the water balance and to conceive infrastructural and operational measures to cope with these impacts. As a consequence, the appropriateness of water management measures depends on the reliability of the output gained by the modeling tools which in turn is highly determined by the capability of the models and the quality of model inputs.\nThis research combines the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and an advanced procedure for spatio-temporal detection of land use dynamics and irrigation in the Upper Kharun basin in the Chhattisgarh State in India. An on-screen visual digitization technique using the Landsat satellite images and their derivatives (NDVI and tasseled cap indices) were employed for land use classification. The land use maps prepared at different time steps within a year can be combined to produce a single multi-temporal land use classification. This approach captures and integrates all the major variations within a year in a single map and hence better represents an area with multiple crop rotations and different levels of urbanization.\nUrbanization and intensification of irrigation by increasing use of groundwater are major land use processes at the global scale as well as in the study region. The study reveals that an increasing pumping rate of groundwater for irrigation is the main reason for decreasing the groundwater contribution to streamflow and subsequently a lowering in discharge and water yield. On the other hand, annual surface runoff is increased significantly by an expansion in built up areas over the decades in the study area.\nThis information (i) enhances the understanding of land use changes and their relevant drivers, and (ii) facilitates the introduction of best water and land use management practices.",

            "abstract": "Carbon gas fluxes in tidal marshes vary spatially and temporally because of vegetation cover, subsurface biogeochemical processes, and environmental forcing and predicting the impact of climate change on greenhouse gas fluxes from wetlands remains challenging. We examined how ecosystem carbon gas exchange varies along a salinity gradient (0-32 ppt) in three marshes along an estuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA. Midday net ecosystem exchange (where a negative rate indicates net carbon assimilated through photosynthesis) was greatest at the most freshwater site (4.8 ± 0.3 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1), followed by the saline (2.8 ± 1.0 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1) and brackish (1.4 ± 0.6 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1) sites. However, net ecosystem exchange integrated diurnally revealed each marsh to be a net CO2 source to the atmosphere as a result of high ecosystem respiration with no significant difference across the fresh (105.5 ± 28.9 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1), brackish (100.1 ± 36.5 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1), and salt marsh (78.3 ± 28.6 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1) sites. The large loss of carbon from these ecosystems is suggested to be a contributing factor to the disappearances of marshes in the region. Fifty percent of coastal Alabama wetlands, for examples, have disappeared from 1780 to 1980, and between 1955 and 1979 the percent loss (29%) in the region has exceeded the national average by a factor of three. While future warming is not expected to impact carbon assimilation significantly, our warming simulations suggest that carbon loss in these ecosystems can be enhanced by 12 to 26%, potentially exasperating the loss of marshes in the region.",

Recently, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) are more and more used for simulating offshore wind turbine wakes as they resolve the atmospheric turbulence as well as the wake turbulence.\nHowever, for an application of LES wind fields to assess offshore wind farm flow a proper validation with measured data is necessary.\nSeveral methods have been investigated at the University of Oldenburg to compare LES wind fields and lidar measurements. In this study we apply one of these methods to validate wake simulations of a single wake of a 5MW wind turbine in the German offshore wind farm \"alpha ventus\" with processed dual-Doppler lidar measurements in the same wind farm.\nThe simulations are performed with the LES model PALM, which has been enhanced by two different approaches of actuator models to simulate the wake of single wind turbines and the interaction of wakes in wind farms. Effects of tower and nacelle are regarded as well as simple turbine control mechanisms. The simulations are initialized with comparable atmospheric conditions as during the time of lidar operation by using measurements from the adjacent meteorological mast FINO 1.\nPlan Position Indicator (PPI) measurements have been performed with two long-range wind lidars installed at different opposing platforms at the border of the wind farm. A Cartesian grid was overlapped to the scanned region and a dual-Doppler algorithm was applied in order to estimate the horizontal stationary wind field on the grid nodes.\nTo our knowledge, the presented study is one of the first validations of LES wake simulations with lidar measurements and first which validates offshore LES wake simulations with 2D lidar data.",

VIRTIS-M, the Visible InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer, onboard the orbiter (Coradini et al., 2007) has acquired data of the nucleus’ surface in the 0.25-5.1 µm spectral range.\nWe discuss the modeling of the radiance and reflectance spectra by applying the Hapke radiative transfer model with the aim to characterize the compositional properties of the surface in terms of refractory material, water and carbon dioxide ices, and other minor species abundances. Moreover this method allows us to infer the grain size distribution across the surface.\nThe best retrieval is achieved by leaving free the parameters of the model in order to minimize the residuals: (signal – model) / noise. To achieve a correct characterization of the noise we have derived an instrumental signal to noise simulator tool, which has been validated against the reference signal measured by VIRTIS-M on two internal calibration sources.\nThe availability of observations taken at different viewing and illumination geometries have allowed us to characterize the surface regolith’s photometric properties and to include them in our model. Finally, the uncertainties of the derived parameters are estimated through the propagation of the errors.\nThe modeling of VIRTIS data is supported by comparison with laboratory spectra of analogue materials.\nAuthors acknowledge the funding from Italian and French Space Agencies.",

However, in order for these channels to be alluvial there are several basic questions to be answered. Are water flows under Martian conditions capable of eroding the amounts of sediment required to leave these channels? Are our present estimates of palaeoflood discharge of correct magnitude to carry out this erosion? And are the channels a product of one or many flood events?\nHere, we use a numerical model (CAESAR-Lisflood) that links a two-dimensional hydrodynamic flow scheme to a sediment transport model to simulate fluvial morphodynamics in the Athabasca and Kasei regions. CAESAR-Lisflood has been successfully applied to simulating flooding, erosion and deposition on Earth in a number of locations, and allows the development of channels, bars, braids and other fluvial features to be modelled. The numerical scheme of the model was adapted to Martian conditions by adjusting gravity, drag co-efficient, roughness and grainsize terms. Preliminary findings indicate that fluvial erosion and deposition is capable of creating mega channel features found at these sites and that existing palaeflood estimates are commensurate with channel forming discharges for these features.",

We present an hybrid numerical method that allows for the modelling\nof short period teleseismic waves in 3D lithospheric target with both the discontinuous Galerkin finite elements method and finite difference method, opening the possibility to perform waveform inversion of seismograms recorded by dense regional broadband arrays.\nHowever, despite the supercomputer ability, the forward-problem remains expensive at global scale for teleseismic configuration especially when 3D numerical methods are considered. In order to perform the forward problem in a reasonable amount of time, we reduce the computational domain in which full waveform modelling is performed. We define a 3D regional domain located below the seismological network that is embedded in a homogeneous background or axisymmetric model, in which the seismic wavefield can be computed efficiently.\nThe background wavefield is used to compute the full wavefield in the 3D regional domain using the so-called total-field/scattered-field technique. This method relies on the decomposition of the wavefield into a background and a scattered wavefields. The computational domain is subdivided into three sub-domains: an outer domain formed by the perfectly-matched absorbing layers, an intermediate domain in which only the outgoing wavefield scattered by the lithospheric heterogeneities is computed, and the inner domain formed by the lithospheric target in which the full wavefield is computed.\nIn this study, we shall present simulations in realistic lithospheric target when the axisymetric background\nwavefield is computed with the AxiSEM softwave and the 3D simulation in lithospheric target model is performed with the discontinuous Galerkin or finite difference method.",

            "abstract": "Electrickinetic(EK) is a promising remediation technology because of its capability to remediate soils with low permeability. It has been used for heavy metals and organic pollutant(OPs) contaminated soils. As the most OPs are poor solubility and strong sorption capacity, combined EK technology is usually used, for example, EK combined with surfactants. Numerous combined EK tests are done in one-dimension(1D) column, however, it is proved that there is a big gap between 1D tests and field application. The objectives of this study are to investigate the remediation efficiency and EK behavior of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene(1,2,4-TCB) contaminated clay enhanced by surfactants in a three-dimension reactor with 28cm length×15cm width×16cm height. 1,2,4-TCB was one of the main contaminants at a field site in Nanjing, China, where the polluted soils are clay. Soil filled in EK cell was divided into six layers in depth, and each layer was divided into six parts in length and three parts in width. There were 108 specimens in total which realized 3D monitoring the effects of EK. Triton X-100(Exp1) and Tween80(Exp2) dissolved in NaCO3/NaHCO3 buffer respectively, were used as the anode purging solution. The distributions of soil pH and water content showed that the buffer was sufficient to neutralize H+ produced at anode and the direction of electroosmotic flow(EOF) remained constant. Exp2 generated a higher EOF than Exp1, but remediation efficiencies were not satisfactory so far. The concentration of 1,2,4-TCB in soil reached a peak and nadir in the normalized distances of 0.75 and 0.9 from cathode after 5 days, respectively. The 1,2,4-TCB concentration in the peak was almost twice as much as the initial concentration. It suggested that 1,2,4-TCB was desorbed from soil by surfactants and was transported from anode to cathode by EOF, which proved the capability of EK with surfactants to move 1,2,4-TCB in clay. The concentration of 1,2,4-TCB in the normalized distances of 0.01~0.06 from cathode were almost unchanged in different depths, suggesting that EK with surfactants had little effect on those regions. A follow-up study will try to improve the remediation efficiency, for example, increasing test duration, optimizing test conditions, enhancing solubility and mobility of 1,2,4-TCB and better controlling soil pH and current.",

For example, 10% of the water footprint of Chinese consumers is outside China; in the US this is 20%, and in the UK even 75%. National consumption thus always depends, partly, on water resources outside the national territory. Earlier research has resulted in global water footprint maps for all countries in the world, showing for each country where in the world water resources are being consumed and polluted in relation to consumption within the country considered. Recent research shows at a high spatial and temporal resolution level in which catchments in the world, the blue water footprint exceeds the maximum sustainable blue water footprint. The current study overlays the global water footprint maps per country with the global map showing locations of unsustainable water use in order to estimate, per country, the dependence of national consumption on unsustainable water footprints. Countries are ranked according to their fraction of their water footprint that is unsustainable and an in-depth analysis of the implications of this dependence is carried out for the top-10 of the list. The in-depth analysis explores which commodities are behind the unsustainable parts of a country’s water footprint, where these footprints are located and what options a country has to reduce its dependence on unsustainable water use.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a well-known tool to measure porosity and pore size distribution for high-permeability rocks at laboratory and at downhole conditions. In low (nanoDarcy) permeability rocks, although downhole tools lack the resolution to measure small pores, low-field laboratory instruments are able to measure fast relaxation times (down to 40-60 µs) and can be used as to assess their porosity and pore size distributions. However, the full potential of NMR data to measure small, µm-sized pores is undervalued. It remains unclear whether NMR transverse relaxation (T2) distributions represent the entire pore structure in low-permeability rocks. In this study, we discuss important acquisition parameters for reliable NMR measurement in mudrocks. We present the challenges and limitations of NMR data inversion and interpretation by simulating the echo train data for two synthetic rocks, a sandstone and a mud rock. We show examples of analytical solutions for simplified geometries to investigate the contribution of different relaxation mechanisms on T2distributions in nanometer-sized pores and to understand NMR diffusion measurements.\nOur results for mud rocks show that even data with high signal to noise ratio fail to capture fast relaxation of the hydrogen nuclei in small pores and, consequently, do not measure the multi-modal pore size distributions. NMR data do capture the dominant pore size range through logarithmic average of the time distribution that is independent of signal to noise ratio and inversion algorithm. Analytical solutions of T2relaxations in mud rocks shows that the response is dominated by the surface relaxation. Diffusion induced relaxation, even at high magnetic susceptibility contrasts, is not significant. Analytical modeling of diffusion coefficient, assuming Gaussian phase distribution, reveals that diffusion of spins in nano-meter pore sizes requires a very large applied gradient for the spins to diffuse. The results of this work lead us to a better understanding of the NMR response in mudrocks and consequently the complex pore structure of low-permeability rocks.",

            "abstract": "Recession of mountain glaciers in partially glacierized headwater catchments has the potential to impact watershed dynamics in a range of ways, including reduced low flows, erosion of exposed steep soils, increased sediment transport, and ecosystem succession. The response of glaciers and glacierized watershed processes to progressive climatic warming will vary greatly with local environmental attributes (aspect, hypsometry, slope, debris cover) and climatic forcing (topography driven climatic gradients, prevailing wind direction, precipitation variability and perturbation). To identify the relative influence of these controlling factors and to identify locations where these changes will have significant influence on stream discharge in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW), we gather a rich data set of glacio-hydrological variables and use a recently developed glacio-hydrology model in conjunction with data to evaluate the hydrologic response of partially glacierized river basins at a range of spatial and temporal scales. The distributed hydrologic modeling framework, which incorporates a physical representation of changes in glacier area through glacier dynamics, allows the analysis of hydrologic and glaciological change at extended temporal and fine spatial scales. Among the river basins we examine are the Hoh River on the Olympic Peninsula of Western Washington, the Hood River in Northern Oregon, the Nisqually River in the Puget Sound drainage basin, and multiple watersheds in the North Cascades Region. For each of these basins, tipping points of hydrologic response to glacier recession are identified and projected. We 1) describe varied patterns of coupled glacio-hydrologic response 2) identify influential environmental controls and 3) identify vulnerable areas in space and time. We close with a discussion of the implications of ongoing and projected glacio-hydrologic changes for the management of water and natural resources in the PNW.",

In this study, post-processing method of MOGREPS for surface temperature prediction is developed with machine learning over 52 locations in South Korea. Past 60-day lag time was used as a training phase of Support Vector Regression (SVR) method for surface temperature forecast model. The selected inputs for SVR are followings: date and surface temperatures from Numerical Weather prediction (NWP), such as GDAPS, individual 24 ensemble members, mean and median of ensemble members for every 3hours for 12 days.\nTo verify the reliability of SVR-based ensemble prediction (SVR-EP), 93 days are used (from March 1 to May 31, 2014). The result yielded improvement of SVR-EP by RMSE value of 16 % throughout entire prediction period against conventional ensemble prediction (EP). In particular, short range predictability of SVR-EP resulted in 18.7% better RMSE for 1~3 day forecast. The mean temperature bias between SVR-EP and EP at all test locations showed around 0.36°C and 1.36°C, respectively. SVR-EP is currently extending for more vigorous sensitivity test, such as increasing training phase and optimizing machine learning model.",

In contrast, in the Subantarctic Zone, export production increased into ice ages coinciding with rising dust fluxes, thus suggesting iron fertilization of Subantarctic phytoplankton. Recently developed XRF core-scanning methods permit paleoceanographic reconstructions on time-scales similar to ice core temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements. We have investigated the sedimentary distribution of various proxies allowing reconstructing export production in a series of sedimentary archives retrieved from the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean spanning the Antarctic Polar Front in the vicinity of Kerguelen Island (Marion Dufresne Expeditions IndienSud-1 & 2). These high-resolution measurements are complemented with reconstruction of 230Th-normalized biogenic particle flux to the seafloor covering the last glacial termination.\nThis contribution will explore the effects of Fe-fertilization on export production in an area remote from major dust sources. Furthermore, quantitative vertical flux determinations will allow comparing carbon export efficiency in the Indian Ocean with previously published records from the South Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "One of the most striking aspects of the 16-year TRMM dataset is the contrast between continental and oceanic convection, particularly in their vertical structures, microphysics, and severity. It has become well known that oceanic storms have weaker convection, and far lower occurrence and frequency of lightning. Oceanic storms are also well known to have weaker ice scattering signatures and weaker radar profiles, in the sense that higher radar reflectivities do not extend as far into the upper troposphere.\nFrom this, a puzzling contrast between land and ocean storms has arisen that has yet to be explained: Given similar radar and passive microwave signatures, land storms have a far higher probability of lightning than the ocean storms that show the same traits.\nWe posit here that either the remote sensing characteristics are not as sensitive to the known microphysics of electrification by non-inductive ice-ice collisions in the presence of supercooled liquid cloud water, or, that the research community has overlooked some property of the hydrometeors detected by these remote sensors that is masking their widely accepted applicability to diagnosing which convective storms should have lightning, or not.\nUsing 16 years of TRMM data from 1997 to 2013, we examine the different radar profiles and ice scattering signatures of precipitation features in archetypes for mid-ocean and mid-continent regions (e.g. central Pacific and Congo). Using hypothesized idealized hydrometeor profiles, and simple radar and passive microwave simulators, we attempt to construct a metric, using measurements available from TRMM to determine the probability of lightning with fewer land-ocean differences than those we have used in the recent past. If successful, this relationship would apply to the radar and microwave data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite currently in orbit.",

Geological evidence suggests that orthopyroxene plays a significant role in the deformation of mantle shear zones. However, in comparison to olivine, relatively little is known about its mechanical behavior. In this contribution, geologic and experimental data on orthopyroxene are assessed, with particular attention to shear localization phenomena in the upper mantle. Orthopyroxene contributes to upper mantle deformation in two ways. First, orthopyroxene acts as the primary pinning phase, suppressing olivine grain-growth, leading to long-lived zones of weakness where olivine deforms by grain-size sensitive mechanisms such as grain boundary sliding. Second, orthopyroxene may contribute to deformation through its own intrinsic rheological properties. Using experiments at high temperature and pressure we have explored the serial processes of dynamic recrystallization and phase mixing in olivine – orthopyroxene aggregates. We show that phase mixing is an inefficient process and that large strains are required to achieve microstructural and rheological steady state. We conclude weakening associated with dynamic recrystallization and phase mixing is a secondary process that contributes to the longevity of shear zones, but not their initial formation. We have also revisited some previous experimental results and derived flow laws and deformation mechanism maps for the grain-size sensitive deformation of orthopyroxene. We show that orthopyroxene deforms by diffusion creep over a wide range of upper mantle conditions.",

The physical controls on discharge and water depth are well represented by rate laws governing flow above and below the sediment interface; however, in the shallow flows of wetlands and streams, there is not necessarily a sharp threshold that determines when surface flow ceases and subsurface flow dominates. Instead there is a gradual transition between flows governed by surface and subsurface flow controls. We examined the effect of microtopography on flow connectivity by measuring and modeling the effect that a decreasing water level has on cross sectional area and tortuosity of surface water flow paths as microtopographic high points emerge above the flow. Several thresholds were determined as functions of the microtopographic distribution, including a major transition where surface flow ceases altogether and the surface water becomes connected by only subsurface flow between pools. We developed a coupled surface and subsurface model of flow connectivity for application in shallow, intermittently flowing wetlands and streams. This one-dimensional model uses a statistical distribution approach to characterize complex microtopography based on limited topographic surveying at appropriate scales. A test application of the model in the Everglades revealed a broad range of transitional conditions associated with relatively easily measured physical features of streams and wetlands.",

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone is the site of intensive biogeochemical cycling in streams. However, the controls on spatio-temporal variability in hyporheic processing, and the impact of this hyporheic processing on reach-scale processing, are largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate spatial variability in hyporheic respiration along an upland river over the course of a flood event using the reactive tracer resazurin (Raz). Raz, a weakly fluorescent dye, irreversibly transforms to resorufin (Rru) under mildly reducing conditions, providing a proxy for aerobic respiration in the hyporheic zone. Eight conductivity loggers and in-situ fluorometers, measuring in-stream concentrations of Raz, Rru, fluorescein, and turbidity, were evenly spaced along a 1km reach of the Selke River, a gravelly, third-order river in north-central Germany. Sub-reaches between fluorometers differed in the number of streambed structures (ex. pool-riffle sequences and gravel bars) hypothesized to impact hyporheic exchange, residence time distributions, and the development of biogeochemical hotspots. Discharge over the 5 days of the experiment in the Selke River ranged from baseflow conditions of 0.3 m3/s to peak flows of 2.6 m3/s. Seven in-stream slug injections of Raz, NaCl and the conservative tracer fluorescein were conducted at discharge conditions of 0.3, 0.8, 2.5, 2.1, 1.3, 1.0, and 0.9 m3/s. Aerobic respiration rates and residence time distributions in the reach and sub-reaches are evaluated relative to the changing discharge conditions. Preliminary results indicate that although reach-scale tracer travel times decrease with increasing discharge, the reach-scale transformation of Raz to Rru is lowest at intermediate discharge and highest at during baseflow and peak flow conditions. This suggests that the highest transformation rates occur during high discharge. ",

            "abstract": "Inversion of teleseismic waveforms yielded fault parameters of four M~7 earthquakes occurred between 1963 and 1983 in Japan Sea. Tsunami waveforms were simulated based on those parameters and compared to the observed waveforms on tide gauges.\nEastern margin of Japan Sea has been considered as a nascent plate boundary between the Eurasian and North American plates but not a typical subduction zone, hence the maximum magnitude (M<8) of earthquakes is smaller than those in the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, several large earthquakes with M > 7.5 in the last century caused seismic and tsunami damages, such as the 2007 Chuetsu-oki (Mw 6.6), 2007 Noto (Mw 6.7), 1993 South off Hokkaido (Mw 7.7), 1983 Japan Sea (Mw 7.7), 1964 Niigata (Ms 7.5), or 1940 Shakotan-oki (Mw 7.5) earthquakes. Detailed studies of source process were performed for these earthquakes. Smaller (M~7) earthquakes also cause seismic and tsunami damages if their hypocenters are near the land. However, there are few analyses for earthquakes around M7. Therefore, we study the characteristics of the M~7 earthquakes in Japan Sea.\nThe earthquakes we studied are the 1983 West off Aomori (MJMA 7.1), 1971 West off Sakhalin (MJMA 6.9), 1964 off Oga peninsula (MJMA 6.9), and 1963 Offshore Cape Echizen (MJMA 6.9) earthquakes. From the teleseismic waveforms inversions, the reverse-fault mechanisms were obtained except for the 1963 earthquake which has the strike-slip-fault mechanism. The fault area is 900 km2, 2800 km2, 3600 km2, and 3600 km2, respectively. Tsunami numerical computations are made from the source models obtained by the teleseismic inversions. Tsunamis from the 1983 earthquake were recorded at 32 tide gauge stations along the Japan Sea. Amplitudes of the calculated tsunami waveforms are much smaller than the observations. For the 1971 earthquake, amplitudes of the calculated tsunami waveforms are also smaller than the observations at 18 tide gauge stations. For the 1964 earthquake, the amplitudes are similar but the waveforms are very different from the observations at 15 tide gauges.",

            "abstract": "We performed an airborne survey of some large anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emission sources in the Southeast U.S. during the 2013 Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury and Aerosol Distribution, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) experiment. The observations included speciated atmospheric Hg, and tracers of urban/industrial emissions and associated photochemistry (e.g., carbon monoxide, CO; carbon dioxide, CO2; sulfur dioxide, SO2; nitrogen oxides (NOx); volatile organic compounds, VOCs; ozone, O3; hydroxyl radical, HO·; sulfuric acid, H2SO4) and were made from the National Science Foundation’s/National Center for Atmospheric Research’s C-130 research aircraft. Mercury was measured using the University of Washington’s Detector for Oxidized Hg Species. We derived Hg emission factors (EF) for several U.S. urban areas and large industrial point sources, including coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia. We compared our measured Hg EFs with inventory-based values from two separate Hg emission inventories provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). We also performed an inter-comparison of the inventory-based Hg EFs. For the CFPPs sampled, we find that actual Hg emissions differed from inventoried values by more than a factor of two in some cases. Measured Hg EFs were weakly correlated with values reported in the NEI: m = 0.71; r2 = 0.47 (p = 0.06; n = 8), whereas EFs derived from the TRI were not meaningfully predictive of the measured values: m = −3.3; r2 = 0.61 (p < 0.05; n = 8). Median absolute differences between measured and inventory-based EFs were ≥50%, relative to the inventory values. The median absolute average difference between the Hg EFs reported in the two inventories was approximately 40%. Our results place quantitative constraints on uncertainties associated with the inventoried Hg emissions. Additionally, our results suggest that the current formulation of the Hg emission inventories critically limits our ability to accurately predict the transport and fate of U.S. urban/industrial emissions of Hg to the atmosphere. These findings are broadly relevant to the design and use of emission inventories for industrial hazardous air pollutants.",

            "abstract": "The processes controlling the entrainment, transport and deposition of coarse sediment in bedrock-alluvial systems are key for understanding sediment fluxes in these systems. Theories have been developed for these processes, and assumptions are made about them in models of bedrock incision. However, there are relatively few field datasets from these rivers with which to test these ideas. We report results from a gravel tracer experiment in the bedrock-alluvial Trout Beck, UK. The 410 m long study section consists of alluvial, mixed bedrock-alluvial and bedrock reaches. There are no tributary inputs so discharge is constant throughout. Two sets of 270 magnet-tagged pebbles covering the grain size distribution of the in-situ sediment were seeded in August 2013. Tracers were placed in an alluvial reach and in a bedrock reach, enabling quantification of grain dynamics over different substrates but under the same flow conditions. Tracers were resurveyed six times over nine months. Concurrent measurements of stage, discharge and bedload impacts at various locations in the channel aid interpretation of the tracer measurements. Tracers installed in the bedrock reach were far more mobile than those in the alluvial reach, with mean travel distances of 70.6 and 2.4 m respectively in the first two months. The transport of tracers was largely size independent over the purely bedrock reach. This finding may be explained by bulk hydraulic measurements that indicate that effective shear stress is highest in this section of the channel. Once these tracers reached the downstream mixed bedrock-alluvial reach, transport distances became relatively shorter, though still greater than in the purely alluvial reach (mean distances of 27.6 and 15.4 m from month 2 to month 7), and became size selective. The second set of tracers seeded in the alluvial reach displayed size-selective transport throughout the experimental period. This study demonstrates how reach substrate exerts a strong control on sediment mobility, through influence on both the sediment and the flow.",

            "abstract": "The fine-scale structure and dynamics of solar polar faculae were studied using Hinode/SOT spectro-polarimetric and filtergraphic observations at polar regions. It is revealed that polar magnetic patches of large flux have substructures, with a few small faculae in the much larger patches. It was also found that faculae tend to have higher intrinsic magnetic field strengths compared with the non-facular regions inside the associated magnetic patches. G-band images reveal much thinner facular structures of close to 0.1 arcsec and the faculae appear as a cluster of thin tapered tube-like structures; individual size is about 0.2 x 0.5 arcsec, reaching the maximum closer mid-way to the limb, are likely projected on the limb-side neighboring granules with center-ward dark lanes. Typical lifetime of each facular elements is about five minutes, showing side-way motion during the life. Corresponding bright fine elongated structures are seen in Ca II H, although such structures are more numerous and therefore there does not always exist one-to-one correspondence of Ca II H bright structures with the G-band facular elements. In H-alpha and Na I D line wing, fibril structure emanating limb-ward from the faulae and Ca II H bright regions. Those facts imply that the polar faculae appear in the root of intense vertically-oriented thin magnetic flux tubes which are consistent with the result from the magnetic properties reduced from the spectro-polarimetry. Those results suggest that the Spruit’s hot wall effect explains the appearance of faculae in intense vertically oriented flux tube whose formation is dynamically changing.",

            "abstract": "Saprolite remnants onshore Scandinavia have been investigated only sporadically. The nature and age of the deeply weathered material thus remains only loosely constrained. The type and degree of weathering of in situ weathered soils are indicative of the environmental conditions during their formation. When external forcing changes, properties related to previous weathering conditions are usually preserved, for example in clay mineral assemblages. By constraining the age and rate of weathering onshore and by isotopically dating selected faults determined to be intimately linked to weathered basement blocks, the influence of climate development, brittle deformation and landscape processes on weathering can be quantified. The \"BASE\" project aims to establish a temporal and conceptual framework for brittle tectonics, weathering patterns and landscape evolution affecting the basement onshore and offshore Norway. We will study the formation of saprolite in pre-Quaternary times, the influence of deep weathering on landscape development and establish a conceptual structural template of the evolution of the brittle deformational features that are exposed on onshore (weathered) basement blocks. Moreover, saprolitic material may have been eroded and preserved along the Norwegian continental margin during Cenozoic times. By studying both the onshore remnants and offshore erosional products deposited during periods of extreme changes of climate and tectonic boundary conditions (e..g Miocene-Pliocene), new inferences on the timing and controlling mechanisms of denudation, and on the relevance of deep weathering on Late Cenozoic global cooling can be drawn.",

            "abstract": "High latitudes are experiencing warmer average annual temperatures, resulting in the thawing of permafrost, and possibly, the increased emission of methane (CH4) from lakes and ponds. One potential impact of permafrost thaw is increased runoff of organic matter into streams, lakes and ponds. Warming can also potentially increase lake sediment temperatures, resulting in a lower methane (CH4) storage capacity and increased CH4 production. We focused our study on six lakes of varying size, location, and characteristics, located in the Stordalen Mire area in northernmost Sweden. We collected sediment cores in each lake and analyzed the dissolved CH4 in the sediment at various depths in the core. The sediment CH4 concentrations were compared to the grain sizes and compositions (total organic carbon (TOC), total sulfur (S), and total nitrogen) of the sediment at the corresponding depths. We also measured dissolved CH4 concentrations in the lake water and compared them to those of the sediment. We found that on average, the CH4 concentration was higher (16.7 μgCH4 gds-1 ± 16.4) in sediments with more TOC (31.4 wt % ± 10.8). There was also a strong positive correlation between sediment CH4 and total S (r2 = 0.37, p = 0.165), between sediment CH4 and TOC (r2 = 0.53, p = 0.101), and between TOC and total S (r2 = 0.64, p = 0.066). This indicates in situ production of CH4­ in the lake sediment at depths of peak CH4 concentrations in at least two of the lakes. The peak of dissolved CH4 was located deeper in the cores although this depth varied among the lakes. In four lakes, we found high CH4 concentrations in the sediment, as well as high CH4 concentrations in the water, indicating little oxidation in the water column or persistent CH4 production in the sediment. This suggests that at least four of our studied lakes have great potential to release a substantial amount of their produced CH4 to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The largest impacts on the Moon – those that form the multi-ring basins – can produce thousands of cubic kilometers of melt. This melt is largely concentrated inside the basin, although some is ejected along with the clastic materials that make up the continuous ejecta blanket that surrounds basins. Impact melt is important because it contains information on the crustal target for basins as well as being the most suitable material to date basin-forming events. New geological mapping of the lunar Orientale and Imbrium impact basins has identified likely deposits of both types of impact melt. The Orientale basin (930 km diameter) is well preserved and only partly flooded by later mare basalts. The basin interior melt sheet is represented by the Maunder Formation, a smooth-to-cracked surface unit that covers the innermost basin ring. Study of the composition of the Maunder Fm. as determined by remote sensing shows that it is remarkably uniform both laterally and vertically, with no evidence of differentiation. Surrounding the basin are vast ejecta deposits, most of which are probably made up of clastic material. However, a few isolated deposits contained within basin secondary craters appear melt-like, with low albedo and a cracked surface texture (e.g., Struve L, 20.7° N, 76° W). The larger (1160 km diameter) and slightly older Imbrium basin is mostly filled with mare basalt lava, concealing most of the basin floor. The Imbrium basin exterior shows isolated deposits of melt-like material in several locales, including on the floors of the craters Parrot C (18.5° S, 1.2° E) and Murchison (5.1° N, 0.1° W). These deposits have low albedo and show cracked surfaces, with evidence of ground flow after deposition. Their composition is remarkably similar to highland basaltic impact melts found in the Apollo collections, such as the Apollo 17 impact melts. These features offer the possibility of examining basin impact melt at distances far removed from basin interiors or from basins that are deeply flooded by mare lava, covering the interior melt sheet. As such, these melt deposits are important sites for future robotic sample return missions.",

            "abstract": "The NASA/GEWEX Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) project produces shortwave and longwave surface and top of atmosphere radiative fluxes for the 1983-near present time period. Temporal resolutions are 3-hourly, 3-hourly-monthly, daily, and monthly. Spatial resolution is 1 degree. The current release 3.0 (available at gewex-srb.larc.nasa.gov) uses the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) DX product for pixel level radiance and cloud information. This product is subsampled to 30 km, resulting in pixel counts of ~10 per grid box. ISCCP is currently recalibrating and recomputing their entire data series, to be released as the HX product, at 10km resolution. The large increase in pixel number will allow SRB greater flexibility in its own spatial resolution, allowing a higher resolution gridded product (e.g. 0.5 degree), as well as the production of pixel-level fluxes. Additionally, the SRB team is collaborating with other global GEWEX energy flux teams to improve key inputs such as the inclusion of an aerosol history, meteorological, and ozone data sets. For instance, the aerosol history will be specified from the first version of the Max-Planck-Institut Aerosol Climatology (MAC) containing a climatological coarse mode and an emission based fine mode history.\nHere we present our first look at results for the improved GEWEX Shortwave and Longwave algorithm (GSW and GLW) with new ISCCP data, the various other improved input data sets and the incorporation of many additional internal SRB model improvements. Improvements in GSW include the incorporation of variable composition aerosol from the MAC data set, an expansion of the number of wavelength bands is expanded from five to eighteen, and the inclusion of ice cloud vs. water cloud radiative transfer. The GLW improvements include the MAC aerosol vertical profiles, meteorology from HIRS, diurnally varying sea surface and land surface temperatures, and new topography, surface type, and snow/ice fields.\nThe SRB data produced will be released as part of the Release 4.0 Integrated Product, recognizing the interdependence of the radiative fluxes with other GEWEX products providing estimates of the Earth's global water and energy cycle (I.e., ISCCP, SeaFlux, LandFlux, NVAP, etc.). The current schedule of this new data set is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Lake Van is the fourth largest terminal lake in the world (38.5°N, 43 °E, volume 607 km3, area 3570 km2, maximum water depth 460 m), extending for 130 km WSW–ENE on the Eastern Anatolian High Plateau, Turkey. The sedimentary record of Lake Van, partly laminated, obtains a long and continuous continental sequence that covers multiple interglacial-glacial cycles. Promoted by the potential of the sedimentary sequence for reconstructing the paleoecological and paleoclimate development of the Near East, a deep drilling operation was carried out in 2010 supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). The 119 m long continental record is based on a well-dated composite profile drilled on the so-called Ahlat Ridge in water depth of 360 m encompassing the last 600,000 years. It contains the longest continuous continental pollen record of the Quaternary in the entire Near East and central Asia obtained to date. It documents glacial and interglacial stages as well as pronounced interstadials encompassing the entire 600 ka of the sedimentary record. The cold-adapted vegetation in the Lake Van region during glacial stages and stadial substages can be described as dwarf-shrub steppe and desert steppe very similar to each other. The climax vegetation of the interglacial stages in the Lake Van region is characterized by an oak steppe-forest with pistachio and juniper. It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the atmospheric CO2 concentration from Antarctic ice cores or marine isotope values based on benthic foraminifera, there is no clear subdivision in the Lake Van pollen record between low-amplitude interglacials (cooler cycles) prior the mid-Brunhes event (MBE) at 430 ka and high-amplitude, post MBE interglacials. Lower CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere might be compensated by stronger insolation forcing during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 13a and 15a. A similar pattern can be observed during the triplicate interglacial complex MIS 7 when AP and oak values reach maximum values during MIS 7c instead of MIS 7e. This underlines the different environmental response to global climate change in the continental Lake Van region compared to the global ice volume and/or greenhouse-gas amounts.",

            "abstract": "The study of the main pathways of carbon flux from the deep Earth requires the analysis of a large quantity and variety of data on volcanic and non-volcanic gas emissions. Hence, there is need for common frameworks to aggregate available data and insert new observations.\nSince 2010 we have been developing the Mapping Gas emissions (MaGa) web-based database to collect data on carbon degassing form volcanic and non-volcanic environments. MaGa uses an Object-relational model, translating the experience of field surveyors into the database schema. The current web interface of MaGa allows users to browse the data in tabular format or by browsing an interactive web-map. Enabled users can insert information as measurement methods, instrument details as well as the actual values collected in the field. Measurements found in the literature can be inserted as well as direct field observations made by human-operated instruments.\nCurrently the database includes fluxes and gas compositions from active craters degassing, diffuse soil degassing and fumaroles both from dormant volcanoes and open-vent volcanoes from literature survey and data about non-volcanic emission of the Italian territory. Currently, MaGa holds more than 1000 volcanic plume degassing fluxes, data from 30 sites of diffuse soil degassing from italian volcanoes, and about 60 measurements from fumarolic and non volcanic emission sites. For each gas emission site, the MaGa holds data, pictures, descriptions on gas sampling, analysis and measurement methods, together with bibliographic references and contacts to researchers having experience on each site.\nFrom 2012, MaGa developments started to be focused towards the framework of the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing research initiative of the Deep Carbon Observatory.\nWhithin the DECADE initiative, there are others data systems, as EarthChem and the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program. An interoperable interaction between the DECADE data systems is being planned.\nMaGa is showing good potentials to improve the knowledge on Earth degassing firstly by making data more accessible and encouraging participation among researchers, and secondly by allowing to observe and explore, for the first time, a gas emission dataset with spatial and temporal extents never analyzed before.",

            "abstract": "Foundering of the Earth's lithosphere, and consequent energy and mass flux across the upper boundary layer and mantle interface, is driven locally by gravitational body forces. The related instabilities are usually classified as having sheet-like or drip-like morphologies. The former is associated with whole lithosphere (subduction) or delamination type foundering such as suggested for beneath the southern Sierra-Nevada and the Colorado Plateau, the latter to classic Rayleigh-Taylor instability below an upper layer, suggested to have occurred beneath the Tibetan Plateau and North Island, New Zealand. This dichotomy is non-trivial; classification of phenomena into one or the other is often debated and is difficult to infer from observables. The two morphologies are most likely end-members. Here I refine the dynamics driving morphology selection as a function of rheological lamination and boundary layer Rayleigh number in 2D and 3D, using the finite-element particle-in-cell code Underworld. I explore the influence of morphology on mass flux, topography and crustal deformation as well as deviation from classic 2D scalings. Additionally, tectonic displacement interference with instability development is discussed using basic 3D shear-box style models. By quantifying and describing the theoretical instability dynamics which could result in a plausible range of morphological expressions, I aim to build a general framework which can be paired to the discussion involving firstly, the recognition of varied styles of body force instabilities in the modern Earth and rock record and secondly, to what degree pattern selection impacts boundary layer mass and energy flux.",

The full nucleus will be mapped at multiple resolutions before the Philae landing in November. The mapping will include imaging using the full spectral range of the Narrow Angle Camera of the OSIRIS imaging system (245nm to 1000nm in 11 optical filters). The color mapping will be done under good illumination condition at ~1m/pixel as part of the pyramid arc approach phase. This will later be followed by higher resolution imaging (down to 20 cm/pixels) of parts of the nucleus. These higher resolution images are acquired under somewhat worse illumination conditions because of the high angle between the orbital plane and the Sun direction.\nThis contribution will discuss the color variegation observed on the comet surface and its relationship to surface morphology and cometary activity.",

            "abstract": "The importance of the spatial variation of prediction uncertainty in digital soil mapping (DSM) application has gained increasing awareness in the past decades. An appropriate estimation on prediction uncertainty is useful not only in revealing the quality of the predicted soil map, but also in identifying areas where further efforts for reducing prediction error can be carried out. Existing probabilistic approaches for estimating prediction uncertainty can be inapplicable in practice due to the violation of the stationary assumption and the limited number of field samples available for constructing the probability distribution function of the targeted soil property. This paper presents a new approach to estimate the spatial variation of prediction uncertainty in digital soil mapping application only using sparse ad hoc field samples. The approach assumes that the more similar environmental conditions between two locations the more similar their soil properties will be. The prediction uncertainty at every un-visited location is estimated by analyzing a similarity representation, which indicates how reliable each of the existing field samples can be used to predict the value of targeted soil property at that location. Two case studies were conducted to evaluate the methodology and to illustrate how the quantified uncertainty can be used to assess the quality of the soil map derived from digital soil mapping techniques. The case studies showed that the areas where the predicted soil organic matter content (%, mass percentage) in the topsoil layer along with high prediction uncertainty were associated with low prediction accuracy and vice versa. A clear positive relationship between the prediction errors (residuals) and the quantified prediction uncertainty has been found in both case studies. In conclusion the method presented in this paper is effective in estimating prediction uncertainty when only sparse ad hoc field samples are available. The quantified prediction uncertainty can be an effective indicator to the accuracy of the derived soil map and can serve as an effective tool for allocating error reduction effort in a cost-effective way.",

            "abstract": "Fluvio-deltaic deposits result from the interplay of upstream and downstream environmental conditions, such as upstream tectonic and downstream sea-level settings, making them prime records of past environments. Environmental conditions are far from static, and changes to these conditions create perturbations, or signals, that can propagate from both the upstream hinterlands and from the downstream receiving basin to the fluvio-deltaic realm. Our ability to interpret past environmental conditions from fluvio-deltaic deposits thus hinges on our understanding of fluvio-deltaic response to, and preservation of, environmental perturbations. Recent work suggests the internal dynamics of fluvio-deltaic systems can modify or completely destroy these signals, making them difficult or impossible to interpret from the sedimentary deposits. It has been shown that such signal modification or destruction is a function of both the signal timescales and system response timescales. However, it remains unclear which aspects of the fluvio-deltaic system most significantly control the interaction of these timescales and the extent to which the environmental signals are ultimately preserved in the deposits. To answer these questions, we numerically simulate fluvio-deltaic growth using a physics-based source-to-sink model of sediment transfer from upland source areas to coastal depositional basins. Preliminary results demonstrate that grain size and length scales of the fluvial system affect propagation of both tectonic and sea-level forcings, as well as the preservation style of the resulting signal in the architecture of the fluvio-deltaic deposits. Future work will focus on determining if these results are set by a relationship between grain size and fluvial system size with system response time.",

Atmospheric stability promotes or suppresses turbulence and energy exchange between the water surface and the atmosphere and could affect evaporation rates. We analyzed the datasets collected from an eddy covariance station at the all-year ice-free Ross Barnett Reservoir, Mississippi from August 2007 to March 2008 to uncover the effect of atmospheric stability on evaporation. Results indicate key parameters that affect evaporation (latent heat flux, LE, proportional to evaporation) are (in sequence of significance) 1) presence of cold fronts (dry and cold northern winds), 2) water vapor pressure difference between the water surface and the atmosphere, 3) mean wind speed, and 4) atmospheric stability. Generally, LE is small in stable atmosphere and increases steadily when transitioning to unstable atmosphere. Within either unstable or stable subcategories, trends of LE become less obvious, with increasing to decreasing trends with more stable or unstable conditions. Vapor pressure difference plays an important role to LE in this case in contrast to wind speeds. Insurgence of cold fronts - synoptic weather processes - substantially alters turbulence and heat exchanges between water and atmosphere, masking the effect of stability on evaporation.",

First, slip line field theory is employed to\npredict the geometry of the failure patterns and second,\nfailure criteria are derived from an energy bifurcation analysis.\nThe bifurcation analysis is concerned with the local energy balance of a material and\ncompares the effects of heat diffusion terms and heat production terms where\nthe heat production is due to mechanical processes. Commonly, the heat is\nproduced locally along the slip lines and if the heat production outweighs\ndiffusion the material is locally weakened which eventually leads to failure.\nThe effect of diffusion and heat production is captured by a dimensionless\nquantity, the Gruntfest number, and only if the Gruntfest number is larger than\na critical value localized failure occurs. This critical Gruntfest number\ndepends on boundary conditions such as temperature or pressure and hence this\ncritical value gives rise to localization criteria. We find that the results of\nthis approach agree with earlier contributions to the theory of plasticity but\ngives the advantage of a unified framework which might prove useful in\nnumerical schemes for visco-plasticity.",

            "abstract": "Dust emanates year-round from Africa and Asia and impacts air quality in North America. Asian dust plumes deliver up to 64 million tonnes of dust over the NW of the USA, and African dust storms deliver over 50 million tonnes of dust over Florida each year. Several recent studies have demonstrated that human and plant pathogens from Asian [1] African [2] aerosols can be transported to N. America in naturally occurring dust storms. What is unknown is whether these ‘presumptive pathogens’ impact human, plant, or animal health in the USA. In order to initiate a long-term monitoring program of pathogens in Asian and African dust plumes, we have developed a dust collection system called DART (Dust at Altitude Recovery Technology) (figure). The DART dust sampler can be mounted on a F104 Starfighter jet (figure) and a T6 Texan propeller driven airplane (not shown), and was test flown over FL in Dec. 2013 on the F104 and on the T6 in the summer of 2014. The DART system utilizes a high-volume pump to pass air through 6 separate filtration units where both aerosols and microbial cells are captured. The filtration systems exhibit flow rates from 25-142 L/min depending on the pore size and brand of filters used. Flow rates are directly correlated to increased air speed, and are inversely correlated to increased altitude. Filtration units can be turned on and off individually as required for specific science flight objectives. The DART dust sampler has performed nominally up to 7600 m, 0.92 Mach, and 3.5 +G’s. During initial test flights in Dec. 2013, 5 of 8 genera of fungi recovered from the lower atmosphere over FL contained plant pathogens including species in the genera: Acremonium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Curvularia, and Fusarium. Numbers of recovered fungi, but not bacteria, increased significantly when 5 or 10 µm filters were used in the DART system compared to filter pore sizes ≤ 1.2 µm. Future sampling programs for both Asian and African dust events will be discussed. ",

            "abstract": "The multidecadal variability of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a major component of the natural climate variability in the North Atlantic Ocean. However, its fundamental mechanism has yet to be fully understood. Current state-of-the-art climate simulations show a wide range in frequency and amplitude of multidecadal AMOC oscillation. It is important to identify the causes of this strong model dependency. In this study, we examine the AMOC oscillation in preindustrial simulations of 500 to 1000 years long, produced by five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate systems and the Community Climate System Model, version 3.0. A multichannel singular spectrum analysis is used to objectively identify the dominant oscillation in each of these climate models. A phase composite based on the dominant mode is used to construct a composite lifecycle of the oscillation to examine its temporal-spatial structure for each model.\nOur results show that, although the AMOC oscillates with widely different periods and strengths in these models, they follow a common sequence of phases within a composite lifecycle: A positive anomalous overturning centered at 40o-50oN is first reversed from north with warm subsurface ocean temperature anomalies in the central basin of the northern North Atlantic. The reversed anomalous AMOC then extends southward as the warm signals propagate further westward. On the other hand, these warm temperature anomalies are previously generated during the strong AMOC phase near the North Atlantic Current and advected northward along the track of the subpolar gyre (SPG). An air-sea feedback may influence the process because the subsurface induced warm sea surface temperature anomalies in northern North Atlantic weaken the North Atlantic Oscillation. The process is reversed during the cold phases. The mean SPG structure plays an important roe in determining the frequency and strength of the dominant AMOC oscillation. In general, an intensive SPG within northwestern Atlantic generates strong AMOC oscillation with shorter period while a weak SPG elongated eastward generates a weak oscillation with a longer period.",

            "abstract": "A suite of ocean simulations are conducted at resolutions of 1 degree down to 1/36 degree using the MIT General Circulation Model, Regional Ocean Modeling System, and the Community Earth Systems Model. The 1 degree simulations in the CESM exhibit warm sea surface temperature biases (upwards of 8 C) from the Mid-Atlantic Bight through the Gulf of Maine. In a coupled climate simulation the bias can lead to misplaced heat fluxes which drastically reduce the fidelity of the climate simulation. These observed errors are typical of coarsely resolved ocean simulations and are directly linked to the improper location of the Gulf Stream. Thus, determing a the cause of this error requires a detailed study of a more well-behaved numerical Gulf Stream. 1/12 degree and 1/36 degree simulations show an improvement in the modelled Gulf Stream when compared with observations.\nAll of the simulations show an agreement in the leading balance in the barotropic vorticity budget within the Gulf Stream, dominantly between planetary vorticity advection and bottom pressure torques. This suggests that this inviscid balance is not the only requirement for proper Gulf Stream pathway, since this signature appears in the poorly separating scenario. However, it is shown that the free surface and baroclinic contributions to the bottom pressure torque largely cancel where the modelled Gulf Stream separates. This compensation is necessary for the transport and the upper layer Gulf Stream to cross the edge of the continental shelf. Scaling arguments owe this cancellation to the relative strength between the Gulf Stream and Deep Western Boundary Current. Hence, weak shear may not allow for the appropriate compensation to allow the transport to cross at Cape Hatteras where the bathymetric gradients are upwards of 20%. It is supposed that the sea surface temperature bias is directly caused by the weak vertical shear between the Gulf Stream and Deep Western Boundary Current which disallows decoupling from bathymetry at Cape Hatteras.",

In this presentation we give a detailed overview on the progress achieved with the developments of the VERCE Science Gateway, according to a use-case driven implementation strategy. More specifically, we show how the computational technologies and data services have been integrated within a tool for Seismic Forward Modelling, whose objective is to offer the possibility to perform\nsimulations of seismic waves as a service to the seismological community.\nWe will introduce the interactive components of the OGC map based web interface and how it supports the user with setting up the simulation. We will go through the selection of input data, which are either fetched from federated seismological web services, adopting community standards, or provided by the users themselves by accessing their own document data store. The HPC scientific codes can be selected from a number of waveform simulators, currently available to the seismological community as batch tools or with limited configuration capabilities in their interactive online versions.\nThe results will be staged out via a secure GridFTP transfer to a VERCE data layer managed by iRODS. The provenance information of the simulation will be automatically cataloged by the data layer via NoSQL techonologies.\nFinally, we will show the example of how the visualisation output of the gateway could be enhanced by the connection with immersive projection technology at the Virtual Reality and Visualisation Centre of Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ).",

            "abstract": "Mapping the structure of localized atmospheric phenomena, from sea breeze and shallow cumuli to thunderstorms and hurricanes, is of scientific interest. Low-cost small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) open the possibility for autonomous \"instruments\" to map important small-scale phenomena (kilometers, hours) and serve as a testbed for for much larger scales. Localized phenomena viewed as coherent structures interacting with their large-scale environment are difficult to map. As simple simulations show, naive Eulerian or Lagrangian strategies can fail in mapping localized phenomena. Model-based techniques are needed. Meteorological targeting, where supplementary UAS measurements additionally constrain numerical models is promising, but may require many primary measurements to be successful.\nWe propose a new, data-driven, field-operable, cooperative autonomous observing system (CAOS) framework. A remote observer (on a UAS) tracks tracers to identify an apparent motion model over short timescales. Motion-based predictions seed MCMC flight plans for other UAS to gather in-situ data, which is fused with the remote measurements to produce maps. The tracking and mapping cycles repeat, and maps can be assimilated into numerical models for longer term forecasting.\nCAOS has been applied to study small scale emissions. At Popocatepetl, in collaboration with CENAPRED and IPN, it is being applied map the plume using remote IR/UV UAS and in-situ SO2 sensing, with additional plans for water vapor, the electric field and ash. The combination of sUAS with autonomy appears to be highly promising methodology for environmental mapping.\nFor more information, please visit http://caos.mit.edu",

            "abstract": "Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, rotates synchronously with its orbital motion. As a result of Titan's non-spherically symmetric mass distribution, the 1:1 spin-orbit resonance is stable, but small variations in the rotation rate around the equilibrium state are possible and measurements of these librations have been reported several times (Lorenz et al. 2008, Stiles et al 2008, Stiles et al. 2010, Meriggiola et al. 2012). The librations contain information on the interior of Titan, and in particular can be used to constrain several properties of the ice shell of Titan (Van Hoolst et al. 2013).\nThe measurements of the rotation variations are based on determinations of the shift in position of Cassini SAR radar images taken during different flybys. The results, however, do not agree and the spin variations are smaller for the latest studies. Theoretical estimates show that variations in the rotation rate can occur for several reasons (Van Hoolst et al. 2013, Richard et al. 2014). First, Titan's rotation changes with a period equal to Titan's orbital period as a result of the gravitational torque exerted by Saturn. Second, dynamic variations in the atmosphere of Titan induce changes in Titan's rotation with a main period equal to half the orbital period of Saturn. Third, free librations with periods of the order of a year might be excited, and fourth, deviations from a Keplerian orbit perturb the rotation at additional frequencies.\nHere, we report on different theoretical aspects of the librations and compare theoretical predictions with observational results. We consider the influence of the rheology of the ice shell and take into account Cassini measurements of the external gravitational field and of the topography of Titan. We also evaluate the librations induced by Titan's hydrocarbon seas and use the most recent results of Titan's atmosphere dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Most known organic tracers and compounds present in atmospheric aerosols are sufficiently volatile to partition between the gas and particle phases, affecting oxidation timescales and pathways. However, few direct measurements are available of ambient gas-to-particle partitioning of individual compounds, and the effect of anthropogenic emissions on the partitioning of biogenic aerosol components is not well-studied. Using hourly measurements of gas- and particle-phase organics in the atmosphere we identify here those factors that are most significant in modeling partitioning. Concentrations and partitioning of oxidation products of biogenic emissions were measured in two locations: the Southeastern U.S. (SOAS 2013) and Amazonia, Brazil (GoAmazon 2014). At both sites, high levels of biogenic emissions interact with plumes from nearby cities, creating an ideal environment to study the influence of anthropogenic emissions on environmental factors expected to affect partitioning (i.e. acidity, liquid water content). A Semi-Volatile Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatograph (SV-TAG) was modified to include simultaneous collection of particle-phase and total gas- and particle-phase compounds, as well as derivatization of hydroxyl groups prior to GC analysis to enable measurement of oxygenates. Co-located instruments measuring trace gases and particle properties provide additional insight into oxidation chemistry and anthropogenic influence. Traditional equilibrium partitioning is found to often underpredict, and almost never overpredict, the particle-phase fraction of a compound with a highly variable deviation between measured and modeled partitioning. Furthermore, the ability of traditional models to describe measured partitioning is strongly compound dependent: some compounds are reasonably well-described, while others are consistently far more in the particle-phase than predicted. Chemical differences are used to explore the role of particle-phase formation of lower-volatility thermally labile or reactive species (i.e. oligomers) that may be observed as monomers or precursors. Temporal and chemical variability provide insight into the mechanisms driving partitioning and better constrain the transition between gas-phase species and organic aerosol.",

We performed a series of sensitivity test simulations changing only the model’s vertical resolution above a 8 km height, i.e., dz = 200 m, 300 m, 400 m, 500 m, and 1000 m; constant about 10-100 km height, and found that inertial gravity waves with short vertical wavelength simulated at higher vertical resolution likely play important roles in determination of gravity wave momentum flux in the stratosphere and mesosphere.",

The strongest projects focus on two-way information exchange with both the citizen scientist and the professional scientist learning when they share their knowledge.\nWorking in cooperation with both teachers and fishermen in a small local community in northwest Greenland, we collected novel oceanographic measurements from a small 5 m fishing boat in the local fjord. We established connections with the local school for developing education initiatives, sharing maps and other resources, and worked through the teachers to connect with the village residents. We hosted a community meeting to provide a forum for a two-way information exchange with the science team providing background on the research project and the local residents providing both narrative information on local environmental change over the last one to three decades, and more quantitative and immediately useful information on fjord depths, iceberg flow directions and timing of seasonal ice break up and move out.\nThe local fishermen were intimately familiar with the local environment, having intrinsically collected data on fjord depth from their regular lowering of fishing line to catch Greenlandic halibut, a benthic fish. For our first trip they worked with us locating the deep and shallow parts of the fjord from many seasons of watching icebergs ground on the shallow shoals, and showed us how to navigate into the ice packed glacial front through the dense ice mélange. The local community interest in the project and in learning how to use the equipment we had brought encouraged us to discuss a long-term data gathering relationship, with the fishermen at the center of the collection. They were interested in the findings, wanting to see how the water temperature might differ from surface to depth. The same data we are interested in for better understanding glacial change is data they seek to explain impacts they have seen in their own fishing and hunting over the last several decades.",

            "abstract": "Lake water temperature (LWT) is an important driver of lake ecosystems and it has been identified as an indicator of climate change. At some European lakes LWT has been observed over several decades, but the majority of lakes is not monitored, or only on a non-regular basis, which is insufficient to track a climate signal. Satellite observations might be utilized to fill these gaps, however, only few satellite sensors offer the possibility to analyze time series which cover 25 years or more. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is among these and has been flown as a heritage instrument for almost 35 years. It will be carried on for at least ten more years finally offering a unique opportunity for satellite-based climate studies.\nWe present a satellite-based lake surface water temperature (LSWT) data set for European (pre-alpine) water bodies based on the extensive AVHRR 1 km data record (1989–2013) of the Remote Sensing Research Group at the University of Bern, Switzerland. It has been compiled out of AVHRR/2 (NOAA-07, -09, -11, -14) and AVHRR/3 (NOAA-16, -17, -18, -19 and Metop-A) day and night time data. We will discuss the processing steps (e.g. geolocation, calibration, LSWT algorithm, etc.) which are necessary to obtain the accuracy needed for climate related studies. The resulting climatology covers pre-alpine and alpine lakes with sizes between 14 and 580 km2. We will present and discuss the analysis of trends for some sample lakes in various regions of the Alps.",

            "abstract": "The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by solar wind affects strongly several key parameters in the high-latitude ionosphere. In this study, the solar wind effect on those parameters especially on Joule heating is conducted statistically based on the simultaneous measurements by the EISCAT radars in Tromsø (TRO, 66.6° cgmLat, mainly within the auroral oval on the nightside), and on Svalbard (ESR, 75.4º cgmLat, mostly within the polar cap). The most important findings are as follows: (i) At TRO, the decrease in Joule heating in the afternoon-evening sector due to neutral winds reported by Aikio et al. [2012] requires southward IMF conditions and a sufficiently high solar wind electric field. The increase in the morning sector takes place for all IMF directions within a region where the upper-E neutral wind has a large equatorward component and the F-region plasma flow is directed eastward. (ii) At ESR, an afternoon hot spot of joule heating centred typically at 14-15 MLT is observed during all IMF conditions. Enhanced Pedersen conductances within the hot spot region are observed only for the IMF Bz+/By- conditions, and the corresponding convection electric field values within the hot spot are smaller than during the other IMF conditions. Hence, the hot spot represents a region of persistent magnetopsheric electromagnetic energy input. (iii) For the southward IMF conditions, the MLT-integrated Joule heating rate without neutral winds for By- is twice the value for By+ at TRO. This can plausibly be explained by the higher average solar wind electric field values for By-.",

            "abstract": "The US midcontinent contains several intraplate seismic zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) sitting above the Reelfoot Rift, and the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone (WVSZ), associated with a smaller Grayville Graben, stretching along the border between Illinois and Indiana. This study provides a new estimate of the velocity structure beneath the area based on observations from the Transportable Array and the OIINK (Ozarks-Illinois-INdiana-Kentucky) FlexArray experiment in the region. Numerous models, involving a zone of weakness either in the crust or the mantle, have been used to explain the seismicity in the NMSZ. Here we present a shear velocity model of the lithosphere beneath the midcontinent by inverting dispersion curves of fundamental mode Rayleigh waves, which are primarily sensitive to the shear wave speeds. We find no spatial correlation between the crustal velocity variations and the two seismic zones. But we do observe that low velocities (~ 4% lower than the measured average of the area) exist in the mantle beneath the NMSZ at depths between 90 and 125 km. The low upper mantle velocities extend to the north and reach the WVSZ, where they are about 3% lower than the average. Velocity variations can result from thermal or compositional heterogeneities, although a thermal perturbation is less likely in this area because no clear surface heat flow anomaly is observed. Compositional heterogeneities, such as the presence of hydrous minerals or contamination by enriched mantle from a plume can reduce seismic velocities as well as the mechanical strength of a region, which would produce a weak zone. The lithosphere beneath a failed rift which has already undergone an earlier phase of deformation is more susceptible to compositional modification and weakening compared to an intact part of a craton. Thus, the two seismic zones may mark locations where deformation has been localized in the crust above a weak mantle due to their lower integrated lithospheric strength.",

We investigate the locations and shapes of critical boundary layers within these magnetospheres, specifically the bow shock, magnetopause and magnetotail, in order to more fully understand the complex interaction of the solar wind with these planets. To perform this study, we implement a multifluid MHD simulation capable of modeling the interplanetary solar wind interaction with the intrinsic magnetic field of the ice giant planets. These simulations are useful in that they can track individual fluids for electrons and different ion species and sources, which is important for understanding the interaction at the ice giant planets where differentiating between natively sourced ionospheric ions and externally sourced solar wind ions may be necessary due to their inherently different temperatures and compositions. Our simulations demonstrate that Uranus has an asymmetric and dynamic magnetosphere during solstice conditions, and that the asymmetry of magnetosphere might be quasi-periodic with rotation. We also investigate the magnetic structure and current systems in the magnetotail region, which can be used to understanding the global transport of plasma within the magnetosphere and hence dynamic responses to solar wind forcing and substorms. We will also present new simulations of Uranus’ global magnetosphere for equinox conditions, and provide predictions for auroral locations which we will then place in the context of recent Hubble Space Telescope observations.",

            "abstract": "Gold and arsenic incorporation into pyrite (FeS2) is strongly coupled in different types of ore deposits, including Carlin-type Au, porphyry Cu, epithermal Au, orogenic Au, volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) and iron-oxide Cu-Au (IOCG), among others. Despite significant advances in the last decades, the fundamental factors controlling Au and As partition in pyrite from hydrothermal systems formed under different tectonic settings and crustal levels remain poorly known. Furthermore, the complexity of pyrite microtextures and growth features suggest multi-stage growth that may be useful to monitor changes in fluid composition related to episodic pumping of fluids.\nHere we report a comprehensive database of EMPA, SIMS, LA-ICP-MS and micro-PIXE Au-As analyses that cover temperature conditions of pyrite formation from ~30ºC to ~600ºC. The global pyrite Au-As data form a wedge-shaped zone in compositional space, and show that the solid solubility limit of Au in arsenian pyrite is independent of the geochemical environment of pyrite formation and rather depends on its crystal-chemical properties and post-depositional alteration. Compilation of Au-As concentrations and formation temperatures for pyrite indicates that Au and As solubility is retrograde in this mineral, as Au and As contents decrease with increasing temperature from ~200-500ºC.\nBased on these results, we define one Au-As trend formed by pyrites from Carlin-type and orogenic Au deposits where compositions are largely controlled by fluid-rock-interactions and can be highly perturbed by changes of temperature or subsequent alteration. The second trend consists of pyrites from porphyry Cu, epithermal Au deposits and geothermal systems, which are characterized by compositions that preserve the Au/As signature of mineralizing magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. The well-developed oscillatory zoning in pyrite detected in these systems, where Cu-rich, Au-As-depleted growth zones alternate with Cu-poor, Au-As-rich layers, indicates that Cu is geochemically decoupled from As and Au. These data suggest that selective partitioning of metals into pyrite may be related to abrupt phase separation events and periodic changes in fluid composition, triggered by external forcing factors such as earthquakes.",

In this study, we investigate the dynamics of momentary bed failure driven by large horizontal pressure gradients, which may be the dominant sediment transport mechanism under intense storm condition. Recently, a multi-dimensional two-phase Eulerian sediment transport model has been developed and disseminated to the research community as an open-source code. The numerical model is based on extending an open-source CFD library of solvers, OpenFOAM. Model results were validated with published sediment concentration and velocity data measured in steady and oscillatory flow. The 2DV Reynolds-averaged model showed wave-like bed instabilities when the criteria of momentary bed failure was exceeded. These bed instabilities were responsible for the large transport rate observed during plug flow and the onset of the instabilities was associated with a large erosion depth. To better resolve the onset of bed instabilities, subsequent energy cascade and the resulting large sediment transport rate and sediment pickup flux, 3D turbulence-resolving simulations were also carried out. Detailed validation of the 3D turbulence-resolving Eulerian two-phase model will be presented along with the expanded investigation on the dynamics of momentary bed failure.",

            "abstract": "Zinc isotope abundances are fairly constant in the majority of igneous rocks and shales (δ66Zn ~0.3 ‰), and are typically unmodified by mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal processes, such that ocean ridge serpentinites formed by hydration and oxidation of mantle peridotites have igneous-like δ66Zn values (0.29 ± 0.1 ‰). In contrast, serpentinites from Mariana forearc mud volcanoes are markedly depleted in 66Zn, with a mean δ66Zn value of -0.02 ‰1. These isotopically light δ66Zn values may reflect percolation of the forearc shallow mantle wedge by slab-derived CO2-rich fluids. In this study, we further investigate the fate of Zn during prograde metamorphism of serpentinite in subduction zones, and the its subsequent recycling into the mantle.\nThe sample set includes (1) oceanic serpentinites (Gakkel ridge), (2) a sequence of Western Alps serpentinites recording a prograde subduction path, (3) Mariana forearc mud volcanoes samples, (4) fluid-derived olivines from the Kohistan arc mantle and (5) Himalayan mantle wedge serpentinites.\nSubduction prograde metamorphism induces gradual transition from lizardite (Liz) to antigorite (Atg) in slab serpentinites – Fe3+-rich phases are reduced and fluid mobile elements (e.g. S, B) are released in an oxidized fluid. The Alpine ophiolites samples record a progressive loss of heavy Zn isotopes during the prograde path, with average d66Zn values decreasing from 0.33 ‰ in oceanic Liz-serpentinites to 0.16 ‰ in eclogitic Atg-serpentinites. Our interpretation of these data is that Zn is released from the serpentinites during the Liz-Atg transition via oxidized, S-rich fluids, where it is bound by sulfate, a ligand that favours uptake of heavy Zn. In the Marianas, serpentinite 66Zn depletion is even more pronounced which may reflect the release of CO2-rich fluids enriched in 66Zn.\nBoth shallow (mud volcano) and deeper (Liz/Atg transition) processes produce high δ66Zn fluids that react with the mantle wedge. In agreement with these, samples representative of the fluid-enriched mantle wedge and arc mantle (Himalayan mantle wedge serpentinites, Kohistan mantle olivine2) have extremely heavy δ66Zn values (> 0.74‰). Future work will focus on arc lavas in order to assess the recycling of Zn in subduction zones.\n1 Pons et al, 2011 PNAS v 108  2 Bouilhol et al, 2009 CanMin v 50",

            "abstract": "Probability distributions for equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) are estimated using climate models that have a range of complexities. Here, we investigate the ability to identify ECS using low complexity models using two statistical methods. By using a climate model with intermediate complexity model to provide pseudo-observations with known climate system properties, we test whether the parameters for a low complexity model can be identified to yield similar model responses across a wide range of ECS values. In this work, the Diffusive Ocean Energy balance CLIMate model (DOECLIM) was calibrated to match the output from 639 simulations of the MIT Integrated Global System Model (IGSM), where each IGSM simulation has a different set of values for three key climate system properties: equilibrium climate sensitivity, vertical diffusivity of temperature anomalies and net aerosol forcing. The energy balance model estimates the globally averaged climate state based on simplified model physics. The IGSM represents the zonal mean state of the atmosphere and ocean using physics used in higher complexity models and produces hindcasts and projections that include internal climate variability. The DOECLIM parameters were estimated for each IGSM run to find the parameter settings for the simpler model that would best match the global mean surface temperature and the global-mean ocean heat content as simulated in the more complex model. When successful, this allows for the simpler model to be used as an emulator over a range of model parameter settings. Two statistical calibration techniques were used and compared. The first was Differential Evolution, a genetic algorithm that produces a single set of parameters providing best fit values; the second was a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, which produces a joint probability distribution for the DOECLIM parameters. We analyzed the statistical skill, including potential biases, that exist when calibrating the energy balance model to IGSM output. In particular, the estimated DOECLIM ECS values tended to be lower than their corresponding IGSM values, particularly for runs with low ocean diffusivity. We will discuss these results in the context of other estimates of probability distributions for ECS that use similar energy balance models.",

            "abstract": "The Dead Sea-Red Sea Rift accommodated climatic and historic events that have fundamentally influenced the evolution of hominids. Among these developments, the Homo-Sapience (HS) dispersal “out of Africa” and the “Neolithic Revolution (NR)” represent major benchmarks. These developments occurred during the last interglacial and the post-glacial periods when the Red Sea - Levant region was overall arid. Nevertheless, wetter intervals prevailed within these arid periods, allowed the human culture development. The information on these wetter periods is stored in the sedimentary archives that were formed in the Rift.\nLake Lisan that expanded all over the Dead Sea- Jordan- Kinnarot basin during the last glacial period retreated and contracted when the ice receded at the northern latitudes. At ~ 14-13 ka BP the lake dropped abruptly and deposited thick sequences of halite. Subsequently, terra rossa soil was re-mobilized from the Judea Mountains and accumulated along the Jordan Valley comprising the Fazael Fm. This soil and the availability of water in the Jordan Valley allow the establishment of the early agriculture settlements of Jericho, Gilgal and Fazael (at ~10-9 ka BP, the “peak” of sapropel S1, when enhance flow of Nile waters arrived to the Mediterranean).\nDuring the last interglacial HS dispersal occurs along the Red Sea- Jordan Valley corridor. Evidence for periods of wetness in this rather hyperarid region comes from fringing coral reefs along the Red Sea- Gulf of Aqaba shores, speleothems and travertines in the southern Negev desert –Arava valley and from lake sediments that were recently drilled at the deepest floor of the Dead Sea. All inventories indicate interval of enhanced wetness at ~ 128-122 ka BP, when sapropel S5 occurred. Thus, it appears that the periods of sapropels S1 and S5 were favorite for human culture development along the Red Sea – Jordan rift valley. Nevertheless, these human-development periods terminated abruptly at ~118-116 ka BP and ~ 8.1 ka BP when extreme arid conditions affected the entire Red Sea-Levant area",

The Mattawoman Creek-Billingsley Road (MCBR2), South Dover Bridge (SDB), and Bass River (ODP Site 1074AX) cores were collected at progressively greater distances from the paleoshoreline in continental shelf deposits in Maryland and New Jersey, USA. The PETM carbon isotope excursion (CIE) at each site is accompanied by sharp increases in pollen and spore concentrations, as well as changes in terrestrial palynomorph assemblage composition. In the two sites proximal to the paleoshoreline in Maryland, CIE fern spore abundance was two- to three times greater than in pre-CIE assemblages. At the distal site at Bass River, fern spores are present in CIE sediments and absent in pre-CIE sediments. Angiosperm pollen is most common in CIE sediments at all three sites. Palynofacies analyses, which quantify contributions of organic material from marine and non-marine sources, indicate that terrestrial influx increased sharply at the CIE onset. This observation is consistent with seasonally increased runoff from the continent.",

Understanding the links between geomorphology and riparian soils, vegetation and hydrology is, thus, a prerequisite for relating small scale processes to observations at the watershed scale. Geographic information systems (GIS) have traditionally been used to study links between geomorphology and properties of terrestrial ecosystems. Applying this approach to riparian zones, however, has only recently become feasible with the availability of high-resolution digital elevation models and the new development of suitable computational methods. In this study we present links between geomorphology and riparian zone hydrology, carbon pools and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon. Geomorphometric attributes were successfully used to predict (1) riparian groundwater levels and flow pathways, (2) the size of riparian soil carbon pools, (3) the vertical variation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in riparian soil profiles, as well as (4) riparian carbon fluxes and turnover times.",

Results of a study conducted on wall-to wall forest cover map using Landsat images (Fichet et al., 2014) gave a net forest loss of 0,38% from 1990 and 2000 and sensibly the same loss rate between 2000 and 2010. However, the country launched recently an ambitious development plan, with communication infrastructure, agriculture and forestry as well as mining projects. Hydrological cycle response to changes may be expected, in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Unfortunately monitoring gauging stations have stopped functioning in the seventies, and Gabon will then be unable to evaluate, mitigate and adapt adequately to these environmental challenges.\nHistorical data were registered during 42 years at Lambaréné (from 1929 to 1974) and during 10 to 20 years at 17 other ground stations. The quantile function approach (Tourian et al., 2013) has been tested to estimate discharge from J2 and ERS/Envisat/AltiKa virtual stations. This is an opportunity to assess long term discharge patterns in order to monitor land use change effects and eventual disturbance in runoff.\nFigure 1: Ogoué River basin: J2 (red) and ERS/ENVISAT/ALTIKa (purple) virtual stations\nFichet, L.

Dust can modify the Earth’s energy budget, provide long-range transport of nutrients, and influence land surface processes via erosion. Consequently, effective modeling of the climate system, particularly at regional scales, requires a reasonably accurate representation of dust emission, transport, and deposition. Here I evaluate African dust in 23 state-of-the-art global climate models used in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I find that all models fail to reproduce basic aspects of dust emission and transport over the second half of the 20th century. The models systematically underestimate dust emission, transport and optical depth, and year-to-year changes in these properties bear little resemblance to observations. These findings cast doubt on the ability of these models to simulate the regional climate and the response of African dust to future climate change.",

After take-off, the drone is released from the tow aircraft on a ~700-m stainless steel cable. We have instrumented the 0.23 m diameter and 2.13 m long drone with high fidelity instruments to measure the means and turbulent fluctuations of 3-D wind vector, temperature, humidity, pressure, CO2 and IR sea surface temperature. Data are recorded internally at 40 Hz and simultaneously transmitted to the tow aircraft via dedicated wireless Ethernet link. The CTV accommodates 40 kg of instrument payload and provides it with 250 W of continuous power through a ram air propeller-driven generator. Therefore its endurance is only limited by that of the tow aircraft.We will discuss the CTV development, the engineering challenges and solutions that have been successfully implemented to overcome them. We present results from recent flights as low as 9 m over the coastal ocean and comparisons of profiles and turbulent fluxes from the CTV and the tow aircraft.\nManned aircraft operation at low-level boundary-layer flights is very limited. Dropsondes and UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) and UAS are alternates for measurements near the ocean surface. However, dropsondes have limited sensor capability and do not measure fluxes, and most present UAS vehicles do not have the payload and power capacity nor the low-flying ability in high winds over the oceans. The CTV therefore, fills a needed gap between the dropsondes, in situ aircraft, and UAS. The payload, capacity and power of the CTV makes it suitable for a variety of atmospheric research measurements. Other sensors to measure aerosol, chemistry, radiation, etc., could be readily accommodated in the CTV.",

Negative trends in median ice drafts and most ice fractions are observed, while open water and thinnest ice fractions (<0.3 m) have increased, attesting to the ablation or removal of the older sea-ice from the BG over the nine year period. Monthly anomalies indicate a shift occurred toward thinner ice after 2007, in which the thicker ice evident at the northern stations was reduced. Differences in the ice characteristics between all of the stations also diminished, so that the ice cover throughout the region became statistically homogenous. The moored data are used to calibrate ice thickness estimates from satellite radiometer data to estimate ice volume changes throughout the BG. Summer solid fresh water content decreased drastically in consecutive years from 730 km3 in 2006 to 570 km3 in 2007, and to 240 km3 in 2008. After a short rebound, solid fresh water fell below 220 km3 in 2012. Meanwhile hydrographic data indicate that liquid fresh water in the BG in summer increased 5410 km3 from 2003 to 2010 and decreased at least 210 km3 by 2012. The reduction of both solid and liquid fresh water components indicates a net export of 320 km3 of fresh water from the region occurred between 2010 and 2012, suggesting that the ocean anticyclonic circulation regime has weakened.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty is present in all fields of climate research, spanning from climate projections, to assessing regional impacts and vulnerabilities to adaptation policy and decision-making. The complex and interdisciplinary nature of climate information, however, makes the decision-making process challenging. This process is further hindered by a lack of institutionalized dialogue between climate researchers, decision-makers and user groups. Forums that facilitate such dialogue would allow these groups to actively engage with each other to improve decisions. In parallel, introducing students to these challenges is one way to foster such climate dialogue.\nWe present the design and outcome of an innovative workshop-seminar series we convened at the University of Zurich to demonstrate the pedagogical importance of such forums. An initial two-day workshop brought together 50 participants, including bachelor, master and PhD students and academic staff, and nine speakers from academia, industry, government, and philanthropy. The main objectives were to provide participants with tools to communicate uncertainty in their current or future research projects, to foster exchange between practitioners, students and scientists from different backgrounds and finally to expose students to multidisciplinary collaborations and real-world problems involving decisions under uncertainty.\nAn opinion survey conducted before and after the workshop enabled us to observe changes in participants’ perspectives on what information and tools should be exchanged between researchers and decision-makers to better address uncertainty. Responses demonstrated a marked shift from a pre-workshop vertical conceptualization of researcher-user group interaction to a post-workshop horizontal mode: in the former, researchers were portrayed as bestowing data-based products to decision-makers, while in the latter, both sets of actors engaged in frequent communication, exchanging their needs and expertise. Drawing on examples from the course evaluation, we seek to encourage the organization of similar events, introducing students to these challenges at an early stage of their education and career as a first step towards improving future dialogue.",

            "abstract": "Aboveground cosmic-ray neutron measurements provide an opportunity to infer soil moisture at the sub-kilometer scale (with an effective area of approximately 300 meter radius). Initial efforts to assimilate those measurements have shown the ability to accurately estimate integrated soil moisture at the root zone. This study expands such analyses by investigating (1) how the information from aboveground cosmic-ray neutrons can constrain the soil moisture at distinct depths simulated by a land surface model, and (2) how changes in data availability (in terms of retrieval frequency) impact the dynamics of simulated soil moisture profiles. We employ ensemble data assimilation techniques in experiments applied at semi-arid shrubland, rainfed agricultural field, and mixed forest biomes. The performance of the land surface model is compared without and with assimilation of observations at hourly intervals and every two days. Synthetic observations of aboveground cosmic-ray neutrons better constrain the soil moisture simulated by the model in root zone soil layers (0-100 cm) despite the limited measurement depth of the sensor (estimated to be 12-20 cm). The ability of the model to reproduce a ‘true’ soil moisture profile is remarkably good regardless of the frequency of observations at the semi-arid site. However, soil moisture profiles are better constrained when assimilating synthetic cosmic-ray neutrons observations hourly rather than every two days at the cropland and mixed forest sites. This indicates potential benefits of using cosmic-ray neutron sensors for hydrometeorological modeling and in combination with satellite remote sensing. Moreover, differences in summertime meteorological forcing between the semi-arid site and the other two sites may indicate a possible controlling factor to soil moisture dynamics in addition to differences in soil and vegetation properties.",

Hydrate dissociation by depressurization and/or heating is accompanied by a multifold hydrate volume expansion and host sediments with low permeability experience massive destructuration. Proper characterization requires coring, recovery, manipulation and testing under P-T conditions within the stability field. Pressure core technology allows for the reliable characterization of hydrate bearing sediments within the stability field in order to address scientific and engineering needs, including the measurement of parameters used in hydro-thermo-mechanical analyses, and the monitoring of hydrate dissociation under controlled pressure, temperature, effective stress and chemical conditions. Inherent sampling effects remain and need to be addressed in test protocols and data interpretation. Pressure core technology has been deployed to study hydrate bearing sediments at several locations around the world. In addition to pressure core testing, a comprehensive characterization program should include sediment analysis, testing of reconstituted specimens (with and without synthetic hydrate), and in situ testing. Pressure core characterization technology can be used to study other gas-charged formations such as deep sea sediments, coal bed methane and gas shales.",

Characteristic ages are found from both East and West Antarctica, indicating that both of these areas were glaciated and producing icebergs during a time when major West Antarctic glaciation was previously uncertain. Site 270 is located in the central Ross Sea on the southeastern flank of the Central High (77°26.48'S; 178°30.19'W). Approximately 36% of the grain population exhibits ages between 475 and 500 Ma, representing the Ross Orogeny and Transantarctic Mountains of East Antarctica. These ages are slightly older than the bedrock at the base of Site 270, which has been previously dated at 437 ± 6 Ma. Smaller populations of grains are clustered near 100, 200, and 350 Ma, all of which point to a West Antarctic contribution. While it has been previously thought that West Antarctic glaciation could have initiated during the Oligocene, it has remained inconclusive. Our data set presents the first geochemical provenance evidence of a glaciated West Antarctica during this time. We suggest the Ross Sea was not just influenced by the ice caps residing on the uplifted basement highs, but was already supporting the transport of ice bergs from the surrounding coastlines.",

            "abstract": "The fraction of the Moon made from Earth at the time of the moon-forming impact and the amount of impactor it contains are major questions concerning the origin of the Earth-Moon system. Earth’s mantle and the Moon are distinctive in their FeO contents and some trace element ratios (e.g. Nb/Ta) but identical in their isotopes of O, Si, W, Ti and Cr. The latter observation implies that they are made from exactly the same material but the former implies the opposite. Due to the pressure-dependence and redox-sensitive nature of W partitioning between metallic core and silicate mantle, the identical W isotopic ratios of both bodies is hard to reconcile. One possible solution is that the impactor and the proto-Earth were not only of similar composition but also essentially the same size - a rather unlikely coincidence.\nAn alternative scenario which we have modeled chemically and isotopically is that the proto-Earth, with a higher mantle FeO content than present, was struck by an early-formed, highly-reduced impactor. The core of the impactor merged with that of Earth, as depicted in most simulations. The moon, containing a similar proportion of impactor material to that of the Earth (<15%), can be viewed as a ‘snap-shot’ of proto-Earth’s mantle. This produced a Moon identical to the Earth’s mantle in isotopic composition, but with elevated mantle Nb/Ta and FeO contents. Evidence of FeO-rich domains in Archaean mantle (Francis, Lithos v.71, 2003) would be consistent with an FeO-rich terrestrial protomantle.\nChanges in mantle FeO content have implications for the stability of liquid H2O at the surface. More FeO-rich mantles (e.g Mars) generate basalts which are more susceptible to serpentinisation and hence to the consumption of surface water. Thus we can argue that the impactor delivered volatiles to the Earth and the ability to retain water in surface reservoirs.",

The tomographic inversion uses 47235 Pg arrival times from 6812 aftershocks recorded by 61 stations around the Lushan and Wenchuan earthquakes. Across the front Longmenshan fault near the Lushan earthquake, there exists a strong velocity contrast with higher velocities to the west and lower velocities to the east. Along the Longmenshan fault system, there exist two high velocity patches showing an “X” shape with an obtuse angle along the near northwest-southeast (NW-SE) direction. They correspond to the Precambrian Pengguan and Baoxing complexes on the surface but with a ~ 20km shift, respectively. The aftershock gap of the 2008 Wenchuan and the 2013 Lushan earthquakes is associated with lower velocities. Based on the theory of maximum effective moment criterion, this suggests that the aftershock gap is weak and the ductile deformation is more likely to occur in the upper crust within the gap under the near NW-SE compression. Therefore our results suggest that the large earthquake may be hard to happen within the gap.",

            "abstract": "A non-hydrostatic sigma-coordinate numerical model (NHWave) is applied to study the structure of a river plume, and the vertical mixing due to shear instabilities. A 3D large-eddy simulation approach is used with the aim to resolve the flow turbulence in the stratified ambient fluid at high Reynolds number. The domain is of depth 10m, length 500m and width 25m, and initially quiescent containing saltwater of salinity 26 psu. Fresh water plume is sent from the left boundary with a range of internal Froude number. Simulation resulting using Standard Smagorinsky closure demonstrates that the model is able to predict shear instabilities although it could not resolve the secondary instability at high Reynolds number. The characteristic length scale of the shear instabilities is around 10 m, which is consistent with field observation of Connecticut River plume using a 4-channel broadband echo sounder (Geyer et al. 2010, Geophy. Res. Lett., 37, L22607). The mixing efficiency and dissipation rate are obtained from the numerical simulation results, and these results are used to investigate and evaluate the Richardson-number-dependent parameterization of the mixing process. The model can also provide the information on fine structures of surface elevation variations, which enables us to correlate the surface signature with the turbulent billow underneath. The model therefore may be useful to help interpret surface signatures observed using various remote sensing techniques. Supported by Office of Naval Research.",

            "abstract": "Assessing and quantifying the uncertainties in projected future changes of energy and water budgets over land surface are important steps towards improving our confidence in climate change projections. In this study, the inter-model variation of projected future changes of land surface energy and water fluxes are assessed, using the 2081-2100 and 1981-2000 periods under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) for comparison. Also investigated is the influence of dynamic vegetation on amplifying or moderating the uncertainties due to model dependency. Simulation results for surface sensible heat fluxes show a high degree of model dependency mainly in Central Asia, central North America, eastern South America and Central Africa. These uncertainties are further amplified by dynamic vegetation feedback. Although precipitation is very likely to increase in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, a high degree of model-related uncertainty exists for ET, soil water content and surface runoff, suggesting the discrepancy of land surface models in simulating the water cycles there. Large model-related uncertainties for the surface water budget also exist in the Tropics including southeastern South America and Central Africa. In the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, vegetation dynamics contributes additional uncertainties for the simulated future changes of water cycles in northwestern North America and central North Asia where the projected vegetation changes are uncertain. In the tropics, while the vegetation dynamics adds more uncertainties for the simulated future changes of soil water content in the Amazon and Congo Basins where there exists dense vegetation, it does so for the projected ET changes in the central and southeastern part of South America and the areas north and south of the Congo Basin. Results show that the range of uncertainties for projected future changes of water budget in the high latitudes of Northern Hemisphere is reduced using the same land surface model. It also shows that large ranges of uncertainties for projected future changes of water and energy cycles in response to the simulated vegetation changes exists in the central part of North Asia.",

The understanding of diversity of the characteristics of the huge earthquakes and their seismic and tsunami hazards are quite important issue.\nVarious earthquake cycle simulations have been recently performed to estimate the diversity of the patterns of the huge earthquakes in the trough and the possibility of the future earthquakes, where the fault rupture propagation process and the friction in a plate boundary are considered. Here, we integrated these two simulations by one-way weakly coupled approach; First we conduct the quasi-dynamic earthquake cycle simulation, then the resultant time-dependent heterogeneous slip histories on the plate boundary are smoothly connected to as inputs of the ground motion and tsunami simulation.\nAs a trial of this approach, the integrated simulation was performed under the huge earthquake scenario with large fault rupture area very similar to the 1707 Hoei earthquake. The target volume of the latter simulation is 1,200 km (EW) x 1,000 km (NS) x 250 km (depth). The equations of motion for viscoelastic body were solved by finite-difference method with discretization of 0.5 km and 0.25 km in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively. For such large-scale simulation the K computer at the AICS, RIKEN was utilized with 2,400 CPUs. The computation time was approx. 1 hour for 80,000 time steps calculation.\nThe results of the integrated simulation show that we successfully reproduced a series of phenomena from earthquake generation to seismic wave propagation, strong ground motion in land, and tsunami growth. Moreover, we confirmed seismic wave generation accompanied by the heterogeneous fault rupture propagation on the plate boundary and the features of the subsequent ground motion on earth surface. It is expected that the high-performance computing of the integrated system enables us to investigate diversity of the seismic and tsunami hazards of huge earthquakes in southwestern Japan as well as their complexity of earthquake generation itself based on physical models.",

            "abstract": "A comprehensive measurement program of effective black carbon (eBC), fine particle (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) was undertaken during 1st December 2011 to 31st March 2012 in Delhi, India. The mean mass concentrations of eBC, PM2.5 and CO were recorded as 12.1±8.7µg/m3, 182.75±114.5µg/m3 and 3.41±1.6ppm respectively. Also, the Absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE) was estimated from eBC and varied from 0.38 to 1.29 with mean value of 1.09±0.11. The frequency of occurrence of AAE was ~17% less than unity whereas ~83% was greater than unity. The mass concentrations of eBC were found to be higher by ~34% of the average value of eBC (12.1µg/m3) during the study period. Sources of eBC were estimated and they were ~ 94% from fossil fuel (eBCff) combustion whereas only 6% was from wood burning (eBCwb). The ratio between eBCff and eBCwb was fifteen which indicates a higher impact from fossil fuels compared to biomass burning. When comparing eBCff during day and night, a factor of three higher concentrations was observed in night-time than daytime, it is due to combustion of fossil fuel (diesel vehicle emission) and shallow boundary layer conditions. The contribution of eBCwb in eBC was higher in between 18.00 to 21.00 hrs due to burning of wood / biomass. A significant correlation between eBC and PM2.5 (r=0.78) and eBC and CO (r = 0.46) indicates the similarity in location sources. The mass concentration of eBC was highest (23.4μg/m3) during the month of December when the mean visibility (VIS) was lowest (1.31Km). Regression analysis among wind speed (WS), VIS, soot particles and CO were studied and significant negative relationships were seen as VIS and eBC (-0.65), eBCff (-0.66), eBCwb (-0.34) and CO (-0.65), however, in between WS among eBC (-0.68), eBCff (-0.67), eBCwb (-0.28) and CO (-0.53) respectively. The regression analysis indicated that emission of soot particles may be localized to fossil fuel combustion whereas wood/biomass burning emissions of black carbon are due to transportation from farther distances. Regression analysis between eBCff with CO (r=0.44) indicated a similar source as vehicular emissions. The very high loading of PM2.5 along with eBC over Delhi suggests that urgent action is needed to mitigate the emissions of carbonaceous aerosol in the northern part of India.",

            "abstract": "Compared with subduction and continental transform systems, many characteristics of oceanic transform faults (OTF) are better defined (first-order structure and composition, thermal properties, etc.). Still, many aspects of earthquake behavior along OTFs remain poorly understood as a result of their relative remoteness. But the substantial aseismic deformation (averaging roughly 85%) that occurs along OTFs and the implied interaction of aseismic with seismic deformation is an opportunity to explore fundamental earthquake nucleation and rupture processes. However, the study of OTF earthquake properties is not easy because these faults are often located in remote regions, lacking nearby seismic networks. Thus, many standard network-based seismic approaches are infeasible, but some can be adapted to the effort. For example, double-difference methods applied to cross-correlation measured Rayleigh wave time shifts is an effective tool to provide greatly improved relative epicentroid locations, origin-time shifts, and relative event magnitudes for earthquakes in remote regions. The same comparative waveform measurements can provide insight into rupture directivity of the larger OTF events. In this study, we calculate improved relative earthquake locations and magnitudes of earthquakes along the Blanco Fracture Zone in the northeast Pacific Ocean and compare and contrast that work with a study of the more remote Menard Transform Fault (MTF), located in the southeast Pacific Ocean. For the Blanco, we work exclusively with Rayleigh (R1) observations exploiting the dense networks in the northern hemisphere. For the MTF, we combine R1 with Love (G1) observations to map and to analyze the distribution of strong asperities along this remote, 200-km-long fault. Specifically, we attempt to better define the relationship between observed near-transform normal and vertical strike-slip earthquakes in the vicinity of the MTF. We test our ability to use distant observations (the closest station is about 2,500 km distant) to constrain rupture characteristics of recent strong earthquakes in the region. We compare the seismicity characteristics along the faults to explore the relationship of fault age and morphology on rupture behavior.",

            "abstract": "In applications of Deep Geothermal reservoirs, thermal recovery processes, and contaminated groundwater sites, the multiphase multicomponent flow and transport processes are often considered the most important underlying physical process. In particular, the behavior of phase appearance and disappearance is the critical to the performance of many geo-reservoirs, and great interests exit in the scientific community to simulate this coupled process. This work is devoted to the modeling and simulation of two-phase, two components flow and transport in the porous medium, whereas the phase change behavior in non-isothermal conditions is considered.\nIn this work, we have implemented the algorithm developed by Marchand, et al., into the open source scientific software OpenGeoSys. The governing equation is formulated in terms of molar fraction of the light component and mean pressure as the persistent primary variables, which leads to a fully coupled nonlinear PDE system. One of the important advantages of this approach is avoiding the primary variables switching between single phase and two phase zones, so that this uniform system can be applied to describe the behavior of phase change. On the other hand, due to the number of unkown variables closure relationships are also formulated to close the whole equation system by using the approach of complementarity constrains. For the numerical technical scheme: The standard Galerkin Finite element method is applied for space discretization, while a fully implicit scheme for the time discretization, and Newton–Raphson method is utilized for the global linearization, as well as the closure relationship.\nThis model is verified based on one test case developed to simulate the heat pipe problem. This benchmark involves two-phase two-component flow in saturated/unsaturated porous media under non-isothermal condition, including phase change and mineral-water geochemical reactive transport processes. The simulation results will be presented to demonstrate its adequacy and efficiency, especially facing phase change behaviors. The validated model is further applied to simulate diffusive transport and biodegradation process of VOCs (Volatile Organic Contaminants) in unsaturated porous medium based on the experimental measurements",

We show that an analysis method involving the Wigner-Ville distribution has higher resolution in time and frequency compared to conventional filter techniques used for surface wave analysis.

            "abstract": "We present results from two geophysical investigations of the north of Ireland, one of a concealed sedimentary basin and the other of an area of pre- to mid-Cambrian metasedimentary material with local microseismicity in Donegal. Magnetotelluric data have been acquired over each area as part of the IRETHERM Project in order to assess potential low-enthalpy geothermal resources. In addition, airborne frequency-domain EM response data have been used to assist in the definition of near-surface electrical structure and constraint of magnetotelluric modeling.\nThe Rathlin Basin in Northern Ireland was identified as a potential geothermal resource due both an elevated geothermal gradient (observed in two deep boreholes) and favorable hydraulic properties in thick successions of Permian and Triassic sandstones (measured from core samples). Prior seismic experiments failed to fully image the sediments beneath the overlying flood basalt. A new experiment applying the magnetotelluric method has had more success, as the MT signal is not dissipated by the crystalline overburden. MT data were acquired at 69 sites across the north-eastern portion of the onshore Rathlin Basin and on nearby Rathlin Island in order to image the thickness, depth, and lateral continuity of the target sediments. Analyses and modeling of the data have determined a resistivity model that maps the variation in thickness of the sediment fill and the truncation of the sediments against the structurally-controlling Tow Valley Fault. Further testing of the model sensitivity to variations of the thickness of the Sherwood Sandstone Group within the sediment fill has also been performed, as the overlying sediments have lower porosities and permeabilities from core sampling.\nMicroseismicity in a metasedimentary area of northern Donegal suggests that secondary porosity distributions along fracture planes may have been augmented, leading to elevated electrical conductivity. MT data were acquired over the epicenter and surrounding of a M2.2 earthquake that occurred on 26/01/2012, with both audio-MT and broadband MT data acquired at 59 sites, and solely AMT data at the remaining 29 sites. Forward and inverse modeling of the data have been performed to search for fine conductive structures within the bedrock, as well as to model the general subsurface structure.",

            "abstract": "A new snowflake aggregation model is developed to study single-scattering properties of aggregate snowflakes. Snowflakes are generated by random aggregation of 6-bullet rosette crystals and constrained by size-density relationships derived from previous field observations. Due to random generation, aggregates may have the same size or mass, yet differing morphology allowing for a study into how shape influences their scattering properties. Furthermore, three different aggregate shapes are created: randomly generated, oblate and prolate flakes. The single-scattering properties of the aggregates are investigated using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) at 10 frequencies. Results are compared to those of Mie theory for solid and soft spheres (density 10% that of solid ice) and to T-matrix results for solid and soft spheroidal cases with aspect ratios of 0.8 (randomly generated) and 0.6 (oblate and prolate). Above size parameter 0.75, neither the solid nor the soft sphere and spheroidal approximations accurately represent the DDA results for the randomly generated or oblate aggregates. Asymmetry and the normalized scattering and backscattering cross-sections of the randomly generated and oblate aggregates fall between the soft and solid spherical and spheroidal approximations. This implies that evaluating snow scattering properties using realistic shapes, such as the aggregates created in this study instead of a simplified crystal shape, is of paramount importance. The dependence of the single-scattering properties on each aggregate’s detailed structure seems of secondary importance. Oblate and prolate preliminary results indicate that backscattering for prolate and oblate flakes is lower than that of the randomly generated flakes. Detailed analyses are conducted to answer: (a) why aggregates of similar size yet dissimilar shape backscatter differently and (b) why prolate and oblate aggregates backscatter differently than randomly generated aggregates.",

Intensity maps provide guidance for the rapid assessment of shaking intensity and consequently the physical damage involved with an earthquake. Local correlations between the instrumental ground motion parameters and shaking intensity values are used to prepare these maps. There are several correlations derived using data from different regions in the world. However, since local damage characteristics of the built environment affect the felt-intensity values directly, different felt-intensity values may be reported in two different regions subjected to ground motions with similar amplitude and frequency contents. Thus such relationships should be derived based on regional strong motion and intensity datasets. Despite the intense seismic activity, as of now there are no such local correlations for the North Anatolian Fault Zone. In this study, we use the recently-compiled Turkish strong motion dataset along with the corresponding felt intensity data from past earthquakes to derive local relationships between MMI and a selected ground motion parameter (PGA, PGV, and SA at selected periods). We provide two sets of predictive equations: first group expresses the intensity values as a function of a selected ground motion parameter while the second set is more refined involving the event magnitude, distance and site class terms as independent variables. We present intensity maps of selected past events against the observed maps. We conclude that regional data from seismic networks is crucial for preparing realistic maps for use disaster management purposes.",

            "abstract": "Marine Chlorine deposition data in French Guiana’s east coast and wind speeds influences has been studied here. In 2001 and 2002 an INERIS’s studies has shown that monitoring hydrogen chloride emitted by the rocket would be appropriate. Thus, with the help of the French Guiana Space Center, two measurement campaigns (2004-2008) have been implemented by the Regional Observatory Air (ROA). The purpose was to determine the impact of space activities in and around the city of Sinnamary. The ROA has made measurements of chlorine concentration during and outside periods of shooting to assess the chlorine from the rocket boosters of natural background chlorine due to its proximity with the Atlantic Ocean. A method is proposed here to differentiate natural from anthropogenic emissions from chlorine. The use of certain meteorological parameter (wind, humidity, temperature, etc…) will first be discussed for the transportation of chlorine. Then, we will try to classify chlorine dispersion according to the seasons and areas. Finally a comparison with a previous study in Brazil will be made.",

            "abstract": "Weather and climate extremes impose substantial impacts on human societies and ecosystems. In particular, events that are large in space (areal extent), time (duration) or both are likely to be associated with highly significant consequences. Hence, a better detection, characterization and understanding of such anomalous events is crucial.\nThere is widespread consensus on a global and continental-scale warming trend, which leads to increases in the number, magnitude and frequency of temperature extremes (Hansen et al., 2012). It is less clear, however, if this warming also coincides with a broadening of temperature distributions (Huntingford et al., 2013). Moreover, the question whether other climate variables, such as large-scale precipitation deficits, likewise change, remains largely unanswered (Sheffield et al., 2012; Seneviratne 2012).\nIn this study, we address this issue by investigating the characteristics of large extremes, using an algorithm that detects the n largest spatiotemporally connected climate extremes for any time period. The deployed algorithm detects, depending on the chosen time step and variable, major heat waves, cold spells or droughts. We find a robust increase in the magnitude of large hot temperature extremes on a global and European scale in observations and reanalysis products, whereas the duration and affected area of those extremes does not show any pronounced changes. These results reveal that there is a detectable signal in temperature distributions beyond the mean warming trend, which might imply a structural change in the making of large extreme events.\nFurthermore, we use the CMIP5 ensemble of models and an ensemble of 100+ members of a regional climate model for Europe (HadRM3P within the weather@home framework[1]) in order to conduct a global and continental-scale analysis of large extreme events in temperature and precipitation. The employment of those model ensembles allows to sample more reliably the tails of the distribution, which will result in a better characterization of the magnitude, frequency as well as spatiotemporal structure of these events.\n\n[1] http://www.climateprediction.net/weatherathome/",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 331 to the Okinawa backarc basin provided an opportunity to study the microbial stratigraphy within the sediments surrounding a hydrothermal vent. The Okinawa backarc basin is a sedimented region of the seafloor located on a continental margin, and also hosts a hydrothermal network within the subsurface. Site C0014 within the Iheya North hydrothermal field is located 450 m east of the active vent and has a surface temperature of 5°C with no evidence of hydrothermal alteration within the top 10 m. Temperature increases with depth at an estimated rate of 3°C/m and transitions from non-hydrothermal margin sediments to a hydrothermally altered regime below 10 m. Site C0014 is a unique location to study changes in microbial communities with depth, as the hydrothermal system generates a thermally and geochemically restrictive subvent biosphere.\nIn this study, we utilized deep 16S rRNA sequencing of DNA from IODP Expedition 331 Site C0014 sediment horizons in order to assess diversity throughout the sediment column as well as determine the potential limits of the biosphere. Analysis of the amplicon data suggests that Archaea represent a significant proportion of the indigenous community throughout the top 15 m of sediment, where Archaea then abruptly disappear. Furthermore, a deeper classification of Archaeal sequences suggests a transition from a mesophilic community to a potentially thermophilic one, where there is an increasingly stronger signal of Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG) followed by Terrestrial Hot Spring Crenarchaeotic Group (THSCG). Additionally, there are several horizons in which methanotrophy is likely supported, indicated by peaks in anaerobic methanotrophic Archaea. The cessation of Archaea as well as Chloroflexi, a common marine subsurface bacterial phylum, at approximately 15 meters below seafloor (mbsf) is suggestive of a potential boundary within Site C0014 in which the environmental conditions have become too restrictive for the persistence of diverse and abundant microbial communities.\nAffiliations: IODP and C-DEBI",

            "abstract": "As Himalayan debris-covered glaciers retreat and thin in response to climate warming, their long, low-gradient tongues generate substantial meltwater which often collects to form surface lakes. Supraglacial lakes on debris covered glaciers present a mechanism of atmosphere-glacier energy transfer that is poorly-studied, and only conceptually included in mass-balance studies. The ponded water can enhance energy transfer as compared to dry debris cover, while also acting as a reservoir of melt-available energy. Supraglacial lakes occur in association with debris-free ice cliffs, another poorly-constrained but critical component of glacier melt. Understanding the role of supraglacial lakes requires precise monitoring of lake volume, estimation of inlet and outlet flows, and consideration of the energy balance across three surfaces: atmosphere-lake, lake-ice, and lake-saturated debris layer.\nThis research progresses previous modeling work on the energy and mass balance of such supraglacial lakes. Lakes were monitored during the monsoon of 2013 on Lirung Glacier in the Langtang Himal of Nepal with pressure transducers and temperature sensors, while UAV-derived DEMs were used to determine lake geometry. Lake albedo was measured to vary between 0.08 and 0.12, and a nearby on-glacier AWS was used to drive the energy balance. Results indicate that the lakes act as a significant recipient of energy, and suggest that lakes are an important part of an active supraglacial hydrologic system during the monsoon. Melt generated by the lake in contact with bare ice is calculated to be 3-5 cm/day, while energy conducted through saturated lake-bottom debris only resulted in 1-2 mm/day melt. The subaqueous melt rates are of similar magnitude to observed ice-cliff melt rates, allowing lake-cliff systems to persist. Energy leaving the lake system through englacial conduits may be the most important contribution to the glacier’s mass balance, driving surface evolution to form new ice cliffs and depressions by conduit collapse. These results indicate that supraglacial lakes efficiently convey atmospheric energy to the glacier’s interior and rapidly progress the downwasting process.",

            "abstract": "Shiveluch Volcano (Kamchatka, Russia) has been in a consistent state of eruption for the past 15 years. During this period different eruption styles have been documented including: sub-plinian events, dome growth and collapse, and subsequent debris flow deposits. For example, on June 25-26, 2009 a pyroclastic debris flow was emplaced and the eruption onset that produced it was recorded by a series of seismic events spanning several hours. However, due to cloud cover, visual confirmation of the exact emplacement time was obscured. Orbital remote sensing was able to image the deposit repeatedly over the subsequent months. ASTER is a high spatial resolution (90m), low temporal resolution (2 – 4 days at the poles, 16 days at the equator) thermal infrared (TIR) sensor on the NASA Terra satellite. AVHRR is a high temporal resolution (minutes to several hours), low spatial resolution (1km) spaceborne TIR sensor on a series of NOAA satellites. Combined, these sensors provide a unique opportunity to fuse high-spatial and high-temporal resolution data to better observe changes on the surface of the deposit over time. For example, ASTER data were used to determine the flow area and to provide several data points for average temperature while AVHRR data were used to increase the amount of data points. Through this method an accurate average cooling rate over a three month period was determined. This cooling curve was then examined to derive several features about the deposit that were previously unknown. The time of emplacement and period of time needed for negligible thermal output were first determined by extrapolating the cooling curve in time. The total amount of heat output and total flow volume of the deposit were also calculated. This volume was then compared to the volume of the dome to calculate the percentage of collapse. This method can be repeated for other flow deposits to determine if there is a consistent correlation between the dome growth rate, the average collapse size, and the size of the deposit. Therefore, by combining the data from these two sensors the creation of an accurate cooling curve for thermally-elevated volcanic flow deposits was made possible. In doing, additional features related to the eruption mechanism were also determined.",

            "abstract": "We have applied several extensions and optimal smoothing approaches of the Kalman filter, one of the best known recursive data processing techniques, on the Full Tensor Gradiometry (FTG) data acquired by Bell Geospace over the Vinton salt dome located in southwest Louisiana. We used the filter to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of gravity gradiometry components. We tested the standard Kalman filter and Fading memory and Constrained Kalman filter extensions with Fixed-lag and Forward-Backward smoothing methods to maintain symmetry. Our most meaningful results were obtained through the Kalman filter with the constraint of Laplace’s equation combined with the Forward-Backward filter operations. Laplace’s equation constraint was incorporated using two separate strategies: Model reduction and Perfect constraint (or Perfect measurement). In general, Kalman filter processed data have greater dynamic range than previously filtered data and also have the ability to extract signal from noisy data without having to remove a band of wavenumbers. In addition, our constrained Kalman filter also has the ability to force the Laplace’s equation constraint. These characteristics enable the Kalman filter to investigate short wavelength signals associated with near-surface lateral density variations. In analyzing two dimensional maps for geologic variations, our workflow includes leveling and decorrugation, both procedures necessary for data processed along profiles. Several previously mapped near-subsurface geologic features like faults and their continuity in the Vinton dome area are more readily apparent in our Kalman filter processed components. Since the processed data generally agree with the previously mapped and interpreted structures, the interpretation could be extended to previously unmapped areas. The use of Kalman filtering in combination with Laplace’s equation in applications such as gravity and magnetic gradiometry could be useful in determining more precisely the near-surface structural and stratigraphic variations associated with earthquake faults in addition to petroleum traps and their nature.",

            "abstract": "Slow Slip Events (SSEs) are an important part of the seismic cycle in many subduction zones. However, their role in earthquake triggering is still unclear. Down-dip events may load higher parts of the seismogenic zone, perhaps promoting seismic rupture. Alternately, slow slip could release a portion of accumulated strain, making seismic rupture less likely. In September 2012, a M=7.6 earthquake took place beneath the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica. Approximately 1 month prior to the 2012 main shock a SSE took place, representing the first time that a SSE was directly imaged in close spatial and temporal proximity to a large earthquake. We investigate the stress changes within the seismogenic zone associated with this preceding SSE along with previously recorded SSEs, and compare them with the spatial extent of the 2012 earthquake.\nUsing inversions for fault slip from a dense C-GPS network located on the Peninsula, we compute the Coulomb Failure Stress Change (Delta CFS) associated with this inferred slip using Coulomb 3.3 (Toda et al., 2011). We find that Delta CFS due to the preceding SSE was as high as 0.5 Bars, however these values were well down dip of the co-seismic rupture location. Using earthquake values from a published coseismic inversion (Yue et al., 2012), the preceding SSE induced Delta CFS of +0.128 Bars. Varying the receiver fault geometry does not generate Delta CFS values greater than 0.2 bars at the updip rupture location, below commonly accepted values for static triggering of earthquakes or aftershocks. This leads us to believe that the preceding SSE did not trigger the M 7.6 earthquake. These calculations only consider an elastic half space. We are developing a Finite Element Model of the subduction zone to consider the possible impact of more complex rheologies on the stress transfer process.",

            "abstract": "The Cretaceous-age margin of western North America, as exposed along the Idaho-Oregon border, juxtaposes accreted terrains to the west and cratonic North America to the east. The Idaho batholith intrudes exclusively east of this boundary. New (U-Th)/He zircon ages from samples collected across the boundary between 44 and 45 °N latitude illustrate the variability in cooling below 200 °C and further document the abrupt nature of this margin.\nThree samples collected from the accreted terrains near the Idaho border yield the oldest ages: 102.3 ± 1.6 Ma (± 1σ; Sparta Butte, OR); 88.6 ± 1.3 Ma (Snake River at Pittsburg Landing, ID); and 83.5 ± 1.4 Ma (above Pittsburg Landing, ID). These ages bracket the inferred timing of deformation within the western Idaho shear zone (WISZ), which currently demarcates this boundary. Immediately to the east, within the WISZ, samples yield ages of 76.2 ± 1.4 to 63.2 ± 1.0 Ma and record steady cooling following deformation. East of the WISZ, within the Atlanta lobe of the Idaho batholith, cooling ages vary from 65.0 ± 1.0 to 20.2 ± 0.3 Ma. The overall pattern of cooling ages is older on the margins of the Atlanta lobe and younger in the center closer to the Sawtooth Valley. Higher density sampling in the Sawtooth and White Cloud Mountains near Stanley, ID reveal internal young Miocene deformation associated with extension. Ages within the Sawtooth Mountains range from 34.2 ± 0.5 Ma (Atlanta lobe) to 20.2 ± 0.3 Ma (Sawtooth granite), whereas two samples of the Atlanta lobe from the White Cloud Mountains to the east yield ages of 68.5 ± 1.0 Ma and 64.2 ± 1.0 Ma. The cooling age pattern likely reflects exhumation of the Sawtooth Mountains along an E-dipping, low-angle normal fault during the Oligocene-Miocene. Overall, the pattern of cooling ages clearly demonstrates distinct domains of thermal stability – notably accreted terrains, WISZ, and the Atlanta lobe - with respect to cooling below 200 °C.",

            "abstract": "Erosional sequence boundaries and incised valleys buried in modern continental shelves represent the response of alluvial and coastal systems to Quaternary sea level oscillations. The study of the processes leading to valley incision reveals, at both regional and global scales, the influence of tectonics and eustatism on the evolution of fluvial landforms in coastal plains, while the sedimentary infill of the valley may represents one of the best archives to investigate past environmental changes. Although the time registered in the stratigraphic record represents only a small portion of the geological history, informations about the processes governing the evolution of past landscapes can be quantified by looking to erosional surfaces, where much of the time is condensed. The Manfredonia Incised Valley (southern Adriatic Sea), is a very interesting case of valley as it formed during a single episode of incision related to the last glacial sea level fall and was completely filled during the post-glacial sea level rise. The inverse-funnel shape of the incision, and its confinement toward the mid-inner shelf reveal the impact of the step-wise sea level fall on preexisting coastal morphologies, in particular during the MIS5-4 and MIS3-2 transitions. The 45 m thick sedimentary succession filling the valley recorded the post-glacial sea level rise, as revealed by the upward transition from fluvial to shallow-marine deposits, and the impact of base level and high-frequency climate change on river to coastal systems. The upper 15 m of infill, in particular, consist of multiple bayhead delta progradations occurred synchronously to the formation of sapropel S1, and represent the very-shallow water equivalent of the cm-thick sapropel layers accumulated offshore in the deeper southern Adriatic basin.",

            "abstract": "We seek to understand spatiotemporal (ST) patterns of agricultural land cover dynamics on the lower Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD). Recent availability of accurately coregistered, radiometrically intercalibrated Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI imagery collected since 1988 allows for synoptic scale ST analyses of vegetation phenology. We use multitemporal spectral mixture analysis of exoatmospheric reflectance to represent land cover and water bodies as continuous fields of soil and sediment substrates (S), vegetation (V), and dark surfaces (D; water & shadow). This study analyses 61 cloud-free Landsat acquisitions across two geographic scenes to identify ST patterns of winter cropping and interconversion between agricultural fields and ponds used for aquaculture. We also use MODIS 16-day EVI composite time series post-2000 and high spatial resolution imagery to extend and vicariously validate the Landsat-derived observations. We use temporal moment spaces (derived from temporal mean, standard deviation, and skewness) and temporal feature spaces (derived from spatial Principal Components) to characterize the full range of phenological patterns observed at 30 m scales throughout the lower delta. For each year with sufficient cloud-free coverage, we distinguish between areas with a high likelihood of use for aquaculture versus areas with a high likelihood of use for agriculture based on a combination of reflectance and phenology. From changes in these patterns we infer changes in land use on seasonal to interannual timescales. Many of the phenological patterns we observe occur on the scale of individual polders, suggesting decision making at community scales. While there appears to be considerable loss of agricultural land to aquaculture in many areas of the lower delta, we also observe intensification of dry season cropping in other areas. MODIS reveals frequent instances of both gradual and abrupt decreases in seasonal peak EVI as well as many localized instances of abrupt cessation of agriculture. In terms of area and magnitude, the single largest disturbance we observe immediately follows Cyclone Aila in 2009. We observe a band of phenological disruption on the polders along almost 400 km of the periphery of the Sundarbans.",

            "abstract": "Continental basins located along the European Atlantic volcanic passive margin are an increasingly important setting for hydrocarbon exploration. Several recent offshore and onshore studies in the Faroe-Shetland Basin have shown that many faults cut part, or all of the Palaeogene lava sequences together with the rocks in the underlying sedimentary basins. These lava-hosted faults have the potential to act both as fluid traps or migration pathways for hydrocarbon accumulations originating at depth below the volcanic pile. Mapping and structural analysis of calcite-mineralized fault sets developed in the Faroe Islands Basalt Group show systematic cross-cutting relationships, which can be fit to a relative chronology of deformation events that record a multi-phase rift-reorientation through time. The geometry and kinematics of structures recorded on the Faroe Islands indicate that they are coeval with the onset of segmented oceanic-spreading on the Reykjanes, Aegir, and Mohns ridges, currently dated at about 54-51 Ma. This age is regionally poorly constrained, utilizing relative ages of oceanic magnetochrons, in a region where magnetochrons are ambiguous. We present new age constraints for initial continental separation, using U-Pb geochronology of crack-seal calcite veins in the Faroe Islands. Calcite grains were selected for each rift-fault set, and analyzed using LA-ICP-MS. Samples were screened to find closed-system material with abundant uranium, and analyzed for alteration using BSE, CL and charge-coat imaging with an SEM. Initial results reveal that although rift-fault kinematics are consistent with the onset of oceanic spreading, the U-Pb ages are much younger than magnetochron (54 Ma) break-up ages, and imply that oceanic spreading had not established in the Faroes region of the margin until at least 45 Ma. This new data is consistent with models for a remnant continental land bridge linking Greenland and Eurasia well into the Eocene.",

            "abstract": "Research on calculating fracture permeability has been undergoing for decades (Witherspoon, 1980). Local Cubic Law (LCL) has been proposed to be one feasible way to simulate the fracture permeability with variable aperture changes (Brown, 1987). The purpose of this research is to present an evaluation of LCL based on a set of experimental results of permeability, aperture distribution and effective stress. We concurrently measure fracture permeability and fracture aperture distribution changes (using X-Ray CT) with cycling stress. Fractured Berea sandstone and Zenifim sandstone are measured, representing rough and smooth rock fracture surfaces. Using thin section data, we evaluate the grain size and apply Stokes fluid flow simulation in a synthetic field to estimate the stagnant fluid level between rock grains. By accounting for the stagnant fluid level, LCL simulation provides a reliable prediction for fracture permeability. Comparing with previous research (Konzuk and Kueper, 2004), we propose that LCL simulation requires detailed information about local grain arrangement.\nThe experiment shows that permeability change is greater than expected from mean aperture change at different stress levels. LCL simulation demonstrates that this is mainly due to the change of fluid flow pattern with stress, which is caused by aperture distribution change. LCL simulation also exhibits that channeling behavior plays an important role in fluid flow in fractures, and sometimes a small number of channels dominate the flow. In the experiment, we apply different flow rates to assess the LCL simulation at different Reynolds number. The simulation results show that fluid flow rate (1.24 < Re < 15.28) does not have a large impact on LCL predictability in the highly tortuous and rough rock fractures, which agrees with the results of Konzuk and Kueper (2004).\n",

These deformations are well reflected in positioning time series from GPS sites and, thus, affect epoch-wise parameters obtained from the analysis of global geodetic networks. Whearas atmospheric surface pressure and ocean bottom pressure usually induce a larger scale signal, the hydrological loading contains strong localized signals with exceptionally high amplitudes exceeding several millimeters that can be associated with major precipitation events and river floods. The deformational response to these quite heterogeneous loading patterns, therefore, is expected to depend strongly on the local earth structure. In this study we present a framework for localized Green’s functions parameterising the earth’s crustal response and apply it to a high-resolution hydrological loading model. ",

Grab samples were measured at ground level by GC­ECD every 20 min. Since emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds in the Southeast are high and there are a variety of anthropogenic pollution sources in the area, the location allows the study of biogenic/anthropogenic interactions.\nPANs showed a diurnal behavior with double peaks around noon and again at the end of the afternoon. Mean mixing ratios during the daytime were 178, 5, and 9 pptv for PAN, PPN, and MPAN respectively with highest levels in air from the North. The ratios of PPN or MPAN with PAN are used to predict the relative importance of biogenic and anthropogenic VOC sources. It appears that biogenic VOC sources were slightly more important.\nThe concentrations measured in 2013 are lower than levels at similar sites in the Southeastern U.S. made over the last 20 years. A comparison is made to assess the role of changes in NOx emissions in the Southeastern U.S and resultant photoproducts like PANs and ozone. While absolute levels of PANs are lower, the relative amount MPAN is similar at Centreville while the relative amount of PPN decreased dramatically. This suggests that the impact of anthropogenic VOC emissions on the atmospheric chemistry seen in Centerville, 2013 was lower than seen in the SE previously.\nRecent laboratory experiments have suggested that the hydroxynitrate of MPAN could be a main precursor to formation of secondary organic aerosol. Field data of speciated MPAN along with particle values, including particulate nitrogen, will allow the relationship between gas phase MPAN and aerosol composition to be explored. ",

            "abstract": "Vernal pools are ephemeral wetlands in forested landscapes that fill with snowmelt, precipitation, and/or groundwater in the spring, and characteristically dry down through the summer months. Typically, vernal pool research has focused on the population and community ecology of pool-breeding organisms (amphibians and macroinvertebrates) conducted during their relatively short breeding season. Yet, little is known about the temporal variability of biogeochemical processes within and among vernal pools in urbanizing landscapes. In this study, we monitored physicochemical characteristics and nutrient dynamics in 22 vernal pools in central Maine post thaw in 2014. Four pristine pools were sampled weekly in five locations within the pool for ambient nutrient concentrations (SRP, NH4, NOx) and at three locations for physicochemical characteristics (DO, pH, temperature, conductivity). In the remaining 18 pools, we sampled one location for nutrients and three locations for physicochemical characteristics at least monthly to estimate the influence of increasing urbanization on the physical and chemical environment. Our data suggest most pools found in urbanizing areas have higher conductivity (developed sites ranging 18.52 – 1238 μS cm-1 compared to pristine between 14.08 – 58.4 μS cm-1). Previous work suggests forested pools exhibit dystrophic conditions with high coloration from DOC limiting primary production due to increased light attenuation in pools. However, both pristine and urban pools experienced spikes in DO (>100% saturation) throughout the day, suggesting that high productivity is not a reliable indicator of the effects of urbanization on vernal pools. We argue that continued monitoring of vernal pools along a gradient of urbanization could give insight into the role of ephemeral wetlands as potential biogeochemical hotspots and may also indicate how human development may alter biogeochemical cycling in ephemeral wetlands.",

In addition, an extra projection is forced by observed temperature trends in 1958–2001. The following results are obtained: (i) Spatial average temperature will increase by 0.6°–0.9°C; the increase exceeds 1°C in all months except in boreal summer, thus indicating a reduced annual cycle; and daily minimum temperature rises faster than daily maximum temperature, resulting in a narrowing of the diurnal range of near-surface temperature. (ii) Precipitation increase mainly occurs in early summer and autumn possibly because of an earlier onset and later withdrawal of the Asian summer monsoon. (iii) Both frost and ice days decrease by 1–2 days in spring, early summer, and autumn, and the decrease of frost days on the annual course is inversely related to the precipitation increase. (iv) Degree-days increase all over the TP with peak amplitude in the Qaidam Basin and the southern TP periphery, which will result in distinct melting of the local seasonal frozen ground, and the annual temperature range will decrease with stronger amplitude in south TP.",

Advanced data visualization will play an increasingly significant role in propelling the development of water science in research, economy, policy and education. It can enable analysis within research and further data scientists’ understanding of behavior and processes and can potentially affect how the public, whom we often want to inform, understands our work. Unfortunately for water scientists, data visualization is approached in an ad hoc manner when a more formal methodology or understanding could potentially significantly improve both research within the academy and outreach to the public.\nFirstly to broaden and deepen scientific understanding, data visualization can allow for more analyzed targets to be processed simultaneously and can represent the variables effectively, finding patterns, trends and relationships; thus it can even explores the new research direction or branch of water science. Depending on visualization, we can detect and separate the pivotal and trivial influential factors more clearly to assume and abstract the original complex target system. Providing direct visual perception of the differences between observation data and prediction results of models, data visualization allows researchers to quickly examine the quality of models in water science. Secondly data visualization can also improve public awareness and perhaps influence behavior. Offering decision makers clearer perspectives of potential profits of water, data visualization can amplify the economic value of water science and also increase relevant employment rates. Providing policymakers compelling visuals of the role of water for social and natural systems, data visualization can advance the water management and legislation of water conservation.

            "abstract": "Driftwood in rivers impact sediment transport, riverine habitat and human infrastructures. Quantifying it, in particular large woods on fairly large rivers where it can move easily, would allow us to improve our knowledge on fluvial transport processes. There are several means of studying this phenomenon, amongst which RFID sensors tracking, photo and video monitoring. In this abstract, we are interested in the latter, being easier and cheaper to deploy. However, video monitoring of driftwood generates a huge amount of images and manually labeling it is tedious. It is essential to automate such a monitoring process, which is a difficult task in the field of computer vision, and more specifically automatic video analysis. Detecting foreground into dynamic background remains an open problem to date.\nWe installed a video camera at the riverside of a gauging station on the Ain River, a 3500 km² Piedmont River in France. Several floods were manually annotated by a human operator. We developed software that automatically extracts and characterizes wood blocks within a video stream. This algorithm is based upon a statistical model and combines static, dynamic and spatial data. Segmented wood objects are further described with the help of a skeleton-based approach that helps us to automatically determine its shape, diameter and length.\nThe first detailed comparisons between manual annotations and automatically extracted data show that we can fairly well detect large wood until a given size (approximately 120 cm in length or 15 cm in diameter) whereas smaller ones are difficult to detect and tend to be missed by either the human operator, either the algorithm. Detection is fairly accurate in high flow conditions where the water channel is usually brown because of suspended sediment transport. In low flow context, our algorithm still needs improvement to reduce the number of false positive so as to better distinguish shadow or turbulence structures from wood pieces.",

            "abstract": "The effects of subgrid cloud variability on grid-average microphysical rates and radiative fluxes are examined by use of long-term retrieval products at the Tropical West Pacific (TWP), Southern Great Plains (SGP), and North Slope of Alaska (NSA) sites of the Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. Four commonly used distribution functions, the truncated Gaussian, Gamma, lognormal, and Weibull distributions, are constrained to have the same mean and standard deviation as observed cloud liquid water content. The PDFs are then used to upscale relevant physical processes to obtain grid-average process rates. It is found that the truncated Gaussian representation results in up to 30% mean bias in autoconversion rate whereas the mean bias for the lognormal representation is about 10%. The Gamma and Weibull distribution function performs the best for the grid-average autoconversion rate with the mean relative bias less than 5%. For radiative fluxes, the lognormal and truncated Gaussian representations perform better than the Gamma and Weibull representations. The results show that the optimal choice of subgrid cloud distribution function depends on the nonlinearity of the process of interest and thus there is no single distribution function that works best for all parameterizations. Examination of the scale (window size) dependence of the mean bias indicates that the bias in grid-average process rates monotonically increases with increasing window sizes, suggesting the increasing importance of subgrid variability with increasing grid sizes.",

            "abstract": "Primarily emitted by vegetation, isoprene is the dominant nonmethane hydrocarbon in the atmosphere. Photooxidation of isoprene has a large influence on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere and the production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). As a part of the GoAmazon2014 Experiment, isoprene and some of its oxidation products were measured using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) at a research site 60 km west of the city of Manaus, Brazil. The fetch of the research site oscillated between the extremes of a pristine atmosphere and the interactions of heavy pollution from Manaus with the natural environment, which allowed for an assessment of the modifications of natural isoprene chemistry by anthropogenic pollution over Amazonia. Photooxidation of isoprene leads to chemically different oxidation products depending on the fate of isoprene peroxy radicals (ISOPOO), but different oxidation products can produce the same ions in PTR-MS analysis due to similarity in their chemical structures. A cold trap was deployed in front of the PTR-TOF-MS for separation and differential classification of some of these isoprene oxidation products. For example, isoprene-derived hydroperoxides (C5H10O3) and methyl vinyl ketone/methacrolein (C4H6O), which are the major oxidation products of the HO2 and NO pathways of ISOPOO reaction, respectively, and both detected as C4H7O+ ion by PTR-MS, were separately measured. Using the measurements of these and other oxidation products of isoprene by PTR-TOF-MS and other complementary measurements, the isoprene chemistry (particularly the fate of ISOPOO) under pristine and polluted scenarios are compared and the implication for SOA formation is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Oligotrophic lakes in the temperate forests of eastern North America appear to be experiencing an increase in the frequency and duration of algal blooms. This has been the focus of numerous public and government reports, resulting in heightened public concern for reporting of algal blooms. There is a vital need for detailed historical survey of numerous lakes, covering large spatial scales (the scale of region, province, or entire country) and temporal scales (decades) to determine if public observations are accurate. We used a remote sensing approach to: (1) develop regression models that relate Landsat imagery reflectance to chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) as a proxy of algal biomass of lakes; (2) apply these models to estimate Chl-a in lakes at the northern edge of the temperate forest biome in central Ontario over a 28 year period (1984–2011). The linear regression model was built on the basis of the normalized exoatmospheric reflectance values acquired from the utility of Landsat TM and ETM imagery and in situ measurements. Landsat band 3 (red) showed the strongest correlation with in situ data explaining 84% of the variance in Chl-a (r2 = 0.84, p <0.001). We applied this model to all lakes within the region selected from atmospherically corrected Landsat data for the peak algal bloom period (late July to early November) for the entire 28 years. A time series revealed a cyclic stationary pattern in the average Chl-a. This pattern followed the regional patterns of major droughts, especially for the first part of the time period, making climate a major driver in the formation of algal biomass in lakes that, in turn, can lead to the rise of algal blooms. However this climate driver appeared to become less predictable, with elevated algal biomass occurring in both normal and drought years, later in the record.",

            "abstract": "Debonding between casing and cement may create interfacial leakage pathways, compromising well integrity in CO2 storage systems. Our previous work on such debonding-defects showed that chemical reactions between cement, steel and CO2-fluids provide only limited potential for local reaction-induced sealing, allowing short-range defects to remain open. Changes in temperature and stress state may subsequently cause these defects to grow and connect, potentially forming long-range interfacial leakage pathways. This study investigates how CO2-induced reaction affects the transport properties of such interconnected defects by means of reactive flow-through experiments.\nMetre scale sections of debonded cement-casing interface were simulated using composite samples, prepared as follows. Cement was cast into steel tube coils (L 1.5–3.0 m, ø 6–8 mm). After curing, the coils were pressurized using water, causing the steel tube to deform permanently and lift off the cement, creating casing-cement samples that contain sections of (partially) debonded cement-steel interface.\nReactive flow-through experiments were performed in a permeameter, capable of running at temperatures (80°C ± 0.5 °C) and fluid pressures (10–12 MPa) representative for downhole environments. The coil samples were one-sidedly flooded with CO2-bearing fluid, continuously measuring apparent sample permeability and periodically sampling the downstream fluid. Additionally, post-experiment microstructural analyses were performed. Results show permeability decreases of several orders, indicating reactive-transport phenomena that occur on the metre scale contribute significantly to the sealing-potential. As such, our experiments can be used to understand the long-range behaviour of annuli in wells, beyond the commonly used lab-scale.",

            "abstract": "Space missions around Earth have been continuously monitoring solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field for many years now. They have detected a large number of interplanetary (IP) shocks. These have been observed with multiple spacecraft at separations ranging from 103 km to several 105. Comparing observations of IP shocks at different locations in space can provide us with important insights on micro-physical processes that take place near or within the shock transitions. We have compiled a database of about 50 IP shocks detected between 2001 and 2014 with several missions. In the first part of our research we calculated local normals of IP shocks by using different one-spacecraft methods and also the 4-spacecraft method, when possible. In some cases we were able to compare the results of the latter method for different inter-spacecraft separations. This is the first time that comparison of IP shock profiles is also performed systematically on small inter-spacecraft separations of several 100 km (Cluster and Themis observations). Shock normals obtained by using different spacecraft configurations may differ. We find that spacecraft observe different shock profiles even when the their separations are only ~1000 km and the detection times differ by less than a second. The four-spacecraft method is less reliable when the detection times are small, since the changing shock profiles and uncertainties related to timing of the shock arrivals may distort the calculations. We also study regions upstream and downstream of IP shocks - we analyze the properties of suprathermal particles and magnetic perturbations there.",

            "abstract": "In equilibrium, Earth’s landscape reflects a balance between rock uplift and erosion. This balance causes geomorphic landforms, such as hillslopes, watersheds, and stream channels, to maintain steady-state geometries that reflect the rate of rock uplift, the erodibility of the underlying bedrock, climate, and the surface processes that formed them. Departure from equilibrium, due to changes in these boundary conditions, causes the landscape to adjust until a new steady-state geometry is established. Geomorphic features can therefore be used as indicators of tectonic activity in areas where the underlying geology, climate, and dominant surface processes can reasonably be assumed to be uniform. In this study, Revs-Up participants utilized ArcGIS® and Matlab® software to characterize key geomorphic features in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains of eastern California. Watershed boundaries and river longitudinal profiles were extracted from USGS 10m digital elevation models and used to plot watershed slope vs. area relationships. These plots were then used to determine profile concavity and channel steepness index values for watersheds along the southern Sierra Nevada Frontal Fault Zone (SNFFZ). Initial results show a northward increase in the complexity of river longitudinal profiles as well as a northward increase in channel steepness indices. Normalized channel steepness index values are highest within watersheds located along a prominent left step in the Sierra Nevada rangefront. Combined with field data and low-temperature thermochronometry, these results may help to constrain spatial variations in rock uplift associated with the long-term evolution of the southern SNFFZ.",

            "abstract": "In April 1997, characteristic broadband seismic signals accompanied with very-long-period (VLP) repetitious seismic pulses were observed at Satsuma-Iwojima, Japan. Ohminato (2006) conducted waveform analyses and showed that the waveforms are well explained by the sudden expansion of an inclined shallow crack. In order to explain the repetitious property of the signals, he proposed a model of sudden vaporization of superheated water filling the crack as a physical model of the sudden crack expansion. This model explains the source geometry and the repetitious property of the VLP signals. However, this model has a serious drawback. The crack surface is not smooth and the rough surface would have small cavities containing small bubbles which can easily grow with increasing temperature and break the state of superheated condition of the water. Thus, for water in a container with rough surface such as a crack in the rock, it is difficult to keep the superheated condition.\nRecently, Namiki and Kagoshima (2014) conducted lab experiments using syrup as a magma analogue. The experiments show that the expansion of one void leads to expansion of another void above it by the rupture of film separating these two voids. The void expansions propagate upward and finally cause intermittent outgassing when they reach the magma surface. Suppose that the upward propagation of void expansions occurs in the conduit of Satsuma-Iwojima and that the top of the conduit is connected to the shallow inclined crack. When the void expansions propagate upward and finally reach the top of the conduit, the gas from the void would be injected into the crack and the crack expansion would excite VLP signals. Every time a large void reaches the top of the conduit, the crack would repeat expansion. The internal pressure increase of the crack occurs simultaneously with the void pressure decrease. Why is it that only the VLP signals corresponding to the expanding source are observed? The time constant at which the void pressure decrease is transferred to the surrounding conduit wall is determined by the viscoelastic property of bubbly magma. If the time constant is large enough, it is possible that only the pressure increase in the crack contributes to the observed seismic signals and the contribution of the pressure decrease in the void is small enough not to be observed.",

It is not only cut through by famous right-lateral strike-slip fault, Tancheng-Lujiang Fault (TLF), but also rifled through by Zhangjiakou-Bohai Seismic Zone (ZBSZ). Its formation/evolution has close relation with continental dynamics, and is concerned greatly by Geoscientists. Although seismicity might shed light on this issue, there is no clear image of earthquake distribution in this region as result of difficulty in seismic observation of bay area.\nIn this paper, we employ Matched Filter Technique (MFT) to better understand the local seismicity. MFT is originally used to detect duplicated events, thus is not capable to find new events with different locations. So we make some improvement on this method. Firstly, we adopt the idea proposed by David Shelly et al. (Nature, 2007) to conduct a strong detection and a weak detection simultaneously, which enable us to find more micro-events. Then, we relocate the detected events, which provides us with more accurate spatial distribution of new events as well as the geometry of related faults, comparing with traditional MFT.\nResults show that the sites of some famous historical strong events are obviously the locations concentrated with microearthquakes. Accordingly, we detect/determine/discuss the accurate positions of the historical strong events in BBB employing the results of the modified MFT. Moreover, the earthquakes in BBB form many seismic zones, of which the strikes mostly near the one of TLF although they together form the east end of ZBSZ. In the 2014 AGU fall meeting, we will introduce the details of our results and their geodynamical significance.\n",

EBK is an interpolation method that accounts for uncertainty in the covariance function by using a weighted sum of many reasonable covariances (Krivoruchko and Gribov, 2014). This results in more realistic prediction uncertainty. EBK accounts for moderate data nonstationarity by building local models on subsets of the input data and then merging the models. In our EBK model, GPS on benchmark (GPSBM) data are transformed to a Gaussian distribution as described in Gribov and Krivoruchko, 2012 and a Mattern covariance model is simultaneously estimated using restricted maximum likelihood approach. Since our GPSBM dataset is large, the input data to EBK are first divided into overlapping subsets of 200 points. Each data subset uses models defined by nearby values, rather than being influenced by very distant factors. In each subset covariances are estimated, then, for each location, a prediction and prediction standard error are generated using weighted covariances from one or more subsets. We observed that the covariance model parameters are changing from region to region and we discuss this interesting feature of the USGG12 and GPSBM spatial data variation. We approximated ellipsoidal distances with chord distances to avoid distortion due to imperfect data projection. The EBK corrector surface is compared with a corrector surface computed by National Geodetic Survey (NGS) using least-squares collocation (LSC). Initial results show that the EBK corrector surface compares favorably with LSC. In particular, the EBK prediction error not only is lower than that of LSC but also is more representative because it accounts for both local data variation and sampling density.",

            "abstract": "Continuous, in situ measurements of water vapor isotopic composition have been conducted in the North Atlantic, Bermuda Islands (32.26°N 64.88°W) between November 2011 and June 2013, using a cavity-ringdown-spectrometer water vapor isotope analyzer and an autonomous self-designed calibration system. Meticulous calibration allows us to reach an accuracy and precision on 10 minute average of d18O, dD, and d-excess of respectively 0.14‰, 0.85‰, and 1.1‰, verified using two parallel instruments with independent calibration. As a result of more than 500 days with 6-hourly data the relationships between deuterium excess, relative humidity (rh), sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed and direction are assessed. From the whole dataset, 84% of d-excess variance is explained by a strong linear relationship with relative humidity. The slope of this relationship (-42.6 ± 0.4 ‰ per % (rh)) is similar to the theoretical prediction of Merlivat and Jouzel (1979) for SST between 20ºC and 30ºC. However, in contrast with theory, no effect of wind speed could be detected on the relationship between d-excess and relative humidity. Separating the dataset into winter, spring, summer, and autumn seasons reveals different linear relationships between d-excess and humidity. Changes in wind directions are observed to affect the relationships between d-excess and humidity. The observed seasonal variability in the relationship between d-excess and relative humidity underlines the importance of long-term monitoring to accurately separate signals of local evaporation from signals associated with moisture advection.\nSteen-Larsen, H.

The Louisville Seamount trail displays age progressive volcanism thought to be formed as the Pacific plate moved over a hotspot. The older seamounts are located in the north (80 Ma, Osbourn Guyot) and younger seamounts to the south. Seamounts in this study are all guyots from the older section of the seamount trail (~74 Ma, Site U1372 at Canopus Guyot to ~51 Ma, Site U1377 at Hadar Guyot).\nSites U1372 and U1376 respectively recovered ~230 m and ~140 m of basaltic material beneath a thin sediment interface and contain many in-situ lava flows that are interlayed with volcaniclastics, breccias and intrusive sheets. 40Ar/39Ar measurements will be used to date these different lithologies and, along with paleomagnetic inclination data, determine whether there was post-erosional volcanism and postulate which processes are involved with either the construction or deconstruction of ocean islands. Koppers et al. (2012) noted that some holes had consistent paleomagnetic inclinations suggesting that at least the larger clasts in the volcaniclastic breccias were emplaced hot or otherwise had been reset post deposition. If this is the case and breccias were emplaced hot then this would explain the undetectable levels of CO2 remaining in glasses after a complete degassing of the lithologies (Nichols et al., 2014). This would further support evidence for shallow eruption depths and post-erosional volcanism. In addition, the 40Ar/39Ar ages should be able to resolve whether or not the breccias were emplaced during the same time period as underlying and overlying intrusive sheets.\nSamples were analyzed using a high-resolution incremental step-heating method at Oregon State University in the Geochronology Lab using a Thermo Scientific ARGUS-VI Noble Gas Multicollector Mass Spectrometer.

            "abstract": "Agent-based social modeling is opening up new methodologies for the study of societal response to weather and climate hazards, and providing measures of resiliency that can be studied in many contexts, particularly in coupled human and natural-technological systems (CHANTS). Since CHANTS are complex adaptive systems, societal resiliency may or may not occur, depending on dynamics that lack closed form solutions. Agent-based modeling has been shown to provide a viable theoretical and methodological approach for analyzing and understanding disasters and societal resiliency in CHANTS.\nOur approach advances the science of societal resilience through computational modeling and simulation methods that complement earlier statistical and mathematical approaches. We present three case studies of social dynamics modeling that demonstrate the use of these agent based models. In Central Asia, we exmaine mutltiple ensemble simulations with varying climate statistics to see how droughts and zuds affect populations, transmission of wealth across generations, and the overall structure of the social system. In Eastern Africa, we explore how successive episodes of drought events affect the adaptive capacity of rural households. Human displacement, mainly, rural to urban migration, and livelihood transition particularly from pastoral to farming are observed as rural households interacting dynamically with the biophysical environment and continually adjust their behavior to accommodate changes in climate. In the far north case we demonstrate one of the first successful attempts to model the complete climate-permafrost-infrastructure-societal interaction network as a complex adaptive system/CHANTS implemented as a ``federated'' agent-based model using evolutionary computation.\nAnalysis of population changes resulting from extreme weather across these and other cases provides evidence for the emergence of new steady states and shifting patterns of resilience.",

            "abstract": "The quantification of the role of weathering in the carbon cycle and its interaction with climate and tectonics at the geological time scale is one of the key questions of the geoscientists. The consumption of atmospheric CO2 by silicate weathering indisputably plays the central role in the long term carbon budget and consequently on mean global climate. Through the composition of major elements in river waters, CO2 consumption by the alteration of continental rocks can be estimated.\nThe aim of this study is to estimate of the chemical weathering rate of the Zambesi basin and the impact of Karoo basalt province on chemical atmospheric consumption, evaluated from a database of major elements. The Karroo basalts outcrop erupted around 183 +/2 2 106 take place in the Upper and the Middle Zambezi, covering a surface of 9600 km2. The Zambesi Basin, located between 8° and 20° south latitude and between 16.5 and 36 east longitude, is the fourth largest in Africa. The catchment has a total area of some 1,281,000 km2, the mean annual temperature is 19,3°C and the annual rainfall varies from nearly 2 000 mm to 600 mm. During the sampling period, the annual runoff at Victoria Fall gauging Station ranged between 50 to 2000 m3/s ie 6.9 to 0.6 l/s/km2. The consumption rate of atmospheric CO2 associated with the chemical weathering was calculated from riverine HCO3- concentrations. During the weathering of volcanic rocks, all dissolved carbonates originate from atmospheric/sil CO2. Values of CO2 consumption rates are relatively high, about 0.024 1012 mol/yr, and are comparable to Deccan Traps consumption rates.",

In this study, we examined the fate of mercury inputs to the Huntington Wildlife Forest (HWF) of the Adirondack region of New York State, USA, by conducting a mercury mass budget over the annual cycle. Mercury exchange processes analyzed included wet deposition, dry deposition, foliar accumulation, throughfall, litterfall, soil evasion, and vertical and horizontal soil drainage loss. The mercury transport processes were quantified by integrating data collected from different sources over recent years (2004-2011). Dry mercury deposition (16.3 µg m-2 yr-1) was more important than wet mercury deposition (6.3 µg m-2 yr-1) at the HWF; most of the atmospheric mercury deposition (> 60%) was retained in the forest soils where litterfall (17.2 µg m-2 yr-1) was the major input pathway. Soil evasion (6.5 µg m-2 yr-1) was the most important mercury export mechanism, exceeding mercury fluxes in lateral and vertical drainage from soil (2.8 µg m-2 yr-1). Our analysis showed marked seasonal variation in the transfers of mercury largely mediated by annual canopy development of the forest ecosystem. The upland hardwood forest ecosystem was a net sink for atmospheric mercury deposition.",

            "abstract": "Pronounced millennial-scale climate variability during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) is considered to be linked to changes in the state of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). The stability of the AMOC to North Atlantic freshwater perturbations is studied using a comprehensive coupled climate model (CCSM3) under MIS3 boundary conditions. An AMOC stability diagram constructed from a series of equilibrium freshwater hosing/extraction experiments reveals a highly nonlinear dependence of AMOC strength on freshwater forcing with a MIS3 baseline state that is remarkably unstable with respect to minor negative or positive freshwater perturbations. The global climate signal associated with a change in AMOC strength is consistent with a transition from an interstadial (strong AMOC) to a stadial (weak AMOC) state including an annual mean surface air temperature drop of >8 K in central Greenland. We further construct a global spatial fingerprint of oceanic temperature anomalies in response to AMOC changes under MIS3 boundary conditions. Highest sensitivity to AMOC changes, especially in summer, is found in northeastern North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), but a characteristic temperature fingerprint is also found at subsurface levels. After testing significance of the linear SST-AMOC regressions, the model results are combined with paleo-SST records from the North Atlantic in order to estimate the magnitude of millennial-scale Dansgaard-Oeschger AMOC variations during MIS3. The results suggest a difference in AMOC strength between interstadial and (non-Heinrich) stadial states of 10.2 ± 1.3 Sv (1σ).",

This is mainly due to the fact, that reference data sets like ERA are only available every six hours. Additionally, for offline coupling procedures it would be too costly to store LBC data in higher temporal resolution for climate simulations. However, theoretically, the coupling frequency could be as high as the time step of the driving model. Meanwhile, it is unclear if a more frequent update of the LBC has a significant effect on the climate in the domain of the regional model (RCM). This study uses the RCM COSMO-CLM/MESSy (Kerkweg and Jöckel, 2012) to couple COSMO-CLM offline to the GCM ECHAM5.\nOne study examines a 30 year time slice experiment for three update frequencies of the LBC, namely six hours, one hour and six minutes. The evaluation of means, standard deviations and statistics of the climate in regional domain shows only small deviations, some stastically significant though, of 2m temperature, sea level pressure and precipitaion.\nThe second scope of the study assesses parameters linked to cyclone activity, which is affected by the LBC update frequency. Differences in track density and strength are found when comparing the simulations.\nThe second study examines the quality of decadal hind-casts of the decade 2001-2010 when the horizontal resolution of the driving model, namely T42, T63, T85, T106, from which the LBC are calculated, is altered. Two sets of simulations are evaluated. For the first set of simulations, the GCM simulations are performed at different resolutions using the same boundary conditions for GHGs and SSTs, thus in each simulation a unique circulation develops. These GCM simulations then provide LBC for the RCM. For the second set, the GCM simulation in T106 is truncated to lower resolutions before creating the LBC for the RCM. Each set of simulations is evaluated regarding the quality of the 2m temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation prediction.",

In this study, we assess whether both the regional and global climate feedbacks are well estimated according to the heat transport strengthening by prescribing latitudinally different climate feedback (2.26 W m-2 K-1 in the low-latitude, 1.11 W m-2 K-1 in the high-latitude as a default). In the presence of the meridional heat transport, model simulated low-latitudinal climate feedback is underestimated by 0.5 W m-2 K-1 while high-latitudinal one is overestimated by similar scale from transient climate simulations. Globally, therefore, no significant variations are caused by the heat transport. Moreover, uncertainties of regional and global estimates slightly decrease with the increasing heat transport. The results of this study possibly provide support for the researches interpreting meridional satellite observational signals.",

            "abstract": "Mantle dynamics manifests at the surface via the horizontal motions of plates and the vertical deflections that influence topography and the non-hydrostatic geoid. The pioneering work of Mitrovica et al. (1989) and Gurnis (1990) on this dynamic topography revolutionized our understanding of sedimentary basin formation, sea level changes and continental flooding. The temporal evolution of subduction can explain the migration of basins and even the drainage reversal of the Amazon (Shephard et al., 2012; Eakin et al., 2014). Until recently, flat subduction has been seen as enhancing downward deflection of the overriding plate and increasing flooding. However, this interpretation depends crucially on the details of the morphology and density structure of the slab, which controls the loci and amplitude of the deflection. We tend to ignore morphological details in mantle dynamics because flow can smooth out short wavelength variations. We have shown instead that details matter! Using South America as a natural laboratory because of the large changes in morphology of the Nazca slab along strike, we show that downward deflection of the overriding plate and hence basin formation, do not occur over flat segments but at the leading edge, where slabs plunge back into the mantle. This is true in both Argentina and Peru. The temporal evolution from a 'normally' dipplng slab to a flat slab leads to uplift over flat segments rather than enhanced subsidence. Critical for this result is the use of a detailed morphological model of the present-day Nazca slab with a spatial resolution of 50-100 km and based on relocated seismicity and magnetotelluric results. The density structure of the slab, due to age and the presence of overthickened crust from aseismic ridge subduction is essential. Overthickened crust leads to buoyant slabs. We reproduce formation and deposition of the Acres-Solimoes basin and the evolution of the Amazon drainage basin in Peru as well as the Mar Chiquita depression in Argentina. We explain the uplift of the paleosols of the los Llanos formation and the Fitzcarrald Arch. We show the effects of strong viscosity variations and slab dip on the extent of continental flooding.",

            "abstract": "The southern Norwegian Rogaland Igneous Complex (RIC) intruded into post-Sveconorwegian granulite facies crust between 930 and 920 Ma. It includes three massif anorthosites, several small leuconorite bodies and the ~7km thick norite-quartz mangerite layered Bjerkreim-Sokndal (BKS) intrusion. The intrusion consists of five rhythmic mega-units created by repeated magma influxes capped by a transition zone and a thick sequence of more evolved mangerites and quartz mangerites. Over 70 paleomagnetic sites have been collected in the BKS, sampling all the mega-cyclic subunits and overlying mangerites. Remanence within the BKS is held in hemo-ilmenite-only rocks (lower parts of the mega-cyclic units), mixed hemo-ilmenite and magnetite rocks (upper parts of the lower mega-cyclic units) and magnetite only rocks in the upper highest mega-cyclic unit and overlying mangerites. Due to the different oxides present magnetic susceptibility varies over four orders of magnitude with a bimodal distribution (mean susceptibility of 6.4 x 10-3 SI for hemo-ilmenite rocks, and 8.9 x 10-2 SI for magnetite rocks). NRM values do not show a strong bimodal distribution as many of the rocks lacking magnetite have hemo-ilmenite with strong lamellar magnetism; average NRM for the entire suite is 8.83 A/m. All sites within the cyclic part of the intrusion have stable remanence and produce well-clustered site means. Samples from the upper mangerite rocks, dominated by MD magnetite, are often unstable and not all sites provide acceptable data. Mean directions for 66 sites spanning the entire intrusion are I = -73.7°, D = 303.7°, with α95  = 3.6° and k = 24. The resulting pole position is at 36.1°S and 217.5°E, with a paleolatitude for this part of Baltica of 59.7°S. Examination of the magnetic mineralogy combined with geochronology for RIC rocks yields an age of magnetization of ~900 Ma. Metamorphic country rocks yield similar directions at least 10 km from the contact, confirming the presence of a contact aureole around the intrusion. Comparison to other early Neoproterozoic paleomagnetic poles from southern Scandinavia confirms the high southern latitude position of Baltica at this time. A paucity of ~900 Ma poles from other ancient cratons precludes a more detailed picture of Rodinia in the early Neoproterozoic.",

Previous studies have documented the change in fire regime and the increasing fire-invasive grass cycle occurring in the western U.S. The change in vegetation structure due to climate change and invasive species alters the fuel load, making these ecosystems vulnerable to high-severity fire. Synergistic remote sensing data, such as hyperspectral data and high-resolution lidar, can be leveraged to capture the composition and structural variability of short-statured semiarid vegetation (e.g. sagebrush, annual grasses). We use a random-forests based fusion technique to integrate multi-source airborne data (hyperspectral and LiDAR) and generate spatially-explicit estimates of vegetation composition and structure (biomass, cover, density, height, LAI) and associated uncertainty across a climate and elevation gradient in southern Idaho. The results will be used to initialize an individual-based terrestrial biosphere model (Ecosystem Demography, ED2) and estimate structural dynamics under future scenarios. This study will provide a basis for understanding feedback mechanisms related to changing climate conditions, fire regimes and patterns of non-native plant invasion. The forthcoming field and remote sensing collection campaigns are also designed for parameterizing a dryland shrub plant functional type in the ED2 model.",

            "abstract": "Surface-atmosphere energy exchanges control the ablation of snow and ice dominated regions. Although some of the input variables for surface energy balance (SEB) models can be estimated with reasonable accuracy using extrapolated data, remote sensing or meteorological models, estimates of other variables are still difficult, especially across glacierised catchments and at high elevations. Despite the existence of large uncertainties in the forcing variables, ablation amounts are usually simulated by glacio-hydrological models using only deterministic inputs. This is the case for advanced SEB models, which use large amounts of input data, or conceptual models e.g. based on temperature index methods, which rely on the transferability in space and time of empirical parameters.\nIn this work, we present an approach to explicitly calculate the uncertainty transferred from input variables to energy fluxes and ablation amounts of SEB simulations. For this, we parameterize the probability density functions (pdfs) of the SEB results. We code a point scale SEB model that calculates radiative, turbulent and internal heat fluxes. The model also includes a blowing snow sublimation module to determine mass losses to the atmosphere within the saltation and suspension layers. Using the SEB model, we perform extensive numerical simulations (>2*106 model runs) and obtain results of melt and sublimation within a-priori defined ranges of the input variables. These ranges are relatively wide in order to be representative of highly variable high-elevation conditions. After this, we fit theoretical pdfs to the input and outputs variables of the SEB model and obtain the distribution parameters. Using these results and a Bayesian scheme, we can compute the pdf of each output variable of the SEB as a function of the available (usually limited) information at a particular study site. In order to identify the most relevant information for each output variable, we also show the results of a global sensitivity analysis of the SEB model. The approach is tested using field measurements in the Chilean Andes and the Nepalese Himalaya. The presented method is shown to be effective on the calculation of energy fluxes, and melt and sublimation amounts, explicitly computing their uncertainty using a computationally parsimonious approach.",

            "abstract": "With the implementation of the South African National Water Act (NWA) currently underway, water intensive sectors, such as the irrigated agriculture sector, can expect reduced water allocations and an increase in water prices. Water footprints (WFs) are increasingly being recognised as a meaningful way by which to represent human appropriation of water resources.\nThis study examines the green and blue WFs of a variety of citrus cultivars in the lower Sundays River Valley, Eastern Cape, South Africa. WFs were calculated across dry, humid and long-term average climates and comparisons were made to available global average benchmark WFs. An number of indicators were also explored including; water productivity (ton/m3), economic land productivity (R/ha) and economic water productivity (R/m3) across all three climatic years. Most applications of WF sustainability assessments have focused on examining physical water scarcity as a measure for determining environmental hotspots. This study, therefore, also calculates the marginal product value for the irrigation water using a non-parametric linear programming approach. Marginal product value of irrigation water is not only useful in assisting with water-allocation decision making, but also useful in demonstrating the effects of resource depletion and degradation, and is therefore a useful measure for determining economic water scarcity.\nThe study highlights that both farmers and governments could reduce blue WF’s through adopting measures to increase water efficiency and considering economic water and land productivity. It also demonstrates the importance of including both environmental and economic scarcity indicators into water management and planning strategies, and the importance of conducting WF assessments using more accurate, site specific data.",

Plant stem tissue was collected periodically throughout the summer months and water was extracted for stable isotope analysis. To account for soil evaporative fractionation, the authors collected soil samples from the field and constructed local evaporative correction lines. Preliminary mixing model analysis suggests fog water use in several shrub species while others utilized rain and groundwater during the late summer.

            "abstract": "Any hydrometeor containing some supercooled liquid can only freeze it as fast as latent heat is dissipated to the ambient air. Consequently, at sub-zero temperatures any given particle in a cloud can contain both ice and liquid water. Wet growth of hail occurs when supercooled cloud-liquid is accreted faster than it can freeze immediately on impact. Equally, raindrops in clear air can take up to a few mins to freeze.\nA new theory of time-dependent freezing is proposed in this presentation. First, wet growth of hail is represented by treating inhomogeneities of liquid coverage and temperature over the surface of the particle. Radial heat fluxes from the sponge layer through the liquid skin to the air are predicted, as well as heat fluxes between its wet and dry parts. Gradual internal freezing of liquid that soaks the interior of the hail or graupel particle during dry growth (‘riming’) is represented. The microphysical recycling with alternating episodes of wet and dry growth is predicted. Second, the time-dependent process of raindrop freezing is represented by including thermodynamic effects from accretion of cloud-liquid and -ice. Freezing drops larger than about 0.1 mm are represented as a new microphysical species in a cloud model with spectral bin microphysics. The freezing drops consist of interior water covered by ice initially. Possibilities of both dry and wet growth of freezing drops are represented.\nSchemes of time-dependent freezing for rain and wet growth of hail and graupel were implemented in a spectral bin microphysics cloud model. The model predicted that accretion of liquid produces giant freezing drops of 0.5-2 cm in diameter, due to downdraft-updraft recirculation and wet growth of freezing drops. Appreciable contents of freezing drops reach a height level of 7 km (-30 degC) in the simulated storm. The critical diameter separating wet and dry growth regimes is predicted to increase with height for freezing drops. It is more vertically uniform for hail.\nA sensitivity test with the cloud model shows that time-dependent freezing delays formation of the first hail. Later in the mature stage of the storm, it boosts hail amounts. Convection is invigorated. Hail and freezing drops are upwelled to higher levels, and hail grows to sizes up to twice as large, than without time-dependent freezing.",

Break through curves of Rhodamine WT were collected for eight wetlands in the Ipswich and Parker (MA) and Lamprey River (NH) watersheds, USA. The curves were inverse modeled using STAMMT-L to optimize the connectivity and size parameters for each reach. Two approaches were tested, a single dominant storage zone and a range of storage zones represented using a power-law distribution of storage zone connectivity. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to relate transient storage parameters to stream discharge, area, length-to-width ratio, and reach slope. Resulting regressions will enable more accurate parameterization of surface water transient storage in network-scale models.",

We have first examined the matrix effect associated with variable salinity (0 to 5 wt.% NaCl), and found that above 1 wt.% NaCl, the intensity of REE in ICP-MS measurement is drastically reduced due to the matrix effect. Accordingly, we have diluted the sample waters to contain ~0.6 wt.% NaCl, and then analyzed them by the standard addition method. The result shows that the abundance is appreciably high compared to near-surface waters, and exhibits almost a flat DMM-normalized pattern, which can be explained by mixing of a slab-derived fluid at relatively low temparature (400 to 500 ºC) and a near-surface water. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of the brine are consistent with the above interpretation on REEs, in that the deep brine is isotopically similar to a slab-derived fluid of the subducted Philippine Sea slab. These evidences suggest that the slab-derived fluid is upwelling even in the non-volcanic region possibly through a fault zone along the tectonic line.",

Spatial and temporal patterns of photosynthesis depend on dynamic plant-specific adaptation strategies to highly variable environmental conditions e.g. light, water, and nutrient availability. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChF) has been proposed as a direct indicator of photosynthesis, and several studies have demonstrated its relationship with vegetation functioning at leaf and canopy level.\nIn this study, two overarching questions about ChF were addressed: Q1) How water, nutrient and ambient light conditions determine the relationships between photosynthesis and ChF? Which is the optimum irradiance level for detecting water and nutrient deficit conditions with ChF?; Q2) What is the seasonal relationship between photosynthesis and ChF when nitrogen is the limiting factor?\nThe results of this study indicated that when the differences between treatments (water or nitrogen) drive the relationship between photosynthesis and ChF, ChF has a direct relationship with photosynthesis. This study demonstrates that the light level at which plants were grown was optimum for detecting water and nutrient deficit with ChF. Further, the seasonal relation between photosynthesis and ChF with nitrogen stress was not a simple linear function due to the complex physiological relation between photosynthesis and ChF. Our study showed that at times in the season when nitrogen was sufficient and photosynthesis was highest, ChF decreased because these two processes compete for available energy.

Currently, large uncertainties still exist in simulated aerosol processes in global climate models (GCMs), which lead to a diversity in dust mass loading and spatial distribution of GCM projections. In this study, satellite measurements from CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) and observed aerosol data from Asian stations are compared with modelled aerosol in the Canadian Atmospheric Global Climate Model (CanAM4.2). Both seasonal and annual variations in Asian dust distribution are investigated. Vertical profile of simulated aerosol in troposphere is evaluated with CALIOP Level 3 products and local observed extinction for dust and total aerosols. Physical processes in GCM such as horizontal advection, vertical mixing, dry and wet removals are analyzed according to model simulation and available measurements of aerosol. This work aims to improve current understanding of Asian dust transport and vertical exchange on a large scale, which may help to increase the accuracy of GCM simulation on aerosols.",

            "abstract": "The relationships between ENSO and the East Asian-western North Pacific monsoon during ENSO mature winter and decaying summer are studied by examining the pre-industrial control runs of 18 global climate models (GCMs) that participated in the phase five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In the observation, the tropical western North Pacific (WNP) is dominated by an anomalous anticyclone (cyclone) during El Niño (La Niña) mature winter, referred to as WNPAC (WNPC). WNPAC is asymmetric with WNPC. Multi-model assessments support the idea that the asymmetry results from the combined effects of the asymmetric remote forcing from the equatorial central-eastern Pacific and the asymmetric local sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. It has been proposed that the asymmetric circulation anomalies over the tropical WNP have a contribution to the asymmetric decaying rates between El Niño and La Niña. The mechanism works in the CMIP5 models. Those models that can (cannot) simulate the asymmetry between WNPAC and WNPC tend to reproduce ENSO with asymmetric (symmetric) decaying rates. In the observation, WNPAC maintains throughout El Niño decaying summer. The maintenance of WNPAC primarily relies on the local forcing of underlying cold SST anomalies in the early summer, remaining from preceding winter and spring, whereas to remote forcing from the tropical Indian Ocean in the late summer. The two mechanisms are reproduced by the multi-model ensemble mean. The scatter diagrams for the CMIP5 models demonstrate that the response of WNPAC to the remote forcing from the tropical Indian Ocean intensifies from June to July, concurring with the establishment of the climatological WNP monsoon trough.",

            "abstract": "Excessive sedimentation in streams and rivers is one of the top water quality concerns in the U.S. and globally. While sediment is a natural constituent of stream ecosystems, excessive amounts cause high levels of turbidity which can reduce primary and secondary production, reduce nutrient retention, and have negative impacts on fish reproduction and physiology. Fine sediment particles adsorb pollutants such as mercury, metals, polychlorinated biphenyl compounds and bacteria. Key questions remain regarding the origin of excessive sediment as well as the transport pathways of sediment through the landscape and channel network of the 4,300 km2 Root River watershed in southeastern Minnesota. To answer these questions, we are developing a sediment budget to account for inputs, outputs, and changes in sediment storage reservoirs within the system. Because watershed sediment fluxes are determined as the sum of many small changes (erosion and deposition) across a vast area, multiple, redundant techniques are required to adequately constrain all parts of the sediment budget. Specifically, this budget utilizes four years of field research and surveys, an extensive set of sediment fingerprinting data, watershed-wide measurements of channel widening and meander migration, and watershed modeling, all evaluated and extrapolated in a geomorphically sensitive manner. Analyses of sediment deposition within channel cutoffs throughout the watershed help constrain sediment storage. These overlapping methods, reconciled within the hard constraint of direct measurements of water and sediment fluxes, improve the reliability of the budget. The sediment budget highlights important sources and sinks and identifies locations that are likely to be more, or less, sensitive to changes in land and water management to support watershed-wide prioritization of conservation and restoration actions.",

During 2012, flash drought conditions occurred at the MOISST location as conditions transitioned from no drought in late April to D4 (exceptional drought) in mid August. The array of instruments captured the dramatic transition of land-surface conditions at the MOISST site, in particular during a period spanning approximately six weeks in July and August in whereby drought conditions changed from abnormally dry to exceptional drought and ecosystem collapsed occurred. Results for the analyses demonstrated that both soil moisture and vegetation dynamics were critical components to flash drought development. Further, when the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) was applied to the MOISST site during 2012, the results demonstrated that the predictability of drought conditions were increased to nearly six weeks prior to flash drought development that began in July.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has been acquiring oblique aerial photographs of the coast before and after major storms since 1995 and has amassed a database of over 140,000 photographs of the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts. USGS coastal scientists use these photographs to document and characterize coastal change caused by storms. The images can also be used to evaluate the accuracy of predictive models of coastal erosion. However, the USGS does not have the personnel to manually analyze all of the photographs taken after a storm. Also, computers cannot yet automatically identify damages and geomorphic changes to the coast from the oblique aerial photographs. There is a high public interest in accessing the limited number of pre- and post-storm photographic pairs the USGS is currently able to share. Recent federal policies that encourage open data and open innovation initiatives have resulted in many federal agencies developing new ways of using citizen science and crowdsourcing techniques to share data and collaborate with the public to accomplish large tasks. The USGS launched a crowdsourcing application in June 2014 called “iCoast – Did the Coast Change?” (\nhttp://coastal.er.usgs.gov/icoast\n) to allow citizens to help USGS scientists identify changes to the coast by comparing USGS aerial photographs taken before and after storms, and then selecting pre-defined tags like “dune scarp” and “sand on road.” The tags are accompanied by text definitions and pictorial examples of these coastal morphology terms and serve to informally and passively educate users about coastal hazards. The iCoast application facilitates greater citizen awareness of coastal change and is an educational resource for teachers and students interested in learning about coastal vulnerability. We expect that the citizen observations from iCoast will assist with probabilistic model development to produce more accurate predictions of coastal vulnerability.",

            "abstract": "The next generation of numerical weather prediction models will run with a grid spacing of about 1 kilometer. Deep convection is coarsely resolved at this grid spacing, but shallow clouds and boundary layer turbulence are too small to be resolved. Previous experience at MeteoSwiss and other institutions has shown significant biases at this resolution: shallow clouds tend to be underrepresented and a too sudden onset of deep convection occurs.\nWe use idealized simulations to investigate the ability of a kilometer-scale NWP model (COSMO) to accurately represent the initiation and development of moist convection. In particular, we look into the role of boundary layer turbulence, horizontal mixing and the convection scheme. We do this by systematically exploring a number of case studies (GCSS cases as well as two previously documented cases of convection over topography), using both the kilometer-scale resolution setup and an LES setup with higher resolution. Using the latter setup as a reference, we aim to identify weaknesses and suggest improvements in the formulation of moist convection and turbulence. We look into the spatial distribution of turbulence, clouds and precipitation and use conditionally sampled statistics to investigate the properties of clouds and flow patterns.\nIn order to represent non-precipitating shallow convection, the use of a subgrid-scale convection scheme is necessary in the kilometer-scale simulations. The standard convection scheme in COSMO captures the onset of clouds, but the liquid water content and mass-flux near cloud top are overestimated. This behavior can be improved, however, with modifications in the closure, convective triggering and the entrainment/detrainment formulation.\nThe kilometer-scale model performs surprisingly similar to LES simulations for phenomena which it only coarsely resolves, such as convective cold pools, slope flows and marginally resolved updrafts. We further discuss the effect of the horizontal mixing formulation and turbulence parameterization on e.g. the mass-flux, the strength of updrafts and the precipitation rate.",

            "abstract": "Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are increasingly being used in earthquake monitoring and tsunami warning systems. However, the ability of GNSS to measure potentially small ground displacements is limited by a number of error sources, one of which is multipath interference, which affects the measurements made by a GNSS receiver.\nSidereal filtering is a technique sometimes used to reduce errors caused by multipath in the positioning of static receivers via GPS in particular. It relies upon the receiver and its surrounding environment remaining static from one day to the next and takes advantage of the approximately sidereal repeat time of the GPS constellation geometry. The repeating multipath error can thus be identified, usually in the position domain, and largely removed from the following day.\nWe have developed an observation-domain sidereal filter (ODSF) algorithm that operates on un-differenced ionosphere-free GPS carrier phase observations to reduce errors caused by multipath. It is applied in the context of high-rate 1 Hz precise point positioning (PPP) of a static receiver. An ODSF is able to account for the slightly different repeat times of each GPS satellite, unlike a position-domain sidereal filter, and can hence be more effective at reducing high-frequency multipath error.\nUsing eight-hour long datasets of GPS observations from two different receivers with different antenna types and contrasting environments, the ODSF algorithm is shown overall to yield a position time series 10% to 45% more stable, in terms of Allan deviation, than a position-domain sidereal filter over time intervals of between 20 s and 300 s in length. This would be particularly useful for earthquake and tsunami early warning systems where the accurate measurement of small displacements of the ground over the period of just a few minutes is crucial. However, the sidereal filters have also been applied to a third dataset during which two short episodes of particularly high-frequency multipath error were identified. These two periods are analyzed in detail and illustrate the limitations of using sidereal filters with important implications for other methods of correcting for multipath at the observation level.",

            "abstract": "The explosive energy release in solar eruptive phenomena such as CMEs/eruptive flares and coronal jets is believed to be due to magnetic reconnection. Magnetic free energy builds up slowly in the corona due to footpoint stressing by the photospheric motions. Along with the free energy, current sheets build up at coronal nulls, which eventually triggers fast reconnection and explosive energy release. This basic scenario has been modeled extensively by MHD simulations and applied to both CMEs/eruptive flares and jets, but the reconnection itself is well-known to be due to kinetic processes. Consequently, it is imperative that shear-driven X-point reconnection be modeled in a fully kinetic system so as to test and guide the MHD results. In MHD simulations, the application of a magnetic-field shear at the system boundary is a trivial matter, but this is definitely not the case for a kinetic system, because the electric currents need to be fully consistent with all the mass motions. We present the first results of reconnection in a 2D X-Point geometry due to a velocity shear driver perpendicular to the plane of reconnection. We compare the results to high-resolution MHD simulations and discuss the implications for coronal activity.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is an essential technology for most unconventional hydrocarbon resources and many conventional ones as well. The primary limitation on the improvement and optimization of the fracturing process is the minimal access to observe the behavior of the fracture in the subsurface. Without direct observational evidence, hypothetical mechanisms must be assumed and then tested for their validity with indirect information such as wellbore measurements, indirect production and pressure behavior. One of the most important sources of information today is the relation made between micro seismic source mechanisms and fracture behavior. Hydraulic fractures induce some level of micro seismicity when the stress conditions in the Earth are altered by changes in stress during the operations. The result is the sudden movement between rock elements and the radiation of both compressional and shear energy in a seismic range that can be detected and recorded with sensitive receivers. The objective of this work is to provide reasonable information when applying inversion methods in order to estimate the vertical and horizontal spatial heterogeneities in medium and energy radiation distribution of microseisms while fracking operations. The method consist in record microseisms at a previous lineal array of stations (triaxial accelerometers) which are located close to the source coordinates and cover the area of study. The analysis clarify some ideas about what information can be gained from the micro seismic source data and according to the obtained results, what kind of comparisons and associations might be done to evaluate the fracking performance operation. Non uniformities in medium such as faults would be revealed by interpreted scattering coefficients. Fracture properties like distance, velocity and orientation would be also determined by analyzing energy radiation.",

            "abstract": "Both drilling and down-hole logging data indicate an abnormally high thermal gradient in the Central Range of Taiwan. A common hypothesis is that uplifting rate is faster than the conductive cooling rate, and as a result the heat was kept in hot dry-rock area. A direct way to prove this theory is to collect representative rock samples from two transects across the Central Range (Central and Southern Cross-Island Highway) measuring thermal parameters, including thermal conductivity, diffusivity, and heat capacity. We also utilize thermal profiles from hot-spring wells in the mountain area to obtain the thermal gradient. Armed with these data, we can calculate present heat flow via the equation-1, , where Q is heat flow (W/m2), λ is thermal conductivity (W/mK), T is temperature (K), and z is the depth (m).\nThermal conductivity is a function of both porosity (pressure) and temperature. Our samples are mainly metamorphic rocks with less affected by porosity, and we build up our own temperature model versus thermal conductivity by heating up samples to about 180℃. Combined with experimental equations from other studies, we can extrapolate our model to higher temperature ranges at the depth of the rock formed and presumed paleo-thermal gradient. Basically, thermal conductivity has a negative relationship with temperature. For example, thermal conductivity of marble collected in the Central Highway has an average value of about 3.0 W/mK at 26℃, and decreases to 1.6 W/mK at 450℃.\n With paleo-thermal gradient, we can correlate spatial distribution of the thermal heat with structural cross sections along central and southern cross-island highway and compare the cooling rate obtained from fission track data in the mountain ranges.",

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation events cause disproportionate damage to wealth and infrastructure. Precipitation extremes lead to flooding in urban areas and disrupt transportation. We evaluated CMIP5 global climate models against sub-daily observations of extreme precipitation events from the TRMM for major urban areas in the world. The evaluation was performed for annual maximum precipitation for 3-24 hours durations. Moreover, after the evaluation of CMIP5 GCMs, we analyzed data from them to estimate changes in precipitation maxima under the projected future climate in major urban areas. Results suggest that the majority of CMIP5 GCMs underestimate 3-hourly precipitation maxima at most of the urban areas. However, negative bias in precipitation maxima in climate models improves with the duration of precipitation. Precipitation maxima are projected to increase significantly at majority of urban areas under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios in future. Results underscore a need to further improve GCMs so that they can capture extreme precipitation intensity in urban areas. Moreover, projected increase in precipitation extremes may pose substantial challenges for urban infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "We perform a comparison study of an eruptive filament in the core region of AR 11283 and a nearby non-eruptive filament. The coronal magnetic field supporting these two filaments is extrapolated using our data-driven CESE-MHD-NLFFF code (Jiang et al. 2013, Jiang etal. 2014), which presents two magnetic flux ropes (FRs) in the same extrapolation box. The eruptive FR contains a bald-patch separatrix surface (BPSS) spatially co-aligned very well with a pre-eruption EUV sigmoid, which is consistent with the BPSS model for the coronal sigmoids. The numerically reproduced magnetic dips of the FRs match observations of the filaments strikingly well, which supports strongly the FR-dip model for filaments. The FR that supports the AR eruptive filament is much smaller (with a length of 3 Mm) compared with the large-scale FR holding the quiescent filament (with a length of 30 Mm). But the AR eruptive FR contains most of the magnetic free energy in the extrapolation box and holds a much higher magnetic energy density than the quiescent FR, because it resides along the main polarity inversion line (PIL) around sunspots with strong magnetic shear. Both the FRs are weakly twisted and cannot trigger kink instability. The AR eruptive FR is unstable because its axis reaches above a critical height for torus instability (TI), at which the overlying closed arcades can no longer confine the FR stably. To the contrary, the quiescent FR is firmly held down by its overlying field, as its axis apex is far below the TI threshold height.

            "abstract": "A prominent feature of the modern North Pacific is the presence of intermediate water with higher oxygen content and lower salinity (centered at σθ = 26.8 isopycnal). This North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) is the only “fresh” water mass formed in the North Pacific Ocean today in which its formation is physically coupled to dense water formation by brine rejection in seasonal sea-ice regions of the Okhotsk Sea. Differences in past NPIW ventilation have been proposed as one important mechanism to understand millennial-scale ocean oxygenation changes observed during the past 60,000 years in the North Pacific (Behl and Kennett, 1996). However, the role of NPIW changes in the past is still under debate. In particular, sufficient proxy data from the North Pacific (including the Okhostk Sea) to study the ventilation of NPIW during the past 60,000 years are not available, yet. Here we present epibenthic stable carbon isotope records (δ13C) from high-resolution sediment cores of the Okhotsk Sea (LV29-108-4, 52° 01.29’N, 153° 34.48’E, 625m water depth) and Bering Sea (SO201-2-101KL, 58° 52.52’N, 170° 41.45’E, 630m water depth), the two potential source regions of past NPIW, used to trace the NPIW ventilation history of the last 60,000 years. We found several short-term events of high nutrient and low oxygen conditions in the mid-depth Okhotsk Sea and Bering Sea. These high nutrient and low oxygen events correlates remarkably well with several (but not all) Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials in Greenland ice-cores (Dansgaard et al., 1993) and associated brief interstadial low-oxygen events found in the northeast Pacific during the past 60,000 years (Behl and Kennett, 1996). We suggest that the intrusion of high nutrient and low oxygen water masses from the Okhotsk Sea and Bering Sea into the northwest Pacific to form NPIW might have facilitated the widespread, nearly synchronous ocean oxygenation changes observed in the North Pacific during Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials of the past 60,000 years.\n",

            "abstract": "Increasing temperatures and drier conditions within the boreal forests of Alaska have resulted in increases in burned area and fire frequency, which alter carbon storage and emissions. In particular, analyses of satellite remote sensing data showed that >20% of the area impacted by fires in interior Alaska occurred in areas that had previously burned since 1950 (e.g., short to intermediate interval fires). Field studies showed that in immature black spruce forests ~ 35 to 55 years old organic layers experienced deep burning regardless of topographic position or seasonality of burning, factors that control depth of burning in mature black spruce forests. Here, refinements were made to a carbon consumption model to account for variations in fuel loads and fraction of carbon consumed associated with fire frequency based on quantifying burned area in recently burned sites using satellite imagery. An immature black spruce (Picea mariana) fuel type (including stands of ~0-50 years) was developed which contains new ground-layer carbon consumption values in order to more accurately account for differences between various age classes of black spruce forest. Both versions of the model were used to assess carbon consumption during 100 fire events (over 4.4 x 10^6 ha of burned area) from two recent ultra-large fire years (2004 and 2005). Using the improved model to better attribute fuel type and consumption resulted in higher ground-layer carbon consumption (4.9% in 2004 and 6.8% in 2005) than previously estimated. These adjustments in ground-layer burning resulted in total carbon consumption within 2004 and 2005 of 63.5 and 42.0 Tg of carbon, respectively. Results from this research could be incorporated into larger scale modeling efforts to better assess changes in the climate-fire-vegetation dynamics in interior Alaskan boreal forests, and to understand the impacts of these changes on carbon consumption and emissions.",

Here we present new boron isotope (δ11B) and trace metal data from benthic foraminifera from a suite of 15 cores from the South Atlantic from depths ranging from 1500 to 4000 m. These records show distinct changes in the water column depth structure of these tracers between the last glacial maximum (LGM) and late Holocene. Comparison of these paired trace element and isotope ratios reveals new insights to the shared and individual controls on tracers including Li/Ca, Sr/Ca, U/Ca, Mg/Li and δ11B. We further examine these data using a recently developed tracer fields modelling approach (Lund et al. 2011). This has previously been applied to δ18O data to investigate changes in circulation at the LGM. Here we extend this method to non-conservative isotopic and trace elemental tracers, allowing us to constrain the roles of circulation, the biological pump of organic carbon and CaCO3, and carbonate compensation, in setting deep ocean carbon storage at the LGM.\nLund, D.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that submarine hydrothermal system supports diverse microbial life. Bio-essential metals supporting such microbial communities were released from basalts by high-temperature water-rock interaction in deeper part of the oceanic crust and carried by submarine fluid flow. Its total quantity in global hydrothermal settings has been estimated to be on the order of ~1019 g/yr, which is surprisingly on the same order of the total river flows (Urabe et al., 2011). Therefore, it is important to explore how submarine river system works, i.e., to understand mechanism and extent of elemental transport, which should lead to understanding of the roles of hydrothermal circulation in oceanic crust in controlling elemental budget in the global ocean and geochemical conditions to support deep hot biosphere.\nWe performed REE analysis of marine sediments influenced by submarine hydrothermal activity in Mid-Okinawa Trough. The sediment samples used in this study are from IODP site at Iheya North region and JADE site at Izena region. The samples show alternation between volcanic and clastic sediments. Hydrothermal fluids of this area contain elevated concentrations of volatile components such as H2, CO2, CH4, NH4+, and H2S, supporting diverse chemoautotrophic microbial community (Nakagawa et al., 2005). The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of hydrothermal activity on the REE signature of the sediments. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the samples show relative enrichment of light over heavy REEs, weak positive Ce anomalies, and variable degrees of negative Eu anomalies. The REE patterns suggest the sediments source was mainly basalt, suggesting insignificant input of continental materials. Negative Eu anomalies found in the IODP site become more pronounced with increasing depth, suggesting progressive increase of hydrothermal alteration where Eu was reductively dissolved into fluids by decomposition of feldspars. Contrary, at the JADE site, magnitude of negative Eu anomalies was variable independent of the sediment depth. This suggests changes in the redox conditions, most likely due to occasional invasions of O2-bearing seawater into sediments. Different regimes of hydrothermal fluid flows govern the chemical environments of marine sediments in active hydrothermal areas.",

            "abstract": "The Vanda Dike Swarm is a set of >600 compositionally diverse dikes that are unusually well exposed in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. New precise zircon age determinations indicate that they intruded between 491 and 495 Ma. The dikes range in composition from basaltic to rhyolitic, although they are arguably bimodal. They were emplaced into both foliated and massive Cambrian granitoids of the Ross Orogeny and their Proterozoic wall rocks. There is no apparent relationship between the major element composition and the dikes’ emplacement age or location. Most dikes have distinctly non-planar contacts, and there is no evidence that dike emplacement was controlled by basement structure, either on a meter scale or regionally. Instead, most dikes are sinuous, strike 28 to 44°, and dip eastward (many <70°), indicating tectonic controls on emplacement. The dikes are not distributed evenly: many are concentrated in km-scale areas, which may mark the infrastructure of central volcanoes. Chilled margins and glassy groundmass indicates that the dike swarm was emplaced at shallow levels. So far as we know, there are no coeval volcanic rocks in the region, where the Devonian to Triassic Beacon Standstone unconformably overlies the dikes and their wallrocks. Many of the dikes have strongly mylonitized margins with normal sense of shear, indicating that solidified dikes served as normal faults. Otherwise, so far as we are aware, there is no recognizable evidence for normal faulting in the area. Our interpretation is that the dikes were emplaced into the shallow crust at the end of the Ross Orogeny, at the culmination of uplift and synchronous with extension. They thus represent the transition from an Andean-type margin to a rifting environment, in all likelihood due to reconfiguration of subduction near the end of the Cambrian.",

            "abstract": "Upon contact with water, freshly-fallen volcanic ash releases a pulse of readily soluble material, derived from dissolution of S-, Cl- and F-bearing salts formed on ash surfaces during transport through the volcanic eruption plume. Analysis of leachate solutions can provide insight into the spatial and temporal variations in surface salt loadings, and hence the processes by which they were emplaced, and the hazards which they may induce upon mobilisation within receiving environments. However, excluding a small number of publications from the 1970’s and 1980’s, leachate studies are often limited by the use of small datasets with an uncertain capacity to adequately represent their parent ash deposit. Here we illustrate the significance of such limitations through the compilation and interrogation of a database of 96 published leachate compositions from 6 studies which investigated the May 18th, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens. Utilising statistical analysis techniques, we removed outliers and biases between studies by linear transformation in order to produce a useable ash leachate dataset. The corrected data were mapped by kriging method to derive the spatial distribution of soluble S and Cl concentrations downwind of the volcano. Our treatment highlighted spatial trends in leachate data which may reflect various volcanic and atmospheric processes. In order to be able to disentangle these processes, we emphasise the need to obtain a homogeneous spatial distribution when sampling ash for leaching purposes, and to conduct those analyses according to a standardized protocol.",

            "abstract": "Although oceanic transform faults (OTF) constitute a small fraction of the total plate boundary area, better constraints on OTF tectonic parameters (e.g. fault length, slip rate, thermal structure) compared to other tectonic boundaries make OTFs a useful focus of the investigation of earthquake processes. The large fraction of aseismic deformation that accompanies OTF earthquakes also makes them an interesting target for exploring the interaction of creep with slow and quick earthquakes. Because most typical OTFs are quite remote, even indirectly observing these deformation processes is a serious challenge. Standard teleseismic analysis methods have yielded valuable constraints on the first-order characteristics of moderate-to-large magnitude OTF earthquakes, but fundamental questions rgarding rupture length and area as well as rupture-front propagation speed remain unknown in these systems. Even identifying the smaller-magnitude activity that often provides clues to some of these quantities is difficult. Short-period seismic arrays at least occasionally provide information suitable for locations of small (mb < 4.0) earthquakes along Mid-Atlantic transforms such as the Romanche and Chain. In this work, we explore the possibility of detecting smaller earthquakes along remote OTFs using waveform-based comparisons (e.g. cross correlations) of template signals with the continuous seismic wavefield for seismic stations surrounding several OTFs. We examine our ability to detect these small events using a range of frequency bands from short-to-intermediate periods and investigating effective approaches for identifying small-magnitude events along remote OTFs. Preliminary results suggest that at least some small events can be identified using simple waveform templates. Our goal is to construct a metric that will produce acceptable false-alarm rates and that will allow us to visually confirm detections and extend the seismicity catalogs along OTFs to lower magnitude threshold and allow us to continue to investigate OTF deformation processes using remote seismic observations.",

            "abstract": "Due to focussed recharge mechanisms and rapid conduit flow, karst aquifers are often very vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination, especially concerning water abstraction from karst springs. This groundwater source vulnerability is highly variable in time, depending on the temporal variability of precipitation and recharge conditions. The critical fast flow component can be assessed by high-resolution monitoring of spring hydrographs and chemographs and their combined analysis. However, because of the lack of data this has been rarely conducted for karst aquifers in arid or semi-arid climate regions, despite the episodic nature of recharge and associated low signal convolution in those environments. A continuous monitoring scheme was implemented at four major karst springs located in the Lower Jordan Valley near Jericho together with meteorological stations and monitoring wells in the recharge area. The results enable (1) the quantification of the fast flow component and associated source vulnerability parameters at the springs, (2) insights into the hydrogeological characteristics of the flow system, e.g. karst network geometry and conduit system volumes, and (3) the evaluation of rapid recharge processes, i.e. the relative importance of flow concentration in the epikarst and rapid vadose zone percolation vs. the infiltration of episodic surface runoff into ponors. Furthermore, the seasonal variable wastewater impact at the springs and hence the epikarst–vadose zone–matrix–conduit interaction can be qualitatively evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Large wood (LW) is a critical component to forested mountain headwater streams contributing significantly to geomorphic and ecological processes. The character of LW is a function of valley recruitment processes that influence LW entering the channel and instream retention processes that influence LW transport through the channel reach. In the central Appalachian Mountains, US, LW dynamics in eastern hemlock-dominated ravines may change due to the invasive insect Hemlock Wooly Adelgid (HWA). However, quantitative LW studies are lacking for this region, which are necessary for effective management of projected HWA-associated change. We examined LW dynamics across central Appalachian headwater streams to identify 1) the current state of LW load, 2) the relative environmental factors that influence LW load, 3) potential signs of HWA impact on LW dynamics, and 4) functional grouping patterns of LW pieces in these systems. In a field study that included 24 sites in Ohio, West Virginia, and Virginia, mean wood density was 36 pieces/100m ± 21 and mean wood volume was 5.6 m3/100m ± 3.5. Most pieces were less than bankfull width suggesting high transportability, but large pieces (>10m) contributed significantly to wood volume, jam formation, and geomorphic function. Central Appalachian LW load was on the lower end of mountain headwater streams, but comparable to the northeastern US. A mixture of recruitment and retention processes influence wood dynamics, but channel retention processes better explain jam dynamics. Specifically, higher wood load was associated with lower forest basal area, smaller channel dimensions, and lower hydraulic driving forces, which is consistent with other studies. We did not detect a significant influence on wood load as a result of HWA infestation of ~20 years, which may reflect a lag period between tree mortality, toppling, and LW load. Pieces clustered in three functional groups of 1) larger, stable pieces that store sediment, stabilize the bank, and create pools, 2) relatively stable pieces that deflect flow and dissipate energy, and 3) smaller pieces associated with flow deflection and energy dissipation composed of mixed stability. This study provides quantitative information on LW dynamics in the central Appalachian region prior to expected environmental change associated with HWA.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogeological testing in a tomographic sequence as shown by the use of hydraulic tomography, allows an improvement of the spatial resolution of subsurface parameters. In this regard, recent studies show increasing interest in tracer tomography which involves sequential and spatially separated tracer injections and the measurement of their corresponding tracer breakthrough at different locations and depths. Such concentration measurements however require large experimental efforts and can be simplified by geophysical tracer monitoring techniques such as electrical resistivity. In this study, we present the use of 4-D, cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) for monitoring salt tracer experiments in high velocity flow fields. For our study, we utilized a set up that enables the conduction of salt tracer experiments with complete recovery within 84 hours over a transport distance of 16 m. This allows the repetition of the experiments with different injection depths for a tomographic salt tracer testing. For ERT monitoring, we designed modular borehole electrodes for repeated usage in a flexible manner. We also assess the use of a high speed resistivity data acquisition mode for field scale tracer monitoring ensuring high spatial and temporal resolution without sacrificing data accuracy. We applied our approach at the Lauswiesen test site, Tübingen, Germany. In our 10 m × 10 m tracer monitoring domain with 16 borehole electrodes, we acquired 4650 data points in less than 18 minutes for each monitoring cycle. Inversion results show that the tracer could be successfully imaged using this approach. The results show that repeated salt tracer tests can be efficiently monitored at a high resolution with ERT which gives the possibility for salt tracer tomography at field scale. Our results also provide a data base for extending current hydrogeophysical inversion approaches to field scale data.",

            "abstract": "Model simulations suggest that different initial conditions can lead to multiple stable vegetation-atmosphere states in the present-day Sahara. Here, we explore the stability of the vegetation-atmosphere system in the warm, nearly ice-free early Eocene climate. Using the MPI-ESM, we simulate the early Eocene vegetation starting from two different states: Continents are either completely covered by forest or completely barren, devoid of any vegetation. The soil albedo is similar to vegetation albedo. Hence, the albedo effect of vegetation is negligible. Without the albedo effect, the Charney effect which is suggested to cause multiple stable vegetation states in the present-day Sahara is absent. In our simulations, the hydrological effect of vegetation plays the major role. We perform the same simulations with preindustrial conditions to compare the stability of the vegetation-atmosphere system in both climate states.\nA desert evolves in Central Asia in both early Eocene simulations. This Asian desert is larger when the simulation starts from bare soil instead forest. Bare soil causes a dry climate in Central Asia in the beginning of the simulation. In the dry climate, vegetation does not establish. Forest enhances evaporation relative to bare soil leading to a stronger Asian monsoon and higher precipitation rates. The increased precipitation sustains plant growth and a smaller Asian desert evolves than in the simulation started from bare soil. Moreover, the stronger Asian monsoon affects global climate. Therefore, the two vegetation states in Central Asia accompany two globally different vegetation-atmosphere states.\nIn the preindustrial climate, the Sahara is larger when the initial vegetation is bare soil instead of forest. The same hydrological effect causes the multiple vegetation states the Sahara as in the early Eocene Asian desert. However, the multiple stable vegetation states in the Sahara do not affect the global climate. This result emphasises that the vegetation-atmosphere system is more sensitive to the initial vegetation cover during the early Eocene than today.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) play an important role in the climate effects of clouds. Wet deposition of these particles via rainout, washout, or cloud seeding is an important removal mechanism for aerosols in the atmosphere. Many of these particles, especially those that serve as IN, are insoluble and remain suspended after uptake within precipitating droplets/crystals as insoluble residues. While studies have measured the dissolved ions or mass of species within collected precipitation, no studies to date have quantified the number and size of insoluble residues. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an in situ method for determining the number concentration, number size distribution, and surface area distribution of insoluble residues < 1 μm in diameter in samples of melted snow and rain. This work evaluates the use of nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), a new and novel technique for determining particle size distributions in a liquid medium, to determine in situ size distributions of insoluble residue particles in precipitation and evaluate this technique versus other analytical methods, including dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Number size distribution modes ranged from 80–150 nm and were strongly sample dependent. Surface area distribution modes ranged from 150–400 nm. Differences were observed between concentrations and size distributions for snow collected at different locations and elevations and between rain and melted snow. These differences can indicate changes in the insoluble residues that vary with ambient aerosol concentration, cloud microphysics, and meteorological dynamics. This method has great potential for improving our understanding of the properties of the particles nucleating droplets and crystals, the surface area available for reactions to occur, and the number of particles removed by scavenging. Additionally, the snow samples were further evaluated for chemical and physical properties using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using techniques learned at Pacific Northwest National Lab’s (PNNL) Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), we performed computer controlled SEM (CCSEM) with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on melted snow and rain samples.",

            "abstract": "The CML-Io phase diagram, where the occurrence of the Jovian decameter radio emissions is plotted versus the central meridian longitude (CML) and the orbital phase of Io, displays four zones of enhanced probability. These zones are the so-called Io-controlled sources Io-A, Io-B (emitted from the northern hemisphere), and Io-C, Io-D (emitted from the south). In a recent work, we have studied the occurrence probability in a polar diagram linked to the local magnetic field, making the assumption that the magnetic field intensity gradient plays the role of an optical axis for the wave propagation. For a given Jovian magnetic field model, the four sources Io-A, Io-B, Io-C and Io-D are plotted as a function of the colatitude angle θ relative to the gradient of the magnetic field (radial coordinate) and an azimuth angle ψ linked to the direction of magnetic field vector. Our previous results revealed that the angle θ is not constant and that the Jovian decameter emission controlled by Io is radiated in a hollow cone which is not axi-symmetrical around the magnetic field gradient but flattened in the direction of the magnetic field vector. The relative directions of the magnetic field and its gradient within the radio source seem to play a crucial role in the angular distribution of the occurrence probability. Thus we analyze the effect of the choice of the magnetic field model (in particular the O6, VIP4, VIT4 and VIPAL models) on this distribution and the consequences for the emission cone. Our study requires use of elliptic coordinates in a frame linked to the local magnetic field.",

Large classes, time constraints, and funding may limit student access to science labs, denying students access to the types of experiential learning needed to motivate and develop new scientists. Interactive, discovery-based computer simulations and virtual labs provide an alternative, low-risk opportunity for learners to engage in lab processes and activities. Students can conduct experiments, collect data, draw conclusions, and even abort a session. We have developed an online virtual lab, through which students can interactively develop as scientists as they learn about scientific concepts, lab equipment, and proper lab techniques. Our first lab topic is adsorption of chemicals to soil, but the methodology is transferrable to other topics. In addition to learning the specific procedures involved in each lab, the online activities will prompt exploration and practice in key scientific and mathematical concepts, such as unit conversion, significant digits, assessing risks, evaluating bias, and assessing quantity and quality of data. These labs are not designed to replace traditional lab instruction, but to supplement instruction on challenging or particularly time-consuming concepts. To complement classroom instruction, students can engage in a lab experience outside the lab and over a shorter time period than often required with real-world adsorption studies. More importantly, students can reflect, discuss, review, and even fail at their lab experience as part of the process to see why natural processes and scientific approaches work the way they do. Our Media Productions team has completed a series of online digital labs available at virtuallabs.nmsu.edu and scienceofsoil.com, and these virtual labs are being integrated into coursework to evaluate changes in student learning.",

Groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers at depths greater than 5 m below land surface have rarely been assessed. The freshwater-saltwater interface in deeper confined aquifers is frequently positioned offshore, where it is difficult to locate or study. Our investigation was located at North Inlet, a wide, intertidal wetland southeast of Georgetown, SC. This site was ideal for studying the freshwater-saltwater interface at the embayment scale because the first major confined aquifer under the wetlands was accessible. Using electrical resistivity tomography, we were able to image the upper 20 to 30 m of sediment, including the first major confined aquifer. At North Inlet a 75 km2 island is bounded by extensive marsh and relict and modern barrier islands extending ~10 km seaward to the Atlantic Ocean. Surface and groundwater salinity throughout the marsh is 35 ppt. In order to get maximum depth penetration, surveys were conducted along dry land on the island and marsh surface with 10 m electrode spacing. Measured apparent resistivity varied in all surveys. A 20 Ohm-m resistivity layer at 25 m depth suggests that freshwater extends 335 m from the mainland. The presence of this freshwater indicates regional groundwater flow under the marsh or high rates of infiltration during precipitation events. Groundwater was saline to brackish (~10 Ohm-m) 1 km further out into the marsh at the next relict beach ridge at depths of 20 to 30 m. These results indicate that embayment scale groundwater flow plays an important role in providing low salinity pore-water to the marsh from beneath. The presence of fresh/brackish groundwater hundreds of meters from the mainland suggests that coastal confined aquifers transport freshwater significant distances. Freshwater could exist in analogous confined aquifers at shallow depths under the seafloor in other coastal systems.",

Buoy 1 drifted into the Chukchi Sea in June and experienced a switch from CDOM to phytoplankton dominated absorption. Buoy 2 has continued to drift south, but remains in the central basin. It has moved into water with reduced light attenuation properties, indicating low CDOM and low Chl a concentrations.

            "abstract": "People in Cordillera Blanca range in Peru have a long history dealing with natural disasters associated to high mountains; particularly Glacier Lakes Outburst Flood (GLOF). Examples in the Cordillera Blanca vary from a GLOF that occurred in 1941 that killed more than 5000 people in the city of Huaraz to recent events from Lake Artison Baja in 2012 and Lake 513 on 2010, which were not devastating thanks to safety systems previously installed in those lakes. However, glaciers continue melting leaving new lakes or changing the characteristics of lakes that were previously controlled making safety systems obsolete that worked successfully in the past protecting communities downstream. Lake Palcacocha has evolved from being safe after the installation of a safety system in 1970 to an imminent source of GLOF risk due to the expansion that has occurred during the last 40 years increasing from a volume of 500,000 to 17 million m3. In response to this risk the community in Huaraz is planning an Early Warning System (EWS) that will allow the population to mobilize to a safe area in case a GLOF occurs. In this work we present an adaptation of the LifeSIM model to calculate the benefits from such an EWS using 2007 census data and a FLO-2D flood simulation model. The outputs are the number of people in Huaraz that could lose their life due to a GLOF. Our results indicate that without an EWS around 19,773 people could lose their life; whereas, if an EWS is installed the number of victims reduces to 7344. Finally, if mobilization of the affected population is improved the value reduces to 2865. The results show the importance of the EWS as well as informing and training the population to how to react if a GLOF occurs.",

            "abstract": "This study analyzes the association between wintertime high wind events (HWEs) in the northeast United States US and extratropical cyclones. Sustained wind maxima in the Daily Summary Data from the National Climatic Data Center’s Integrated Surface Database are analyzed for 1979-2012. For each station, a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) is fit to the upper tail of the daily maximum wind speed data, and probabilistic return levels at intervals of 1, 3 and 5-years are derived from the GPD fit. At each interval, wind events meeting the return level criteria are termed HWEs. The HWEs occurring on the same day are grouped into multi-station events allowing the association with extratropical cyclones, which are tracked in the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast ERA-Interim reanalysis. Using hierarchical clustering analysis, this study finds that the HWEs are most often associated with cyclones travelling from southwest to northeast, usually originating west of the Appalachian Mountains. The results show that a storm approaching from the southwest is four times more likely to cause strong surface winds than a Nor’easter. A series of sensitivity analyses confirms the robustness of this result. Next, the relationship between the strength of the wind events and the corresponding storm minimum sea level pressure is analyzed. No robust relationship between these quantities is found for strong wind events. Nevertheless, subsequent analysis shows that a relationship between deeper storms and stronger winds emerges if the analysis is extended to the entire set of wintertime storms.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical properties of the lithosphere are increasingly recognized as having a quantifiable influence on the rates and patterns of surface processes. Strain localization, controlled by the mechanical response to local tectonic and topographic stress fields, manifests as tabular fault damage zones that impose displacement, strength, and grain size distribution patterns on the Earth’s surface. Brittle failure and comminution associated with seismogenic cataclasis can reduce bedrock cohesion by several orders of magnitude and generate dense fracture networks, such that the grains released by rock weathering are much finer than those produced by weathering of the surrounding undamaged, intact bedrock. We combine models of landscape evolution and crustal mechanics to investigate how strain-induced crustal failure can exert significant controls on the rates and patterns of landscape development and adjustment. Based on our model results, drainage network patterns tend to reflect the geometry of underlying active or inactive tectonic structures due to the rapid erosion and transport of fault gouge. Fault erosion can be over an order of magnitude faster than erosion of intact bedrock. Fault zones with shallow dip angle are capable of enforcing lateral migration of their structurally confined rivers. Deep valleys created by eroding faults quickly become armored by coarse sediments transported from nearby intact bedrock. Differential displacement affects drainage network patterns by deforming and uplifting the surface relative to baselevel while simultaneously exposing fresh fault damage zones. Topography produced from these processes reflects the strong mechanical anisotropy associated with strain localization and brittle failure over many length scales, contrasting with the absence of a strong directional dependence from dendritic rivers incising into a predominantly homogeneous substrate. Our methods have been used to produce accurate predictions about local and regional stress and strain fields in New Zealand and the Himalayan Eastern Syntaxis.",

The T3 site is a receptor site for both polluted urban down-wind (Manaus, BR a city of several million 70 km up wind) and background (Amazon rainforest) air-masses and can provide a contrast between clean and polluted conditions. Particle hygroscopicity (kappa) and mixing state were calculated from the particle activation spectrum measured by size selecting aerosols and exposing them to a wide range of supersaturation in the CCN counter (Droplet Measurement Technologies Continuous-Flow Streamwise Thermal Gradient CCN Chamber). The supersaturation was varied between 0.07 and 1.1% by changing a combination of both total flow rate and temperature gradient in the CCN counter. Measured spectra were examined for air masses with different level of influence from Manaus plume. Particle hygroscopicity generally peaked near noon local time which was broadly consistent with the trend in aerosol sulfate. The average kappa values during the first intensive operation period were 0.14±0.05, 0.14±0.04 and 0.16±0.06 for 75, 112 and 171 nm particles respectively. Evaluation of particle hygroscopicity and dispersion (mixing state) will be presented with respect to size and level of pollution.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic ash sintering can occur during hot deposition or upon reheating, and recently published models have improved our understanding of viscous sintering timescales at magmatic temperatures. However, in most volcanic environments, water is present either from meteoric or magmatic sources. Water significantly lowers the viscosity of liquids and therefore should alter the onset temperature and timescales of sintering. The diffusion of water in melts and glasses at low (sub-liquidus) temperatures and pressures, and the partitioning between water vapor and dissolved water species are poorly understood. We investigate the impact of a water rich Ar -atmosphere on viscous sintering at temperatures close to the glass transition. Synthetic near-spherical soda-lime silica glass beads with a well-constrained size of about 10-350µm (produced by Spheriglass) were heated in simultaneous thermal analyses of both differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry. Glass transition temperature onset and mass stayed consistent under argon atmosphere during successive heating cycles at a rate of 10 °C.min-1. Contrastingly, preliminary results show that, when heated, closely packed in a water-argon atmosphere (1) there is a measurable water uptake during timescales as short as 2 hours, and (2) sintering is more efficient and densification takes place at lower temperatures and/or within shorter timescales.\nSintering of volcanic materials reduces both porosity and permeability of volcanic products. The process of sintering is, however, limited by quenching of the material shortly after eruption. External water present during deposition could allow welding of pyroclastic deposits at conditions and timescales otherwise not achievable from the deposited pyroclasts alone.. Viscous sintering in a water-rich atmosphere may enhance resorption and encourage the formation of vesicle-free obsidian.",

            "abstract": "Methane, the most abundant hydrocarbon in Earth’s atmosphere, is produced in large quantities in sediments underlying the world’s oceans. Very little of this methane makes it to surface sediments as it is consumed by Anaerobic Methanotrophs (ANME’s) in consortia with Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB). Less is known about which organisms are responsible for methane production in marine sediments, and whether that production is under thermodynamic control based on hydrogen concentrations. Although ANMEs have been found to be active in methanogenic sediments and incubations, it is currently unknown whether they are able to grow in methanogenic conditions. We demonstrated with bottle incubations of methane seep sediment taken from Cape Lookout Bight, NC, that hydrogen controls methane production. While sulfate was present the hydrogen concentration was maintained at below 2 nM. Only after the depletion of sulfate allowed hydrogen concentrations to rise above 5 nM did we see production of methane. The same sediments when spiked with methane gas demonstrated its complete removal while sulfate reduction occurred. Quantitative PCR shows that ANME-2 and ANME-1 increase in 16S copy number as methane increases. Total direct cell counts demonstrate a decline in cells with the decrease of sulfate until a recovery corresponding with production of methane. Our results strongly suggest that hydrogen concentrations influence what metabolic processes can occur in marine sediments, and that ANME-1 and ANME-2 are able to grow on the energy provided from methane production.",

Basal melting and sliding conditions cannot be observed directly, but observables such as ice thickness, surface velocity and the internal radar layer structure contain indirect information of the basal conditions. The northeast ice stream extend to the interior parts indicating that basal conditions are also important in the interior parts.\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of the large-scale evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet on millennial to glacial/interglacial time scales to parameters controlling basal sliding and ice flow. In the study, we use the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) to examine the response of the ice sheet evolution to the choices of dynamic parameters. The investigated parameters relates to the parameterization of the basal processes and ice viscosity, these includes the enhancement factor, the exponent in the basal sliding relation employed in the model and the parameterization of the basal material. We run the PISM model through the last glacial/interglacial cycle for an ensemble of model parameters sets to obtain the evolution of the ice sheet using the same climate reconstruction as surface boundary conditions in all experiments in order to estimate the sensitivity of the ice sheet evolution to the choices of dynamic parameters alone. The paleo-climatic spinup of the seaRISE experiment is used as surface boundary conditions.\nThe results of the ensemble experiments are compared using time series of global variables and by comparing snapshots of the ice sheet at predefined times. We discuss the regional differences and sensitivity to the model parameters, and further discuss the evaluation of the parameter combinations by comparing the modelled ice flow pattern to observed present day velocities.",

            "abstract": "On June 13, 2013, a north-south oriented, long formation of strong storms passed eastward over the New Jersey coast. Three hours later, while the weather was calm, a sudden runup of water along the New Jersey and New England coasts was witnessed despite no nearby seismic activity. Post-event analysis revealed that a rare meteotsunami impacted the East Coast of the United States. The strong pressure jump associated with the storms generated an ocean wave that became amplified when the speed of the storms reached the speed of the wave, creating resonance. The wave approached the Mid-Atlantic shelf break and reflected back, explaining the time lag between the passing storms and the incoming wave. The National Water Level Observing Network (NWLON) stations maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) measured strong water level oscillations at several stations along the eastern seaboard. The detided one-minute data show the tsunami signal with maximum amplitudes ranging from 0.16 m at Nantucket Island, MA to 0.61 m. at Newport, RI. The Narragansett Bay stations captured the meteotsunami wave propagating northward and diminishing towards the innermost part of the Bay. The Atlantic City, NJ station captured the 3.2-mb pressure jump in the six-minute barometer data from the passing storms as well as the incoming wave that hit three hours later with a maximum amplitude of 0.47 m. Along the U.S. coast, harbor shape and orientation contributed to the strength of the tsunami wave, and some stations that were in shadowed areas did not measure a strong signal despite being in an area of measurable impact. Meteotsunamis pose a threat to the U.S. coastline, and without high-resolution observations and models these events cannot be quantitatively forecasted. NOAA does not currently have an operational warning system but the June 2013 meteotsunami provides an excellent case study for identifying setup conditions and timing of an impact from a reflected wave.",

In other hydrology disciplines, hydrological processes are commonly observed in environments (e.g. streamflow, infiltration) or easily demonstrated in labs (e.g. Darcy’s column). It is relatively difficult to demonstrate ecohydrological concepts and processes (e.g. soil-vegetation water relationship) in teaching. In this presentation, we report examples of using some advanced techniques to illustrate ecohydrological concepts, relationships, and processes, with measurements based on a native vegetation catchment in South Australia.

            "abstract": "Traditional understanding views secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in the atmosphere as continuous gas-phase oxidation of precursors such as isoprene, aromatics or alkanes. Recent research found that these oxidation products are also highly water soluble. It is further understood that the liquid-phase of cloud droplets as well as deliquesced particles could mediate SOA formation through chemistry in the aqueous-phase. While the effect of multi-phase processing has been studied in detailed for specific compounds like glyoxal or methylglyoxal, an integrated approach that considers the large number of individual compounds has been missing due to the complexity involved. In our work we explore the effects of multi-phase processing on secondary organic aerosol from an explicit modeling perspective.\nVolatility and solubility determine in which phase a given molecule will be found under given atmospheric conditions. Volatility has already been used to simplify the description of SOA formation in the gas-phase in what became known as the Volatility Basis Set approach (VBS). Compounds contributing to SOA formation are grouped by volatility and then treated as a whole. A number of studies extended the VBS by adding a second dimension like oxygen to carbon ratio or the mean oxidation state. In our work we use functional groups as second dimension.\nUsing explicit oxidation chemistry modeling (GECKO-A) we derive SOA yields as well as their composition in terms of functional groups for commonly used precursors. We then investigate the effect of simply partitioning functional-group specific organic mass into cloud droplets and deliquesced aerosol based on their estimated solubility. Finally we apply simple chemistry in the aqueous-phase and relate changes in functional groups to changes in volatility and subsequent changes in partitioning between gas- and aerosol-phase.\nIn our presentation we will explore the sensitivites of the multi-phase system in a box model setting with realistic environmental conditions. We will present the then-current state of our efforts to include this new concept into a regional-scale chemistry-transport-model (WRF-Chem) to evaluate its impacts under realistic conditions.",

            "abstract": "The potentially stabilizing effects of forest cover in respect of slope stability have been the subject of many studies in the recent past. Hence, the effects of trees are also considered in many deterministic landslide susceptibility models. TRIGRS 2.0 (Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability; USGS) is a dynamic, physically-based model designed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility in space and time. In the original version the effects of forest cover are not considered. As for further studies in Vorarlberg (Austria) TRIGRS 2.0 is intended to be applied in selected catchments that are densely forested, the effects of trees on slope stability were implemented in the model. Besides hydrological impacts such as interception or transpiration by tree canopies and stems, root cohesion directly influences the stability of slopes especially in case of shallow landslides while the additional weight superimposed by trees is of minor relevance. Detailed data on tree positions and further attributes such as tree height and diameter at breast height were derived throughout the study area (52 km²) from high-resolution airborne laser scanning data. Different scenarios were computed for spruce (Picea abies) in the study area. Root cohesion was estimated area-wide based on published correlations between root reinforcement and distance to tree stems depending on the stem diameter at breast height. In order to account for decreasing root cohesion with depth an exponential distribution was assumed and implemented in the model. Preliminary modelling results show that forest cover can have positive effects on slope stability yet strongly depending on tree age and stand structure.\nThis work has been conducted within C3S-ISLS, which is funded by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund, 5th ACRP Program.",

            "abstract": "Mangrove forests cover only about 1% of the Earth’s terrestrial surface, but they are amongst the highest carbon-storing and carbon-exporting ecosystems globally. Estimating 3-D mangrove forest parameters has been challenging due to the complex physical environment of the forests. In previous works, remote sensing techniques have proven an excellent tool for the estimation of mangrove forests. Recent experiments have successfully demonstrated the global scale estimation of mangrove structure using spaceborne remote sensing data: SRTM (InSAR), ICESat/GLAS (lidar), Landsat ETM+ (passive optical). However, those systems had relatively low spatial and temporal resolutions.\nPolarimetric SAR Interferometry (Pol-InSAR) is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing technique based on the coherent combination of both Polarimetric and interferometric observables. The Pol-InSAR has provided a step forward in quantitative 3D forest structure parameter estimation (e.g. forest canopy height and biomass) over a variety of forests. Recent developments of Pol-InSAR technique with TanDEM-X (TDX) data in mangroves have proven that TDX data can be used to produce global-scale mangrove canopy height and biomass maps at accuracies comparable to airborne lidar measurements.\nIn this study we propose to generate 12m-resolution mangrove canopy height and biomass estimates for the coastline of Mozambique using Pol-InSAR techniques from single-/dual-pol TDX data and validated with commercial airborne lidar. To cover all of the mangroves in the costal area of Mozambique, which is about 3000 km, about 200 TDX data sets are selected and processed. The TDX height data are calibrated with commercial airborne lidar data acquired over 150 km2 of mangroves in the Zambezi delta of Mozambique while height and Biomass estimates are validated using in-situ forest inventory measurements and biomass. The results from the study will be the first country-wide, wall-to-wall estimate of mangrove structure and biomass at 12 m resolution.",

            "abstract": "Observations of the middle and lower cloud layers of Venus has established the water vapour mixing ratio there as ~ 30-35 ppm (Ignatiev et al. 1997), while more recent data suggests that the water vapor mixing ratio of the upper haze of Venus is ~ 1 ppm (Bertaux et al. 2007). The transition region between these two regimes, the upper cloud, is an active site of photochemistry and production of sulfuric acid, which occurs through the formation of SO3 from the oxidation of SO2, and subsequent reactions between SO3 and water. These reactions have been shown by Parkinson et al. (2014a, submitted) as capable of causing an order of magnitude decrease of the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper cloud and upper haze if the SO2 mixing ratio at the upper cloud base were increased by only ~20%, as the resulting high SO3 concentrations rapidly react with any available water to form sulfuric acid. The opposite is true when water is in high abundance. This is likely to have profound effects on the sulfuric acid clouds and hazes themselves, as 1) the depletion of either species will decrease the production rate of sulfuric acid and 2) the saturation vapor pressure of the cloud droplets increases with decreasing water fraction, and thus a \"drying\" of the clouds may result in decreased cloud thickness. In this work we will use the Venus microphysical cloud models of Gao et al. (2014) and Parkinson et al. (2014b, submitted) to simulate the sulfuric acid clouds and hazes of Venus from 40 to 100 km altitude and evaluate how their structure and particle sizes depend on the background water vapor profile and sulfuric acid production rate as determined by Parkinson et al. (2014a, submitted). We also show how they respond to transient episodes of increased/decreased SO2/H2O mixing ratios and discuss the plausibility of possible causes, such as volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "Many ophiolitic mélanges distribute in the West Junggar, NW China. They are fault-contacted with Carboniferous turbidites with mostly NE trend and some NS trend with ages mostly Ordovician-Silurian and some Late Devonian. The boundary faults and the foliation inside the mélanges are of high-angle or nearly vertical. The NE trend ophiolitic mélange belts were structurally emplaced into the Carboniferous strata mainly by dextral transpressive deformation, but the NS trend ophiolitic mélange belts mainly by lateral extrusion deformation or pure shearing, suggesting a\nuniform\nstress field of nearly EW compression controlled the emplacements. The tectonic relationship between the ophiolitic mélanges and the Carboniferous turbidites imply that the ophiolitic mélanges are the main components of the basement of the Carboniferous strata. The geophysical data also reveal that high gravity, high magnetic and medium resistivity exist under the Carboniferous strata, matching well to the distribution of the ophiolitic mélanges on the surface. The\nneodymium\nmodel ages (TDM) of widely distributed Late Carboniferous-Permian granites are mostly between 0.352-0.923Ga and concentrate in 0.45-0.6Ga with positive eNd(t) mostly between 5~10, suggesting the Early Paleozoic rocks as the main magma source, consistent with the age of the ophiolitic mélanges, also coinciding with the conclusion of the ophiolitic mélanges as the basement of the Carboniferous strata.\nThe Carboniferous turbidites primarily formed in residual basin. Early Permian terrestrial coarse molasses deposits unconformitily cover on the Carboniferous turbidites, suggesting the residual basin closed in Late Carboniferous. The accretionary complex or residual oceanic crust emplaced into the overlying Carboniferous turbidites through the dextral transpression or lateral extrusion due to EW convergent when the residual basin closed.\nThe tectonic juxtaposition relationship between the ophiolitic mélanges and the younger lateral strata with same stratigraphic system suggests that the ophiolitic mélange belts do not separate different tectonic palaeogeographic or stratigraphic divisions. The traditional understanding of the ophiolitic mélange belt as plate or terrane boundary should be carefully to apply to the West Jungar.",

Ultracarbonaceous Antarctic micrometeorites (UCAMMs) discovered in the Japanese and French micrometeorite collections could be representatives of these CHON particles [Nakamura et al., 2005; Duprat et al., 2010]. On the other hand, samples from comet 81P/Wild 2 brought back in 2006 by the Stardust mission contain a large diversity of minerals with varying degrees of primitivity. Organic compounds were only found in small amounts, most probably as a result of degradation during high speed capture of the samples, but several forms of organic matter were identified at the sub-micron level, and glycine was also detected [Brownlee, 2014 and references therein]. The complex shape of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggests that even more diversity in dust composition could be expected than in previous analyses of cometary samples.\nThe COSIMA dust analyzer on the ROSETTA spacecraft will analyze the dust from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko [Kissel et al., 2009 and Hilchenbach et al., this conference]. In the high mass resolution time-of-flight spectra of COSIMA, the inorganic compounds are generally resolved from the organic contributions. We will report on the first results on the inorganic part of the spectra, and on its association with the organic phases [see Briois et al., this conference].\n",

In this work we present results from ab-initio molecular dynamics in combination with the two-phase coexistance method to study properties of a system of MgSiO3 liquid coexisting with crystalline MgO at conditions of the deep lower mantle. During incongruent melting the crystal may either grow via partial freezing of the liquid or shrink via partial melting at a given temperature and pressure. The melting process can be studied using the two-phases method where liquid and solid are in contact at a given temperature and pressure and so under thermodynamic equilibrium. We characterise the composition and densities of the resultant solid and liquid phases, provide chemical potentials of the liquid phase and study the structural and dynamical properties of the melt. In addition, we discuss the performance of alternative computational methods applied to the study of incongruent melting in silicate systems where long simulation times and a large number of atoms are usually needed. Finally, we discuss the implication of our findings for the evolution of the Earth's interior.",

Borehole stability modeling, geophysics, shale oil and shale gas reservoirs, and underground storage of CO2 in shale formations are some of these potential applications to name a few. The growing interest in these reservoirs, as a source for hydrocarbons production, has resulted in an increasing demand for fundamental rock property data.\nThese rocks are known to be non-linear materials. There are many factors, including induced cracks and their orientation, partial saturation, material heterogeneity and anisotropy, plasticity, strain rate, and temperature that may have an impact on the geomechanical behaviour of these shales.Experimental results and theoretical considerations have shown that the elastic moduli are not single-value, well-defined parameters for a given rock. Finding suitable values for these parameters is of vital importance in many geomechanical applications.\nIn this study, shale heterogeneity and its geomechanical properties are explored through an extensive laboratory experimental program. A series of hydrostatic and triaxial tests were performed in order to evaluate the elasticity, viscoplasticity, yielding and failure response of Marcellus shale samples as a function of pressure and temperature. Additional characterization includes mineralogy, porosity, and permeability measurements. The shale samples were taken from a Marcellus outcrop at State Game Lands 252, located in Lycoming and Union counties, Allenwood, Pennsylvania. Laboratory experiments have shown that creep behaviour is highly sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, the non-linear nature of these rocks reveals interesting behaviour of the elastic moduli highly dependent on stress history of the rock. Results from cyclic triaxial tests point out the different behaviour between 1st-loading and unloading-reloading cycles. Experimental results of these Marcellus shales are compared with other shales from different plays in the United States.",

            "abstract": "The polar orbiting Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's (LRO) Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) carried out an atmospheric campaign during the month of December 2013, at the same time the Lunar Atmospheric and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission was sampling the lunar exosphere in a retrograde equatorial orbit. Observations of the lunar exosphere were performed by LAMP during a solar \"beta-90\" geometry, i.e. riding along the lunar terminator. During this geometry, the LAMP nadir-pointed line of sight to the nightside surface also includes illuminated columns of foreground emissions from exospheric species, which is invaluable in the study of the tenuous lunar exosphere. Other types of maneuvers to probe the lunar exosphere were also performed by LAMP/LRO during this campaign. During backward pitch slews, the LRO spacecraft was pitched to look opposite its direction of motion to a point just inside the limb in the nightside region around the polar terminator. Forward pitch slews were also obtained, and the angles of 63 deg or 77 deg from nadir were set depending on the polar region observed. Finally, during lateral roll slews, LRO rotated by ~60 deg towards the nightside limb, maximizing the amount of illuminated atmosphere in the foreground probed by the LAMP field of view. We extract day to day density variations on helium and/or upper limits for numerous other species that were accessible to both LAMP and LADEE (e.g., Ar, Ne, O, and H2). Moreover, constraints on helium density will complement measurements of solar wind alpha particles (He++) from the ARTEMIS (Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, & Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun) mission. This comparison will provide a comprehensive picture of composition, abundance, and spatial and temporal variations of volatiles of the lunar exosphere, combining equatorial (LADEE) and polar (LAMP) measurements for the first time. Volatiles in the lunar exosphere, especially water, are of paramount importance in the context of lunar exploration, since the compelling hypothesis of their storage in Permanently Shaded Regions (PSRs) was advanced in the second half of the last century.",

            "abstract": "The M 8 1556 Huaxian earthquake that occurred in the Weihe graben, Shaanxi Province, China, is the deadliest earthquake in recorded history, with an estimated death toll of 830,000. Despite extensive damage reports from government documents of the Ming dynasty, the geological story of this normal-faulting earthquake is relatively poorly described. A discontinuous ~8 metre scarp along the frontal faults of the Weinan Platform and Huashan Range may have formed in the 1556 earthquake, but whether it did so, or whether it is a cumulative scarp formed in multiple events, is a question that is key to determining the recurrence interval and rates of active faulting. In this study we combine geodetic and geological observations in order to answer this question.\nWe have used Pleiades stereo imagery to produce a 1-metre resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the area where the Chishui River cuts through the eastern segment of the Weinan Platform frontal fault. More than three thousand GPS measurements were collected in the field using network Real Time Kinematic GPS in order to calibrate and assess the Pleiades DEM. After making use of a few ground control points, the mean difference between the Pleiades DEM and GPS is 0.1 metres with a standard deviation of 0.9 metres. At least three river terraces (T1, T2 and T3) can be identified on the DEM. The youngest terrace (T1) postdates the last fault movement. Offset of the T2 forms the 8 metre scarp; the older terrace (T3) is offset by ~13 metres across the fault. Charcoal was collected from ancient soil and loess layers that overlie gravels in all three terraces.\nThe surface geomorphology, along with a fault exposure in a nearby quarry excavation, allows us to conclude that the 8-metre scarp was formed in a single earthquake. Furthermore, it appears that the 1556 event was preceded by a rupture of similar magnitude, sometime in the period 2000-6000 ka. The Huaxian fault is a relatively slow-moving fault, and in the Holocene has failed in large-magnitude, large stress-drop earthquakes separated by long intervals of time.",

            "abstract": "Ireland and its continental shelves are located in a structurally complex part of the European North Atlantic Margin. The northern part of the margin (e.g. the Rockall Basin) is considered to be magma-rich, whereas the southern part of the margin (e.g. the Porcupine Basin) is relatively magma-poor. Despite this fundamental difference, the Rockall and Porcupine regions have much in common: both have a dominant structural grain inherited from the Caledonian Orogeny, and were variably deformed by Variscan compression and multiple phases of extension and rifting. Rifting culminated in continental breakup between the North American and European plates in the Paleogene. Following continental breakup, both regions were further deformed by phases of Cenozoic compression, which have been attributed to many different causes, including the Alpine Orogeny.\nHydrocarbon exploration in the region has met with limited success. This is in part due to the complex structure of the margin, and a number of persisting questions regarding the location, age, and nature of potential source and reservoir rocks, and the timing and evolution of structural traps. This study aims to re-evaluate the structural framework that underpins hydrocarbon exploration in the region. The study is based on a compilation of georeferenced maps and cross-sections, a newly merged set of marine gravity and aeromagnetic data, as well as published seismic and public domain data gravity and magnetic data, all of which are integrated in GIS. The integration of seismic and potential field data allows us to use the strengths of these different geophysical methods to investigate the crustal architecture from the seabed to the Moho. Quantitative interpretation of the crust is achieved by 2D gravity and magnetic modelling along key B.I.R.P.S seismic lines in the Rockall and Porcupine basins. These models are used to highlight similarities and differences between these areas and to suggest how the structure of the Irish Margin has developed through the Late Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "Since the start of the McMurdo Fe lidar campaign, large-amplitude (~±30 K), long-period (4 to 9 h) perturbations with upward propagating Inertia Gravity Wave (IGW) signatures are frequently observed in the MLT temperature data. Despite its frequent appearance, such type of wave was neither widely observed, nor well understood in the past, primarily due to a paucity of measurements in Polar Regions. At McMurdo, the simultaneous observations of such waves using lidar, radar and airglow imager can provide their unique 3-D intrinsic wave-propagation properties, which are greatly needed for understanding their sources and potential impacts. This study presents the first coincident observation of IGWs by lidar, radar and airglow imager in the Antarctic mesopause region. On 11 June 2013, coherent wave structures with observed period of ~ 5 h and vertical wavelength of ~20 km were observed in both the Fe lidar temperature and MF radar winds. Derived from hodograph analysis, the wave has a horizontal wavelength of ~1200 km and propagates southward at ~60 m/s. The phase relationship between the temperature and winds is in good agreement with the gravity wave polarization relationship. Similar wave structures were also observed in the airglow keograms. The results of the horizontal propagation information obtained from appropriate filtering and applying a non-linear least-square fit of the keograms are similar to those estimated from the combined lidar-radar hodograph analysis. A Monte Carlo sampling method is used to perform all the non-linear fits of the observations to the linear gravity wave models.",

The chemistry that these species are known to take part in include ozone-destruction cycles. Despite the potentially large perturbation to the chemistry of the troposphere that eruptions may cause the magnitude of such impacts on global and regional scales is largely unknown.\nWe used WRF-Chem to investigate the influence of Mount Etna on the tropospheric chemistry of the Mediterranean region. The chemistry of bromine, chlorine and mercury has been added to the chemical mechanism CBMZ and we have coupled WRF-Chem with the emissions program PrepChem. We developed a simple parameterisation of the key multiphase reaction cycles involving halogens. Comparison with published field data shows that the model is able to reproduce the bromine explosion phenomenon seen in spectroscopic investigations of volcanic plumes.\nFrom the model results we are able to determine a detailed picture of the chemistry of a volcanic plume; results are presented which show how the character of the volcanic plume evolves as it is advected downwind. We determine the magnitude of Mt. Etna's regional influence under typical conditions. We also present results which show how the variation in volcanic output, as well as meteorological variation within the region, can influence the extent of Mt. Etna's regional impact. As WRF-Chem is very flexible, we also performed model runs fir other volcanoes.. The model results are compared to satellite measurements of BrO and SO2 to improve our understanding of chemical processes in tropospheric volcanic plumes.",

            "abstract": "Large englacial features at the base of the ice sheet have been observed in recent radio echo sounding data in both Antarctica and Greenland. In Greenland such features are found in many places, especially in North Greenland, where high availability in basal water is likely. In the interior of Antarctica such features are observed in the Dome A region, a slow flowing region, where the alpine like relief of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains allows for basal melt in the deeply incised valleys. All these observed englacial features resemble plumes, which can, in terms of their geometric structure, be reproduced by modelling internal isochrone layers by including basal ice-accretion. However, to produce such large freeze-on features sufficiently high basal accretion rates are needed.\nHere we investigate the conditions required, in terms of water flux and bed slope, to obtain the needed basal accretion rates through the process of Clausius-Clapeyron cooling of basal water. Furthermore, we examine the geometrical aspect of the plumes and the related englacial isochrone pattern to understand the relationship with ice flux. We use the 3-D numerical model BASISM to calculate temperature, melt water flux and ice flux. We find that for most areas where plumes are found the relationship between water flux and steep ascending slopes in the basal topography along flow is sufficient to explain the accretion rates through the process of Clausius-Clapeyron cooling. Further, we find that the plume height for a given accretion rate is inversely related to the ice flux, matching areas with reduced local ice flux showing high plumes. Since ice rheology affects the ice flux and in addition, might be affected by basal freeze-on, we use the ELMER/ICE model to explore the effect of ice fabric evolution and internal temperature variation.",

            "abstract": "Barite (BaSO4) is a highly stable and widely-distributed mineral found in magmatic, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks (of all ages), as well as in soils, aerosol dust, and extraterrestrial material. Today, barite can form in a variety of settings in the oceans (hydrothermal, cold seeps, water column, sediments) and on the continents – where supersaturation and precipitation of barite typically occurs from the mixing of fluids – one containing Ba and another containing sulfate. Sulfur (δ34S) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes together with 87Sr/86Sr and stable Sr-isotopic signatures (δ88/86Sr) of modern authigenic continental barite are compared to modern pelagic marine barite and marine hydrothermal and cold seep barite to investigate the potential for their combined use to indicate mode of barite formation. The 87Sr/86Sr in barite cleary identifies the source of fluid for any particular type of barite (as previously noted, see Paytan et al., 2002). The highest (most radiogenic) 87Sr/86Sr values are measured in continental barite samples. There is no unique δ88/86Sr signature for any particular type of barite, but coretop marine (pelagic) barite has a consistent value measured from samples collected in different ocean basins. The highest and lowest δ88/86Sr values were measured in continental barite samples. The combination of isotopic systems result in unique δ88/86Sr and δ18O relationships and distinct δ88/86Sr and δ34S relationships for different types of barites investigated. Data suggest that the combined use of these metal and nonmetal isotopic measurements in barite could be useful as a new geochemical proxy to identify mode of barite mineralization for use in earth science applications including understanding ancient barite deposits.",

We examine the morphological and sedimentological changes in the Upper Missouri River, between the Garrison Dam in ND (operational in 1953) and Oahe Dam in SD (operational in 1959) (the Garrison Dam segment). Through historical aerial photography, stream gage data, and cross sectional surveys, we demonstrate that the influence of the upstream dam is still a major control of river dynamics when the backwater effects of the downstream reservoir begin. We propose a conceptual model of how interacting dams could affect river morphology, resulting in distinct and recognizable geomorphic sequences that we term “Inter-Dam Sequence”. Based on previous research on the geomorphic adjustment and recovery of sediment loads downstream from large dams, we define a distance criterion for dam interaction. We use this criterion to demonstrate that there are more than 400 reaches on large rivers in the United States that could be geomorphically controlled by dam interactions, similar to the Garrison Dam segment.",

In addition, there is a significant change in the spectral location of the 2.1 μm shortwave-infrared channel used by MODIS for cloud microphysical retrievals.\nThe climate science community will face an interruption in the continuity of key global cloud data sets once the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua sensors cease operation. Given the instrument differences between MODIS EOS and VIIRS S-NPP/JPSS, we discuss methods for merging the 14+ year MODIS observational record with VIIRS/CrIS observations in order to generate cloud climate data record continuity across the observing systems.\nThe main approach used by our team was to develop a cloud retrieval algorithm suite that is applied only to the common MODIS and VIIRS spectral channels. The suite uses heritage algorithms that produce the existing MODIS cloud mask (MOD35), MODIS cloud optical and microphysical properties (MOD06), and NOAA AWG/CLAVR-x cloud-top property products. Global monthly results from this hybrid algorithm suite (referred to as MODAWG) will be shown. Collocated CALIPSO comparisons will be shown that can independently evaluate inter-instrument product consistency for a subset of the MODAWG datasets.",

The dam is operated for flood control, hydropower production and irrigation. The flood control space reserved in the reservoir each year during the monsoon season limits the ability to supply hydropower and irrigation services. Allocating a variable amount of flood control space based on a pre-season forecast of the peak event flood volume, or of the flood volume over a specific duration is consequently, more useful than a prediction of the annual maximum peak flow for this dam and for other flood control dams.\nThe joint distribution of annual peak flow, the corresponding flood volume, and the event duration is investigated based on the copula theory. A statistical model is developed for the conditional prediction of this joint distribution using pre-season climate indicators. The potential for the guidance for water management in the Yangtze River basin and for insights to the design of the large flood control reservoirs in the future is illustrated.",

            "abstract": "Basin-3, a major drainage basin of the Austfonna icecap in NE-Svalbard switched to full surge mode in autumn 2012 after a multiannual, stepwise acceleration of its northern branch. A time series of velocity maps from repeat TerraSAR-X acquisitions revealed a maximum speed at the terminus of >18 m d-1 around the turn of the year 2012. The frontal ablation of Basin-3 was estimated to 4.2±1.6 Gt a−1 between April 2012 and May 2013, tripling the total dynamic mass loss from the largest icecap in the Eurasian arctic.\nToday, TerraSAR-X, Radarsat–2 and GPS data show that the surge is still ongoing. While the speed at the calving front dropped to 10 m d-1 until July 2014, areas further inland continued to accelerate after the climax, and 10 m d-1 were also measured ~20 km inland in summer 2014. This development will be further investigated by exploiting a time series of velocity maps based on Radarsat-2 Fine Beam data starting from July 2014, which will, other than the TerraSAR-X data, cover almost the entire fast flowing part of the basin. By combining both datasets we will extend the estimation of the frontal ablation and related sea-level rise contribution of the Basin-3 surge.",

LASP has a long history, in particular, of making space-based measurements of the solar irradiance, which serves as crucial input to several areas of scientific research, including solar-terrestrial interactions, atmospheric, and climate. LISIRD, the LASP Interactive Solar Irradiance Data Center, serves these datasets to the public, including solar spectral irradiance (SSI) and total solar irradiance (TSI) data.\nThe LASP extended metadata repository, LEMR, is a database of information about the datasets served by LASP, such as parameters, uncertainties, temporal and spectral ranges, current version, alerts, etc. It serves as the definitive, single source of truth for that information. The database is populated with information garnered via web forms and automated processes. Dataset owners keep the information current and verified for datasets under their purview.\nThis information can be pulled dynamically for many purposes. Web sites such as LISIRD can include this information in web page content as it is rendered, ensuring users get current, accurate information. It can also be pulled to create metadata records in various metadata formats, such as SPASE (for heliophysics) and ISO 19115. Once these records are be made available to the appropriate registries, our data will be discoverable by users coming in via those organizations.\nThe database is implemented as a RDF triplestore, a collection of instances of subject-object-predicate data entities identifiable with a URI. This capability coupled with SPARQL over HTTP read access enables semantic queries over the repository contents.\nTo create the repository we leveraged VIVO, an open source semantic web application, to manage and create new ontologies and populate repository content. A variety of ontologies were used in creating the triplestore, including ontologies that came with VIVO such as FOAF. Also, the W3C DCAT ontology was integrated and extended to describe properties of our data products that we needed to capture, such as spectral range.\nThe presentation will describe the architecture, ontology issues, and tools used to create LEMR and plans for its evolution.",

            "abstract": "By means of case studies we explore key elements of the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system associated with repetitive substorm activity during persistent strong forcing by ICMEs. Our approach consists of a combination of the magnetospheric and ionospheric perspectives on the substorm activity. The first aspect is the near-Earth plasma sheet with its repetitive excitations of the substorm current wedge, as monitored by spacecraft GOES-10 when it traversed the 2100-0300 MLT sector, and its coupling to the westward auroral electrojet (WEJ) centered near midnight during the stable interplanetary (IP) conditions. The second aspect is the excitation of Bostrom type II currents maximizing at dusk and dawn and their associated ionospheric Pedersen current closure giving rise to EEJ (WEJ) events at dusk (dawn). As documented in our study, this aspect is related to the braking phase of Earthward-moving dipolarization fronts-bursty bulk flows. We follow the magnetospheric flow/field events from spacecraft Geotail in the midtail (X = - 11 Re) lobe to geostationary altitude at pre-dawn MLTs (GOES 10). The associated M-I coupling is obtained from ground-satellite conjunctions across the double auroral oval configuration along the meridian at dusk. By this technique we distinguish between ionospheric manifestations in three latitude regimes: (i) auroral oval south, (ii) auroral oval north, and (iii) polar cap. Regime (iii) is characterized by events of enhanced antisunward convection near the polar cap boundary (flow channel events) and in the central polar cap (PCN-index events). The repetitive substorm activity is discussed in the context of the level of IP driving as given by the geoeffective IP electric field (E_KL), magnetotail reconnection (inferred from the PCN-index and spacecraft Wind at X = - 77 Re) and the storm SYM-H index. We distinguish between different variants of the repetitive substorm activity, giving rise to electrojet (AL)-plasma convection (PCN) events recurring at (i) 2 - 2.5 hrs (''sawtooth events''), and (ii) 20 - 40 min. intervals, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Iron isotopes show systematic changes in igneous rocks that have been ascribed to fractional crystallization, partial melting, as well as, diffusion effects. Layered mafic intrusions, such as the Paleoproterozoic Bushveld Igneous Complex, are ideally suited to investigate stable isotope fractionation arising principally by fractional crystallization. The upper 2.1km of the Bushveld Complex (Upper and Upper Main Zone, UUMZ) crystallized from a basaltic magma produced by a major recharge event, building up a sequence of tholeiitic, Fe-rich, gabbroic cumulate rocks that display systematic variations in mineralogy and mineral compositions consistent with fractional crystallization. Within this sequence, magnetite joins the liquidus assemblage at ∼260m, followed by olivine at 460m and apatite at 1000m. Here, we present iron isotope measurements of bulk cumulate rocks from the Bierkraal drill core of UUMZ of the western limb. Iron was chemically separated from its matrix and analyzed for δ56Fe (relative to IRMM- 014) with a Nu plasma MC-ICPMS at the University of California, Davis, using (pseudo-) high resolution and sample-standard bracketing. The δ56Fe values for Bushveld cumulates span a range from 0.04‰ to 0.36‰, and systematically correlate with the relative abundance of pyroxene + olivine, magnetite and plagioclase. Notably, the highest δ56Fe values are found in plagioclase-rich cumulates that formed prior to magnetite crystallization. δ56Fe is also high in magnetite-rich cumulates at the onset of magnetite crystallization, while subsequent cumulates exhibit lower and variable δ56Fe principally reflecting fractionation of and modal variations in magnetite, pyroxene and fayalitic olivine. The overall relationships for δ56Fe are consistent with positive mineral – liquid Fe isotope fractionation factors for magnetite and plagioclase, and negative to near zero values for pyroxene and olivine. These initial results are being integrated into a forward model of the Bushveld liquid line of descent and will be compared to complementary work on the Skaergaard intrusion.",

            "abstract": "Assessing writing assignments and providing students the opportunity to meaningfully revise the assignments are challenging for instructors of large enrollment science classes. We included two individual writing assignments and peer assessments as part of course assessment for a large Introduction to Environmental Science course. In order to facilitate the assessment, Calibrated Peer Review (CPR), a web-based application developed by UCLA that enables frequent writing assignments in any discipline and with any class size, was adopted. The CPR assignment process involved four steps: submitting a writing assignment, calibrating each student’s review skills, reviewing peers’ writing, and assessing one’s own writing assignment (self-assessment). A rubric was provided to guide students through each writing assignment and the same rubric was used in calibration, review, and self-assessment scoring. Once the instructors uploaded the writing prompts, rubrics, sample writings and answer keys into the CPR system, the CPR software fully directed all student activity (writing assignment submission, calibrations, reviews, and self-assessment). Students were able to view their results within the CPR program, including their self-calibration scores, reviewing scores, peers’ ratings and feedback, total earned scores, and self-assessment scores.  Surveys independently administered at the conclusion of the CPR assignments indicated that sixty to seventy-five percent of the students perceived that CPR was helpful in their learning, improved their writing and evaluation skills, and that the process of reviewing other students’ essays and their own essays was more helpful than the comments received from peers. These survey results are in agreement with the well-established educational research literature that shows the benefits of peer review and peer assessment to student learning. Our experience with CPR in a large enrollment science course indicates that thoughtful planning of the calibration writings and rubrics, beginning-of-course communication strategies regarding the relationship of the CPR activities to course goals and sufficient technical support to students are critical components to successful implementation.",

Black carbon that is coated with non-absorbing material absorbs more strongly than the same amount of black carbon in an uncoated particle, but there is a large discrepancy between absorption enhancement predicted by models and absorption enhancement observed in the atmosphere. Modeling studies and laboratory measurements find absorption enhancement (Eabs) greater than two for thickly coated particles, but ambient observations find only weak absorption enhancement (Eabs = 1–1.2). Through a detailed modeling study of black carbon populations, we show that unrealistic representations of particle composition lead to large errors in modeled absorption. For example, if particles in BC populations were assumed to have uniform composition, similar to the representation applied in modal models, absorption enhancement was overestimated by as much as a factor of two relative to more realistic treatments of particle composition. By applying realistic distributions of particle composition from a particle-resolved aerosol model, we found weak absorption enhancement at low relative humidity (Eabs = 1–1.3), consistent with ambient observations that are performed at low relative humidity. On the other hand, we found strong absorption enhancement (Eabs > 1.8) in many locations if particles were modeled using the global variation in relative humidity.",

            "abstract": "Our Sun accelerates ions and electrons up to near-relativistic speeds in at least two ways; magnetic reconnection during solar flares is believed to produce the impulsive or 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs), while diffusive shock acceleration at fast coronal mass ejection – or CME–driven shock waves are thought to produce the larger gradual SEPs. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the properties (e.g., time variations, spectral behavior, longitudinal distributions, compositional anomalies etc.) of large SEP events, the relative roles played by many important physical processes remain poorly understood. These effects include variations in the seed populations, the geometry of the shock, the presence or absence of a preceding CME from the same active region, scattering by ambient turbulence or by self-generated Alfvén waves during acceleration and transport, and the direct presence of flare accelerated material at energies above ~10 MeV/nucleon. Observations from ACE, Wind & STEREO and theoretical studies have indicated that many of these effects are manifest in the spectral properties of H and other heavy elements. In this paper, we present a preliminary survey of the roll-over or break energies observed in the energy spectra of ~0.1-100 MeV/nucleon H-Fe nuclei in >80 large SEP events and determine how they vary with the ion’s Charge-to-Mass (Q/M) ratio. In particular, by combining in-situ SEP, solar wind, and magnetic field data from ACE and STEREO over the course of solar cycles 23 and 24 with numerical modeling, we attempt to understand why some SEP events exhibit spectral breaks that vary strongly with the ion’s Q/M ratio while others do not. We also discuss the potential roles played by the shock geometry and the presence or absence of self-excited Alfvén waves in the Q/M-dependence of the spectral break energies. Finally, we describe how by directly and repeatedly sampling the near-Sun environments where interplanetary scattering and transport effects are significantly reduced, measurements from the upcoming Solar Probe Plus (SPP) and Solar Orbiter missions will unravel the roles of injection, acceleration and transport in producing the Q/M-dependent SEP spectral breaks.",

            "abstract": "The sky is dynamic, from long lasting cloud systems to ethereal, fleeting formations. After years of observing the sky and growing our personal collections of cloud photos, we decided to take to social media to share pictures, as well as build and educate a community of cloud enthusiasts. We began a Facebook page, the Community Cloud Atlas, described as “...the place to show off your pictures of the sky, identify clouds, and to discuss how specific cloud types form and what they can tell you about current and future weather.” Our main goal has been to encourage others to share their pictures, while we describe the scenes from a meteorological perspective and reach out to the general public to facilitate a deeper understanding of the sky. Nearly 16 months later, we have over 1400 “likes,” spanning 45 countries with ages ranging from 13 to over 65. We have a consistent stream of submissions; so many that we decided to start a corresponding blog to better organize the photos, provide more detailed explanations, and reach a bigger audience. Feedback from users has been positive in support of not only sharing cloud pictures, but also to “learn the science as well as admiring” the clouds. As one community member stated, “This is not ‘just' a place to share some lovely pictures.” We have attempted to blend our social media presence with providing an educational resource, and we are encouraged by the response we have received. Our Atlas has been informally implemented into classrooms, ranging from a 6th grade science class to Meteorology courses at universities. NOVA's recent Cloud Lab also made use of our Atlas as a supply of categorized pictures. Our ongoing goal is to not only continue to increase understanding and appreciation of the sky among the public, but to provide an increasingly useful tool for educators. We continue to explore different social media options to interact with the public and provide easier content submission, as well as software options for managing a growing database.",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of the crust and lithosphere is to a large extent controlled by its effective viscosity. Typically, rheological parameters are estimated from laboratory experiments and extrapolated over ten orders of magnitude to geological conditions, which has significant uncertainties. In this study, we propose a method to constrain these parameters directly from geophysical observables. The method links lithosphere-dynamics models with geophysical observations (e.g. horizontal and vertical surface (GPS-) velocities, topography and gravity data). A Bayesian inversion strategy is employed to estimate probabilities of model parameters that affect the rheology of the lithosphere. As this requires many forward models (104 - 106), an efficient and parallel implementation is necessary, which we recently showed for 3D models with linear viscous rheologies (Baumann et al. 2014).\nHere, we examine how well this method is capable of resolving complex rheologies and address a few technical issues such as defining appropriate stopping criteria for models with a free surface. We use synthetic models of intra-oceanic subduction to demonstrate that the rheological parameters of the lithosphere can be recovered successfully even if rheologies are power-law viscous or plastic, provided that the temperature structure is known. A piece-wise linear lithospheric temperature parameterization as part of the inverse approach is shown to give reasonable results as well.\nFurthermore, we apply the method to cross-sections of the Himalaya where we consider different geological interpretations as end-member cases. For each end-member, we estimate the probabilities of their rheological structure and plasticity parameterisation and also obtain suitable temperature distributions. Our results indicate that the Indian mantle lithosphere has large effective viscosities whereas the Tibetan lower crust has small effective viscosities. This is consistent with many published modelling studies of the region.\nAcknowledgements\nFunding was provided by ERC Grant agreement #258830\n",

Extensive field monitoring programs and process studies by the Narragansett Bay Commission, Federal and State agencies, municipalities, and university groups have been measuring physical parameters, nutrient concentrations and other water quality parameters in the Bay and its tributaries, nutrient inputs from wastewater treatment facilities, and process kinetic parameters. We are using data for existing nutrient concentrations, river flow and wastewater treatment facility effluent flow to estimate nutrient loading for non-sampled days using the U.S. Geological Survey’s Load Estimator (LOADEST) software. The time-variable data so generated will be used as input to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s WASP\\EUTRO model linked with a calibrated three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). The primary objectives of the modeling effort are to simulate the effects of nutrient loading on dissolved oxygen concentrations and chlorophyll-a, an important parameter for water clarity and seagrass viability, to estimate the sensitivity of the Bay to changes in nutrient loading and freshwater inflow, and to explore the potential effects of management actions and other factors such as climate change on these water quality parameters in the Bay.",

            "abstract": "Carbonates are some of the most abundant rock forming minerals in the crust; carbonate dominated rocks form the bedrock of many populated areas and host seismogenic fault systems as well as energy resource reservoirs and aquifers. In many ways, the mechanical behaviors of silicate rocks and carbonate rocks are analogous; however, the ways in which the behaviors differ can be substantial. In particular, the ease of crystal plastic deformation at upper crustal conditions and the chemical effects of hydrothermal fluids can lead to significant divergence in the mechanical behavior of carbonate rocks compared to more commonly studied silicate rocks. To explore the chemical effects of pore fluids on the deformation of porous carbonate rocks, we ran hydrostatic and axial deformations in traditional triaxial configuration on Indiana Limestone (>98% calcite, ~16% porosity) at effective confining pressures from 10 to 50 MPa, temperatures from 23 to 75°C, and saturated with equilibrium and disequilibrium pore fluids. In-situ permeability measurements were made during tests. Over these pressure and temperature conditions, the inelastic behavior and failure modes of limestone samples change from localized shear failure to shear-enhanced compaction to cataclastic dilation. We find that elevated temperature and pore fluid saturation both have a weakening effect on the limestone, reducing yield strength and favoring yield by shear-enhanced compaction. Permeability is negatively correlated with axial deformation at all conditions. In addition, we find that the chemistry of the pore fluid has a significant effect on the mechanical behavior of the limestone, with disequilibrium pore fluid causing more pronounced weakening than equilibrium pore fluids. Microstructural observation of deformed samples shows that failure behaviors are controlled by the competition between microcracking and crystal plasticity.",

            "abstract": "One of the more surprising findings of the MESSENGER spacecraft is the confirmation that the smallest terrestrial planet has an internally generated, dipolar magnetic field, which is likely driven by a combination of thermal and compositional buoyancy sources. This observation places constraints on the thermal and energetic state of Mercury’s large iron core and on mantle dynamics because dynamo operation is strongly dependent on the amount of heat extracted from the core by the mantle. However, other observations point to several factors that should inhibit a present-day dynamo. These include physical constraints on a thin, possibly non-convecting mantle, as well as properties of liquid iron alloys that promote compositional stratification in the core.\nWe consider a range of self-consistent internal structures, core compositions and thermal evolution models that are also consistent with observational constraints, and assess the circumstances under which a dynamo is permitted to operate in Mercury’s core. We present the thermal evolution models, 1D parameterized convection models and planetary entropy calculations. We attempt to account for the large uncertainties on some parameters by considering various end member cases.\nWe examine the thermal and magnetic implications of a long-lived lateral temperature difference resulting from Mercury’s orbital resonance and how it may play a role in driving the planetary dynamo. We compare simulations of mantle heat flow using the ASPECT convection code to predictions from the parameterized models and produce heat flow maps at the CMB. To represent fluid dynamics and magnetic field generation inside Mercury’s core, a numerical dynamo model is performed by using the obtained heat flux maps.\nLastly, we also investigate the seismic observability of the different structural models of Mercury to determine the extent to which any future single-seismometer mission will be able to provide alternative insights into Mercury's internal dynamics.\nThis study was initiated at the 2014 CIDER summer program on the dynamics of planetary interiors.",

            "abstract": "The crystalline complex and overlying sedimentary sequences in southern and central Sinai are highly dissected by numerous faults, shear systems, and dikes, hereafter referred to as discontinuities. Understanding the distribution of these discontinuities, their cross cutting relations, and the hydraulic gradient gives clues as to the distribution of water resources in the area. In the study area, extensional tectonics has been active as early as the Precambrian era as evidenced by the widely distributed dikes, bimodal volcanics, and dip-slip faults and shear zones of varying ages. These extensional tectonics and associated structural elements enhance the porosity and permeability of Sinai’s basement and overlying sedimentary sequences. To investigate the impact of the discontinuities on groundwater flow, the following steps were conducted: 1) the spatial and temporal precipitation events over the basement complex were identified from TRMM data; 2) observations extracted from temporal change in backscattering coefficient in radar (Envisat ASAR radar scenes) were used to identify water-bearing discontinuities; 3) the discontinuities were delineated using false color images that were generated from ASTER, SIR C and band ratio images, 4) field observations, Very Low Frequency (VLF), magnetic investigations, and stable isotopic analyses for groundwater samples were then applied to refine satellite-based observations and selections, test the validity of our satellite-based methodologies for locating sub-vertical discontinuities, and decipher their role as conduits or barriers for groundwater flow. Findings include: (1) sub-vertical faults and shear zones and highly weathered chilled margins of sub-vertical mafic dykes are water-bearing and are conducive for groundwater flow; felsic dykes are massive (do not promote groundwater flow), (2) groundwater flow generally follows the topographic relief, but locally the flow is controlled by the discontinuities, (3) discontinuities that are sub-parallel to groundwater flow direction act as preferred pathways for groundwater flow, whereas those that intersect groundwater flow directions at high angles act as barriers, raise groundwater level in the upstream, and locally they redirect groundwater flow to align with their trends.",

The occurrence of wind and water gaps along tear faults as well as elevated, distinct geomorphic surfaces along the fold axis show that Wheeler Ridge is actively growing over the kyr-timescale. The soils, tectonic geomorphology, structural modeling, and slip rate estimations were research foci in the 1990’s. Previous studies used total station surveys, contour maps, trenches (5m deep), RASCAL (RAster SCanning Airborne Lidar) scanning (~1pnt/1.54m, ~0.8 km2) on the forelimb, and aerial photographs to map distinct geomorphic surfaces & features, and generate topographic profiles perpendicular and parallel to the fault axis. In September 2014, a ~40 km2 area of high resolution (>4pnts/m2) light detection and ranging (lidar) data will be collected at Wheeler Ridge by the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) via a graduate student Seed grant. The new topographic data will enable us to build on previous studies of meter scale topography on the 10km fold and refine the geometric characterization of identified landforms that have been used to infer uplift, east fault tip propagation, and fold geometry in the last 250 kyr. These features include 5 geomorphic surfaces, stream channel geometry, alluvial terraces on the forelimb as well as wind and water gaps. This initial work will refine the representation of these features with high resolution topography as well as apply additional morphometric techniques to the hillslopes and channels, examine the spatial variation of landforms with independently determined uplift rates, create an updated, detailed geomorphic map of the 10km fold axis of Wheeler Ridge, and use previous subsurface modeling and these new constraints to inform an updated structural model for the growth history of Wheeler Ridge.",

            "abstract": "The widespread use of footprint estimates in conjunction with eddy covariance measurements illustrates that flux footprint modelling is an important and therefore commonly used data quality assessment tool in micrometeorology. Mostly, analytical and computationally inexpensive models are applied, although their assumption of homogeneous turbulence is usually not fulfilled in practical flux measurement conditions. This difficulty raises the question of how reliable footprint model results are at real-world flux sites. In order to evaluate the model’s performance, we conducted tracer experiments at a grassland site in Graswang, southern Germany. The site is part of the TERENO.net pre-Alps observatory and is located on a flat alluvial valley bottom (ca. 1 km wide), flanked by steep sides. An artificial tracer (methane) was released continuously over one averaging period from a surface source of 1m2 size. It was measured simultaneously with two eddy covariance systems which were arranged in different configurations downwind of the source. In this way we are able to evaluate the alongwind as well as the crosswind component of footprint models at real observation conditions. By comparing measured flux contributions from the tracer source to those predicted by footprint models the accuracy of the modelled 2-dimensional flux footprint can be assessed. We compare our measurements to estimates of analytical models as well as models based on Lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion. First results indicate that even analytical models perform adequately, except that they miss downwind source contributions which can be important.",

            "abstract": "Background seismicity has been relatively low at Mount St. Helens (MSH) following its last eruption in 2004-2008, with an average of 95 located M > 0 events per year. This is in marked contrast to the five years immediately following the 1980-86 eruptive period, when the yearly average rate was about 400 events. During that time there was clear evidence, in the form of rotated fault-plane solutions (FPS), that magma recharge was occurring at depths > 2 km. Despite lower seismicity rates and generally smaller earthquakes, an improved seismic network recorded data sufficient to allow for computation of 88 FPS for the period 2008-2013. These FPS show that stress fields at depths > 2 km were rotated in a manner similar to that seen post-1980-86, providing evidence that magma recharge is again occurring at MSH. A subtle trend towards slightly deeper earthquakes since 2011 is consistent with this hypothesis, as is previously reported outward motion on GPS stations that has been modeled with an inflationary source beneath the volcano at ~8-9 km depth.\nIn the summer of 2014, 70 broadband seismometers were installed within 50 km of MSH as part of the iMUSH experiment, greatly increasing the number of stations close enough to MSH to obtain good recordings of MSH-generated events. By the Fall AGU meeting we expect to have several months of data collected and processed from iMUSH stations. These data should greatly improve constraints on first-motion FPS and/or the number of events for which well-constrained FPS can be computed. In addition, the density of three-component stations may allow for computation of moment tensor solutions for larger events (M > 1), which typically occur ~20 times per year. This would allow us to assess whether recent MSH events have significant non-double-couple components, something that could indicate fluid involvement and that has previously only been seen during eruptive periods at MSH via short-term deployments of broadband stations.",

            "abstract": "Iran and Pakistan are countries frequently affected by destructive earthquakes, as for instance, the magnitude 6.6 Bam earthquake in 2003 in Iran with about 30 000 casualties, or the magnitude 7.6 Kashmir earthquake 2005 in Pakistan with about 80'000 casualties. Both events took place inland, but in terms of magnitude, even significantly larger events can be expected to happen offshore, at the Makran subduction zone. This small subduction zone is seismically rather quiescent, nevertheless a tsunami caused by a thrust event in 1945 (Balochistan earthquake) led to about 4000 casualties. Nowadays, the coastal regions are more densely populated and vulnerable to similar events. Furthermore, some recent publications discuss the possiblity of rather rare huge magnitude 9 events at the Makran subduction zone. We analyze the seismicity at the subduction plate interface and generate various synthetic earthquake catalogs spanning 100000 years. All the events are projected onto the plate interface using scaling relations and a tsunami model is run for every scenario. The tsunami hazard along the coast is computed and presented in the form of annual probability of exceedance, probabilistic tsunami height for different time periods and other measures. We show how the hazard reacts to variation of the Gutenberg-Richter parameters and maximum magnitudes.We model the historic Balochistan event and its effect in terms of coastal wave heights. Finally, we show how an effective tsunami early warning could be achieved by using an array of high-precision real-time GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers along the coast by applying it to the 1945 event and by performing a sensitivity analysis.",

            "abstract": "Arctic sea ice has been disappearing at a rapid rate and the impact this will have on the atmospheric general circulation and weather variability is still highly uncertain. Observational studies are hindered by the short observed record and the difficulty in isolating the dynamical role of sea ice, while modelling studies do not agree on many aspects of the response, particularly the atmospheric circulation. These disagreements may be due to a number of reasons including model differences, different magnitude and spatial patterns of the forcing, different treatment of sea surface temperatures, and natural variability. In this study, we present results from a sea ice perturbation experiment using the coupled Community Climate System Model version 4(CCSM4). By decreasing the albedo the sea ice, we were able to achieve an ice-free Arctic in September, in a simple, energetically self-consistent way that also involves year-round sea ice thinning and oceanic warming. The model was integrated for 800 years to find a robust equilibrium response to sea ice loss. Another 7 realizations of 50 years in length, differing only in their initial conditions, were used to investigate the transient response to rapid sea ice loss. In both the equilibrium and transient response, the general circulation response is very weak and the transient response is highly variable between realizations. We also find a reduction in surface temperature variability on sub-seasonal and interannual time scales over most of the mid and high latitudes with the largest changes being over the Arctic Ocean, associated with the increased maritime influence under low-ice conditions. We quantify this reduced variability, which extends into the midltatitudes and into the free tropospheric geopotential height variability.",

            "abstract": "We will present the development of the Greenhouse gas Laser Imaging Tomography Experiment (GreenLITE). GreenLITE consists of two laser based transceivers and a number of retro-reflectors to measure differential transmission (DT) of a number of overlapping chords in a plane over the site being monitored. The transceivers use the Intensity Modulated Continuous Wave (IM-CW) approach, which is a technique that allows simultaneous transmission/reception of multiple fixed wavelength lasers and a lock-in, or matched filter, to measure amplitude and phase of the different wavelengths in the digital domain. The technique was developed by Exelis and has been evaluated using an airborne demonstrator for the past 10 years by NASA Langley Research Center. The method has demonstrated high accuracy and high precision measurements as compared to an in situ monitor tracable to WMO standards, agreeing to 0.65 ppm +/-1.7 ppm.\nThe GreenLITE system is coupled to a cloud-based data storage and processing system that takes the measured chord data, along with auxiliary data to retrieve an average CO2 concentration per chord and which combines the chords to provide an estimate of the spatial distribution of CO2 concentration in the plane. A web-based interface allows users to view real-time CO2 concentrations and 2D concentration maps of the area being monitored. The 2D maps can be differenced as a function of time for an estimate of the flux across the plane measured by the system. The system is designed to operate autonomously from semi-remote locations with a very low maintenance cycle. Initial instrument tests, conducted in June, showed signal to noise in the measured ratio of >3000 for 10 s averages. Additional local field testing and a quantifiable field testing at the Zero Emissions Research and Technology (ZERT) site in Bozeman, MT are planned for this fall. We will present details on the instrument and software tools that have been developed, along with results from the local field testing and quantitative testing at ZERT. GreenLITE is being developed under a cooperative agreement between Exelis and the National Energy and Technology Laboratory (NETL) under the Department of Energy (DOE), contract # DE-FE0012574.

            "abstract": "Several distinct wake regimes are possible when considering atmospheric flow past a steep mountainous island. Of these regimes, coherent vortex shedding in low-Froude number flow is particularly interesting because it can produce laterally focused paths of counter rotating eddies capable of extending downstream for hundreds of kilometers (i.e., a von Kármán vortex street). Given the spatial scales of atmospheric von Kármán vortices, which typically lies on the interface of the meso-scale and the micro-scale, they are uniquely challenging to model using conventional numerical weather prediction platforms. In this presentation, we present high resolution (1-km horizontally) numerical modeling results using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, of multiple real-world von Kármán vortex shedding events associated with steep islands (e.g., Madeira island, Gran Canaria island, etc.). In parallel, we also present corresponding cloud-motion wind and cloud-top height measurements from the satellite-based Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument. The MISR stereo algorithm enables experimental retrieval of the horizontal wind vector (both along-track and cross-track components) at 4.4-km resolution, in addition to the operational 1.1-km resolution cross-track wind and cloud-top height products. These products offer the fidelity appropriate for inter-comparison with the numerically simulated vortex streets. In general, we find an agreement between the instantaneous simulated cloud level winds and the MISR stereoscopic winds; however, discrepancies in the vortex street length and localized horizontal wind shear were documented. In addition, the simulated fields demonstrate sensitivity to turbulence closure and input terrain height data.",

            "abstract": "The long-term slow slip event (LSSE) in the Tokai area, central Japan, from mid-2000 to mid-2005 [Suito and Ozawa (2009)], had continued five years, which was much longer than other LSSEs around the world [e.g. Schwartz and Rokosky (2007)]. After the termination of the SSE in 2005, no obvious long-term SSE was detected and that makes difficult to discuss a recurrence interval of the events. In order to reveal whether the event repeats or not, and if it repeats, to clarify the interval and a temporal and spatial change of the coupling and the LSSE, I analyzed a leveling data from 1981 to 1999 -- before the era of GNSS -- and deduced spatial patterns of the vertical crustal deformation rate.\nThe deduced rates show two sorts of spatial patterns and the patterns appear alternately. One of them resembles the pattern during the LSSE between 2000 and 2005. Summing up the results and accounting for the estimation errors, it is clear that there are at least three events in the last thirty years; 2000-2005 (already and well known event), 1987-1990, and around 1983. The 2000-2005 event is the biggest and longest one, while 1983 event is the smallest and shortest one in the three events. It suggests that the duration of the event is longer, the interval to the next event becomes longer, and that there are some relationships between the size, duration time, and the recurrence interval of the events. These features are very unique for the Tokai LSSEs compared with those in the other regions such as the Bungo Channel and Cascadia.",

            "abstract": "We present a quartz grain size dataset from ~250 mylonite samples spaced along 170 km of the Alpine Fault. The majority of the quartz (72% by area) is fairly coarse grained (>40 µm). The coarse grains show minor size variation along strike, changing from an average of 60-70 µm in the south to 40-60 µm in the north. We interpret that this quartz as recrystallized during steady-state ductile deformation at deep levels of the Alpine Fault. The recrystallized grain size piezometer for quartz (Stipp and Tullis, 2003) is accurate when applied to natural samples (Kidder et al., 2012) and predicts a peak stress of 30–60 MPa associated with this recrystallization. This value is comparable to a stress estimate from plate-scale numerical modeling of the Alpine Fault (Liu and Bird, 2002).\nA second population of finer recrystallized grains (4–40 µm) overprint the coarser grains in most samples. Recrystallized grains of this size typically comprise <10% of quartz by volume. The average grain size of this population increases significantly in the central region of the Alpine Fault where uplift rates are rapid and the geothermal gradient is elevated. Peak stress calculated in this area using the fine-grained population is ~60 MPa. In areas of slower uplift to the north and south, peak stress estimated from the fine-grained fraction is ~100–200 MPa. The fine grains record transient, high-stress events on the Alpine Fault since: 1) the stress magnitudes are significantly higher than estimated for steady state deformation on the Alpine fault and other major faults, 2) strain occurring at these high stresses was minimal based on the small extent of recrystallization and the fact that significant deformation at these stresses would generate a massive thermal anomaly that has not been identified, 3) high concentrations of the small recrystallized grains are found in the vicinity of pseudotachylites, 4) modeling by Ellis et al. (2004, 2006) predict transient stresses of these magnitudes during post-seismic deformation on major faults.",

This area is characterized by stable near-surface salinity stratification that is produced by the mixed layer dilution by local rainfall. Here the fresh and warm mixed layer is periodically disrupted by the gap wind-induced uplifts of colder and saltier water. Aquarius SSS data capture these high SSS events. In boreal winter when the intense gap winds are frequent, two tongues of anomalously salty water develop off the Gulfs of Tehuantepec and Papagayo. During that season the average SSS in the meridionally oriented Tehuantepec tongue is about 0.4 psu saltier than background SSS. The zonally elongated Papagayo tongue stands out even more strongly, being 1 to 2 psu saltier than SSS in the neighboring Panama Bight. The spatial locations and orientations of these salty tongues closely correspond to the locations and orientations of the cool SST tongues suggesting they have similar governing mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Two decades of hydroacoustic monitoring combined with in situ OBS and OBH experiments have identified nine seismically well-defined seafloor events at mid-ocean ridges with characteristics consistent with eruptive activity. The majority of these events occurred at fast and intermediate spreading ridges, where eruption recurrence rates are expected to be higher. Most have also been verified as eruptions through direct seafloor observations. This suite of crustal accretion events, when examined together, suggest patterns of activity that are influenced by both short and long term tidal forces. Tidal triggering of earthquakes in the mid-ocean ridge environment is well established, but until recently data has been lacking on the timing of seafloor eruptions with which to make statistically robust inferences. OBS and OBH earthquake data on the East Pacific Rise and Axial volcano both indicate a steady increase in the rate of seismic activity preceding an eruption, consistent with an increasing state of stress of the system. All of these observations are consistent with a model of crustal accretion that is sensitive to small perturbations in loading both in the short and longer term. Implications of this sensitivity will be presented along with observations to support it.",

            "abstract": "It is common to treat the lithosphere as a purely elastic plate parameterized by its flexural rigidity or effective elastic thickness if glacial isostatic adjustment processes are modeled. Furthermore, the viscous or viscoelastic mantle structure underlying the elastic plate is considered in a spherical, i.e. 1D symmetry. These assumptions downgrade the lithosphere to a thin plate where its rheological characteristics and structural features are neglected; but the assumptions are widely accepted as the horizontal extensions of the classical glacial loads in Scandinavia and North America are too large as to be sensitive to small-scale lateral variations of lithospheric strength. Likewise, the presently observed fading adjustment process due to the loading processes dating back several thousands of years is governed by the large-scale flow of mantle material.\nHowever, recent studies question this assumption and propose to consider the rheological structure of the lithosphere. To analyze the influence of the lithospheric rheology variations, we apply the spectral finite element code VILMA which allows to consider such effects and discuss the impact on the broad scale pattern of GIA.

            "abstract": "The success of an environmental contaminated project is often determined by the extent to which it is able to ascertain and control subsurface conditions. At present, site managers have limited tools to gain detailed information on the distribution of possible underground barriers or anomalous bodies. The technology employed in Taiwan to evaluate or confirm subsurface anomalies relies primarily on surface geophysical surveys, borehole drillings, or past records. Surface ground-penetrating radar \u0001GPR\u0002 survey is among the most popular of these methods. Surface GPR technique can be used in many ways, but this method is not always the best suited to Taiwan’s conditions. Surface GPR surveys are adversely affected by the conductivity of silty/clayey sediment and cultural noises. As a result, when surface GPR surveys are used, both detection and resolution of subsurface anomalies will decrease with depth. In order to overcome these obstacles, the use of borehole GPR \u0001BGPR\u0002 with a few boreholes may provide a more direct and effective way to detect an underground target. Recent improvement in the quality of BGPR contributes to the suitability of this type of survey work when implemented on construction sites. This paper ues the BGPR geophysical technology has been developed to overcome above limitations. The information of multi-wells logging could be used to interpret the permeability of subsurface, the dominate flow path and the hot-spot for evaluating the distribution of pollution and the efficiency of remediation in different time sequences.",

            "abstract": "Geophysical observations and high-velocity friction experiments suggest that mature faults weaken significantly during earthquakes. One proposed weakening mechanism is the breakdown of frictional contacts at a critical weakening temperature, a process known as flash heating. For bare surface sliding Rice [2006] showed that heat generation at frictional contacts triggers flash heating above a critical weakening velocity Vw of ~0.1 m/s. However, all faults generate a gouge layer at least a few millimeters wide, and the efficiency of flash heating in gouge is still unknown.\nBuilding on Beeler et al. [2008], we model flash heating in gouge by assuming that the total slip rate applied across the deforming zone is shared between multiple frictional contacts. Solving for the contact temperature we show that flash heating occurs when the strain rate exceeds a critical weakening strain rate controlled by the gouge properties. For a deforming zone 100 microns wide the equivalent Vw is ~4 m/s, making flash heating much less efficient in gouge than for bare surfaces.\nThe lower contact slip rate associated with distributed shear leads to longer contact lifetimes, increasing the thickness of the thermal boundary layer at a slipping contact W. We show that W can become comparable to the expected spacing between slipping contacts D. Accounting for this in a new model for contact temperature we show that when W » D flash heating begins at much lower slip rates, and friction decreases slowly as the slip rate increases.\nFinally we study the hysteresis commonly seen in bare surface experiments, with higher friction observed during acceleration than deceleration. Accounting for the sensitive dependence of Vw on sliding surface temperature Tf allows us to match some experimental data for both acceleration and deceleration over a wide range of slip rates. Building on this we discuss how flash heating may operate near the trailing edge of a rupture where temperatures are high and slip is decelerating.",

            "abstract": "The Marcellus shale is the largest shale gas resource in the United States and is found in the Appalachian region. Rapid large-scale development, and the scarcity of direct air measurements make the impact of Marcellus shale development on local and regional air quality and the global climate highly uncertain. Air pollutant and greenhouse gas emission sources include transitory emission from well pad development as well as persistent sources including the processing and distribution of natural gas. In 2012, the Aerodyne Inc. Mobile Laboratory was equipped with a suite of real-time (~ 1 Hz) instrumentation to measure source emissions associated with Marcellus shale development and to characterize regional air quality in the Marcellus basin. The Aerodyne Inc. Mobile Laboratory was equipped to measure methane, ethane, N2O (tracer gas), C2H2 (tracer gas), CO2, CO, NOx, aerosols (number, mass, and composition), and VOC including light aromatic compounds and constituents of natural gas. Site-specific emissions from Marcellus shale development were quantified using tracer release ratio methods. Emissions of sub-micron aerosol mass and VOC were generally not observed at any tracer release site, although particle number concentrations were often enhanced. Compressor stations were found to have the largest emission rates of combustion products with NOx emissions ranging from 0.01 to 1.6 tons per day (tpd) and CO emissions ranging from 0.03 to 0.42 tpd. Transient sources, including a well site in the drill phase, were observed to be large emitters of natural gas. The largest methane emissions observed in the study were at a flowback well completion with a value of 7.7 tpd. Production well pads were observed to have the lowest emissions of natural gas and the emission of combustion products was only observed at one of three well pads investigated. Regional background measurements of all measured species were made while driving between tracer release sites and while stationary at night. Median background mixing ratios of methane in Pennsylvania were observed to be 19.7 ppmv in the Southwestern part of the state and 20.5 ppmv in Northeast. The atmospheric background measurements provide information about the temporal and spatial characteristics of the Marcellus basin during the early stages of shale gas development.",

            "abstract": "The vegetation change from C3 forests to C4 grasslands in India, Pakistan, and Nepal during the late Miocene has been well documented, with previous records indicating that carbon isotope changes in paleosols from Pakistan and marine sediments from the Bengal Fan correspond with a C4 plant expansion. The uplift of the Tibetan plateau, monsoon variability, late Cenozoic cooling, and hydrological changes have all been suggested as potential causes of the C4 grassland expansion, but the ultimate driver of this shift is still unknown. We investigate whether hydrological change drove the expansion of C4 grasslands in the Siwaliks around 6 Ma. We analyzed leaf wax biomarkers in Bengal Fan deep-sea core sediments deposited between 20 Ma and 0.5 Ma from ODP sites 717 and 718, where terrestrial sediments from the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers are deposited on the sea floor. n-Alkane concentrations and carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios were measured to characterize the vegetation shift and to determine changes in rainfall isotopic composition and continental aridity. We found that an increase of carbon isotopic ratios in the long-chain alkanes occurred very abruptly between 6.35 and 5.5 Ma, indicating a change from a C3 woodland to a C4 grass-dominated environment. This ecosystem shift was accompanied by an increase in the δD values of the plant-wax biomarkers, although the δD shift begins almost 1 My prior to the vegetation shift. Source water isotopic values were computed from the plant-wax n-alkane δD values using a landscape apparent fractionation value based upon the n-alkane carbon isotope values and reasonable vegetation end members. The source water isotope shift is larger than the lipid shift and some combination of an increase in δD of rainfall or aridity preceded the vegetation shift, and may have played a role in driving the C4 vegetation expansion. Ongoing work comparing these results to published oxygen isotope values from sedimentary archives in the Siwaliks may help differentiate these two effects.",

            "abstract": "The largest emissions sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas and the primary component of natural gas, are the fossil fuel sector and microbial processes that occur in agricultural settings, landfills, and wetlands. Attribution of methane to these different source sectors has proven difficult, as evidenced by persistent disagreement between the annual emissions estimated from atmospheric observations (top-down) and from inventories (bottom-up). Given the rapidly changing natural gas infrastructure in North America, and the implications of associated rapid changes in emissions of methane for climate, it is crucial we improve our ability to quantify and understand current and future methane emissions. Here, we present evidence that continuous in-situ airborne observations of ethane, which is a tracer for fossil fuel emissions, are a new and useful tool for attribution of methane emissions to specific source sectors. Additionally, with these new airborne observations we present the first tightly constrained ethane emissions estimates of oil and gas production fields using the well-known mass balance method.\nThe ratios of ethane-to-methane (C2H6:CH4) of specific methane emissions sources were studied over regions of high oil and gas production from the Barnett, TX and Bakken, ND shale plays, using continuous (1Hz frequency) airborne ethane measurements paired with simultaneous methane measurements. Despite the complex mixture of sources in the Barnett region, the methane emissions were well-characterized by distinct C2H6:CH4 relationships indicative of a high-ethane fossil fuel source (e.g., “wet” gas), a low-ethane fossil fuel source (e.g., “dry” gas), and an ethane-free, or microbial source. The defined set of C2H6:CH4 that characterized the emissions input to the atmosphere was used in conjunction with the total ethane and methane fluxes to place bounds on the fraction of methane emissions attributable to each source. Additionally, substantial ethane fluxes from the Barnett and Bakken regions were observed (1% to 10% of estimated national ethane emissions), and emissions of these magnitudes may significantly impact regional atmospheric chemistry and air quality by influencing production of tropospheric ozone.",

            "abstract": "Mercury is the only inner solar system body other than Earth to possess an active core dynamo-driven magnetic field and the only planet with a small, highly dynamic magnetosphere. Measurements made by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft have provided a wealth of data on Mercury’s magnetic field environment. Mercury’s weak magnetic field was discovered 40 years ago by the Mariner 10 spacecraft, but its large-scale geometry, strength and origin could not be definitively established. MESSENGER data have shown that the field is dynamo-generated and can be described as an offset axisymmetric dipole field (hereafter OAD): the magnetic equator lies ~0.2 RM (RM = 2440 km) north of the geographic equator and the dipole moment is 2.8 x1019 Am2 (~0.03% that of Earth’s). The weak internal field and the high, but variable, solar wind ram pressure drive vigorous magnetospheric dynamics and result in an average distance from the planet center to the sub-solar magnetopause of only 1.42 RM. Magnetospheric models developed with MESSENGER data have allowed re-analysis of the Mariner 10 observations, establishing that there has been no measureable secular variation in the internal field over 40 years. Together with spatial power spectra for the OAD, this provides critical constraints for viable dynamo models. Time-varying magnetopause fields induce secondary core fields, the magnitudes of which confirm the core radius estimated from MESSENGER gravity and Earth-based radar data. After accounting for large-scale magnetospheric fields, residual signatures are dominated by additional external fields that are organized in the local time frame and that vary with magnetospheric activity. Birkeland currents have been identified, which likely close in the planetary interior at depths below the base of the crust. Near-periapsis magnetic field measurements at altitudes greater than 200 km have tantalizing hints of crustal fields, but crustal sources cannot be distinguished from core fields, nor cleanly separated from external fields. I will report on recent data acquired at altitudes as low as 25 km that have the potential to resolve these issues. The presence of remanent crustal fields would have profound implications for Mercury’s thermal and dynamical histories.",

            "abstract": "Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) from the prairie pothole region of North America are particularly vulnerable to loss and increasing urban, agricultural, and natural resource development pressures continue to place these wetlands at risk. Although small in area and low in surface hydrologic connectivity, GIWs provide important functions such as flood control and water purification and their loss has been recognized as a contributing factor to the eutrophication of Lake Winnipeg. Within Canada, GIW loss can be attributed to the lack of high-resolution wetland inventories and the lack of information about historic wetland loss rates. In this study, we tested an approach to estimate GIW loss by improving their detection and delineation. To initialize our work, a high-resolution wetland inventory was created using a novel approach that fuses LiDAR data (probability of wetland) with aerial photographs (to distinguish open water and wet meadow) for the Beaverhill watershed, a major tributary of the North Saskatchewan watershed. Our wetland mapping results validated our ability to detect wetlands on the landscape. Secondly, we applied a power law area-frequency function to an aerial photograph time series spanning the watershed’s natural climate variation range (1960 to present) to estimate historic wetland loss, with historic wetland loss determined via a break in slope in the power law function. Our analysis revealed ongoing loss of small GIWs in the watershed, despite the implementation of wetland policy measures to mitigate this loss. This ongoing GIW loss is particularly detrimental as it is concomitant with a loss in the important associated ecosystem functions of these GIWs, which has serious repercussions for downstream waters. Overall, our findings support a shift in wetland policies from area to function assessments that provide governments with tools to manage the potential consequences of wetland loss in terms of increased flooding and pollution of downstream waters.",

            "abstract": "With four centuries of solar evolution, the International Sunspot Number (SSN) forms the longest solar time series currently available. It provides an essential reference for understanding and quantifying how the solar output has varied over decades and centuries and thus for assessing the variations of the main natural forcing on the Earth climate.\nBecause of its importance, this unique time-series must be closely monitored for any possible biases and drifts. Here, we report about recent disagreements between solar indices, for example the sunspot sumber and the 10.7cm radio flux. Recent analyses indicate that while part of this divergence may be due to a calibration drift in the SSN, it also results from an intrinsic change in the global magnetic parameters of sunspots and solar active regions, suggesting a possible transition to a new activity regime.\nGoing beyond the SSN series, in the framework of the TOSCA (www.cost-tosca.eu/) and SOLID (projects.pmodwrc.ch/solid/) projects, we produced a survey of all existing catalogs providing detailed sunspot information (Lefevre & Clette, 2014:10.1007/s11207-012-0184-5) and we also located different primary solar images and drawing collections that can be exploitable to complement the existing catalogs. These are first steps towards the construction of a multi-parametric time series of multiple sunspot and sunspot group properties over more than a century, allowing to reconstruct and extend the current 1-D SSN series. By bringing new spatial, morphological and evolutionary information, such a data set should bring major advances for the modeling of the solar dynamo and solar irradiance. We will present here the current status of this work. The preliminary version catalog now extends over the last 150 years. It makes use of data from DPD (http://fenyi.solarobs.unideb.hu/DPD/index.html), from the Uccle Solar Equatorial Table (USET:http://sidc.oma.be/uset/) operated by the Royal Obeservatory of Belgium, the Greenwich Catalog (RGO:http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/) as well as the Kodaikanal white light data.",

            "abstract": "A significant fraction of world population is projected to experience increased water stress in response　to the combined effects of population growth and climate change. Some previous studies have suggested that high water stress had significant causality for civil war, and militarized conflict and trans-boundary water conflict in international river basin. On the other hand, some previous empirical analyses have found that institutionalization (e.g., specific provisions in trans-boundary freshwater treaties) in international river basin was associated with a lower risk of water conflicts during water scarcity. The purpose of this study is to identify these water conflict “hotspots”, integrating institutional and governance mechanisms of adaptations to impact of water stress. These adaptations is classified to 4 abilities and skills and then used to calculate the adaptive capacity. The adaptive capacity includes the way to manage water conflict effectively, plan to deal with　uncertainty in the future, alter current situation and create institutionalization with common perspective throughout the whole activities. This study identifies water conflict “hotspots” by combining high water stress areas projected by a global water resource model and a lower degree of the adaptive capacity. This study finds that 9 water conflict “hotspots” in Africa, Asia and South America.",

At present, the global 129I in surface water is about 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than pre-1990 levels. The anthropogenic 129I signal produced from industrial nuclear fuel reprocessing plants is known to be the primary source of 129I in marine surface waters of the Atlantic, and elevated 129I values are found globally.\nThe Great East Japan Earthquake and the induced tsunami in 2011 triggered the nuclear shutdowns, failures, and partial meltdowns of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The accident resulted in a series of radioactive material releases into the environment and spread out through atmospheric and ocean circulation. We will present 129I results of water samples collected weekly near Scripps Institution of Oceanography, San Diego, CA for the past 3 years. We also have several measurements collected a year apart from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, which represent west margin of Pacific Ocean, and from Alaska, Washington, and Oregon. By establishing 129I time series, we can observe the spread of 129I in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean that resulted from the accidental releases.",

            "abstract": "A radiative transfer solver (i.e. SHDOM) is the most powerful tool to extract simultaneous information of the atmosphere and the surface of Titan from the hyperspectral data of the VIMS imaging spectrometer onboard Cassini. However, the sheer amount of data (~40000 VIMS cubes containing several millions of spectra since the beginning of the mission) makes this approach too demanding in computational time.\nIn our analysis we use a radiative transfer model to create look-up tables for different values of the model’s parameters (geometry of the observation, surface albedo, aerosols opacity). We employ up-to-date information on gaseous spectral coefficients, aerosols’ optical properties and Titan’s climatology. These look-up tables, appropriately interpolated, are then used to minimize the observations and create simultaneous maps of surface albedo at the wavelengths of Titan’s spectral windows and of aerosols opacity. This approach allows the gain of a factor of several thousands in computational time and thus, for the first time, a truly massive treatment of VIMS data. This capacity of processing full mapping quickly will consent to monitor closely the global and local seasonal evolution of the atmosphere and the surface.\nWe will present the results of our method applied to some cases of interest. We will analyze several hyperspectral images of the Huygens landing site and show the comparison of our results with observations of other Cassini instruments. We will also investigate regions that have been observed multiple times at different Cassini flybys with different observational conditions, as the T13/T17 mosaic of the Atzlan area. The perspectives for atmospheric and surface seasonal monitoring will be highlighted.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 318 drilled an inshore to offshore transect of sites across the Antarctic Wilkes Land margin to provide a long-term record of Cenozoic Antarctic glaciation and its relationships with global climatic and oceanographic changes. The expedition recovered ~2000 m of high-quality middle Eocene–Holocene sediments from water depths between 400 and 4000 m at seven sites on the Wilkes Land rise and shelf. Sediment cores provide an insight into ~54 million years of Antarctic history starting with an ice-free subtropical east Antarctica during the late Eocene, and the first cooling during the middle Eocene, coeval with the first incursion of cold westward flowing waters across the southern Tasman Gateway. The cores also reveal the erosional consequences of the onset of the continent-wide glaciation during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, and its effect in rising sea level around the Antarctic coastlines. Starting in the earliest Oligocene (Oi-1 event), the icehouse sediments provide records of the subsequent waxing and waning of the ice sheets, sea ice, and ecosystems. These include times of past elevated temperatures and CO2 concentrations (i.e., the early Pliocene) and unprecedented seasonal to annual resolution records of the last deglaciation that began ~10,000 y ago. Wilkes Land records should be complimentary to those from Prydz Bay (ODP Legs 119 and 188) and the Ross Sea (ANDRILL, CRP), allowing for variations between different east Antarctic ice sheet sectors to be assessed, which will provide a better understanding of East Antarctica’s role in the past, present, and future global climate system.",

            "abstract": "One of the unresolved questions concerning fault deformation is the degree and cause of localisation of shear at depth beneath a fault. Geologic observations of exhumed shear zones indicate that whilst the motion is no longer planar, it can still be localised near the down-dip extension of the fault; however, the degree of localisation is uncertain. We employ simple analytic and numerical models to investigate the structural form of distributed shear beneath a strike-slip fault, and the relative importance of the physical mechanisms that have the potential to localise a shear zone. As we are concerned with long-term structure the model is time-averaged across the earthquake cycle, consisting of an idealised strike-slip fault within a rigid lid over a viscous layer.\nFor a depth dependent viscosity, η = η0 exp (−z/z0), we find a shear zone develops with a half-width δw ~ √z0 for small z0, where lengths are non-dimensionalised by the layer thickness (d km). Including a non-linear stress-strain rate relation (ε ̇ ∝ σn) scales δw by 1/√n, comparable to deformation length scales in thin viscous sheet calculations. We find that the primary control on δw is the depth dependence of viscosity arising from the increase in temperature with depth. As this relationship is exponential, scaling relations give a half-width that scales approximately as\nδ\nw\n≈T(z=1/2)\nRd\nnQβ\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n√\nkm,\nwith T (K), gas constant R (J/mol K), activation energy Q (J/mol), and geotherm β (K/km). Figure illustrates shear zones for a dry olivine composition. For n = 1 the shear zone half-width is δw = 4 km, which reduces to δw = 2.3 km when n = 3; other parameter choices consistent with laboratory-derived rheological properties give δwfrom 2-6 km.\nThe inclusion of shear-stress heating only reduces δw by an additional 5-25%, depending on the initial width of the shear zone; in the case of dry olivine with n = 3 we get δw = 1.8 km. This reduction in width occurs over a thermal diffusion timescale of ~5Ma; hence the full effect will only occur if the fault location is stationary relative to the viscous layer. Whilst the width of the shear zone may not decrease significantly, local temperature increases range from 50-300◦C with a viscosity reduction of up to 5 orders of magnitude and a concomitant reduction in driving stresses.",

            "abstract": "The fossil record of C4 grasses is extremely sparse so that much speculation on their importance through time is based solely on stable carbon isotope ratios in derived materials, such as tooth enamel, soil carbonate, leaf waxes. I present stable isotope analyses of modern large mammals from different 25 sites in East and Central Africa, primarily from national parks and national reserves, that show patterns of dietary strategies in environments ranging from closed forests to open grasslands. This uses isotope values from each locality for each taxon to estimate diet, rather to assume a constant diet for a taxon across all localities. Each taxon can be represented on the dietary continuum from pure C3-browsing to pure C4-grazing. Fossil assemblages from the Turkana basin are evaluated in the same way over the past 4.2 million years. The fossil record shows patterns with no modern analogue in the national parks and reserves of East and Central Africa for significant periods of time. Significant patterns shifts occur between 2.0 and 2.5 million years ago, and also in the past million years. These dietary changes at the community level occur during the evolutionary backdrop of C4 grasses, which have gone from less than 1% Net Primary Productivity (NPP) at 10 million years ago to more than 50% NPP in the tropics today. It is likely that C4 plants have also undergone important changes in nutrient content, defense against herbivory, fire adaptation, and propagation strategies in the past 10 million years; such issues could signficantly influence dietary strategies at the community level through time.",

As part of this effort, the Geospatial Fabric (GF) for the NHM was created. The GF is a database that contains parameters derived from datasets that characterize the physical features of watersheds. The GF was used to aggregate catchments and flowlines defined in the National Hydrography Dataset Plus dataset for more than 100,000 hydrologic response units (HRUs), and to establish initial parameter values for input to the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS). Many parameter values are adjusted in PRMS using an automated calibration process. Using these adjusted parameter values, the PRMS model estimated variables such as evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), snow-covered area (SCA), and snow water equivalent (SWE). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of parameter calibration, and model performance in general, several satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) gridded datasets including ET, PET, SCA, and SWE were compared to PRMS-simulated values. The MODIS and SNODAS data were spatially averaged for each HRU, and compared to PRMS-simulated ET, PET, SCA, and SWE values for each HRU in the Upper Missouri River watershed. Default initial GF parameter values and PRMS calibration ranges were evaluated. Evaluation results, and the use of MODIS and SNODAS datasets to update GF parameter values and PRMS calibration ranges, are presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Associated with northward convergence of the India continent, the surface motion of the Tibetan plateau, documented mainly by dense geodetic GPS measurements, changes greatly both on magnitude and on direction in different tectonic units. The most remarkable discordance of surface motion is around the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, where GPS velocity field is rotated gradually to oppositional direction near the southeastern Tibetan plateau with respect to the northward convergence of the India continent. Such a velocity field could be result from lateral boundary conditions, since the strength of lithosphere is probably weaker in the Tibetan plateau than in the surrounding regions. However, whether the surface motion of the Tibetan plateau is affected by basal shear at base of the elastic crust, that could exist if the coupling condition between the elastic and the viscous crust were changed, is unclear. Here, we developed a large-scale three-dimensional finite element model to explore the possible existence of basal shear below the Tibetan plateau and the surrounding regions. In the model, the lateral boundaries are specified with far-field boundary condition; the blocks surrounding the Tibetan plateaulike the Tarim, the Ordos, and the South China are treat as rigid blocks; and the mean thickness of elastic crust is assumed about 25km. Then, the magnitude and distribution of basal shear stress is automatically searchedin numerical calculation to fit surface (GPS) motion of the Tibetan plateau. We find that to better fit surface motion of the Tibetan plateau, negligible basal shear stress on the base of elastic crust is needed below majority of the western and the central Tibetan plateau; Whereas, around the eastern and the southeastern Tibetan plateau, especially between the Xianshuhestrike-slip fault and the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, at least ~1.5-3.0 Mpaof basal shear stress is needed to cause rotational surface motion as GPS measurements documented. This suggests that the state of mechanical couplingbetween the elastic and the viscous crust exist significant difference below the eastern and the western Tibetan plateau. In addition, the predicted magnitude and distribution of basal shear stress explains the north-south trended normal faults diffusively developed mainly around the western Tibetan plateau.",

Cyst fluxes in the sediment of the Alvarado lagoon suggest frequent blooms of Pyrodinium bahamense in the past hundreds of years. Moreover, the high concentrations of the cysts (~ 4000 cysts g-1) in the “modern” surface sediment reveal that the area is susceptible to be affected by future blooms, especially during seasons of heavy rain and wind, when cysts are resuspended in the water column. The dinoflagellate cyst bank in sediment deserves special attention as it may constitute a source for the export of cells in adjacent regions. The cyst of other harmful dinoflagellates have been recovered in the sediment. They notably include those of the benthic dinoflagellate Bysmatrum subsalsum, which is here reported for the first time.",

            "abstract": "This presentation discusses two ongoing interdisciplinary case studies that are using qualitative research to design and enhance environmental communication and science products for outreach and decision making purposes. Both cases demonstrate the viability and practical value of qualitative social science methodology, specifically focus group interviews, to better understand the viewpoints of target audiences, improve deliverables, and support project goals. The first case is a NOAA-funded project to conduct process-based modeling to project impact from climate change in general and sea level rise in particular to the natural and built environment. The project spans the Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida Panhandle coasts with concentration on the three National Estuarine Research Reserves. As part of the broader project, four annual focus groups were conducted with a purposive sample of coastal resource managers to capture their perspectives and suggestions to better meet their informational and operational needs. The second case is a Florida Sea Grant-funded project that is developing, implementing, and testing a cohesive outreach campaign to promote voluntary careful and responsible recreational boating to help protect sensitive marine life and habitats (especially seagrasses and oyster reefs) in the Mosquito Lagoon. Six focus groups were conducted with a purposive sample of the target audience of boaters to gain insights, feedback, and ideas on the direction of the campaign and design of the messages and products. The campaign materials created include a branded website, Facebook page, mobile app, information packets, brochures, pledge forms, and promotional items. A comparison of these two case studies will be provided and will explain how the qualitative findings were/are being implemented to tailor and refine the respective communication strategies and techniques including the emerging outreach products. The resulting outcomes are messages and tools that are readily accessible, understandable, engaging, useful, and memorable to the target audiences. The presentation will conclude with an overview of the strengths and role of qualitative methodology, how this approach can help address other science communication needs, and future research recommendations.",

            "abstract": "Methane emissions in arctic regions have the potential to contribute a large positive radiative forcing to our climate structure. However, methane in the Arctic has multiple sources and sinks which can complicate source attribution and quantification attempts. In situ stable isotope measurements provide a way to help tease apart different methane sources since the two primary methane sources, thermogenic and biogenic, have distinct isotopic signatures. Ultimately, this knowledge about the ratio between 13CH4 and 12CH4 concentrations can help us understand the relative contribution from each source. The ICOS instrument developed in our lab is an ideal candidate to obtain this type of information. Unlike other measurement methods such as IRMS, our instrument has been tailored to fit in a small aircraft capable of flying below the boundary layer in the arctic region. We flew ICOS in Summer 2013 over the north slope of Alaska and obtained spatially (every 160 m) and temporally (every 2 s) resolved δ13CH4 measurements in real time. Future missions will entail a Stirling-cooled detector in the instrument to further enhance the precision and sensitivity of the measurements. These field missions will enhance our understanding of the routes by which methane is being produced in these regions. This improved knowledge can then lead to improved predictive ability regarding the characteristics of future methane flux and its effect on our climate.",

            "abstract": "The potential for accelerated sea-level rise under anthropogenic warming is a significant societal problem, in particular in world’s coastal deltaic regions where about half of the world’s population resides. Quantifying geophysical sources of sea-level rise with the goal of improved projection at local scales remains a complex and challenging interdisciplinary research problem. These processes include ice-sheet/glacier ablations, steric sea-level, solid Earth uplift or subsidence due to GIA, tectonics, sediment loading or anthropogenic causes, hydrologic imbalance, and human processes including water retention in reservoirs and aquifer extraction. The 2013 IPCC AR5 concluded that the observed and explained geophysical causes of global geocentric sea-level rise, 1993–2010, is closer towards closure. However, the discrepancy reveals that circa 1.3→37.5% of the observed sea-level rise remains unexplained. This relatively large discrepancy is primarily attributable to the wide range of estimates of respective contributions of Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets and mountain/peripheral glaciers to sea-level rise. Understanding and quantifying the natural and anthropogenic processes governing solid Earth (land, islands and sea-floor) uplift or subsidence at the regional and local scales remain elusive to enable addressing coastal vulnerability due to relative sea-level rise hazards, such as the Bangladesh Delta. This study focuses on addressing coastal vulnerability of Bangladesh, a Belmont Forum/IGFA project, BanD-AID (\nhttp://Belmont-SeaLevel.org\n). Sea-level rise, along with tectonic, sediment load and groundwater extraction induced land uplift/subsidence, have exacerbated Bangladesh’s coastal vulnerability, affecting 150 million people in one of the world’s most densely populated regions. Here we present preliminary results using space geodetic observations, including satellite radar and laser altimetry, GRACE gravity, tide gauge, hydrographic, and GPS/InSAR observed land subsidence, and via fingerprint sea-level adjustment and reconstructed sea-level approaches, for improved quantification of major contributions to, and the projection of relative sea-level rise at the Bangladesh delta, towards addressing its coastal vulnerability and sustainability.",

            "abstract": "The development timescale of a tropical cyclone from genesis to the start of rapid intensification in an axisymmetric model is hypothesized to be a function of the initial entropy deficit. We run a set of idealized simulations in which the initial entropy deficit between the boundary layer and free troposphere varies from 0 to 100 J kg-1 K-1. The development timescale is measured by changes in the integrated kinetic energy of the low-level vortex. This timescale is inversely related to the mean mass flux during the tropical cyclone gestation period. The mean mass flux, in turn, is a function of the statistics of convective updrafts and downdrafts. Contour frequency by altitude diagrams show that entrainment of dry air into updrafts is predominately responsible for differences in the mass flux between the experiments, while downdrafts play a secondary role. Analyses of the potential and kinetic energy budgets indicate less efficient conversion of available potential energy to kinetic energy in the experiments with higher entropy deficits. Entrainment leads to the loss of buoyancy and the destruction of available potential energy. In the presence of strong downdrafts, there can even be a reversal of the conversion term. Weaker and more radially confined radial inflow results in less convergence of angular momentum in the experiments with higher entropy deficits. The result is a slower vortex spinup and a reduction in steady-state vortex size, despite similar steady-state maximum intensities among the experiments.",

            "abstract": "Rapid warming at high northern latitudes is resulting in permafrost degradation. When permafrost thaws in wetlands, the peat plateaus tend to collapse, bringing the water table closer to the surface. Methane (CH4) fluxes increase post-thaw, but the extent to which this is caused by CH4 release from the decomposition of previously-frozen, old carbon, deep within the soil profile, versus waterlogging near the soil surface resulting in anaerobic decomposition of more recent inputs, is unclear. Quantifying the relative contributions of these contrasting CH4 sources is essential for predicting future rates of CH4 release from thawing permafrost wetlands.\nThe most definitive test of whether old permafrost-derived C contributes substantially to CH4 release post thaw, would be to measure the radiocarbon (14C) content of the CH4. However, until recently this was very challenging in remote locations. Using new techniques that overcome previous limitations, we were able to measure the 14C content of CH4 being released from thawing wetlands in northern Canada. We hypothesised that time since plateau collapse would affect the amount of old CH4 being released, and so sampled in locations where collapse had occurred at different times. Samples were collected from collars that either included or excluded CH4 from deep within the peat profile, and CH­4 from a depth of 100 cm was collected by sampling soil water.\nWe demonstrate that millennium-old CH4 was being produced at 100 cm. However, CH4 being released from the surface had contemporary 14C signatures. Using our collar treatments, we were able to calculate that deep CH4 contributed less than 10% of the surface flux, and that this contribution did not vary with time since collapse. The effect of permafrost thaw on CH4 fluxes in these peatlands appears to be more closely related to changes in near surface conditions than to increases in anaerobic decomposition of previously frozen C. This indicates permafrost thaw does not necessarily lead to increased emissions of old C via the CH4 pathway as many have assumed. This is not generally reflected in Earth system models.",

However, not all particulate iron (pFe) is considered to be biologically available, with some fraction locked away in mineral matrices. As a result, analyses that estimate the bioavailable fraction of pFe are a valuable addition to studies of iron distribution. One such analysis involves the use of an oxalate-EDTA leach at pH 8, with heating, to estimate “ligand-leachable” iron. We will present concentration profiles of ligand-leachable iron associated with suspended (0.8 – 51 μm) particles from the GEOTRACES Eastern Pacific Zonal Transect: a dataset that includes labile particulate iron concentrations measured in the mixed layer, chlorophyll maximum, benthic nepheloid layers, oxygen minimum zones and hydrothermal plume. Where relevant, we compare concentrations to measurements made in similar areas during the US GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal transect. In addition, we will present initial results from US GEOTRACES EPZT of the stable isotopic composition of iron (δ56Fe) in the ligand leachable fraction and discuss the results in terms of biogeochemical cycling of particulate iron.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that is responsible for about 17% of the total direct radiative forcing from long-lived greenhouse gases (IPCC 2013). While the global emission of methane is relatively well quantified, the temporal and spatial variability of methane emissions from individual area or point sources are still poorly understood. Using 4 field methods (aircraft-based mass balance, tracer correlation, vertical radial plume mapping, and static chambers) and a new field-validated process-based model (California Landfill Methane Inventory Model, CALMIM 5.4), we investigated both the total emissions from a central Indiana landfill as well as the partitioned emissions inclusive of methanotrophic oxidation for the various cover soils. This landfill is an upwind source for the city of Indianapolis, so the resolution of m2 to km2 scale emissions, as well as understanding the temporal variability for this complex area source, contributes to improved regional inventory calculations. Emissions for the site as a whole were measured using both an aircraft-based mass balance approach as well as a ground-based tracer correlation method, permitting direct comparison of the strengths, limitations, and uncertainties of these two approaches. Because US landfills are highly-engineered and composed of daily, intermediate, and final cover areas with differing thicknesses, composition, and implementation of gas recovery, we also expected different emission signatures and strengths from the various cover areas. Thus we also deployed static chambers and vertical radial plume mapping to quantify the spatial variability of emissions from the thinner daily and intermediate cover areas. Understanding the daily, seasonal and annual emission rates from a landfill is not trivial, and usually requires a combination of measurement and modeling approaches. Thus, our unique data set provides an opportunity to gain an improved understanding of the emissions from a complex area source, an essential requirement for developing improved urban-scale greenhouse gas inventories relevant for addressing mitigation strategies. We report on the results here.",

            "abstract": "Submerged breakwaters avoid the generation of major reflected waves that affect the beach. They are very useful for erosion control and beach protection by decreasing the wave heights. In addition, standing waves can play a significant role in hydrodynamics near the vertical breakwater. However, an accurate understanding of the wave propagation/breaking over a submerged breakwater, and wave overtopping in front of a vertical breakwater has yet to be achieved. A 2D two-phase flow model for air–water flow simulation near the submerged and vertical breakwaters is described. In the submerged breakwater case, wave propagation, wave breaking, and runup and rundown of waves on sloping beach is studied numerically with an emphasis on air-water interaction and hydrodynamic characteristics. For the vertical breakwater case, a two-phase flow model of wave breaking/overtopping hydrodynamics under fully and partially standing waves is developed and evaluated. The model contains the Navier–Stokes equations for both air and water phases, the LES turbulence closure model and a hybrid level set/volume-of-fluid approach. The numerical model is discretized using a finite element method. The model’s convergence as a function of grid refinement is examined. The numerical model is validated alongside the two experimental data sets, with good agreement found. The numerical results show that a vortex forms when waves spread over a submerged breakwater. The numerical results also indicate that the maximum turbulent kinetic energy, velocities and viscosity occur on the top of breakwater. The results show that for fully standing waves, velocities and wave height are higher in comparison to the comparable partially standing wave case (for the vertical breakwater). These calculations are in overall agreement with earlier observations, while the numerical model describes the water and air phase characteristics in greater detail than current measurements. The model provides a valuable method to advance mechanistic understanding of hydrodynamic characteristics near the breakwater in the nearshore area.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of aerosol size distribution is essential for its influence on atmosphere and human health, especially for small particles because they are able to penetrate lung tissues, thus increasing the risk of bronchitis or lung diseases. Lidar as an active optical remote sensing technique is effective for monitoring aerosols with high temporal and spatial variations. Particles with diameters comparable to the detecting light wavelength have been effectively detected by using UV, VIS, and near-IR wavelengths. However, to quantitatively estimate the shape of the particle size distribution, more information is required with respect to sub-micrometer and smaller particles. Conventional lidar employs tiny field-of-view (FOV) to detect single scatter reflected from aerosols in the direction opposite to incident light. However, the complicated reflection on the path of laser causes multiple scatter which contains also the size distribution information of aerosols. In this study, a UV Lidar with multiple FOV receiver was used for detecting such multiple scattering effects in order to obtain more quantitative information related to particle size distribution. The FOV of Lidar receiver was program controlled in a range from 0.1 mrad to 12.4 mrad. The pacific retrieval method for aerosol size distribution using this feature and field measurement results will be introduced in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "The 2009 L’Aquila main shock (6th of April, Mw6.1) is one of the best-recorded normal faulting earthquakes with a distinctive foreshock-aftershock sequence. The seismic sequence activated an ~50-km-long, N133°E-trending fault system composed of two major right-stepping en echelon segments: the L’Aquila fault (AF) and the Campotosto fault. We focus our analysis only on the volume containing the high-angle AF segment where the whole foreshock sequence clustered around the nucleation patch together with numerous repeating earthquakes.\nAnalyzing the seismograms of the events that occurred within 6 km (±3) from the AF plane we discuss the complex nucleation and rupture process characterizing the 2009 L’Aquila earthquake together with the inferred heterogeneous distribution of the material/mechanical rock properties, seismicity pattern and coseismic slip, showing how different competing mechanisms control the initial stage of rupture and the dynamic rupture propagation.\nWe compute source parameters (i.e., stress drop, moment magnitude and corner frequency) of foreshocks and aftershocks to investigate the spatial-temporal pattern of fault zone heterogeneities. Source spectra at each station are inferred by using the multi-taper technique and corrected for attenuation; therefore corner frequency is inferred by using the Snoke’s relation. Outputs were compared to those we obtained by a multi-window-spectral-ratio technique (MWSR) computing the fit of stacked spectral ratios. Further, we discuss the results with those found in the literature. Ml versus Mw relation is inferred for this dataset. Foreshocks and aftershocks nucleated in the same fault portion do not show any difference in source parameters.",

We introduce an index of basin complexity based on its optimal model complexity. We use a simple hydrological model based on k-nearest neighbors and quantify its complexity for different parameterizations. Further, by a model of optimal complexity we mean a robust representation of the underlying processes (here to predict streamflow), i.e. it remains a good conceptualisation of underlying processes as new information in the form of new datasets are introduced. Relationships between hydrologic characteristics of around 430 MOPEX basins such as location, hydrologic ratios, saturated hydraulic conductivity and NDVI and respective basin complexities are investigated. The results suggest that optimal complexity and aforementioned hydrologic characteristics are linked, thereby suggesting that model complexity may have a physical interpretation. It also suggests that optimal model complexity can be interpreted as an index of physical similarity, and that minimum complexity that is required to model a basin depends on its hydrologic characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Large uncertainty in the direct radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) exists, with published estimates ranging from 0.25 to 0.9 W m−2. A significant source of this uncertainty relates to the vertical distribution of BC, particularly relative to cloud layers. We first compare the vertical distribution of BC in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models to aircraft measurements and find that models tend to overestimate upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric (UT/LS) BC, particularly over the central Pacific from Hiaper Pole-to-Pole Observations Flight 1 (HIPPO1). However, CMIP5 generally underestimates Arctic BC from the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites campaign, implying a geographically dependent bias. Factors controlling the vertical distribution of BC in CMIP5 models, such as wet and dry deposition, precipitation, and convective mass flux (MC), are subsequently investigated. We also perform a series of sensitivity experiments with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5, including prescribed meteorology, enhanced vertical resolution, and altered convective wet scavenging efficiency and deep convection. We find that convective mass flux has opposing effects on the amount of black carbon in the atmosphere. More MC is associated with more convective precipitation, enhanced wet removal, and less BC below 500 hPa. However, more MC, particularly above 500 hPa, yield more BC aloft due to enhanced convective lofting. These relationships—particularly MC versus BC below 500 hPa—are generally stronger in the tropics. Compared to the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, most CMIP5 models overestimate MC, with all models overestimating MC above 500 hPa. Our results suggest that excessive convective transport is one of the reasons for CMIP5 overestimation of UT/LS BC.",

            "abstract": "Error in accounting for atmospheric delay is one of the most significant limiting factors in the accuracy of GPS position determination. Delay due to tropospheric water vapor is especially difficult to model, as it depends in part on local atmospheric dynamics. Currently, the delay models used in GPS data analysis produce millimeter-level position estimates for most of the stations in the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) GPS network. However, certain stations in the network often show large position errors of 10 millimeters or more, and the key characteristic of these errors is that they occur in a particular direction. By analyzing the PBO network for these asymmetric outliers, we found that all affected stations are located in mountainous regions of the United States, and that many are located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Furthermore, we found that the direction in which the asymmetric outliers occur is related to the direction of local topographic increase, suggesting that topography plays a role in creating asymmetric outliers. We compared the GPS time series data with several forms of weather data, including radiosonde balloon measurements, numerical weather models, and MODIS satellite imagery. The results suggest that GPS position errors in the Sierra Nevada occur when there is strong atmospheric turbulence, including variations in pressure and humidity, downwind of the mountain crest. Specifically, when GPS position errors occur in the Sierra Nevada, lee waves are likely to be observed over the ridge; however, not all lee wave events produce position errors. Our results suggest that GPS measurements in mountainous regions may be more prone to systematic errors than previously thought due to the formation of lee waves. ",

            "abstract": "Precipitation in the summer monsoon season accounts for more than 80% of India’s annual rainfall and is crucial for the region’s agriculture and economy. A large fraction of this summer precipitation is produced by vortices with outer radii of about 1000 km that typically form over Bay of Bengal. Intense occurrences of these synoptic-scale storms are commonly classified as monsoon depressions.\nRecords of monsoon depression tracks maintained by the India Meteorological Department extend from the late 19th century to the current day, and show an average of about 6 monsoon depressions forming each summer season in the Indian region. Recent analyses of these records have revealed a statistically significant decreasing trend in the number of depressions but an increase in the number of weaker storms since the mid-20th century. In particular, the years 2002, 2010, and 2012 were noted for being the first summers, in over a century, in which no depressions formed.\nHere satellite and reanalysis datasets are used to document the existence of multiple storms in the summers of 2002, 2010, and 2012 that meet traditional criteria for classification as monsoon depressions. This indicates that the India Meteorological Department record is missing storms, at least in those recent years. We furthermore use ocean surface wind speeds obtained from satellite scatterometers to estimate the number of extreme synoptic events occurring each summer over the Bay of Bengal, and find that this proxy for storm counts exhibits no statistically significant trend over the last three decades. Depression counts based on a reanalysis dataset also exhibit no statistically significant trend over the last three decades, but temporal changes in the observing network may render reanalysis-based storm-count trends unreliable.\nIn summary, our results demonstrate the existence of possible errors in the dataset on which previous claims of large trends in monsoon depression activity have been based. Although multiple issues exist with storm counts based on several reanalysis and satellite datasets, we were unable to find a statistically significant downward trend in depression counts using those datasets. This indicates a need for improved monitoring of monsoon depressions and more in-depth study of possible trends in their activity.",

This study uses the NOAA National Air Quality Forecasting Capability (NAQFC) developmental product to quantify such pollution attributions in terms of surface level concentration of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) over the contiguous US (CONUS). Sensitivity study using the NAQFC to predict surface concentrations of PM2.5 with and without projected wild fires provides a baseline apportionment of pollutant attributable to wild fire. The forecast system entails wild fire related pollutant emission to be projected near real time. It uses the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Hazard Mapping System (HMS), a multiple satellite and human-analyst-assisted wild fire detection system, to locate wild fires. The U.S. Forest Service Bluesky Modeling framework is used during the emission projection to provide parameterization for fuel type, loading inventories and burn duration. Subsequent to the Bluesky process, the U.S. EPA Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model is invoked to map chemical speciation and to calculate plume rise for the chemical transport model (CTM) within the NAQFC. Fire plumes intruded into CONUS were also considered. The CTM used is the U.S. EPA Community Air Quality Multi-scale Model (CMAQ) version 4.6 with CB05 gas phase mechanism and the AERO4 tri-modal aerosol size-distribution module. Both surface-based concentration and space-based observation such as aerosol optical thickness are used to verify performance of the forecast. A standard statistical performance metric is used to rank the performance improvement achieved by accounting for wild fires over the CONUS during an extended period of real-time testing.",

            "abstract": "Discussions of our response to climate change invariably involve issues of adaptation and mitigation. The former presupposes unavoidable climate consequences and recognises a need to lessen their impact. The latter attempts to lessen the effects of increasing greenhouse gases (GHG) by (1) reducing GHG emission, (2) creating CO2 sinks (e.g. carbon sequestration) or by blocking the effects of solar radiation (solar radiation management - SRM).\nThe SPICE project was set up to investigate the feasibility of implementing a practical method of SRM using the stratospheric injection of aerosols. SPICE remit includes: engineering design for the delivery of stratospheric aerosol, laboratory measurements for characterising the properties of optimal aerosol, and modelling studies looking into the parameterisation and impact of stratospheric aerosols within a state-of-the-art global climate model. The project has also pressed for the need for governance of climate engineering research.\nWe describe idealised experiments investigating the environmental impact following sulphate aerosol injection into the tropical low-mid stratosphere. We compare a geo-engineering scenario (GeoMIP G4), which includes a constant injection rate of SO2 (5Tg/year) beginning at 2020, against a control simulation of increasing greenhouse gas forcing, as outlined by the CMIP5 RCP4.5 scenario. We use the well-documented stratosphere-resolving Hadley Centre model, which has been employed in previous CMIP5 and climate engineering studies. We examine for high-latitude impacts following tropical aerosol injection, and in particular the Holton-Tan effect observed in the wintertime extratropical stratosphere. These dynamical sensitivities provide an important link, bridging tropical stratosphere forcing with the near-surface response often seen at high latitudes.",

Changes in land use have the potential effect of modifying this flux, particularly in urban areas where impervious areas are common. To investigate the effect of urbanization on riverine carbon transport, we studied four first-order streams in Towson, a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The watersheds from the studied streams exhibit different levels of urbanization as measured by the percentage of impervious areas. Samples from these four streams were taken weekly, and several chemical constituents were measured either in the field or in the laboratory. These constituents included nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), phosphate, the carbon isotopic compositions of DOC and DIC, and fluorescence intensity of the DOC. Results show that DOC concentrations were consistently below 5 mg C/L regardless of the level of imperviousness of the watershed. Similarly, carbon isotope ratios were consistent across the studied streams, with values centered around -26.4 per mil, thus suggesting a significant influx of soil-derived organic carbon originated from C3 plants that are common in the watersheds. Confirming this interpretation, fluorescence spectroscopy data suggest a humic-like origin for the DOC of the streams, thus pointing to the heterotrophic nature of the streams. The combined results suggest that the studied streams exhibit similar DOC concentrations, carbon isotopic values, and fluorescence spectra, despite their level of impervious surfaces in their watersheds.",

The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission, carrying Doppler Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and a high spectral resolution lidar (ATLID) is expected to bring qualitative estimate of these quantities together with cloud vertical velocity information. The standard algorithm for warm cloud microphysics developed under the first Jaxa EarthCARE Research announcement enables us to tackle bimodal problems on retrieving size and number concentration of cloud particles and drizzles coexisting within a vertical grid, by practically incorporating backward Monte-Carlo calculations of the polarized lidar returns in the inversion scheme with sufficient processing speed adapted to global data. In the present study, the developed algorithm has been applied to similar set of measurements from A-train, especially from CloudSat and CALIPSO, to derive global views of cloud and drizzle vertical distributions to be further used to examine the performance of their parameterizations in climate and cloud resolving models.",

Interpretation of the δ18O of the carbonate is complex and recent studies indicate the temperature dependent oxygen isotopic fractionation of cave calcites may be greater than previous laboratory studies indicated.\nThe goal of this study is to shed light on the environmental and kinetic drivers of the δ18O and δ13C kinetic isotope fractionation in a cave located on Eleuthera, Bahamas. The cave monitoring includes experiments in which the δ18O and δ13C of calcite precipitated from drip water could be studied by placing microscope slides and concave watch glasses on top of active stalagmites, in addition to analysis of temperature, relative humidity, geochemical analyses of the drip waters, cave air, and calcite. The precipitated calcite was deposited over ~three month period and could be considered a single layer as the calcite all precipitated approximately at the same time and under the same conditions.\nResults demonstrate minimal fractionation for the calcite deposited from the microscope slides whereas the calcite on the watch glasses, intended to represent the geometry of a stalagmite, show a greater increase in δ18O and δ13C values with increasing distance from the center. Heavier isotopic values at the edges are driven by increased degassing and fractionation. Overall, the oxygen isotopes of the calcite demonstrate the best agreement with the temperature dependent fractionation equation from Tremaine et al. (2011. Geochim. Cosmochim. Ac.75,17 4929-4950). However, even samples which are thought to be precipitated in equilibrium are still offset, possibly driven by varying degrees of kinetic fractionation within the cave. Results demonstrate the portion of the cave which is the least ventilated is characterized by the highest growth rate and produces calcites which are closest to equilibrium for δ18O. This suggests that growth rate and ventilation may be primary drivers of the decreased fractionation within this cave. These results support previous findings that the temperature dependent oxygen isotopic fractionation of cave calcites may be greater than laboratory studies indicated and that stalagmite samples are best selected from deeper sections of the cave for geochemical analyses.",

Mis-alignment of the solar rotational and magnetic axes\nleads to the characteristic ballerina-skirt shape of the HCS and during the solar cycle there can be large excursions in the sheet's latitudinal extent. Voyager 2's observations of energetic electron\ndropouts are related to its crossing of this boundary. Magnetic reconnection is also thought to occur as the HCS compresses and narrows between the termination shock and the heliopause. Near the\nequator the two HCS field alignments are present in roughly equal amounts, while near the edges the distribution can be considerably skewed. This will lead to substantial differences in the environments\nof the two Voyager spacecraft since Voyager 1 is north of the equator, but firmly in the sector region, while Voyager 2 is south of the equator and skirting the edges of the sector region. We present\nparticle-in-cell simulations demonstrating the consequences of the reconnection of asymmetric amounts of flux. In particular, we will discuss Voyager 2's remaining time in the heliosphere -- including the\nimplications for the solar wind velocity, energetic particle transport, and the expected structure of Voyager 2's heliopause crossing -- and compare it with the data collected from Voyager 1.",

            "abstract": "In the CrowdMag project, we explore whether digital magnetometers built in modern mobile phones can be used as scientific instruments to measure Earth’s magnetic field. Most modern mobile phones have digital magnetometers to orient themselves. A phone's magnetometer measures three components of the local magnetic field with a typical sensitivity of about 150 to 600 nanotesla (nT). By combining data from vector magnetometers and accelerometers, phone's orientation is determined. Using phone's Internet connection, magnetic data and location are sent to a central server. At the server, we check quality of the magnetic data from all users and make the data available to the public as aggregate maps. We have two long-term goals. 1) Develop near-real-time models of Earth's time changing magnetic field by reducing man-made noise from crowdsourced data and combining it with geomagnetic data from other sources. 2) Improving accuracy of magnetic navigation by mapping magnetic noise sources (for e.g. power transformer and iron pipes). Key challenges to this endeavor are the low sensitivity of the phone’s magnetometer and the noisy environment within and surrounding the phone.\nURL : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/crowdmag.shtml",

            "abstract": "Large-scale fluid convection in conventional volcanic geothermal systems is driven by the hydrothermal cooling of shallow intrusions. Recently, there has been increased interest in tapping supercritical fluid resources in volcanic geothermal systems, since such fluid reservoirs could provide a roughly order-of-magnitude greater potential for electricity production than conventional geothermal wells drilled to temperatures of 250-300 °C. The potential of supercritical geothermal reservoirs was demonstrated in 2010, when the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) drilled into liquid magma at 2 km depth and encountered an overlying permeable, high-temperature (~450 °C) fluid reservoir capable of more than ~30 MWe of electricity production. However, a conceptual model describing the main factors governing the extent and structure of target reservoirs has remained elusive. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of the role of rock permeability, the brittle-ductile transition temperature, and the depth of magma chamber emplacement on the development of supercritical fluid reservoirs. We use the numerical modeling code CSMP++ to model two-phase flow of compressible water around an initially elliptical, 900 °C intrusion. Our models indicate that potentially exploitable supercritical fluid resources are an integral part of many magma-driven geothermal systems. Hotter and more extensive reservoirs are promoted by a brittle-ductile transition temperature higher than ~400 °C, an intrusion depth less than 3 km, and a host rock permeability of 10-14 to 10-15 m2. The systematic dependence of the size, location and hydrologic behavior of supercritical reservoirs on these factors aids the development of exploration models for different volcanic settings. In addition, by serving as the main agents of heat transfer at the interface of an intrusion and the overlying hydrothermal system, supercritical fluid reservoirs play a decisive role in determining the overall thermal histories of shallow intrusions and in shaping the overall character of hydrothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "Many evidences showed that heavy isotope systems could be significantly fractionated as the consequence of the nuclear volume effect (NVE) or so-called nuclear field shift effect. Here we investigate NVEs of Hg, Tl and Pb isotope systems by using quantum chemistry computational methods with careful evaluation on quantum relativistic effects via the Dirac’s formalism of full-electron wavefunction. Our results generally agree with previous studies but with noticeable differences in many cases. With the unique NVE driving force, equilibrium 202Hg/198Hg and 205Tl/203Tl isotopes can be fractionated up to 3.94‰ and 2.78‰ at 0℃, respectively, showing potentially large equilibrium isotope fractionations can be expected for future studies of these two isotope systems. Moreover, the NVE causes large mass-independent fractionations (MIF) for odd-mass isotopes (e.g., ∆199NVHg and ∆201NVHg) and small MIFs for even-mass isotopes (e.g., ∆200NVHg). For Pb isotope system, NVEs induce isotope fractionations up to 1.62‰ (207Pb/206Pb) and 4.06‰ (208Pb/206Pb) at 0℃. However, contributions from classical mass-dependent driving force are small, about 0.1-0.5‰ for 207Pb/206Pb and 0.2-0.9‰ for 208Pb/206Pb. We find that Pb4+-bearing species can be significantly enriched heavy isotopes than Pb2+-bearing species. Comparing to Pb0, Pb2+-bearing species even enrich lighter Pb isotopes. A very strange and interesting thing is that the beta value of Pb2+-bearing species can be smaller than the unity (1.000). Similar thing has been found on Tl+-bearing species. This is an impossible and unexplained situation if only based on classical mass-dependent isotope fractionation theory (e.g., Bigeleisen-Mayer equation). The consequence is that the different direction of beta values of Pb2+-bearing species will let the Pb isotope fractionation even larger when they fractionate with Pb4+-bearing species. Moreover, NVEs also cause mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of odd 207Pb isotopes (∆207NVPb).",

These devices consist of a 1.00 m2 mesh that collects tiny fog water droplets that coalesce, fall into a trough and whose volume is recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge at 15-minute intervals. These data provide an estimate of the fog density and a quantitative measurement of the amount of liquid water available from each fog event.\nSeveral of these sites were deployed in conjunction with active strand collectors based on Colorado State University's Caltech Active Strand Cloudwater Collector (CASCC) design which are used to collect clean water samples for the detection of mercury. This presentation will highlight the spatial and temporal variability observed within the data sets during this first summer (2014) of active collection. Of particular and significant note is the variability of the fog in relationship to distance from the coast as well as the latitudinal variability.\nWe note that the observations coupled with accompanying meteorological measurements can potentially help to provide estimates of the potential flux of moisture available from fog events to ecosystem processes during the otherwise dry season along the California coast.",

InSAR image from descending orbit was found to detect clear precursor landslide surface deformation on a slope; however, InSAR image on ascending orbit did not always detect clear precursor deformation. It is thought to be related with atmospheric moisture condition, length of observation baseline and so on. Furthermore, after phase unwrapping on InSAR images, 2.5-dimensional deformation was analized. This analysis needed both ascending and descending InSAR images and culculated quasi east-west deformation component (Figs. (a) and (b)) and quasi up-down deformation component (Figs. (c) and (d)). The resulting 2.5D calculation gave westward deformation and mixture of upward and downward deformations on the precursor landslide surface deformation slope (blue circles in Figs. (c) and (d)), where remarkable disrupted deep landslide occurred during Nov 2012 and 25 Jun 2013, judging from result of airborne LiDAR survey and field survey; the occurrence date is not precisely identified. The figure remains the issue that eliminating \"real\" precursor deformation from other candidate deformations.

            "abstract": "Observations at the WAIS Divide site show that near-surface snow is strongly altered by weather-related processes, producing features that are recognizable in the ice core. Prominent reflective “glazed” surface crusts develop frequently during the summer. Observations during austral summers 2008-09 through 2012-13, supplemented by Automated Weather Station data with insolation sensors, documented formation of such crusts during relatively low-wind, low-humidity, clear-sky periods with intense daytime sunshine. After formation, such glazed surfaces typically developed cracks in a polygonal pattern with few-meter spacing, likely from thermal contraction at night. Cracking was commonest when several clear days occurred in succession, and was generally followed by surface hoar growth. Temperature and radiation observations showed that solar heating often warmed the near-surface snow above the air temperature, contributing to mass transfer favoring crust formation. Subsequent investigation of the WDC06A deep ice core revealed that preserved surface crusts were seen in the core at an average rate of ~4.3 ± 2 yr-1 over the past 5500 years. They are about 40% more common in layers deposited during summers than during winters. The total summertime crust frequency also covaried with site temperature, with more present during warmer periods.\nWe hypothesize that the mechanism for glaze formation producing single-grain-thick very-low-porosity thin crusts (i.e. “glazes”) involves additional in-filling of open pores. The thermal conductivity of ice greatly exceeds that of air, so heat transport in firn is primarily conductive. Because heat flow is primarily through the grain structure, for a temperature inversion (colder upper surface) beneath a growing thin crust at the upper surface, pores will be colder than interconnected grains, favoring mass transport into those pores. Transport may occur by vapor, surface, or volume diffusion, although vapor diffusion and surface transport in pre-melted films are likely to dominate.\nOn-site wintertime observations have not been made, but crust formation during winter may be favored by greater wind-packing, large meteorologically-forced temperature changes reaching as high as -15oC in midwinter, and perhaps longer intervals of surface stability.",

            "abstract": "Shallow cumulus convection enhances vertical transport of trace gases and aerosol and creates a cloudy transition layer on top of the sub-cloud mixed layer. Two recent studies have proposed that an elevated layer of enhanced organic aerosol over the southeastern United States (SEUS) could explain the discrepancy in the summertime enhancement of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and summertime enhancement of surface measurements of aerosol mass. We investigate the vertical profile of aerosol over the SEUS during the summertime using in situ aircraft-based measurements of aerosol from the SENEX and SEAC4RS studies. During shallow cumulus convection over the SEUS, we found that aerosol and trace gas concentration in the transition layer are diluted by cleaner air from the free troposphere, and the absolute aerosol loading decreases with altitude in the transition layer. However, after normalizing the vertical profiles to the CO boundary layer enhancement to correct for the dilution, the aerosol mass, volume, and extinction relative to the boundary layer CO enhancement is ~20% greater in the transition layer than in the mixed layer. The enhancement of aerosol loading suggests production of aerosol mass in the transition layer, although biomass burning could also be the source of the enhancement. The median composition of the aerosol in the mixed layer is ~70% organics and ~18% sulfate, while it is 65% organics and 23% sulfate in the transition layer. The composition of the aerosol enhancement in the transition layer is roughly equal parts sulfate and organics by mass. The enhancement of aerosol extinction in the transition layer is not sufficient to explain the summertime enhancement of AOD over SEUS.",

            "abstract": "Borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) combined with solar thermal energy harvesting is an economic technological system to garner and store energy as well as an environmentally-sustainable alternative for the heating of buildings. The first community-scale BTES system in North America was installed in 2007 in the Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC), about 35 miles south of Calgary, Canada. The BTES system involves direct circulation of water heated from solar thermal panels in the summer into a storage tank, after which it is circulate within an array of 144 closed-loop geothermal heat exchangers having a depth of 35 m and a spacing of 2.5 m. In the winter the circulation direction is reversed to supply heat to houses. Data collection over a six year period indicates that this system can supply more than 90% of the winter heating energy needs for 52 houses in the community. One major challenge facing the BTES system technology is the relatively low annual efficiency, i.e., the ratio of energy input and output is in the range of 15% to 40% for the system in Drake Landing. To better understand the working principles of BTES and to improve BTES performance for future applications at larger scales, a three-dimensional transient coupled fluid and heat transfer model is established using TOUGH2. The time-dependent injection temperatures and circulation rate measured over the six years of monitoring are used as model input. The simulations are calibrated using soil temperature data measured at different locations over time. The time-dependent temperature distributions within the borehole region agree well with the measured temperatures for soil with an intrinsic permeability of 10e-19 m2, an apparent thermal conductivity of 2.03 W/m°C, and a volumetric heat capacity of 2.31 MJ/m-3°C. The calibrated model serves as the basis for a sensitivity analysis of soil and operational parameters on BTES system efficiency preformed with TOUGH2. Preliminary results suggest 1) BTES efficiency increases with increased in-pipe circulation rates; 2) BTES efficiency increases with decreasing soil thermal conductivity due to lateral heat loss from the system; and 3) BTES efficiency increases only slightly with decreasing soil permeability.",

However the details of more regional variations are unclear. The Earthscope Transportable Array (TA), which is composed of nearly 2000 stations, and the Caltech Regional Seismic Network (CI) provide us an excellent opportunity to detect the properties of the inner core underneath the inner core's “western” hemisphere\n We have collected seismograms from both the TA and CI networks for more than 1000 earthquakes in the Americas with magnitude greater than 5.5 around U.S. which took place after 2002. This enabled us to find more than 40 events with clear PKiKP observations. These PKiKP observations are used to constrain the properties of the top layer of the inner core and the coda signal of PKiKP is also present in the data. PKiKP coda provides useful information about the small scale heterogeneity in the top layer of the inner core which is likely to be the region most strongly affected by of present-day inner core dynamical processes. The distance for these PKiKP observations ranges from near-podal to 95 degrees. In agreement with in previous studies we find inner core scattering (ICS), which causes strong PKiKP coda, in the distance range 45-75 degrees. However, the ICS we observe in these 40 western hemisphere events might be much weaker than the reported estimations. These differences may show the regional variations of the inner core properties and indicate more complex dynamical processes of the core.",

It has been postulated in the literature that extreme weather events can shape people’s climate change beliefs and adaptation attitudes. In this presentation, we use data from pre- and post-extreme event surveys and interviews to examine the effects of the 2012 Midwestern US drought on agricultural advisors’ climate change beliefs, adaptation attitudes, and risk perceptions. We found that neither climate change beliefs nor attitudes toward adaptation changed significantly as a result of the drought. Risk perceptions did change, however, with advisors becoming more concerned about risks from drought and pests and less concerned about risks related to flooding and ponding. Qualitative interviews revealed that while advisors readily accept the occurrence of extreme weather as a risk, the irregularity and unpredictability of extreme events for specific localities limits day-to-day consideration in respect to prescribed management advice. Instead, advisors’ attention is directed towards planning for short-term changes encompassing weather, pests, and the market, as well as planning for long-term trends related to water availability. These findings provide important insights for communicating climate change in this critical sector while illustrating the importance of social science research in planning and executing communication campaigns.

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon dating is the key method for obtaining chronological information of paleoclimate records covering the last ~45,000 years. The wealth of paleoclimatic information reconstructed from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores are often used as blue-prints to place these radiocarbon dated records into a wider context. However, while layer counted ice core time scales from Greenland provide high precision on the duration of events, the absolute age uncertainty increases back in time. This poses limitations on the possible detail and robustness of comparisons between radiocarbon dated, and ice core records.\nCosmogenic radionuclide records, i.e. based on 14C and 10Be, provide a unique tool for synchronizing different time scales from various archives. They carry the common production rate signal which is modulated by variations in the strength of the helio- and geo- magnetic fields, which are climate-independent processes and global. We will present a method for synchronizing radiocarbon and Greenland ice core time scales back to 16,000 years ago based on Bayesian wiggle matching of cosmogenic radionuclide records. The method utilizes the strength of the high relative precision of ice core time scales as well as the small absolute age uncertainty from tree-ring chronologies and U/Th dated speleothems. The method provides combined error estimates and allows testing i) the accuracy of ice core time scales, ii) the quality of 14C records underlying the radiocarbon calibration curve as well as iii) assumptions of synchronicity of rapid climate changes. Furthermore, we will illustrate how this method can be used for high-precision radiocarbon wiggle-match dating of floating tree ring chronologies beyond 14,000 years ago, and potentially improve the radiocarbon calibration curve.",

It is host to the Caloris Planitia, the interior smooth plains of the basin, which feature several distinct types of tectonic structures. Contractional wrinkle ridges are generally present throughout the basin, while two distinct sets of extensionally produced graben are found mainly in separate regions; the complex of radial linear graben known as Pantheon Fossae is located in the central region of the basin, while a set of more randomly oriented and concentric graben are found approximately midway between the basin’s centre and its circumference. Although the zones where these two extensional sets occur are mainly distinct, there are some instances of spatial overlap. This work focuses on constraining the relative timing of these diverse structural features, thus helping to unravel the deformational history of the basin by analyzing the geometries and kinematics of the graben and ridges in areas where the structures cross-cut each other. We also seek to quantify and constrain the local strains and stresses associated with these structures. This analysis will further guide future kinematic and mechanical models of Caloris, with end member descriptions ranging from a single mechanism to account for the simultaneous deformation of structures, for interactions which show no consistent order of deformation throughout the basin, to one or more deformational mechanisms driving a multi-stage or sequential deformation, for interactions that demonstrate a clear order of cross-cutting relations.",

            "abstract": "The atolls of the Pacific Ocean are low-lying landforms (less than 5m in elevation), typically consisting of reef-building corals often mounted by subaerial islets, or motu, which encircle a central lagoon. These motu, perched atop old coral reefs, typically consist of sand and gravel, and are sometimes anchored by relict geologic features (highstand coral reefs). Despite the vital role these islets play as home to terrestrial ecosystems and human infrastructure, the morphologic processes responsible for their formation and maintenance remain poorly understood. For example, although extreme events are hypothesized as a formation mechanism, motu are found in regions where hurricanes or tropical cyclones rarely occur and across varying storm gradients and frequency tracks. Here we use hydrodynamic and event-based morphodynamic modeling to better understand the role of storm events on the formation and evolution of motu.\nUsing XBeach, a two-dimensional model of infragravity wave propagation and sediment transport, coupled with the coastal wave model, SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore), we simulate the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic impacts of storm events on the nearshore, beach, and backbarrier portions of atolls. We investigate the effect of different representative profile morphology, for example motu height or the distance from the reef edge to the motu, on storm response. We further test the effect of storm intensity and inundation scenarios (i.e. difference in elevated water levels of the lagoon and ocean) on storm hydrodynamics and morphologic change. Model scenarios are informed and compared to basin-wide analysis of the variation of atoll and motu characteristics, such as reef width, motu width, and motu spacing across the Pacific Ocean. Atoll morphologies and storm responses are affected by both geographic location and, locally, the shoreline orientation (compared to storm tracks). Combining these different model scenarios with measured morphometrics allows us to develop a better understanding of the response of atolls and motu to climatic forcings, such as varying wave climate, storm frequency and intensity, and increased sea levels.",

We investigated each element by ultra-thin section microscopy, by broad-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (BIB-SEM) and focused-ion-beam transmission electron microscopy (FIB-TEM), by X-ray diffraction crystallography (XRD) and by naked-eye analysis.\nWe found extremely thin shear zones (<4µm) along which several samples broke, revealing slickensides. BIB-SEM and FIB-TEM showed that these thin shear zones comprise strongly aligned nano-sized clay particles. The porosity of the shear zones is dramatically reduced compared to the protolith. The strong alignment of clay particles, which wrap larger grains as quartz, calcite fossils and feldspar, yields a shiny, smooth surface morphology of the slickensides. Occasionally, calcite and celestite veins are associated to releasing sections such as risers of the slickenside. Gouge comprises much finer particles, a higher fabric intensity and a strong reduction in porosity and calcite content compared to the protolith. These findings suggest that gouge evolved by a cataclastic deformation mechanism aided by pressure solution of calcite. Scaly clay occurs in varying intensity and comprises thin shear zones, which sometimes act as flexural-slip faults of microfolds and C'-type shear bands.\nWe propose that next to cataclastic processes, pressure solution and precipitation are important micro-scale mechanisms in faulting in Opalinus Clay and thus need to be considered in extrapolating laboratory results to long-term mechanical behavior.",

The analytical results revealed an increasing trend of the air temperature in the last several decades, but decreasing trends for streamflow and precipitation. This paper demonstrates the application of TOPMODEL, a rainfall-runoff model to simulate runoff of the Jinghe River Basin. Global climate model participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5) has been used to project climate change of the Jinghe River Basin, by the year 2050. The projected temperature and precipitation were integrated into TOPMODEL to simulate runoff under future climate conditions. The projections show that the Jinghe River Basin tends to become warmer. Annual average maximum and minimum temperature would rise by 4.2℃ and 3.8 ℃ under RCP8.5 in the 2040s. Annual precipitation would also increase by 32 mm-68 mm under both scenarios, notably by 68 mm in 2030s under RCP8.5. The change in spring precipitation is most significant with an increase by 8%-29%. Annual average runoff is likely to increase about by -3%, -1% and 1% in the 2020s, 2030s and the 2040s under RCP 8.5 and by 2%, -8% and 15% under RCP 4.5 relative to the baseline (1990-2010).",

            "abstract": "In modern marine and marginal marine sediments, bacterial sulfate reduction dominates the subsurface oxidation of organic carbon due to the abundance of sulfate in many surface environments. While bacterial sulfate reduction may control anaerobic organic carbon oxidation, there is increasing evidence that iron redox chemistry may be intimately linked to sulfur redox chemistry in the anoxic subsurface, with iron species acting as catalysts or electron shuttles for the microbial use of sulfur, and vice versa. We use stable isotope and geochemical techniques to explore the coupling of the iron and sulfur cycles in salt marsh sediments in North Norfolk, UK. Unique among previously studied environments, these sediments contain high concentrations of both sulfate (20-40mM) and ferrous iron (1-3mM). High ferrous iron concentrations require extended regions of bacterial iron reduction. Within these zones of iron reduction we would predict no sulfate reduction, and lack of change in sulfur isotopes and no loss of sulfate suggest that there is no net sulfate reduction in this zone. However, coincident with the increase in ferrous iron concentrations, the δ18Osulfate exhibits significant increases of up to 5‰.\nThe decoupling of the sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate is suggestive of a cryptic sulfur cycle in which sulfate is reduced to an intermediate valence state sulfur species and subsequently reoxidized to sulfate; this cycle must by quasi-quantitative to produce the suite of geochemical observations. We further explore the nature of this cycling through a series of batch reactor incubation experiments. When sediments are incubated in 18O-enriched water, significant shifts (>15‰) in the δ18Osulfate are observed with no corresponding shift in sulfur isotopes. This provides direct evidence that microbial assemblages in these salt marsh sediments facilitate a cryptic cycling of sulfur, potentially mediated by iron species in the zone of iron reduction. We contrast this with incubations where labile organic carbon is added; in these incubations sulfate is depleted within one month and methane is produced. We suggest that the cryptic iron-sulfur cycle observed could play a part in keeping these salt marsh sediments poised at iron reduction and thus prevent these vast areas from becoming sources of methane.",

The slit on the high resolution near infrared spectrometer (NIRSPEC; (R~25,000) was aligned pole-to-pole along Saturn’s rotational axis at local noon. This is also aligned (within uncertainties) to the effectively dipolar magnetic field. Four polar/auroral regions of Saturn’s ionosphere were measured simultaneously as the planet rotated: 1) the northern noon main auroral oval; 2) the northern midnight main oval; 3) the northern polar cap and 4) the southern main oval at noon. The results here contain twenty-three H3+ temperatures, column densities and total emissions located at the above regions spread over timescales of both hours and days. The main findings of this study are that ionospheric temperatures in the northern main oval are cooler than their southern counterparts by tens of K; supportive of the hypothesis that the total thermospheric heating rate (Joule heating and ion drag) is inversely proportional to magnetic field strength. The main oval H3+ density and emission is lower at northern midnight than at noon, and this is in agreement with an electron influx peaking at 08:00 Saturn local time and having a minimum at midnight. When ordering the northern main oval parameters of H3+ as a function of the oscillation period seen in Saturn’s magnetic field - the planetary period oscillation (PPO) phase - we see a large peak in H3+ density and emission at ∼110° phase, with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼40°. This seems to indicate that the influx of electrons associated with the PPO phase at 90° is responsible at least in part for the behavior of all H3+ parameters. In addition to the auroral/polar data we also present the latest results from observations of Saturn’s mid-to-low latitude H3+ emission. This emission is thought to be modulated by charged water product influx which flows into the planet along magnetic field lines from Saturn’s rings, i.e. ring rain.\nFigure:\nH3+ Q(1,0) parameters as a functon of northern PPO phase.

            "abstract": "The Bação, Bonfim and Belo Horizonte domes are the largest domes in the Archaean Southern São Francisco craton (Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Brazil). These domes are mainly formed by fine-grained banded gneisses typically intruded by leucogranitic veins and by weakly foliated granites, cropping out as large batholiths and small scale-domains closely associated to the gneisses. Granites and gneisses have high silica content (70-76 wt%), K2O ranging from 2wt% to 6wt%, Sr from 600 to 40 ppm and La/Yb from 150 to 5. Based on their K2O/Na2O ratios, these rocks are subdivided in three groups: sodic (K2O/Na2O≤0.7), transitional (0.7<K2O/Na2O<1.1) and potassic (K2O/Na2O≥1.1). There is no direct relationship between the metamorphic overprint (granites vs. gneisses) and the K2O/Na2O ratio; e.g. granites plots equally in the sodic and potassic groups. Overall, the composition of gneisses and granitoids in the three domes marks the transition between Archean TTGs and modern calc-alkalic granitoids. LA-ICP-MS zircon U–Pb data allow three main periods of magmatism to be defined. The oldest recorded magmatic contribution to the craton began at 3200 Ma, as attested by the occurrence of inherited zircons in younger granitoids as well as by the fact that zircons with a ca. 3200 Ma age represent a significant subset in the detrital zircon population of the greenstone belt. Subsequent magmatic events took place at 2930-2870 Ma and 2780-2700 Ma. The geochronological data reveal that, although the sodic rocks represent a greater proportion of the older gneisses, sodic, transitional and potassic granitoids intruded contemporaneously. The geochemistry of sodic and transitional granites and gneisses suggests that they formed by partial melting of TTG source rocks that are not preserved in the rock record. MC-ICP-MS Hf isotope data on magmatic zircon, suggesting crustal reworking with minor or no involvement of juvenile magmas, support this interpretation. Further recycling of sodic-transitional gneisses does not account for the genesis of potassic granitoids whose origin requires the participation of magmas derived by metasedimentary source rocks.",

Previous MMCO modeling has been unsuccessful in trying to replicate the mid-latitude warmth at reconstructed CO2 levels through changing ice sheets, orbital variability, vegetation, sea-ways, and other boundary conditions. Several hypotheses have been invoked to explain the discrepancy. These include, our inability to identify missing paleo-climate forcing, models lacking sufficient positive feedbacks, or misinterpretation of the signals in proxy records.\nHere we explore two mechanisms which could be important in our understanding of past warmth of the MMCO. First, we employ the recently released Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in fully coupled mode, which has higher sensitivity to CO2 forcing than its predecessor CAM4. Second, we explore the significance of changing aerosols within the CAM5 model framework, which includes cloud aerosols indirect effects in its cloud microphysical schemes.\nPreliminary results in comparison to compiled MMCO proxy records show that CAM5 is a better match at specific locations and in the mean annual when compared to CAM4. Specifically, a reduction of aerosol concentrations within CAM5 produces additional warming in the high latitudes. While the higher sensitivity to CO2 forcing, in CAM5, induces a general increase in the mean annual temperature in the simulation. The combination of these two forcings is able to keep the CAM5 MMCO simulations relatively sea-ice free year round.",

            "abstract": "We determined U-Pb ages of zircons from core samples of IODP Exp. 322 using the laser abrasion ICP-MS (VG Plasma Quad 3 with New Wave Research UP-213). Zircon crystals were separated from four felsic tuffs from the Unit V of Site C0011, and a volcaniclastic turbidite sandstone of the lowermost horizon of the Unit V of Site C0012. Both of the drilling sites are located off the Nankai trough on the Shikoku Basin of the Philippine Sea plate, southwest Japan. Zircons from two felsic tuffs from Site C0011 are euhedral crystals, and most of their 238U-206Pb ages range 13 – 16 Ma. Weighted means of the 238U-206Pb ages of these samples are ca. 14.3 Ma. The other two felsic tuffs include zircon grains with older ages (80 – 260 Ma), however, weighted means of the 238U-206Pb ages of population with young ages ranges 14.5 – 14.7 Ma. These ages are coincide with those of the intense felsic magmatism occurred in the forearc region of southwest Japan (14 – 15 Ma) just after the opening of the Japan Sea and consequent clockwise rotation of the southwest Japan. Some of the felsic igneous bodies of the middle Miocene southwest Japan ejected large amount of felsic materials resulting caldera formation. So the provenance of felsic tuffs from the core of the Site C0011 are presumed to be one of the felsic igneous bodies of the forearc region of southwest Japan.\nTurbidite sandstone from Site C0012 also includes Miocene zircon grains of which their weighted mean of the 238U-206Pb ages is ca. 14.2 Ma. Moreover turbidite sandstone contains zircons with various ages (19 – 2500 Ma). One of the possible origin of such old zircon grains is reworking from sediments of the accretionary complex in the forearc of southwest Japan. If we assume the present rate of convergence of the Philippine sea plate (ca. 4 cm/y) is invariant, the turbidite including both clastic sediment and coeval felsic igneous materials traveled ca. 600 km across the trench.",

            "abstract": "Lake Victoria (LV) is an important freshwater resource in East Africa, covering 68,800 km2, and a catchment that spans 193,000km2. It is an important source of food, energy, drinking and irrigation water, transport and a repository for agricultural, human and industrial wastes generated from its catchment. For such a lake, and a catchment transcending 5 international boundaries, collecting data to guide informed decision making is a hard task. Remote sensing is currently the only tool capable of providing information on environmental changes at high spatio-temporal scales. To address the problem of information availability for LV, we tackled two objectives; (1) we analyzed water quality parameters retrieved from MODIS data, and (2) assessed land cover changes in the catchment area using Landsat data. We used L1A MODIS-Aqua data to retrieve lake surface temperature (LST), total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a (CHLa) and diffuse attenuation coefficient (KD490) in four temporal periods i.e. daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal scales. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was done on monthly data. An analysis of land cover change was done using Landsat data for 3 epochs in order to assess if land degradation contributes to water quality changes. Our results indicate that MODIS-Aqua data provides synoptic views of water quality changes in LV at different temporal scales. The Winam Gulf in Kenya, the shores of Jinja town in Uganda, as well as the Mwanza region in Tanzania represent water quality hotspots due to their relatively high TSM and CHLa concentrations. High levels of KD490 in these areas would also indicate high turbidity and thus low light penetration due to the presence of suspended matter, algal blooms, and/or submerged vegetation. The EOF analysis underscores the areas where LST and water color variability are more significant. The changes can be associated with corresponding land use changes in the catchment, where for instance wetlands are converted to croplands. On-going dissemination of our findings together with capacity building efforts with the three main fishery and research institutions working in the lake, will enable informed decision making for the water management of LV. Enhanced capacity in trans-boundary water resources research is critical for successful decision making.",

            "abstract": "The Fraser River Basin (FRB) is the largest river draining to the Pacific Ocean in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and it provides the world’s most abundant salmon populations. With recent climate change, the shifting hydrologic regime of the FRB is evaluated using hydrological modeling results over the period 1949 to 2006. To quantify the contribution of snowmelt to runoff generation, the ratio RSR, defined as the division of the sum of the snowmelt across the watershed by the integrated runoff over the water year, is employed. Modeled results for RSR at Hope, BC — the furthest downstream hydrometric station of the FRB — show a significant decrease (from 0.80 to 0.65) in the latter part of the 20th century. RSR is found to be mainly suppressed by a decrease of the snowmelt across the FRB with a decline with 107 mm by 26 % along the simulation period. There is also a prominent shift in the timing of streamflow, with the spring freshet at Hope, BC advancing 30 days followed by reduced summer flows for over two months. The timing of the peak spring freshet becomes even earlier when moving upstream of the FRB owing to short periods of time after melting from the snow source to the rivers.",

            "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly apparent that the winter season of high latitudes can be important for controlling a range of ecological and biogeochemical properties of northern ecosystems. Here we evaluate the importance of winter conditions on the carbon exchange between boreal forest systems and the atmosphere during the following growing season in order to elucidate any influence of inter-seasonal “memory” effects on carbon exchange properties of boreal forest ecosystems. The study is based on 5 years of continuous eddy covariance measurements at two ca 50 year old Norway spruce stands situated in mid- and northern Sweden, respectively (a total of 10 site years).\nThe growing season net ecosystem exchange (NEE) ranged from -530 to -60 g C m-2 (negative values indicates carbon sinks). Environmental conditions during the growing season (e.g. temperature, radiation, length) only weakly explained the year-to-year variability in NEE. In contrast, up to 75% of the variation could be explained by the severity of the preceding winter (defined as the lowest observed average weekly air temperature) using an exponential response function. After warm winters the carbon sink properties were high as compared to those observed after cold winters. The winter conditions markedly affected the systems potential for carbon uptake in early summer.\nThis presentation will address the potential mechanisms underpinning the observed correlations linking growing season carbon exchange to the conditions of the preceding winter. The influence of winter on the partitioned carbon fluxes of ecosystem respiration and gross primary productivity, respectively, will also be addressed. The results strongly indicate that controls on boreal forest carbon exchange can transcend across seasons. Understanding these mechanisms are integral for understanding the environmental drivers of atmospheric carbon exchange, allowing for accurate predictions of boreal forest NEE under both present and future climates.",

            "abstract": "Arc magmas are widely considered to be oxidized, with elevated ferric iron contents (Fe3+/ΣFe) relative to mid-ocean ridge lavas (\n1\n,\n2\n). However, it is unclear whether the oxidized nature of arc basalts is a primary feature, inherited from the sub-arc mantle, or the product of magmatic differentiation and/or post eruptive alteration processes (\n3\n).\nIron stable isotopes can be used to trace the distribution of Fe during melting and magmatic differentiation processes (4, 5). Here we present Fe isotope data for well-characterized samples (6-8) from islands of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the intra-oceanic Mariana Arc to explore the effect of magmatic differentiation processes on Fe isotope systematics.\nThe overall variation in the Fe isotope compositions (δ57Fe) of samples from the CVZ islands ranges from -0.10 ±0.04 to 0.29 ± 0.01 ‰. Lavas from Anatahan are displaced to lower overall δ57Fe values (range -0.10 ±0.04 to 0.18 ±0.01 ‰) relative to other CVZ samples. Fe isotopes in the Anatahan suite (range -0.10 ±0.04 to 0.18 ±0.01 ‰) are positively correlated with SiO2 and negatively correlated with Ca, Fe2O3(t), Cr and V and are displaced to lower overall δ57Fe values relative to other CVZ samples. These correlations can be interpreted in terms of clinopyroxene and magnetite fractionation, with magnetite saturation throughout the differentiation sequence. Magnetite saturation is further supported by negative correlations between V, Fe2O3(t), Cr and MgO (for MgO <3.5 wt%). The early saturation of magnetite in the Anatahan and CVZ lavas is likely to be a function of high melt water content (9, 10) and potentially elevated melt oxidation state. Future work will focus on determining the relationships between mineral Fe isotope partitioning effects and melt composition and oxidation state.\n1. R. Arculus, Lithos (1994).\n2. K. A.

            "abstract": "With the proliferation of broadband recordings from volcanoes, it has become clear that conduit processes produce seismic signals with an extensive range of frequencies. Near the low corner of broadband instruments, the affects of ground rotation can be significant; rotation dominates at periods below the corner. Unraveling the relative influence of translation and rotation on recordings of very-long-period (12 - 120 s) and ultra-long-period (120-600 s) events is an important challenge, because including tilt in inversion of VLP and ULP signals associated with small eruptions can provide constraints on the dynamics of conduit processes. At Fuego volcano in Guatemala, we recorded hundreds of small-scale explosions in field campaigns since 2008 using temporary arrays of seismometers, tiltmeters and microbarometers. Explosions are frequently preceded by 5 to 20 minutes of tilt, indicative of pressurization of the upper conduit. The onset of explosive eruptions, which last from many tens of seconds to more than two minutes, include VLPs with peak periods from less than 30 to nearly 50 seconds. The events are dominated by ash emission that suggests a vulcanian-style downward migration of the magma fragmentation front. Joint inversions of the seismic and tilt signals using synthetic tilt and displacement Green functions provides a more complete view of the eruption process at Fuego. Inversions without tilt point to a source centroid 200 m west of and 300 m below the vent. When lower frequencies are included in the inversion, the source centroid shallows and moves east to a position directly below the vent. We interpret this to reflect a process where the vent seals and pressurizes, producing the ULP signal. The VLP signal results from a rapid change in the deformation of the upper few hundred meters of the conduit due to the ejection of magma during the explosion.",

            "abstract": "The water content of aerosols is largely governed by relative humidity (RH). As the relative humidity decreases, and thus the water content of aerosols, a number of processes occur including the shrinking of aerosols, the increase in concentration of components, and potentially the formation of liquid liquid phase separation (llps) due to the salting out of inorganic salts. The most ubiquitous salt in atmospheric aerosols is ammonium sulfate which results in many aerosols to be at least mildly acidic. However, during llps, the pH of the different phases is not necessarily the same. Many reactions that take place within atmospheric aerosols are acid catalyzed so a better understanding of the pH of the individual phases as well as the interface between the phases is important to understanding aerosol processing and aging. Through the use of pH sensitive dyes and confocal microscopy we have directly measured the pH of micron sized model aerosols during high RH where the aerosols are in a single phase, at intermediate while the aerosols are in llps, and low RH where the aerosols consist of one liquid phase and one solid phase. We will discuss the variation in RH during these different phase states in the presence and absence of excess sulfuric acid. We will also discuss how this variation in pH affects aging of aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Resource assessments for low-grade geothermal applications employ available well temperature measurements to determine if the resource potential is sufficient for supporting district heating opportunities. This study used a compilation of bottomhole temperature (BHT) data from recent unconventional shale oil and gas wells, along with legacy oil, gas, and storage wells, in Pennsylvania (PA) and New York (NY). Our study’s goal was to predict the geothermal resource potential and associated uncertainty for the NY-PA region using kriging interpolation. The dataset was scanned for outliers, and some observations were removed. Because these wells were drilled for reasons other than geothermal resource assessment, their spatial density varied widely. An exploratory spatial statistical analysis revealed differences in the spatial structure of the geothermal gradient data (the kriging semi-variogram and its nugget variance, shape, sill, and the degree of anisotropy). As a result, a stratified kriging procedure was adopted to better capture the statistical structure of the data, to generate an interpolated surface, and to quantify the uncertainty of the computed surface. The area was stratified reflecting different physiographic provinces in NY and PA that have geologic properties likely related to variations in the value of the geothermal gradient. The kriging prediction and the variance-of-prediction were determined for each province by the generation of a semi-variogram using only the wells that were located within that province. A leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was conducted as a diagnostic tool. The results of stratified kriging were compared to kriging using the whole region to determine the impact of stratification. The two approaches provided similar predictions of the geothermal gradient. However, the variance-of-prediction was different. The stratified approach is recommended because it gave a more appropriate site-specific characterization of uncertainty based upon a more realistic description of the statistical structure of the data given the geologic characteristics of each province.",

            "abstract": "The recently launched NASA OCO-2 satellite is expected to provide important information about the carbon dioxide distribution in the troposphere down to Earth’s surface. Among the challenges in accurately retrieving CO2 concentration from the hyperspectral observations in each of the three OCO-2 bands are cloud and aerosol impacts on the observed radiances. Preliminary studies based on idealized cloud fields have shown that they can lead to spectrally dependent radiance perturbations which differ from band to band and may lead to biases in the derived products. Since OCO-2 was inserted into the A-Train, it is only natural to capitalize on sensor synergies with other instruments, in this case on the cloud and aerosol scene context that is provided by MODIS and CALIOP. Our approach is to use cloud imagery (especially for inhomogeneous scenes) for predicting the hyperspectral observations within a collocated OCO-2 footprint and comparing with the observations, which allows a systematic assessment of the causes for biases in the retrievals themselves, and their manifestation in spectral residuals for various different cloud types and distributions. Simulating a large number of cases with line-by-line calculations using a 3D code is computationally prohibitive even on large parallel computers. Therefore, we developed a number of acceleration approaches. In this contribution, we will analyze them in terms of their speed and accuracy, using cloud fields from airborne imagery collected during a recent NASA field experiment (SEAC4RS) as proxy for different types of inhomogeneous cloud fields. The broader goal of this effort is to improve OCO-2 retrievals in the vicinity of cloud fields, and to extend the range of conditions under which the instrument will provide useful results.",

            "abstract": "Despite the important increase of the computational power in the last decades, simulating the seismic wave propagation through realistic geological models is still a challenge. By realistic models we here mean 3D media in which a broad variety (in terms of amplitude and extent) of heterogeneities lies, including discontinuities with complex geometry such as faulted and folded horizons, intrusive geological contacts and fault systems. To perform accurate numerical simulations, these discontinuities require complicated meshes which usually contain extremely small elements, yielding large, sometimes prohibitive, computation costs. Fortunately, the recent development of the non-periodic homogenization technique now enables to overcome this problem by computing smooth equivalent models for which a coarse mesh is sufficient to get an accurate wavefield.\nIn this work, we present an efficient implementation of the technique which now allows for the homogenization of large 3D geological models. This implementation relies on a tetrahedral finite-element solution of the elasto-static equation behind the homogenization problem. Because this equation is time-independent, solving it is numerically cheaper than solving the wave equation, but it nevertheless requires some care because of the large size of the stiffness matrix arising from the fine mesh of realistic geological structures. A domain decomposition is therefore adopted. In our strategy, the obtained sub-domains overlap but they are independent so the solution within each of them can be computed either in series or in parallel. In addition, well-balanced loads, efficient search algorithms and multithreading are implemented to speed up the computation. The resulting code enables the homogenization of 3D elastic media in a time that is neglectable with respect to the simulation time of the wave propagation within. This is illustrated through a sub-surface model of the Furfooz karstic region, Belgium.",

In a 2-D numerical simulation (noon-midnight meridian plane), we solve the continuity, momentum, and energy equations for multiple species of ions and neutrals and Maxwell’s equations. In particular, the model retains Faraday’s law, inertial term in the ion momentum equations and photochemistry. The code is based on an implicit algorithm and simulates a region from 80 km to 5000 km above the Earth. The system is driven by an antisunward motion at the upper boundary of the dayside cusp latitude in both hemispheres. We show that the frictional heating, which can produce upflows of the light (H+ and He+) and heave (O+) ions, is driven by the Alfven wave-induced ion motion relative to the neutrals. The variations of the upflows along a noon-midnight magnetic meridian are examined in association with given driving conditions imposed by the magnetosphere convection.",

A multiband quasi analytical algorithm is used to estimate the inherent optical properties of water, and the Bio-optical model based tool is also used to estimate water quality and bottom properties from remote sensing images for chlorophyll a, colored dissolved organic matter, and total suspended sediments concentrations across the Shenandoah River basin using EO-1, Hyperion data and field spectroscopy. Preliminary results show that Chl a concentrations compared with values reported for coastal and inland waters around the world are high in the Shenandoah River with values varying from 0.001 - 12.636 μg/l, with an average concentration of 9.67 μg/l. Total suspended sediment concentration values are in good agreement with the TSS concentrations measured on the field with a range of 0.001 - 3.0227 mg l-1, and, an average concentration of 0.266 mg l-.1. CDOM concentration varies from 0.001 - 0.4 μg/l, with average values of 0.13 and 0.15 μg/l for the South Fork section of the River. Our results also suggests that, the river is dominated by high CDOM absorption, high Chl a concentrations and abnormally high reflection in the red, probably caused by the high concentrations of red clays found in the river since CDOM is a mixture of compounds of terrestrial and marine origins. To validate the performance of our analysis, we used; error, bias and root mean square, and obtained 0.0697 μg/l, 0.0048 μg/l and 0.0174 μg/l respectively, for the River Basin show that the data had sufficient sensitivity to detect optical water quality concentrations.\nKey words: Hyperion, field spectroscopy, inherent optical properties, Bio-optical model Shenandoah River, water quality, chlorophyll a, colored dissolved organic matter, and total suspended sediments.",

Over the past several years, studies have increasingly focused on the potential of external addition of Nd along water mass transport paths (for example through “boundary exchange” with particulates or addition from groundwaters), thus challenging the idea that Nd isotopes behave “quasi-conservatively” in the oceans. The SW Atlantic, with the major water masses involved in the AMOC (southward flowing NADW, northward flowing AAIW and AABW), is arguably the best place on Earth to evaluate how well Nd isotopes trace water mass mixing, in order to clarify its value for following the AMOC through time.\nWe will report Nd isotope ratios of seawater collected on the SW Atlantic meridional transect of the NIOZ West Atlantic GEOTRACES Cruise Leg 3 (RRS James Cook 057), which sampled seawater profiles and the sediment surface at 18 stations between 0-50°S. Most stations are sampled in the open ocean, providing a test of whether Nd isotopes show quasi-conservative mixing systematics away from continental margins. The cruise section also provides several opportunities to test the potential effects of external Nd input. For example, it transects the continental shelf in the far south, the Rio Grande Rise, volcanic seamounts, and the major geological age boundaries of South America. It also crosses the major Southern Hemisphere wind zones, allowing us to test the impacts of aeolian input, and inputs from major rivers (Parana-Paraguay, Sao Francisco, Amazon). All of these features have the potential to modify the seawater Nd isotope ratios, allowing us to determine if they add significant external Nd.",

We report the results extensively on the WURM website (\nhttp://wurm.info\n, Caracas and Bobcioiu, 2011). We find that hydration has a more pronounced effect on the spectroscopic properties than cation replacement. The Raman spectra of all phases present clear SO4 features that are easily identifiable. We use this to show one can use the vibrational spectroscopic information as an identification tool in a remote environment, like the Martian surface.\nBased on the computed vibrational results we analyze the S isotope partitioning. We observe that in general hydration favors enrichment in the lighter S isotope 32S with respect to the heavier 34S, which is accumulated in the less hydrous structures. Thus we show for the first time that the signature of 34S/32S partitioning could be observed by in situ spectroscopy on the surface of Mars.\nFinally we compute hydration energies. For example, in the hydrated magnesium sulfate series we find that epsomite and meridianiite with, respectively 7 and 11 water molecules per MgSO4 unit are particularly stable with respect to other individual or combinations of hydration states (Bobocioiu and Caracas, 2014). This can be related to the diurnal cycle of hydration and dehydration and hence it can improve the modeling of the water circulation on Mars.\n",

            "abstract": "For much of the first 20 years of Kīlauea’s 1983–present ERZ (East Rift Zone) eruption, deformation was characterized by subsidence at the summit and along both rift zones. We speculate that subsidence of the rift zones was caused by deep rift opening and basal fault slip. A 3D Mixed-Boundary Element model including deep rift-zone opening (running from ~3 to 9 km depth beneath Kīlauea’s East and Southwest Rift Zones) as well as slip on the décollement fault that underlies the volcano’s south flank (at ~9 km depth) can indeed explain most of the deformation imaged by InSAR data from RADARSAT-1 and JERS-1 spanning two distinct background periods: 1993-1997 and 2000-2003, respectively.\nAt the end of 2003, however, Kīlauea’s summit began a 4-year-long period of inflation that culminated in an ERZ dike intrusion and small eruption during 17–19 June 2007—the “Father’s Day” (FD) event. On the basis of deformation, seismicity, effusion rate, and lava chemistry and temperature, the FD event was interpreted as the result of forcible intrusion of magma driven by high pressure within the summit magma storage area, as opposed to a passive response to deep rift zone opening. This period of summit inflation is particularly interesting in 2006. According to daily GPS data, two distinct periods can be defined, spanning January to March 2006 and March to end of 2006. A major seismic swarm occurred during the first period while the south caldera area was inflating. The beginning of the second period corresponds to a switch from subsidence to inflation of the SWRZ (Southwest Rift Zone). The SWRZ had been subsiding since the last eruptive episode there in 1974, with the exception of a few dike injections in 1981-82. To investigate the magmatic processes which occurred during 2006 and their implications in terms of the magma plumbing system and local stress field, we integrate contemporary geodetic data from InSAR and GPS with seismic and geologic observations of the SWRZ.",

            "abstract": "Mining and processing of uranium (U) ore for nuclear energy and weapons has led to U contamination of groundwater. Reduction of soluble, mobile U(VI) to UO2 decreases uranium groundwater concentrations and is an important driver of natural and stimulated attenuation. 238U/235U measurements can be used to monitor and perhaps quantify U(VI) reduction; biological reduction of U(VI) has been shown to produce a ~1.0‰ isotopic fractionation in both laboratory and field settings, with the reduced product enriched in 238U. However, adsorption of U(VI) onto minerals may complicate the use of 238U/235U in this application; adsorption of U(VI) onto Mn oxides induces an isotopic fractionation of 0.2‰ with the sorbed U(VI) depleted in 238U. At present, the isotopic shift produced by adsorption of U(VI) onto other minerals has not yet been explored.\nThis study measures U isotopic fractionation during adsorption onto goethite, birnessite, quartz, illite, and complex aquifer materials. In addition, the effect of U speciation on fractionation is also examined by adsorption of uranyl (UO22+), uranyl carbonato (such as UO2(CO3)22− and UO2(CO3)34−), and calcium uranyl carbonato (Ca2UO2(CO3)3(aq) and CaUO2(CO3)32−) ions to goethite and birnessite. Experiments are carried out with a multi-stage, batch approach, in which a U(VI)-bearing solution is exposed to three stages of adsorption, and the final solution is analyzed by a double-spike MC-ICP-MS method. This increases our ability to resolve among sorbents the extent of fractionation. Early results suggest that uranium adsorption to different minerals produces different isotopic fractionations, with quartz producing little to no fractionation (<0 .05‰), while goethite produces a 0.16‰ isotopic shift (adsorbed U(VI) depleted in 238U).",

However, it has been proven that knowledge alone does not have enough impact to modify people’s behaviors in emergencies (Oki and Nakayachi, 2012). On the other hand, the conventional approach taken by practitioners had been to conduct emergency drills at schools or workplaces. The loss of many lives from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake has proven that these emergency drills were not enough to save people’s lives, unless they were empowered to assess the given situation on their own and react flexibly.\nOur challenge is to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice. With reference to best practices observed in Tohoku, such as The Miracles of Kamaishi, our endeavor is to design an effective Disaster Preparedness Education Program that is applicable to other disaster-prone regions in the world, even with different geological, socio-economical and cultural backgrounds.\nThe key concepts for this new approach are 1) empowering individuals to take preventive actions to save their lives, 2) granting community-based understanding of disaster risks and 3) building a sense of reality and relevancy to disasters.\nWith these in mind, we held workshops at some high schools in the Lesser Himalayan Region, combining lectures with an activity called “Hazard Map Making” where students proactively identify and assess the hazards around their living areas and learn practical strategies on how to manage risks.\nWe observed the change of awareness of the students by conducting a preliminary questionnaire survey and interviews after each session. Results strongly implied that the significant change of students’ attitudes towards disaster preparedness occurred not by the lectures of scientific knowledge, but after completing the whole program of activities. Students closed their presentation by spontaneously adding messages to others about importance of life and preparedness.\nIn this presentation, we share good practices in terms of program design and facilitation that encouraged the transition of participants from a learner to an actor.",

            "abstract": "Some salt deposits contain the valuable magnesium and potassium salts bischofite and carnallite, as well as halite, in the form of pure and mixed layers. During extraction of such salts from the subsurface by solution mining, the material in the undissolved walls will flow into the caverns. In order to accurately predict the flow of wall rock material, feasible production rates and related subsidence, a good understanding of the creep behaviour of bischofite, carnallite and mixed salt rocks under in situ conditions is required.\nWe have conducted conventional triaxial compression tests on polycrystalline bischofite, carnallite and mixed bischofite-carnallite-halite rock samples machined from natural cores. The experiments were carried out at true in situ P-T conditions of 70°C and 40 MPa confining pressure. All experiments consisted of strain rate stepping runs, applying strain rates in the range 10-5 to 10-8 s-1, reaching 2-4% axial strain per step, with individual steps being followed by stress relaxation down to strain rates ~10-9 s-1.\nBoth bischofite and carnallite reached near steady state creep behaviour within each constant strain rate step. Carnallite was found to be 4-5 times stronger than bischofite. For bischofite as well as carnallite, we observed that during stress relaxation, the conventional power law stress exponent n changed from ~5 at 10-5 to ~1 at 10-9 s-1. The absolute strength of both materials remained higher if the relaxation started at a higher stress, i.e. at a faster rate. We interpret this as indicating a difference in microstructure at the initiation of the relaxation, notably a smaller grain size related to dynamical recrystallization during the constant strain rate step. The data thus suggest that there is gradual change in mechanism with decreasing strain rate, from grain size insensitive dislocation creep to grain size sensitive (pressure solution) creep. The mixed bischofite-carnallite-halite salt rock did not approach steady state creep within individual steps. The overall strength of the mixed material was 1.3-1.5 times that of carnallite at the faster strain rates, increasing to 2.5-3.5 times at the slower rates. The strength of the mixed material is also slightly higher than that of wet synthetic polycrystalline halite under the same conditions.",

However, the role of vegetation remains a poorly constrained component of existing landscape evolution models. We investigate the role of vegetation in soil production, and how it impacts the hillslope response to changes in channel incision rates using a combination of: (i) empirical observations of coupled ecological and geomorphological changes across topographic knickzones in the Californian Sierra Nevada, obtained from airborne LiDAR data, and (ii) numerical experiments that explicitly incorporate tree throw as a soil production mechanism. The results suggest that the ecological response to changing erosion rates may play a significant role in modulating the evolution of hillslopes adjusting to more rapid rates of fluvial incision, impacting on the nature of the soil-bedrock transition.",

In particular, the accurate representation of non-linear tides, such as quater-diurnal and higher-frequency components, and of their loading effects is a challenging task to be accomplished in the next years.\nThe Canfranc underground laboratory (LSC), excavated in the rock under the Central Pyrenees (Spain), is mainly devoted to the study of phenomena which needs “cosmic silence”, as the detection of cosmic neutrinos or “dark matter” particles, but, as the site is located in one of the most active seismic areas in Western Europe, it also hosts a geodynamic facility capable to record the whole geodynamic spectrum, from near-field seismicity to tectonic deformation, including Earth tides.\nUsing two near-orthogonally-oriented 70-m-long high-resolution laser strainmeters installed at LSC, we have obtained continuous precision measurements of local strain in terms of dL/L, where L is the interferometer length and dL its change over time. The laser strainmeters are operational since early 2012.\nSpectra show clear tidal peaks whose frequencies range from the diurnal band to at least 8 cicles per day (cpd). Tidal peaks at frequencies higher than 2 cpd are ascribable to ocean loading of non-linear constituents, mainly from the Bay of Biscay. Strain amplitudes of observed non-linear tides range from few 10^-12 (e. g. 3*M2+K2) to 4x10^-10 (M4).\nWe will show comparisons between observations and predicted strain tides, computed using ocean-tide loading programs included in the SPOTL package (Agnew, 2013) and two ocean tidal models, namely TPXO8-atlas (enriched with the European Shelf 2008 regional solution) and FES2012.\nIn particular, M4, MS4, and MN4 will be compared with predictions by both ocean tidal models, while MKS2 (semidiurnal band), N4, and M6 will be compared with predictions by FES2012 only.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic rise in the magnitude of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in western Lake Erie. These cyanobacteria blooms have drawn attention to phosphorus loading, a common driver of freshwater productivity. However, it is unclear how much of the year-to-year variability in bloom size is explained by anthropogenic phosphorus loading, and how much variability is related to other factors, including weather/climate drivers and measurement error. Here, we aim to advance the state-of-the-art in HAB forecasting by explicitly quantifying uncertainties in late-summer bloom observations, and propagating them through a Bayesian modeling framework that relates bloom size to phosphorus load. Because of the need to accurately represent predictive uncertainty, different statistical formulations are critically evaluated through cross validation. A model based on a novel implementation of a gamma error distribution is found to provide the most realistic uncertainty characterization, as well as high predictive skill. Our results also underscore the benefits of a hierarchical approach that allows us to assimilate data sets from multiple sources. Finally, our modeling analysis suggests that Lake Erie has become increasingly susceptible to large cyanobacteria blooms. We explore the nature of this change and assess potential biophysical explanations.",

            "abstract": "Drought conditions caused by soaring temperatures and decreasing amounts of precipitation continue to plague the particularly heavily cultivated areas of California. Research efforts from state and federal government stakeholders are ongoing to track, quantify, and forecast the impact of these changing conditions. For the State of California, beginning in 2007, the US Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) annually began using remote sensing techniques to produce a geospatial agricultural land cover classification data product called the Cropland Data Layer (CDL). The CDL is produced using current farmer reported data in conjunction with satellite imagery collected during the summer growing season each year to identify the type and location of multiple categories of land cover across the state. Tracking the impact of drought conditions on agriculture in California can be done by analyzing the land cover category for fallow and idle agricultural land within the CDL. Using multiple years of CDLs, profiles are created to document the different characteristics of fallow land across the agricultural landscape including NDVI measurements, average field sizes, and total acreage amounts in each county. The fallow land profiles also detail the increasing amount of fallow land appearing in what was historically agricultural intensive areas, as well as what types of land cover are being replaced with fallow land instead of being cultivated during the growing season. Understanding the dynamic changes of fallowing land in each county helps researchers quantify the agricultural impact and assist with mitigation efforts caused by the water shortages.",

The hypothesis is that Fe3+ generated from Cr(VI) reduction process acts as electron acceptor and catalyst for Fenton’s Phenol oxidation process. The Fe2+ formed from Fenton reactions can be reused for Cr(VI) reduction. Thus iron can be made to recycle between two reactions, changing back and forth between Fe2+ and Fe3+ forms, makes treatment sustainable.(Fig 1) This approach advances current Fenton like oxidation process by (i)single system removal of heavy metal and organic matter (ii)recycling of iron species; hence no additional iron required (iii)more contaminant removal to ZVI ratio (iv)eliminating sludge related issues.\nPreliminary batch studies were conducted at different modes i) concurrent removal ii) sequential removal. The sequential removal was found better for in-situ PRB applications. PRB was designed based on kinetic rate slope and half-life time, obtained from primary column study. This PRB has two segments (i)ZVI segment[Cr(VI)] (ii)iron species segment[phenol]. This makes treatment sustainable by (i) having no iron ions in outlet stream (ii)meeting hypothesis and elongates the life span of PRB. Sequential removal of contaminates were tested in pilot scale PRB(Fig 2) and its life span was calculated based on the exhaustion of filling material. Aqueous, sand and iron aliquots were collected at various segments of PRB and analyzed for precipitation and chemical speciation thoroughly (UV spectrometer, XRD, FTIR, electron microscope). Chemical speciation profile eliminates the uncertainties over in-situ PRB’s long term performance.\nBased on the pilot scale PRB study, ‘field level PRB wall construction’ was suggested to remove heavy metal and organic compounds from Pallikaranai marshland(Fig 3)., which is contaminated with leachate coming from nearby Perungudi dumpsite. This research provides (i)deeper insight into the environmental friendly, accelerated, sustainable technique for combined removal of organic matter and heavy metal (ii)evaluation of the novel technique in PRB, which resulted in PRB’s increased life span (iii)designing of PRB to remediate the marshland and its ecosystem, thus save the habitats related to it.",

During the YD the West Highlands Ice-cap covered the majority of the Scottish Highlands (c. 13,000 sq mi), which is thought to have affected accumulation rates beyond the ice-cap margins, resulting in a steep (c. 80%) easterly decline in precipitation and smaller ice-masses.\nWe present multi-proxy data investigating YD glaciation in the Tweedsmuir Hills, Southern Uplands, Scotland (55°46’ N, 03°34’ W), suggesting conditions were less arid. The area forms the most easterly upland region in the Southern Uplands and south of the West Highlands Ice-cap, reaching an altitude of 840 m and covering c. 200 sq mi. Results of air-photo interpretation and field mapping, which utilised a morphostratigraphic approach, have demonstrated a more extensive glaciation than previously mapped. The reconstruction consists of two separate icefields covering an area c. 40 sq mi. and new 14C dates of basal contact organics place the ice-mass within the context of the YD but new Cosmogenic Nuclide Analysis (CNA) of bedrock and in situ boulders are inconclusive, implying limited erosion and limited resetting during the YD.\nEquilibrium Line Altitudes are calculated to have ranged from c. 419 - 634 m. Paleo-precipitation values were derived using two precipitation-temperature relationships and suggest slightly lower totals than YD ice-masses located on the west coast of the U.K. but do not support a significant easterly reduction in precipitation. Analysis of present-day (c. 30 year) meteorological data across the U.K. demonstrates a pronounced reduction in precipitation of c. 50% on the east coast. This disparity between present-day and glacier-based YD precipitation patterns is partly attributable to the methodology employed in glacier reconstruction and represents an avenue for future research. These results differ significantly from the traditional paradigm which due to low accumulation rates, only restricted ice-masses developed in the Tweedsmuir Hills. Within a wider context this data questions the steep precipitation gradients thought to have been present during the YD.",

            "abstract": "Increased frequency of extreme precipitations, especially those with multiday durations, are responsible for recent urban floods and associated significant losses of lives and infrastructures in Bangladesh. Reliable and routinely updated estimation of the frequency of occurrence of such extreme precipitation events are thus important for developing up-to-date hydraulic structures and stormwater drainage system that can effectively minimize future risk from similar events. In this study, we have updated the intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curves for Bangladesh using daily precipitation data from 1961 to 2010 and quantified associated uncertainties. Regional frequency analysis based on L-moments is applied on 1-day, 2-day and 5-day annual maximum precipitation series due to its advantages over at-site estimation. The regional frequency approach pools the information from climatologically similar sites to make reliable estimates of quantiles given that the pooling group is homogeneous and of reasonable size. We have used Region of influence (ROI) approach along with homogeneity measure based on L-moments to identify the homogenous pooling groups for each site. Five 3-parameter distributions (i.e., Generalized Logistic, Generalized Extreme value, Generalized Normal, Pearson Type Three, and Generalized Pareto) are used for a thorough selection of appropriate models that fit the sample data. Uncertainties related to the selection of the distributions and historical data are quantified using the Bayesian Model Averaging and Balanced Bootstrap approaches respectively. The results from this study can be used to update the current design and management of hydraulic structures as well as in exploring spatio-temporal variations of extreme precipitation and associated risk.",

However to better understand large system responses to human impacts such an analysis is called for.\nOur objective is to organize a rigorous analysis of the potential hydro-physical impacts of dams on the major sub-basins of the Amazon. We are incorporating existing data of sediment fluxes, deforestation and land-use land-change to include the entire extent of the basin as defined by the fluvial unit. In addition, we will be analyzing the spatial distributions of dams (planned, under construction, and constructed) within each sub-basin. Our preliminary results have used statistical analysis and remote sensing to calculate the extent of deforestation on fluvial regimes of the legal Amazon and concentrated to identify the potential disruptions of sediment fluxes.\nCombining the spatial distributions of dam sites, and deforestation per sub-basin we will develop a system to interpret land-use and land-change per catchment.

            "abstract": "The goal of this study is to assess geological storage potential of CO2 in the Miocene Pohang Basin, based on the structural and stratigraphic characteristics with the hydraulic features of the basin-fill and depth distribution of the basement. The basin is a pull-apart basin extended due to NNW-trending dextral strike slip faulting. The western margin of the basin consists of a series of segmented NNE-trending normal faults divided by NNW- or NW-trending dextral strike-slip faults. The southern margin is Yeonil Tectonic Line that is a zigzag-shaped NNW-trending fault zone consisting of NNW-trending dextral strike-slip and NNE-trending normal fault segments. The line connects with the NNE-trending western border faults with an oblique 50° angle. The Ocheon Fault System (OFS), the eastern marginal fault of the basin, is a NE-trending relayed fault system composed of a number of NE or NNE-trending normal-slip and sinistral-normal oblique-slip faults, and has a scissor fault geometry decreasing in vertical offset southwestward. The OFS which acted as initially normal fault experienced clockwise rotation with change of slip sense from normal-slip to sinistral-normal oblique-slip in response to a progressive dextral simple shear. The geometry and kinematics of syndepositional structures as well as the marginal faults indicate a WNW-ESE horizontal minimum stress. Stratigraphic and sedimentologic investigations suggest that dramatic subsidence of the hanging-wall of the western border faults resulted in thick accumulation of fan-delta successions and intervening and/or overlying hemipelagic mudstones. In addition, this study reveals that there are a number of NNE-trending normal faults dipping toward the east inside the basin. Depth distribution of the basement through deep drilling boreholes also supports the existence of the normal faults. These results thus indicate that potential geologic CO2 storage sites in the Pohang basin are located on the easternmost part of the basin along the east coast line. The several columns of the boreholes also show that high porous and permeable coarse sedimentary rocks occur in the depth of 700-900 m, which are overlain by thick low-permeable mudstones. They are thus significantly eligible to be a major reservoir body for CO2 underground storage.",

            "abstract": "Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were introduced as replacements for ozone depleting chlorinated gases due to their negligible ozone depletion potential. As a result, these potent greenhouse gases are now rapidly increasing in atmospheric mole fraction. However, at present, less than 50% of HFC emissions, as inferred from models combined with atmospheric measurements (top-down methods), can be accounted for by the annual national reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). There are at least two possible reasons for the discrepancy. Firstly, significant emissions could be originating from countries not required to report to the UNFCCC (“non-Annex 1” countries). Secondly, emissions reports themselves may be subject to inaccuracies. For example the HFC emission factors used in the ‘bottom-up’ calculation of emissions tend to be technology-specific (refrigeration, air conditioning etc.), but not tuned to the properties of individual HFCs. To provide a new top-down perspective, we inferred emissions using high frequency HFC measurements from the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) and the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) networks. Global and regional emissions information was inferred from these measurements using a coupled Eulerian and Lagrangian system, based on NCAR’s MOZART model and the UK Met Office NAME model. Uncertainties in this measurement and modelling framework were investigated using a hierarchical Bayesian inverse method. Global and regional emissions estimates for five of the major HFCs (HFC-134a, HFC-125, HFC-143a, HFC-32, HFC-152a) from 2004-2012 are presented. It was found that, when aggregated, the top-down estimates from Annex 1 countries agreed remarkably well with the reported emissions, suggesting the non-Annex 1 emissions make up the difference with the top-down global estimate. However, when these HFC species are viewed individually we find that emissions of HFC-134a are over-reported, with all other species being under-reported. Therefore, the approximate agreement between top-down and bottom-up aggregated Annex 1 emissions appears to be the result of a fortuitous cancellation of errors in the individual HFC emissions reports.",

            "abstract": "Whereas meander wavelengths of alluvial rivers characteristically scale with bankfull discharge, bedrock meander wavelengths are typically 5–10 times greater than the scaling relationship for alluvial rivers would suggest, a fact that has led some to conclude that bedrock meanders are “underfit.” Others, however, have reasoned that larger dominant discharges should be expected for bedrock meanders to erode bank toes and mobilize sediment in bank-shielding scree piles, which often accompany steep, even vertical, outside banks capable of supplying coarse debris via landslide, debris flow, and rockfall. We attempt to test this hypothesis by finding dominant discharges for the Buffalo National River, Arkansas, by several methods. First, assuming that, as with alluvial meanders, bedrock meander wavelengths are 7–15 times hydraulic width at dominant discharge, we use cross-sections extracted from LiDAR-derived DEMs to find discharges corresponding to objectively-determined meander wavelengths. Second, assuming that dominant discharge must mobilize scree mantling outer-bank toe slopes, we use measured grain size distributions and cross sections to determine this discharge. For each of these calculated discharges, we use flow-duration curves to find corresponding recurrence intervals. Third, assuming that mean residence times of scree are similar to dominant discharge recurrence intervals, we use measured scree volumes and flux rates inferred from lateral migration rates to find those residence times. Preliminary results for the site with the longest gauge record yield a mean recurrence interval of 26 yrs corresponding to a meander wavelength-to-width scaling ratio of 11 (9–139 yrs for scaling ratios of 7–15). Recurrence intervals found by the other methods await field and cosmogenic isotope concentration measurements.",

            "abstract": "Detailed documentation of the exhumation history of southeastern Tibet is important for understanding of the coupling of tectonic and geomorphic processes shaping this landscape. We present K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar multi-diffusion domain model analysis and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology along both horizontal and vertical traverses within Gangdese batholith to constrain the spatial and temporal pattern of exhumation in the region. In conjunction with thermokinematic modeling we use these data to interrogate patterns of regional erosion and test mechanical models of plateau evolution such as delamination, lithospheric-scale folding, and rifting. Previously reported zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He data from a vertical transect west of the Nari Yun Chu Rift indicate a prolonged period of exhumation between ~20 Ma and 12 Ma. To the east, K-feldspar modeling of a sample on the Nyang River shows a period of rapid cooling between ~18-15 Ma that is consistent with an extended period of rapid exhumation. However, zircon (U-Th)/He data vary by ~30 Ma across an E-W transect through the region, which indicates that either the period of rapid erosion occurred much earlier in the west than in the east, or erosion was faster in the east, and removed significantly more material. These differences in exhumation between the E and W correlate with a documented increase in the depth of the Moho and general decrease in relief from E to W. These spatial correlations suggest linkages between deep geodynamic processes and the development of mountain topography. Variability in km-scale exhumation despite common mountain summit elevations throughout southeastern Tibet indicates that this region underwent a complex and protracted unroofing history. Additional data and modeling will test whether an erosional front propagated through the region or if pulses of erosion resulted from localized tectonic forcing, such as motion on the Nari Yun Chu Rift.",

            "abstract": "The MGVF has a total area of ca. 40,000 km2 and is well known for being the host of the only two monogenetic volcanoes in Mexico that were born in historical times: Jorullo (1759–1774) and Paricutin (1943–1952). Another particularity of the MGVF is its high number of eruptive vents with over 1000 small monogenetic cones and associated lava flows (average vol. of 0.021 km3) and ca. 400 medium-sized volcanoes (average vol. from 0.5 to 50 km3). Most of these medium-sized volcanoes may be characterized as shields that were produced dominantly by effusive activity as opposed to the small cones formed also by explosive phases of activity. The products of the small cones range from olivine basalts to andesites whereas the medium-sized volcanoes are restricted to a smaller compositional range in the andesitic domain. Although the medium-sized volcanoes are more sparsely distributed in time and space and less abundant than the small cones, the risks associated with renewal of this type of activity should not be neglected. This study focuses on El Metate which is probably the youngest shield of the MGVF (< 3,700 y. BP). Unlike a typical shield volcano composed of a succession of thin fluid basaltic flows, El Metate consists of well-preserved >60 m thick andesite flows distributed radially around a summit dome. Detailed mapping and sampling allowed us to reconstruct its eruptive activity and the time sequence of lava flow emplacement. We have identified 13 individual lava flows with lengths ranging between 3 and 15 km covering 103 km2 and average thicknesses between 60 and 150 m. Individual volumes range between 0.5 and 3.5 km3 for a total of 11 to 15 km3. Estimates of flow emplacement parameters indicate maximum average effusion rates ranging between 15 and 100 m3.s-1 and a cumulative duration from 15 to 30 years. Such a short emplacement time is comparable to the historical monogenetic eruption of nearby Paricutin volcano (9 years) but the erupted volume of lava is considerably larger (>11 km3 vs. ca. 0.8 km3). The young age of this eruption bears important implications, especially for evaluating future hazards in the MGVF. Furthermore, this study widens the use of the term “shield” and “monogenetic”, usually attributed to low-viscosity basaltic volcanoes, to more silicic compositions and a radically different flow emplacement style.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of long-term, background sediment generation rates place current and future sediment fluxes to the Great Barrier Reef in context. Without reliable estimates of sediment generation rates and without identification of the sources of sediment delivered to the reef prior to European settlement (c. 1850), determining the necessity and effectiveness of contemporary landscape management efforts is difficult. Using the ~2100-km2 Barron River catchment in Queensland, Australia, as a test case, we use in situ-produced 10Be to derive sediment generation rate estimates and use in situ and meteoric 10Be to identify the source of that sediment, which enters the Coral Sea near Cairns. Previous model-based calculations suggested that background sediment yields were up to an order of magnitude lower than contemporary sediment yields. In contrast, in situ 10Be data indicate that background (43 t km-2 y-1) and contemporary sediment yields (~45 t km-2 y-1) for the Barron River are similar. These data suggest that the reef became established in a sediment flux similar to what it receives today. Since western agricultural practices increased erosion rates, large amounts of sediment mobilized from hillslopes during the last century are probably stored in Queensland catchments and will eventually be transported to the coast, most likely in flows triggered by rare but powerful tropical cyclones that were more common before European settlement and may increase in strength as climate change warms the south Pacific Ocean. In situ and meteoric 10Be concentrations of Coral Sea beach sand near Cairns are similar to those in rivers on the Atherton Tablelands, suggesting that most sediment is derived from the extensive, low-gradient uplands rather than the steep, more rapidly eroding but beach proximal escarpment.",

We developed a new method for simultaneously evaluating the fit of this data to data derived from an expert interpreter.\nThe study focused on eastern deciduous forests in the southeastern US, with 192 pixels selected for error evaluation over 25,000 sq km in TN, NC, VA and KY. Land cover change for those pixels from 1984-2011 was determined by an expert using TimeSync, a tool that allows a user to select start and end dates of disturbance, regenerating and stable periods by examining Landsat time series and other data sources (Google earth, aerial detection surveys, localized studies and data, and their own expert knowledge). For each evaluation pixel and for each of four vegetation indices (Tassel-Cap Angle, NDVI, NBR, and NDMI), the disturbance/regeneration trajectories identified by VeRDET were compared with those expert-determined trajectories by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) between the two fit lines. We then generated 1000 random trajectories for each pixel, using resampling to generate the number of vertices, assigning verteces to random years, fitting a piecewise linear regression, and calculating the MSE of these random trajectories as compared to the expert-determined trajectories. The number of random trajectories with a higher MSE than VeRDET, converted to a percentile, is used as the dissimilarity score. This approach takes into account both the agreement in position of vertices as well as the shape of the resulting trajectory, and weights subtle changes less than large ones.\nComparing the four vegetation indices in periods of disturbance, regeneration and stability, NDMI was found to best match the expert interpretation, with VeRDET outperforming 80% of the random null models 89% of the time. Segmentations using NBR and NDVI performed less well overall and Tassel-Cap Angle performed the worst.",

The antenna B of the Channel-2 onboard the LPR (LPR Channel-2B) has collected more than 20000 traces of raw data. The raw LPR data could not be directly used for geological interpretation because of the operation mode of the LPR, noise and fast attenuation of radar wave. This study focuses data preprocessing and processing methods to obtain higher quality data. A section of usable LPR data of over 2000 traces is gained after the preprocessing of selecting, splicing, removing delay time and fine-correcting to raw data, but only a few shallow geological structures are visible. To further improve the resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio of the LPR data, we have processed the LPR data including amplitude compensation, filtering, and deconvolution processes based on electromagnetic wave theory. The processing results reveal that (1) the spherical spreading compensation and auto gain control enhance the amplitude of reflection echoes from deeper strata and make the geological structures more obvious, (2) the spiking deconvolution applied to narrow reflection events down makes it possible to identify thin layers with 30% improved resolution, and (3) the band-pass filtering removes the multiple reflections and, consequently, improves the signal-to-noise ratio of LPR data. The processing results will lay the foundation for the subsequent geological interpretation and physical property inversion of lunar materials.",

            "abstract": "We present a new geodynamic evolution for the late Paleozoic accretionary complex of the Chilean coast, located between Tanumé-Pichilemu villages. The accretionary complex has been interpreted as paired metamorphic belt, with continuous exposures along the Coastal Cordillera between 34° and 38°S, was formed during subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate against the southwestern margin of Gondwana. This complex consists of two tectonometamorphic units: (i) a basally accreted HP/LT, the Western Series, formed by metabasites, metacherts, greenschists, blue-schists and marbles, with peak P-T conditions of 7-11 kbar and 350-400°C, that are superimposed on (ii) the frontally accreted Eastern Series, mainly formed by metaturbidites and deformed in HT/LP metamorphic conditions, coeval with the emplacement of the Pennsylvanian Coast Range batholith.\nThe structures observed in the Tanumé-Pichilemu transect has been affected by three deformation episodes related with Gondwanan orogeny (D1, D2, D3), developed in late Carboniferous-Early Permian times. In the Eastern Series, D1 is associated to recumbent isoclinals folds with NW trend and associated (S1) cleavage. The D2 event is related to SW vergent folds which are part of an antiform-synform pair, developing an axial plane cleavage (S2) that dips 30° to the NE. This regional tectonic foliation S2 has intertectonic garnets porphyroblasts. In the Western Series, the first episode (D1) is represented by a foliation (S1) formed under HP-LT metamorphic conditions and preserved in syn-D2 garnet and albite porphyroblast. A NE directed reverse ductile fault system (D2), developed under pressure decreasing conditions, overlaps the HP-LT Western Series, formed about 15-25 km depth, above the shallow HT/LP Eastern Series. In this context the D2 of the Eastern Series are formed previously to D2 episode of the Western Series.\nThe third deformative event D3 is linked to west-verging kilometric-scale antiform, related to a fragile reverse fault that thrust the Eastern Series above the Western Series. This episode is associated with a S3 cleavage. The D3 reverse fault presents a minor sinestral movement, probably related to the Andean orogenic cycle.\nThis work has been supported by FONDECYT grant 1130227, and TORANDES (CGL2012-38396-C03) Spanish I+D+i Plan.",

            "abstract": "We present clumped-isotope and stable-isotope data from carbonate veins obtained from the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) borehole. A number of models proposed to explain the apparent weakness of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) require fluids to be present in the fault zone. However, little is known about the presence, source(s), temperature, and migration pathways of these fluids. We investigate spatial trends in isotopic composition of veins within meters of two actively deforming strands of the SAF - the southern deformation zone (SDZ) and central deformation zone (CDZ). Two populations of veins are present based on the isotopic data. The first group of veins with calcite δ18O values < +15 ‰ (VSMOW) and δ 13C values > +1 ‰ (VPDB) are present in foliated siltstone and shale cataclasites from 3186 to 3194 meters MD and in sheared siltstones and sandstones of the CDZ from 3297 to 3301 meters MD. Clumped-isotope analyses for a subset of samples from this vein set indicate temperatures between 72 and 99 °C and calculated pore fluid δ18O values of -3.4 to +0.1‰ (VSMOW). A second group of veins with δ18O values between +17 and +25 ‰ (VSMOW) and δ13C values between +1 and -18 (VPDB) is present in the serpentinite-bearing SDZ from 3196 to 3197 meters MD and in siltstones from 3302 to 3310 meters MD. Veins in the SDZ record temperatures from 80 to 118 °C and calculated pore fluid δ18O values of -0.3 to +3.1‰ (VSMOW). Both vein populations record temperatures less than or within uncertainty of present-day borehole temperature of ca. 120 °C. We propose the first group of veins formed by precipitating from fluids charged with soil CO2 or biogenic methane that flowed along preexisting diagenetic fracture networks or fractures formed early in the evolution of the SAF. The second group of veins precipitated from fluids charged with thermogenic methane near present-day ambient temperatures and localized in a ~50 meter wide zone of damage along the actively deforming strands of the SAF. Our findings are consistent with localization of fluid flow leading to enhanced circulation of relatively cool reducing (hydrocarbon-rich) aqueous fluids, extensive fluid-rock interaction, and precipitation of Fe-, Ni-, Mg-, and Cr-oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, and weak phyllosilicates that may contribute to the low-strength behavior of the SAF.",

            "abstract": "The increasing dependence on GNSS-based methods and technologies for global or regional navigation and communication has raised concerns about the impact of space weather on these systems. Temporal and spatial ionosphere variations caused by driving forces, such as changes in solar radiation, solar wind, and the Earth’s magnetic field contribute to errors in satellite navigation positioning and communication systems. In this study we will focus on the impact of space weather in the Arctic region related to total electron content (TEC) and scintillation changes.\nMeasurements from the GNSS network of stations in Greenland are analyzed and geophysical variables such as such as TEC, amplitude scintillation indices (S4), and phase scintillation indices (σϕ), are calculated together with 2D/3D electron density and scintillation maps. For the TEC we applied data from the Greenland GNET network of stations – consisting of 62 stations, while the scintillations data are based on 50 Hz sampled data from a set of sites on the west coast of Greenland (i.e., Thule, Sisimiut, and Kangerlussuaq).\nThe GNSS-derived data is augmented by ground-based geomagnetic measurements, such as the Dst-index and magnetic H-component data obtained from the Greenland magnetic stations. Extreme ionosphere events will be presented and the underlying geophysical process will be identified and discussed. Especially results where large-scale gradients in the regional TEC are compared with the growth of scintillations.\nWe will identify crucial elements and parameters (such as the auroral oval and the auroral electrojet), driving these changes in the Greenland TEC, S4 and σϕ distributions, in order to come up with appropriate algorithms and tools for monitoring and predicting Arctic TEC and scintillation large-scale patterns.",

            "abstract": "The most striking feature of the Ethiopian-Arabian large igneous province is the thick cap of flood basalts that dominate the northwest and southeast Ethiopian Plateaus. These flood basalts are interpreted to reflect the interaction of the Afar plume head with the continental lithosphere, and have been geochemically divided into three groups: low- Ti (LT) which is spatially restricted to the western half of the NW Ethiopian plateau, furthest from the hypothesized center of the Afar plume head; and two High-Ti groups (HT1/2), which occur on the eastern half of the plateau, closest to the plume head. While the source of HT1/2 basalts have been geochemically linked to the Afar plume with contributions from the depleted mantle and African lithosphere, the origin of the roughly contemporaneous LT basalts remains unclear. Here we present preliminary stratigraphy of two densely sampled, parallel E-W transects along escarpments that dissect the LT basalts, providing a flow-by-flow glimpse at magma evolution. Our study includes 326 samples collected between 542-2175 masl, incorporating the entire flood basalt event from the Mesozoic basement to Miocene capping lavas. Flows are extensive and flat lying, varying from aphyric to olivine- and/or plagioclase-phyric with two distinct horizons dominated by plagioclase megacrysts. We observe correlations between flows in the north and south transect (~70 km distance) based on contact elevation, flow thickness, modal mineralogy and paleosols. Our initial inspection of petrography and whole-rock geochemistry of the northern transect has identified changes in modal mineralogy, phenocryst abundance (0-30%) with rare ophitic textures, and MgO (4-10 wt. %) that occur on 50-200 m intervals, and are suggestive of magma storage, differentiation and potentially recharge events. Magma-crystal disequilibrium is often observed in the form of zoning, sieve texture, and glomercrysts (plagioclase or clinopyroxene) and further illustrates the subtle, but complex nature of flood basalt magma reservoirs through time. This work adds petrographic detail of individual flows in concert with geochemical data that can be used for correlation in future studies of Ethiopian flood basalts.",

            "abstract": "Rivers, although inherently dynamic, have been chosen as political boundaries since the beginning of colonization for several reasons. Such divisions were chosen namely for their defensive capabilities and military benefits, and because they were often the first features mapped out by explorers. Furthermore, rivers were indisputable boundaries that did not require boundary pillars or people to guard them. However, it is important to understand the complexities of a river as a boundary. All rivers inevitably change over time through processes such as accretion, deposition, cut-off, or avulsion, rendering a political boundary subject to dispute. Depending upon the flow, size, and surrounding land, a river will migrate differently than others. As these natural features migrate one country loses land while another gains land leading to tension between legal rigidity and fluid dynamism. This in turn can manifest in social disruption due to cultural differences, political upheaval, or conflict risk as a result of scarce water resources.\nThe purpose of this research is to assess the temporal and spatial variability of the political boundaries of Peru that follow rivers. Peru shares borders with Colombia, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, and Ecuador. A large part of its northern border with Colombia follows the Putumayo River and later the Amazon River. Part of its eastern border with Brazil follows the Yavari River and later the Yaquirana River. These rivers are natural features used as political boundaries yet they differ in how each migrates. By means of a spatial and temporal analysis of satellite images it was possible to obtain erosion and deposition areas for the Putumayo River, the portion of the Amazon River that is part of the Peruvian boundary, the Yavari River, and the Yaquirana River. The erosion and deposition areas were related to land distribution among Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. By examining the Digital Elevation Model one can see how the altitude of the surrounding land affects the watersheds and thus better understand the dynamic of rivers.\nUltimately, this research combines data regarding the morphodynamics of these rivers with historical insight on border treaties in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of political implications and social repercussions of dynamic boundaries.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, in situ optical water quality sensors have been applied to advance the understanding of biogeochemical changes in aquatic systems at temporal scales impracticable for traditional grab sampling. Optical sensor technology was used in northern Vermont to measure watershed response to seasonal- and event-based fluctuations in various water quality parameters using measurements every 15 minutes. An in-stream UV-Vis spectrometer measured turbidity and nitrate, total organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations using turbidity compensated spectra at wavelengths from 200 nm to 700 nm. Sensors were placed in streams whose watersheds represent urban-suburban, agricultural, forested, and mixed land uses in order to understand varied chemical responses based on a variety of natural and anthropogenic influences. Salt dilution and velocity-area discharge measurements were made in concert with pressure transducer measurements to develop robust rating curves for streams where no US Geological Survey discharge data was available so that loads could be calculated. Findings will deepen the understanding of (1) the behavior of dissolved organic carbon, nitrate, and sediment across watersheds of different land uses, focusing on seasonal climatic drivers and response to extreme events, (2) the changes in the absorbance and fluorescence character of dissolved organic carbon over diurnal, event-based, and seasonal temporal scales, and (3) how high-frequency water quality data can be used to better calculate nutrient loads to receiving water bodies.",

We investigated the source contributions through inverse modeling using GOME-2 observations (2007-2012) and the GEOS-Chem model. The observed high glyoxal to HCHO column ratio over the region indicates the potential presence of a direct source of glyoxal rather than secondary production. A bimodal seasonal cycle of glyoxal concentrations was found, providing further evidence for a biogenic origin of glyoxal emission. The estimate of the primary glyoxal emission over the eastern equatorial Pacific is 20-40Tg/yr, which is comparable to the previous estimate of the global continential glyoxal emission.",

Here, sediments are cut-off from surface inputs of organic substrates for tens of thousands of years; yet somehow support a diverse population of microorganisms. We examined the potential metabolic and ecological roles of uncultured archaea and bacteria in IODP Leg 347: Baltic Sea Paleoenvironment samples, using quantitative PCR holes 60B, 63E, 65C, and 59C and single cell genomic analysis for hole 60B. We quantified changes in total archaea and bacteria, as well as deeply-branching archaeal taxa with depth. These sediment cores alternate between high and low salinities, following a glacial cycle. This allows changes in the quantities of these groups to be placed in the context of potentially vastly different organic matter sources. In addition, single cells were isolated, and their genomes were amplified and sequenced to allow a deeper look into potential physiologies of uncultured deeply-branching organisms found up to 86 meters deep in marine sediments. Together, these data provide deeper insight into the relationship between microorganisms and their organic matter substrates in this extreme environments.",

A complementary acoustical characterization of the estuarine environment provides another layer of information to facilitate a more complete understanding of the physical environment. Relatively few acoustical studies have been carried out in rivers, estuaries or other energetic environments; nearly all acoustical work in such environments has been done at high acoustic frequencies—in the 10’s and 100’s of kHz. To this end, within the context of a larger hydrodynamic field experiment (RIVET II), a small acoustic field experiment was carried out in the Columbia River Estuary (CRE), the acoustic objective of which was to characterize the acoustic environment in the CRE in terms of ambient noise field statistics and acoustic propagation characteristics at low-to-mid-frequencies. Acoustically, the CRE salt wedge consists of two isospeed layers separated by a thin, three-dimensional high-gradient layer. Results demonstrate that (1) this stratification supports ducting of low-angle acoustic energy in the upper layer and the creation of an acoustic shadow zone in the lower layer; (2) the spatiotemporal dynamics of the salt wedge structure during the very energetic flood and ebb tides induce significant variability in the acoustic environment, as well as significant flow noise across the acoustic transducer; and (3) this flow noise correlates to current velocity and complicates acoustical observations at low frequencies.",

            "abstract": "Understanding groundwater flow and contaminant transport in fractured bedrock aquifers requires detailed characterization of the discrete features that control flow, as well as the properties of the rock matrix. This requires multiple, high-resolution, depth discrete datasets that provide different, but complementary information. Distributed fibre optic sensing is a relatively new technology used to continuously monitor properties along the entire length of an optical fibre. Technological advances over the past few years have brought the sensitivity and spatial resolution to the point where shallow (<200m) borehole applications are practicable.\nRecent studies using fibre optic distributed temperature sensors (DTS) have shown excellent application of DTS for characterizing groundwater flow in both continuously sealed and open boreholes. This presentation highlights the results of a field trial at the Bedrock Aquifer Research Station on the University of Guelph campus (Ontario, Canada) where a single fibre optic cable was interrogated by both a DTS (Ultima-DTS) and a Distributed Acoustic Sensor (iDAS). DAS is a relatively recent development that allows an optical fibre to be used as a receiver for seismic imaging. These seismic images are produced by sending an optical pulse down the fibre and analyzing the effects of seismic waves on the propagating light. Numerous vertical seismic profiles were collected and the effects of different fibre optic cable structures and coupling techniques were examined. The seismic profiles will help delineate structural features and lithological contacts away from the borehole wall, and will assist in correlating other geophysical, hydraulic, or geological logs collected in the boreholes across the site. Preliminary results show promise for shallow seismic imaging and continued field trials will allow refinement of the technique.",

            "abstract": "The terrestrial planets accreted in a series of increasingly large and violent collisions. Simultaneously, metallic cores segregated from their silicate mantles, acquiring their modern compositions through high pressure (P), high temperature (T) partitioning reactions. Here we present a model that couples these aspects of early planetary evolution, building on recent accretion simulations and experimental results.\nWe have run 100 N-body simulations of terrestrial planet accretion, with Jupiter and Saturn on either circular (CJS) or eccentric (EJS) orbits, to gain insight into the statistics of this highly stochastic process (Fischer and Ciesla, 2014). An Earth (Mars) analogue forms in 84-92% (2-10%) of our simulations. We draw on our recent high P-T metal-silicate partitioning experiments of Ni, Co, V, Cr, Si, and O in a diamond anvil cell to 100 GPa and 5500 K. In our model, N-body simulations describe the delivery, masses, and original locations of planetary building blocks. As planets accrete, their core and mantle compositions are modified by high P-T reactions with each collision (Rubie et al., 2011). By utilizing a large number of N-body simulations, we obtain a statistical view and observe a wide range of outcomes.\nWe use this model to predict the core compositions of Earth-like planets. For partial equilibration of the mantle at 50% of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) pressure, we find that their cores contain 6.9 ± 1.8 wt% Si and 4.8 ± 2.3 wt% O (Figure), with this uncertainty due entirely to variations in accretion history in our 100 simulations. This composition is consistent with the seismologically-inferred density of Earth's core, based on comparisons to high P-T equations of state (Fischer et al., 2011, 2014). Earth analogues experience 0.7 ± 0.1 or 0.9 ± 0.2 log units of oxidation during accretion in EJS or CJS simulations respectively, which is due to both the effects of high P-T partitioning and the temporal evolution of the Earth analogue's feeding zone. The model can reveal the relative importance of various accretionary processes, highlighting targets for future experimental and numerical studies. For example, changing the depth of partitioning to 70% of the CMB pressure leads to an increase of 1.7 ± 2.8 wt% Si and 2.2 ± 3.5 wt% O in Earth analogue cores, comparable to variations due to accretion history.",

            "abstract": "The Currituck submarine landslide complex located offshore North Carolina is one of the most pronounced geomorphic features of the US Mid-Atlantic Margin, evacuating and redepositing sediment over an area greater than 6500 km2 along continental slope and upper rise. Despite its geomorphic significance, the factors that preconditioned the Currituck slope for failure remain poorly understood. We present an integrated analysis of new high-resolution multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles acquired by the USGS, multibeam bathymetry data, and 1980s vintage industry MCS profiles. The Currituck slope appears to be made up of multiple failure events. Bathymetry data show evidence for multiple surface scarps, while the MCS data suggest there are additional buried scarps within the Pleistocene section. A ~500-m-thick section of relatively intact strata is observed across a 10 x 18 km swath of the lower slope and adjacent to the primary slide evacuation zone. Within this section, chaotic mass transport deposits are sandwiched between parallel reflectors, suggesting older landslides occurred along the upper slope prior to the most recent episode of slope failure. Plio-Pleistocene strata imaged below the main Currituck slide surface display seaward divergence and little to no evidence for buried submarine canyons, suggesting that the Currituck slope was progradational prior to failure. In contrast, the slope to the north and south of Currituck is heavily canyonized and Plio-Pleistocene depocenters are concentrated on the upper rise, suggesting these regions were dominated by sediment bypass and erosion. 3-D mapping of allostratigraphic surfaces imaged in industry MCS profiles reveal significant spatial variation in the antecedent margin morphology that may have set the stage for the accumulation of unstable Plio-Pleistocene depocenters. Upper Miocene strata to the north and south of Currituck show an angular shelf-edge and steep upper slope, whereas the Currituck region displays a rounded and gentle shelf-edge/upper slope. The gentler slope profile may have allowed for preferential sediment accumulation.",

Nevertheless, the energy released by this earthquake and the associated slip distribution was much less than expected.\nIn the present contribution, we will reassess the tsunami hazard for the North of Chile taking into account the occurrence of the recent events, focusing on the potential impact that a worse case scenario could produce in the city of Iquique. For that purpose, an updated tsunami source will be derived using updated information on the seismic and co-seismic tectonic displacements that is available from historical, geological information, and the dense GPS and seismometer networks available in the North of Chile.\nThe updated tsunami source will be used to generate initial conditions for a tsunami and analyze the following aspects: i) large scale hydrodynamics, ii) arrival times, maximum flow depths, and inundation area, iii) potential impact on the port of Iquique, and more specifically on the container’s drift that the tsunami could produce. This analysis is essential to reassess tsunami hazard in Iquique, evaluate evacuation plans and mitigation options regarding the port operation. Tsunami propagation and inundation will be conducted using the STOC model (Tomita and Honda, 2010), and a high resolution Lidar topographic database.\n",

            "abstract": "Sub-seasonal variability over the Indian Ocean, such as Madden-Julian Oscillation impacts weather and climate globally. However, the prediction of tropical sub-seasonal variability (TSV) remains a challenge, and understanding air-sea interactions on TSV time-scales is likely to be an important part of the prediction problem. The purpose of this paper is to examine the predictability of sub-seasonal variability in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. The analysis emphasizes on variability associated with coupled air-sea interactions in observational estimates, and how well these coupled modes are simulated and predicted within the context of a 30-year retrospective forecast experiment with a state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean coupled model. The analysis shows that Sea Surface Temperature anomalies (SSTA) over the Indian Ocean tend to precede precipitation anomalies by 7-11 days with maximum amplitude over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal for summer and along the Seychelles-Chagos Thermocline Ridge (SCTR) region for winter. Though these coupled modes are captured by the models, the forecasts fail to predict its evolution. Based on the diagnosis of these coupled modes, we introduce a SCTR-SST index and an index that measures the modulation of the low-frequency amplitude (LFAM) of sub-seasonal SSTA variability over SCTR as a way to predict the coupled modes. Based on correlation with the observed variability, SCTR-SST has forecast skill of about 45 days over the Indian Ocean. However the sub-seasonal SSTAs in the predictions and the observational estimates do not have any direct ENSO tele-connection. In contrast, the LFAM of the sub-seasonal SSTA variance over SCTR is strongly correlated with ENSO, suggesting enhanced sub-seasonal variance on seasonal time-scales is potentially predictable.",

            "abstract": "For the rapid reaction against the destructive earthquake hazard, the earthquake early warning system is one of the most challenging methods even though the lead times are very short as few seconds. In the operation of earthquake early warning (EEW) it is important to quickly determine which region is expected as the damaged zone using the estimated and observed information such as location of epicenter, magnitude and PGA of seismic stations. This research is about generating the estimated and timely updated PGA shake map using two different ways: one is from the estimated PGA values using attenuation relation between magnitude and epicenter distance referring to the results of EEW and the other is from the observed PGA data with updating every second from seismic stations. The timely updated shake map can be calculated on every grid of national wide area with 0.1 degree grid size using Modified Shepard interpolation with processing the observed PGA data by EEW system receiving 100 sps data from stations. The estimated shake map is also calculated on the same grids and with the same interpolation as like the observed shake map, and could be updated promptly when EEW system changes the epicenter or magnitude as gathering data. These shake maps has been under testing with operation of EEW in Korea from the early 2013 and the performance of calculation has been stable even though it has to work continuously for a long time. The realistic values should be considered by applying amplification factors at every station in the further study.",

We have tracked these changes over southeastern New York for the past 20+ years and can show a clear link to road density as an explanatory factor for local concentrations. The unexpected findings center around retention of Cl in streams and shallow groundwaters long after the winter season has passed and this can result in average summertime concentrations as high as monthly mean concentrations during the snoa and ice season. These persisten concentrations have consequences for aquatic life as well as local water resources. Literature suggests these high summer values may cause harm to some sensitive organisms.Experiments show both susceptibility and adaptation by local stream algal communities. Analysis of reported data from private drinking water wells shows a sub-set has Cl levels above the EPA secondary standard and these exceedances are apparently associated with local salt application rates. The problems of rising salt are significant given the magnitude of salt release to the environment but also tractable in the sense that there are multiple motivations for minimizing application rates while maintaining public safety. The salinization issue has also proven a useful tool for public engagement since the problem is widespread yet comprehensible.",

            "abstract": "Using data from the A-Train satellites, we investigate the distribution of clouds and their microphysical and radiative properties in Southeast Asia during the summer monsoon. We find an approximate balance in the top of the atmosphere (TOA) cloud radiative effect, which is largely due to commonly occurring cirrus layers that warm the atmosphere, and less frequent deep layer clouds, which produce a strong cooling at the surface. The distribution of cloud ice water path (IWP) in cirrus layers, obtained from the 2C-ICE CloudSat data product, is highly skewed with a mean value of 170 g m-2 and a median of 16 g m-2. We evaluate the fraction of the total IWP observed by CloudSat and CALIPSO individually and find that both instruments are necessary for describing the overall IWP statistics and particularly the values that are most important to cirrus radiative impact. In examining how cirrus cloud radiative effects at the TOA vary as a function of IWP, we find that cirrus with IWP less than 200 g m-2 produce a net warming. Weighting the distribution of radiative effect by the frequency of occurrence of IWP values, we find that cirrus with IWP around 20 g m-2 contribute most to heating at the TOA. We conclude that the mean IWP is a poor diagnostic of radiative impact. We suggest that climate model intercomparisons with data should focus on the median IWP because that statistic is more descriptive of the cirrus that contribute most to the radiative impacts of tropical ice clouds.\nGiven these findings, we use the A-Train observations to address the issues of IWP occurrence and high cloud forcing in a global climate model (GCM). Our goal is to determine whether the clouds that heat the upper troposphere in the model are the same genre of clouds that heat the upper troposphere in the real atmosphere. First, we define a cloud radiative kernel that’s a function of IWP to determine whether the modeled ice clouds produce similar shortwave and longwave radiative effects at the TOA. Then we will evaluate whether the model (Community Atmosphere Model version 5) produces a distribution of IWP that is similar to the IWP derived from the A-Train. This methodology will allow us to investigate how GCMs with large differences in global mean IWP can produce similar estimates of a positive high cloud feedback.",

            "abstract": "High-velocity friction experiments in the last 25 years have contributed greatly to the understanding of the physical processes and mechanical properties of fault zones during seismic fault motion. But most experiments have been done at low normal stresses, under dry conditions, and at room temperature. A rationale for conducting experiments under controlled pore-pressure conditions is that specific fracture energy at a 100 MPa normal stress, extrapolated from the experimental results at low normal-stresses, is smaller than the fracture energy estimated for natural earthquakes by about one order of magnitude. Thus dry data are not consistent with earthquakes with respect to the specific fracture energy, and wet experiments may lead to a completely different framework of fault mechanics.\n We review nineteen existing friction apparatuses having high-velocity capabilities. Velocity regimes are conventionally classified into low velocity below 10-7 m/s, intermediate velocity between 10-7~10-4 m/s, and high velocity above 10-4 m/s. Then there are six high-velocity friction apparatuses, five intermediate to high-velocity apparatuses, and eight low to high-velocity apparatuses currently in use. Seven apparatuses can cover plate velocities on the order of 10-9 m/s to high velocities to allow studies of earthquake nucleation to dynamic rupture processes. Six apparatuses are equipped with pressure vessels and experiments with pore pressures are becoming possible. Use of Ti-Al alloy with a thermal conductivity almost as low as that of rock will open a way to expand the high-normal stress capability dramatically.\n We also report a rotary-shear low to high-velocity friction apparatus at IGCEA, capable of producing plate to seismic velocities (44 mm/yr to 2.1 m/s), and velocity jumps by 103 or 106 by using five electromagnetic clutches without stopping the motor. A unique feature of the apparatus is a large specimen chamber where different specimen assemblies can be installed easily. We built two pressure vessels for pore pressures to 70 MPa; one at room temperature and the other at temperatures to 500ºC. We will report preliminary experiments under hydrothermal conditions in an attempt to determine frictional properties relevant to slow slip and high-frequency tremors in subduction zones.",

Over recent years an assessment of the stability of the site has been instigated, with a particular focus on measuring inter-technique height variation.\nA campaign of fortnightly levelling surveys began in 2010 to monitor the relative heights of a series of monuments using a Lecia DNA03 bar-code levelling instrument, with instrumental accuracy of 0.3mm. The monuments include an absolute gravimeter pier, the SLR pillar and points on the GNSS monuments. In total 22 relative heights are measured during an approximately two hour survey run, which involves two members of the SGF team.\nThe results from four years of data show that the height differences between most of the monuments are highly stable at the sub-mm level and lack systematic variation. However, a well-defined annual height variation of magnitude ±0.5mm has been discovered between certain monuments, in particular the HERS tower.\nThese on-going levelling surveys lead us to conclude that the inter-technique ties at the Space Geodesy Facility are stable at the millimetre level and that consequently the Herstmonceux site will continue to make a major contribution to the ITRF in the context of the GGOS sub-mm goal.",

            "abstract": "Accurate quantification of evaporative losses to the atmosphere from surface water bodies is essential for calibration and validation of hydrological models, particularly in remote arid and semi-arid regions, where rivers and lakes are generally minimally gauged. In this study, we reviewed and combined the most recent equations for estimation of evaporative losses based on the revised Craig-Gordon model. We designed new software, called Hydrocalculator, which allows quick and robust estimation of evaporative losses based on the isotopic composition of water. We validated Hydrocalculator by testing the range of uncertainty in the estimation of evaporative losses in arid climates by cross-validating a simplified stable isotope model with field pan evaporation experiments. The use of standardized pans (1.2 m diameter, volume 300 dm3) in hot and dry climates (temperature 29°C and relative humidity between 19 and 26%) allowed simulation of fast evaporation from shallow water bodies. Several factors may contribute to the uncertainty in the evaporative loss calculations. The analytical uncertainty in the determination of the stable isotope composition of water may contribute to ~0.6% for δ18O and ~1.4% for δ2H. The model is less sensitive to uncertainty in climatic variables and an uncertainty of 1°C in air temperature will result only in the ~0.1% uncertainty in δ18O and δ2H. However, uncertainty in relative humidity of 10% will result in an uncertainty in the final outcome of 0.4% (δ18O) and 1.0% (δ2H). Significantly higher uncertainty in evaporative loss estimation is thus associated with uncertainty in ambient air moisture estimation or analysis. An error of 20‰ in δ2H and 5.0‰ in δ18O will result in a maximum difference of 2.4% (δ2H) and 1.7% (δ18O) in the final calculations. Hydrocalculator can thus provide accurate, rapid and cost-effective insight into the water balance of surface water pools. We used the new software to determine the origin of surface water and the progress of evaporation in pools along several dryland rivers in northern Western Australia.",

            "abstract": "Accurate representation of emissions is essential in global models of atmospheric composition. New and updated emission inventories are continuously being developed by research groups and agencies, reflecting both improving knowledge and actual changes in emissions. Timely incorporation of this new information into atmospheric models is crucial but can involve laborious programming.\nHere, we present the Harvard–NASA Emission Component version 1.0 (HEMCO), a stand-alone software component for computing emissions in global atmospheric models. HEMCO determines emissions from different sources, regions, and species on a user-defined grid and can combine, overlay, and update a set of data inventories and scale factors, as specified by the user through the HEMCO configuration file. New emission inventories at any spatial and temporal resolution are readily added to HEMCO and can be accessed by the user without any preprocessing of the data files or modification of the source code. Emissions that depend on dynamic source types and local environmental variables such as wind speed or surface temperature are calculated in separate HEMCO extensions.\nBy providing a widely applicable framework for specifying constituent emissions, HEMCO is designed to ease sensitivity studies and model comparisons, as well as inverse modeling in which emissions are adjusted iteratively. So far, we have implemented HEMCO in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and in the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS-5) along with its integrated data assimilation system.",

            "abstract": "The orientation of seismic anisotropy inferred beneath the interiors of plates may provide a means to estimate the motions of the plate relative to the deeper mantle. Here we analyze a global set of shear-wave splitting data to estimate plate motions and to better understand the dispersion of the data, correlations in the errors, and their relation to plate speed.\nThe errors in plate motion azimuths inferred from shear-wave splitting beneath any one tectonic plate are shown to be correlated with the errors of other azimuths from the same plate. To account for these correlations, we adopt a two-tier analysis: First, find the pole of rotation and confidence limits for each plate individually. Second, solve for the best fit to these poles while constraining relative plate angular velocities to consistency with the MORVEL relative plate angular velocities. Our preferred set of angular velocities, SKS-MORVEL, is determined from the poles from eight plates weighted proportionally to the root-mean-square velocity of each plate. SKS-MORVEL indicates that eight plates (Amur, Antarctica, Caribbean, Eurasia, Lwandle, Somalia, Sundaland, and Yangtze) have angular velocities that differ insignificantly from zero. The net rotation of the lithosphere is 0.25±0.11º Ma-1 (95% confidence limits) right-handed about 57.1ºS, 68.6ºE. The within-plate dispersion of seismic anisotropy for oceanic lithosphere (σ=19.2°) differs insignificantly from that for continental lithosphere (σ=21.6°). The between-plate dispersion, however, is significantly smaller for oceanic lithosphere (σ=7.4°) than for continental lithosphere (σ=14.7°). Two of the slowest-moving plates, Antarctica (vRMS=4 mm a-1, σ=29°) and Eurasia (vRMS=3 mm a-1, σ=33°), have two of the largest within-plate dispersions, which may indicate that a plate must move faster than ≈5 mm a-1 to result in seismic anisotropy useful for estimating plate motion.",

            "abstract": "Complimentary trace metal and water quality surveys were conducted along a 45-km longitudinal transect of the Chester River, a tidal tributary of Chesapeake Bay, to identify potential chemical differences associated with input from different water sources. The Chester River serves as the receiving waters of a largely agricultural watershed on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Delineating water sources within the system can inform management and nutrient reduction strategies. Surface water samples were collected and syringe- filtered in the field. Samples were analyzed to determine the concentrations of V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sn, Ba, W, Pb and U. Dissolved nitrate and orthophosphate, Chlorophyll a and total suspended matter were also determined for each sample. Hydrocasts of salinity, temperature, pH, and relative fluorescence of chlorophyll were used to reconstruct water column characteristics and provide insight into mixing with Chesapeake Bay. Results from a complete transect survey conducted over a single tidal maximum (+/- 2 hours) show that Ba is elevated in the Chester River (621 nMol/L) relative to Chesapeake Bay, but exhibits no distinguishable trend with salinity in the river. The Ba results suggest complex input from groundwater along the transect and potential dissociation from riverine sediments and suspended particles. Arsenic, Cr, and V demonstrate marked conservative mixing along the salinity gradient. Arsenic ranged from 23 nMol/L at the lowest salinity and the highest concentration (218 nMol/L) at the mouth where the Chester River enters Chesapeake Bay. This apparent conservative behavior is likely the result of simple mixing between fresh- and saltwater over what is assumed to be a relatively short residence time (days) for water in the river system. The plots of U and W with salinity show curvilinear distributions with positive slopes and may reflect the importance of uptake by sediments and vegetation in the upper reaches of the river. Manganese concentrations are also curvilinear but decrease with increased salinity, potentially due to changes in redox conditions as freshwater mixes with more saline Bay water.",

Though there is consensus on the broad management goals addressed by each of these options, translating these concepts into management plans specific for individual forest types that vary in structure, composition, and function remains a challenge. We will describe a decision-making framework that we employed within a manager-scientist partnership to develop a suite of adaptation treatments for two contrasting forest types as part of a long-term forest management experiment. The first, in northern Minnesota, is a red pine-dominated forest with components of white pine, aspen, paper birch, and northern red oak, with a hazel understory. The second, in southwest Colorado, is a warm-dry mixed conifer forest dominated by ponderosa pine, white fir, and Douglas-fir, with scattered aspen and an understory of Gambel oak. The current conditions at both sites are characterized by overstocking with moderate-to-high fuel loading, vulnerability to numerous forest health threats, and are generally uncharacteristic of historic structure and composition. The desired future condition articulated by managers for each site included elements of historic structure and natural range of variability, but were greatly tempered by known vulnerabilities and projected changes to climate and disturbance patterns. The resultant range of treatments we developed are distinct for each forest type, and address a wide range of management objectives.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous proppant placement (HPP) technologies offer improved hydraulic fracturing performance through the creation of channels within propped fractures (see figure). Such schemes, however, can suffer from reduced performance due to uncertainty in reservoir properties (e.g.: embedment and moduli). This is particularly true of unconventional reservoirs where properties can be highly heterogeneous. We demonstrate that the mechanisms controlling uncertainty in HPP performance differ between vertical and lateral wells.\nFor computational efficiency, we combine the boundary element method to simulate formation deformation with a detailed discretization of the proppant within the fracture to predict conductivity of the HPP channels. We performed an extensive parameter study with thousands of scenarios relevant to HPP, including placement geometries consistent with both vertical and lateral wells. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was then applied to quantify and rank contributions from uncertain input parameters to variance in fracture conductivity.\nWe were able to rigorously quantify the impact of parametric uncertainty. We found that for lateral wells the uncertainty in the conductivity is dominated by the uncertainty in diffusion of the proppant. For vertical wells, the dominant factors causing uncertainty in the performance change with stress. At low stress, performance is controlled by factors that dictate pillar geometry. At high stress, parameters that help preserve channels against closure stress control conductivity.\nOur results highlight the robustness of the HPP concept and quantify the sources of uncertainty in HPP performance. Further, we can clearly identify the fundamental parameters that control HPP conductivity and reveal that they are different for wellbore geometries that are typical of unconventional wells in North America. This implies that optimal HPP strategies will differ between vertical and lateral wells.",

            "abstract": "The Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas is an online data discovery and access tool that allows users to browse a growing collection of ecosystem-related datasets visualized as map plates. Thematically, the Atlas includes updated long-term assessments of the physical, biological, environmental, economic and living marine resource characteristics that indicate baseline conditions of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. These data are crucial components of integrated ecosystem assessments and modeling and support restoration and monitoring efforts in the Gulf. A multi-agency executive steering committee including members from international, federal, state, and non-governmental organizations was established to guide Atlas development and to contribute data and expertise. The Atlas currently contains over 235 maps in 70 subject areas. Each map plate is accompanied by a descriptive summary authored by a subject matter expert and each data set is fully documented by metadata in Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)-compliant standards. Source data are available in native formats and as web mapping services (WMS). Datasets are also searchable through an accompanying Map Catalog and RSS feed. The Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas is an operational example of the philosophy of leveraging resources among agencies and activities involved in geospatial data as outlined in the US Department of Interior and FGDC \"Geospatial Platform Modernization Roadmap v4 - March 2011”. We continue to update and add datasets through existing and new partnerships to ensure that the Atlas becomes a truly ecosystem-wide resource.",

            "abstract": "During periods of northward IMF, an absence of low latitude reconnection at the magnetopause is expected. However, this gives rise to questions as to how the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) can be populated with magnetosheath-like plasma under northward IMF conditions. Multi-spacecraft observations have shown the existence of Ultra-Low Frequency waves at the magnetopause that are thought to be results of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability (Miura, 1982). These K-H waves can grow into non-linear waves and form rolled-up vortices. It has been postulated that magnetic reconnection within these vortices may be responsible for the transfer of solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere (e.g. La Belle-Hamer et al., 1988; Nykyri and Otto, 2001; Hasegawa et al., 2004; Bavassano Cattaneo et al., 2010). Thus, high temporal resolution plasma observations sufficient to resolve reconnection signatures inside K-H vortices (e.g.) are key to understanding how reconnection bursts contribute to coupling of the magnetosheath plasma with magnetosphere.\nWe study an event in Dec 2006, in which Cluster encountered on-going K-H waves as the spacecraft were inbound and crossed the Earth’s dusk flank magnetopause through the LLBL. During this event, the spacecraft were operating in burst mode, and the magnetic field remained closely aligned with the spacecraft spin axis. Thus we have used the 3D particle data to reconstruct near-full pitch angle distribution of electrons and ions at sub-spin resolution (0.125s c.f., 4s spin resolution). These observations, up to 32 times faster than normal mode data, provided new insight into particle dynamics during the outbound movements of Cluster across the magnetopause. We present observations of regions where boundary plasma was traveling faster than bulk magnetosheath velocity, which is a plasma signature indicative of rolled up K-H vortices. Within these vortices, we show evidence of reconnection, which consist of D-shape accelerated ion population, field-aligned magnetosheath electrons along with anti-field-aligned magnetospheric electrons. We discuss the ramifications of this result in context for the soon to be launched MMS mission.",

            "abstract": "The existence of seismic anisotropy in D” has been diagnosed by the evident arrival-time shifts between SVdiff and SHdiff phases and discrepancies in SKS and SKKS splitting. Previous numerical modeling of seismic wave propagation demonstrates that the SVdiff and SHdiff arrivals are not synchronized in time even in an isotropic Earth model due to intrinsically different finite-frequency sensitivity of non-geometrical diffracted S waves between radial and transverse components. Therefore, prior to using diffracted shear wave phases to constrain seismic anisotropy in the lowermost mantle, we need to first clarify the finite-frequency effects of diffracted shear waves propagating through D” velocity heterogeneity.\nIn this study, we collect broadband waveforms from intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes (> 150 km) with epicentral distances of 90-145o and magnitudes greater than 5.8 during 1997-2012. The splitting between the vertically (SV) and transversely (SH) polarized arrivals of S(diff) phases after correcting for upper mantle anisotropy are analyzed to investigate seismic anisotropy in D” induced by anisotropic material elasticity and finite-frequency wave propagation effects. Both positive and negative SVdiff-SHdiff split times are observed in seismically slow regions; however, the proposed viable scenario in which partial melts produced at the base of the hot mantle plumes have been aligned laterally in D” by the basal boundary flow can only explain relatively earlier SHdiff arrivals. Positive SV-SH times (i.e., SH traveling faster) found in high-velocity regions are consistent with the consequences caused by intrinsic LPO of pPv-MgSiO3 in horizontally-lying slabs and different finite-frequency sensitivity between SVdiff and SHdiff in the heterogeneous lowermost mantle. We will differentiate and quantify these two effects on the observed Sdiff splitting through simulating ground-truth finite-frequency shear wave diffraction in the 3-D tomography Earth model and comparing the observed SVdiff-SHdiff split times with those predicted by their distinct finite-frequency sensitivity kernels constructed with the interactions of forward and adjoint wavefields computed by a spectral element method.",

            "abstract": "In late March 2014 an energetic sequence of earthquakes began near Challis, ID, about 20-30 km northwest of the portion of the Lost River Fault that produced the M6.9 1983 Borah Peak earthquake. Many events were, and continue to be, felt by local residents. During the first month locations of more than 100 events (1.5 < Md < 4.7) outlined a quasi-linear NW-SE trend similar to the strike of the Lost River fault. As of early August 2014 many Md > 2 and occasional Md > 3 earthquakes continue to occur. In mid-April 2014 the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey, installed a temporary seismic array consisting of four 6-channel (3 broadband plus 3 accelerometer) instruments and one 3-channel accelerometer near the swarm. Two additional 6-channel instruments were added in early July. All data are being archived at the IRIS DMC, with six of the seven instruments streaming data in near real time. The temporary array decreased the distance from the swarm to the nearest station from more than 70 to less than 12 km for nearly all events, providing better-constrained depths than could be provide by the regional network. For larger events, first-motion focal mechanisms show oblique normal and strike-slip faulting consistent with regional tectonics and mechanisms observed for the Borah Peak aftershocks. However, a moment tensor solution for a 3.8 Mw event indicates normal faulting on a NW-striking plane. Using events identified by the local array as templates, we will use a subspace detector to completely identify the low-magnitude events and relocate all of the seismicity. The March-August Challis sequence is curious because of its proximity to the Lost River fault zone and its swarm-like character. There are no known fluid injection sources in the region.",

            "abstract": "The release of gases from the Earth’s interior to the exosphere takes place in both volcanic and non-volcanic areas of the planet. Fully understanding this complex process requires the integration of geochemical, petrological and volcanological data. At present, major online data repositories relevant to studies of degassing are not linked and interoperable.\nWe are developing interoperability between three of those, which will support more powerful synoptic studies of degassing. The three data systems that will make their data accessible via the DECADE portal are: (1) the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program database (GVP) of volcanic activity data, (2) EarthChem databases for geochemical and geochronological data of rocks and melt inclusions, and (3) the MaGa database (Mapping Gas emissions) which contains compositional and flux data of gases released at volcanic and non-volcanic degassing sites. These databases are developed and maintained by institutions or groups of experts in a specific field, and data are archived in formats specific to these databases.\nIn the framework of the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing (DECADE) initiative of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), we are developing a web portal that will create a powerful search engine of these databases from a single entry point. The portal will return comprehensive multi-component datasets, based on the search criteria selected by the user. For example, a single geographic or temporal search will return data relating to compositions of emitted gases and erupted products, the age of the erupted products, and coincident activity at the volcano.\nThe development of this level of capability for the DECADE Portal requires complete synergy between these databases, including availability of standard-based web services (WMS, WFS) at all data systems. Data and metadata can thus be extracted from each system without interfering with each database’s local schema or being replicated to achieve integration at the DECADE web portal. The DECADE portal will enable new synoptic perspectives on the Earth degassing process. Other data systems can be easily plugged in using the existing framework. Our vision is to explore Earth degassing related datasets over previously unexplored spatial or temporal ranges.",

As such, we now can study the development of Convective Ionospheric Storms (CIS) and, most importantly, large-scale seeding of the low growth-rate Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability. Two mechanisms have been suggested for such seeding: the Collisional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (CKHI) and internal atmospheric gravity waves. A number of observations have shown that the spectrum of fully developed topside structures peaks at 600 km and extends to over 1000 km. These structures are exceedingly difficult to explain by CKHI. Here we show that sinusoidal plasma oscillations on the bottomside during daytime develop classical R-T structures on the nightside with the background 600 km structure still apparent. In two case studies, thunderstorm activity was observed east of the sinusoidal features in the two hours preceding the C/NOFS passes. Thus, we argue that convective tropospheric storms are a likely source of these sinusoidal features.",

Further, activities such as feeding and burrowing affect heart rate, as do environmental factors such as water salinity, water temperature, exposure, and predation. We have developed a small, noninvasive sensor for measuring freshwater mussel heart rate. Its working principle is as follows. An infrared (IR) light-emitting diode is placed in contact with the mussel shell. Some of the IR penetrates through the shell, reflects off internal organs, and traverses back. A photodetector detects this IR, and electronics condition the signal. The heartbeat of the animal modulates the IR, allowing one to measure the heart rate. The technique is widely-used in finger heart-rate monitors in humans. The sensors do not have to be positioned above the heart and several locations on the mussel shell work well. The sensor is small (8 mm × 10 mm) and consumes less than 1 mA, and has a simple one-wire interface that allows for easy integration into data acquisition hardware. We present heart rate measurements for the common pocketbook (lampsilis cardium) freshwater mussel.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission was successfully launched at 1837 UTC 27 February 2014 with the first space-borne Ku/Ka band Dual Frequency Precipitation Radar and a passive microwave radiometer (channels ranging from 10-183 GHz). The primary objective of the Core satellite is to measure rain and snow globally, determine its 3D structure, and act as the calibration satellite for a constellation of GPM passive microwave satellites. In order to assess how remotely sensed precipitation can be applied to a range of data applications, ground validation (GV) field campaigns are crucial. As such, the Olympic Mountains Experiment (OLYMPEX) is planned for November 2015 – February 2016. The Olympic Peninsula in Washington State is an ideal location to conduct a GV campaign. It is situated within an active mid-latitude winter storm track and receives among the highest annual precipitation amounts in North America. In one compact area, the Olympic peninsula ranges from ocean to coast to land to mountains. It contains a permanent snowfield and numerous associated river basins. This unique venue will enable the field campaign to monitor both upstream precipitation characteristics and processes over the ocean and their modification over complex terrain. The scientific goals of the OLYMPEX field campaign include physical validation of satellite algorithms, precipitation mechanisms in complex terrain, hydrological applications, and modeling studies. In order to address these goals, a wide variety of existing and new observations are planned. These include surface observing networks of meteorological stations, rain and snow gauges, surface microphysical measurements, and snowpack surveys. Several radars will be deployed including the NASA S-Band dual-polarimetric and NASA Dual-Frequency Dual-Polarimetric Doppler radars, the Canadian x-band radar, and other mobile radars. Several instrumented aircraft are likely to participate such as the NASA DC-8 and the University of North Dakota Citation. The aircraft measurements will determine upstream thermodynamic and moisture conditions, sample particle types and sizes, and act as a proxy for the satellite itself. The ground-based measurements will test how well the satellite proxy measurements determine the rain and snow over complex terrain.",

            "abstract": "The caliber and quantity of sediment delivered to a channel influences its size and shape, yet we know little about how the sediment supply affects rivers whose geomorphic form is influenced by riparian vegetation. We present results from flume experiments that test the impact of sediment supply on plant-morphodynamic interactions. We introduced two sediment supply conditions to a 28-meter long, sand bedded flume (60 cm wide and 71 cm deep) at the UC-Berkeley Richmond Field Station: equilibrium (balance between sediment transport and supply) and deficit (transport exceeds sediment supply). We conducted ten runs with different riparian seedling configurations (individual plants or patches) and species (tamarisk or cottonwood), and stem and leaf density (0.003-0.47 cm2/cm2), under both sediment supply conditions. Plant species, size, and configuration were important in predicting the topographic adjustments that occurred during our experiments. These influences may be attributed to differences in plant morphology; tamarisk is shrubby while cottonwood is more tree-like, with a single stem and leaves concentrated higher on the plant. The plant-morphodynamic relationship, however, differed for the two sediment supply conditions. During sediment equilibrium, only patches of cottonwood served as sediment sinks compared to an unvegetated bed, but tamarisk patches had no impact on the sediment mass balance. During sediment deficit, in contrast, tamarisk patches accumulated more sediment than unvegetated beds. Stem and leaf density also controlled changes in bed elevation. During equilibrium conditions, increasing the density of cottonwood stems and leaves resulted in greater bed degradation. Conversely, aggradation occurred with increases in the density of tamarisk. For sediment deficit conditions, the relationship between stem and leaf density and the rate of bed change was negative for both species (i.e., higher density resulted in faster rate of scour). The shifting influence in how tamarisk and cottonwood mediate topographic changes under low versus high relative sediment supply rates highlights the need to account for this variability in future research on vegetated rivers.",

            "abstract": "Oxygen has been a plausible candidate for a light element dissolved in the Earth’s core mostly due to its large abundance in the mantle and low eutectic temperature at low pressure. In order to place constraints on the existence/absence of oxygen in the core, which are the key to understand the origin, evolution, and dynamics of the Earth, many experimental efforts have been made on oxygen-bearing iron systems, including measurements of phase relations and of the density and sound velocity of phases. I made thermodynamic analysis on the experimentally constrained melting phase relations in the system Fe-FeO, which helps us to refine the physical properties of the system. From the analysis I found two important issues in the melting relations: (i) the melting temperatures of the end-member systems at 15-16 GPa and (ii) mixing properties for liquids. (i) In order for the thermodynamic calculations to reproduce phase relations determined in multianvil experiments at 15-16 GPa which include an assemblage of FeO + metallic liquid just above the solidus, the melting temperature of iron needs to be lower than that of FeO. If the iron melting temperature is greater, another assemblage of Fe + ionic liquid would be stabilized instead of FeO + metallic liquid. (ii) I tested existing mixing models for liquids by comparing calculated eutectic relations with experimental data to 300 GPa. I found that the Fe-FeO liquids show nonideal mixing behavior at least to 50 GPa and become nearly ideal mixtures under the core pressures. The constructed thermodynamic database to the inner core boundary pressure (330 GPa) yields the eutectic compositions of Fe–7.2–9.1wt% O and eutectic temperatures of 2990–4330 K under the outer core pressures (136-330 GPa). I will also discuss the nature of an oxygen-bearing outer core.",

            "abstract": "An ongoing challenge for society is to harness the benefits of phosphorus (P) while minimizing negative effects on downstream ecosystems. To meet this challenge we must understand the controls on the delivery of anthropogenic P from landscapes to downstream ecosystems. We used a model that incorporates P inputs to watersheds, hydrology, and infrastructure (sewers, waste-water treatment plants, and reservoirs) to reconstruct historic P yields for the northeastern U.S. from 1930 to 2002. At the regional scale, increases in P inputs were paralleled by increased fractional retention, thus P loading to the coast did not increase significantly. We found that temporal variation in regional P yield was correlated with P inputs. Spatial patterns of watershed P yields were best predicted by inputs, but the correlation between inputs and yields in space weakened over time, due to infrastructure development. Although the magnitude of infrastructure effect was small, its role changed over time and was important in creating spatial and temporal heterogeneity in input-yield relationships. We then conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify a typology of anthropogenic P cycling, using data on P inputs (fertilizer, livestock feed, and human food), infrastructure (dams, wastewater treatment plants, sewers), and hydrology (runoff coefficient). We identified 6 key types of watersheds that varied significantly in climate, infrastructure, and the types and amounts of P inputs. Annual watershed P yields and retention varied significantly across watershed types. Although land cover varied significantly across typologies, clusters based on land cover alone did not explain P budget patterns, suggesting that this variable is insufficient to understand patterns of P cycling across large spatial scales. Furthermore, clusters varied over time as patterns of climate, P use, and infrastructure changed. Our results demonstrate that the drivers of P cycles are spatially and temporally heterogeneous, yet they also suggest that a relatively simple typology of watersheds can be useful for understanding regional P cycles and may help inform P management approaches.",

Today we believe this conversion occurs during the bacterial remineralization of sinking organic matter in the oceanic water column. The Black Sea with its high organic matter inputs and anoxic deep waters is an excellent study site to investigate in more detail the processes yielding MeHg. To date only one vertical profile of Hg species near the Western shelf and one vertical profile in the Western Gyre are published (Lamborg et al. 2008). We will present new results of the 2013 Dutch-led GEOTRACES MEDBlack cruise in the Black Sea. Research vessel “Pelagia” occupied 12 full depth stations along an east-west transect from 13 to 25 July 2013. High resolution vertical profiles were sampled using a titanium ultraclean CTD frame (de Baar et al., 2008) equipped with 24 x 24L PVDF samplers. Samples were filtered (0.2µm, Sartobran 300), drawn into pre-cleaned 250mL Savillex PFA bottles and acidified to 0.4% (v:v) with double-distilled HCl. Dissolved MeHg, as the sum of monomethylHg and dimethylHg, was analyzed via isotope dilution gas chromatography sector field inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Total dissolved Hg was determined following the US EPA 1631 method. We will present high resolution vertical Hg species profiles, including one ultra-high resolution profile (1 sample every 5m-depth) to understand the dynamics along the chemocline (Luther et al., 1991). We will also present the results of the GEOTRACES international intercalibration exercise for dissolved MeHg and dissolved total Hg in surface seawater that we organized during the same cruise.\n",

Wentz and Ricciardulli (2011) have criticized the study, citing the methodology solely employing data collected from a series of altimetry missions and lack of adequate verification of the results. An earlier study (Wentz et al. 2007) had differing results using data from microwave radiometers and scatterometers. This study serves as a response to these studies, employing a similar methodology but with a different set of data. Data collected from the QuikSCAT and ADEOS-2 SeaWinds scatterometers, SSMI(S), and TOPEX/POSEIDON and JASON-1 altimetry missions are used to calculate trends in the mean, 90th-, and 99th-percentile wind speed and wave height over the period 1999—2009. Linear regression analyses from the satellite missions are verified against regression analyses of data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. Temporal sampling presents the most critical consideration in the study. The scatterometers have a much greater independent temporal sampling (about 1.5 observations per day per satellite) than the altimeters (about 1 observation per 10 days). With this consideration, the satellite data are also used to sample the wind speeds in the ERA-Interim dataset. That portion of the study indicates the sampling requirements needed to accurately estimate the trends in the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\nWentz, F.J., L. Ricciardulli, K. Hilburn, and C.

We will also examine the sensitivity of NOy, NOx, NO2/NO, OH, HO2/OH, and O3 to LNOx as well as the implications on overall atmospheric radiative forcing (defined herein as the net flux imbalance at the tropopause).

            "abstract": "Using Cluster multi-spacecrafts observation between August to October each year from 2002 to 2004, Shi, et al. [2013] have reported an unexpected discovery of regions of solar wind entry into the Earth’s high-latitude magnetospheric lobes where the solar wind plasmas may penetrate into magnetosphere through high-latitude magnetic reconnection when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is northward. From statistical analysis, they found that the IMF Bx component may influence the solar wind entry into the magnetosphere by changing the occurring conditions of high-latitude magnetic reconnection. Based on their studies, in this paper we use another period of Cluster data which is between January to April each year from 2001 to 2006 to do a further study. As a result, the influence of the IMF Bx component is consistent with the results from [Shi, et al. 2013]. We find that the IMF By component affects the events along with the IMF Bx component, which is consistent with the Parker Spiral of the IMF. We have also studied some transpolar arc observations in correlation with the solar wind entry events. The properties of entry plasma, electron and ion properties associated with aurorae are examined using multiple spacecraft data (Cluster, TIMED, DMSP, IMAGE and POLAR etc) , as can be seen from another work presented this meeting by Mailyan et al.",

Maintaining caprock integrity during the injection process is the most important factor for a successful injection. In this work we evaluate the potential for jointed caprock during injection scenarios using coupled three-dimensional multiphase flow and geomechanics modeling.\nEvaluation of jointed/fractured caprock systems is of particular concern to CO2 sequestration because creation or reactivation of joints (mechanical damage) can lead to enhanced pathways for leakage. In this work, we use an equivalent continuum approach to account for the joints within the caprock. Joint’s aperture and non-linear stiffness of the caprock will be updated dynamically based on the effective normal stress. Effective permeability field will be updated based on the joints’ aperture creating an anisotropic permeability field throughout the caprock. This feature would add another coupling between the solid and fluid in addition to basic Terzaghi’s effective stress concept. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the joint’s orientation and geometry of caprock and reservoir layers on geomechanical response of the CO2 geological systems.\nThis work is supported as part of the Center for Frontiers of Subsurface Energy Security, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences under Award Number DE-SC0001114.

From north to south this region consists of the Pyrenees, resulting from Iberia-Eurasia collision; the Iberian Massif, which has been undeformed since the end of the Paleozoic; the Central System and Iberian Chain, regions with intracontinental Oligocene-Miocene deformation; the Gibraltar Arc (Betics, Rif and Alboran terranes), resulting from post-Oligocene subduction roll-back; and the Atlas Mountains.\nWe analyzed data from recent broad-band array deployments and permanent stations in the area (IberArray and Siberia arrays, the PICASSO array, the University of Munster array, and the Spanish, Portuguese and Moroccan National Networks) to characterize its lithospheric structure. The combined array of 350 stations has an average interstation spacing of ~60 km. We calculated the Rayleigh waves phase velocities from ambient noise (periods 4 to 40 s) and teleseismic events (periods 20 to 167 s). We inverted the phase velocities to obtain a shear velocity model for the lithosphere to ~200 km depth.\nOur results correlate well with the surface expression of the main structural units with higher crustal velocity for the Iberian Massif than for the Alpine Iberia and Atlas Mountains. The Gibraltar Arc has lower crustal shear velocities than the regional average at all crustal depths. It also shows an arc shaped anomaly with high upper mantle velocities (>4.6 km/s) at shallow depths (<65 km) interpreted as the subducting Alboran slab. The hanging slab is depressing the crust of the Gibraltar arc to ~55 km depth, as seen in receiver function data and active source seismic profiles. Low upper mantle velocities (<4.2 km/s) are observed beneath the Atlas, the northeastern end of the Betic Mountains and the Late Cenozoic volcanic fields in Iberia and Morocco, indicative of high temperatures at relatively shallow depths, and suggesting that the lithosphere has been removed beneath these areas.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem models simulate belowground processes of element cycling, such as soil carbon dynamics, through numerical representations of our mechanistic understanding of these processes. This poses a great challenge, because many mechanistic models are so highly parameterized and complex that the reasons for their behavior are often difficult to understand, while others are so simplistic that they are unlikely to capture potentially important complexities, such as C-N interactions. Here we propose a mechanistic, but parsimonious modular approach to building a belowground C and N model, with a core processes-level representation of microbial and exoenzymatic activity. We have merged the Dual-Arrhenius Michaelis Menten (DAMM) model of Davidson et al. (2012) with the Microbial Carbon and Nitrogen Physiology (MCNiP) model of Drake et al. (2013). DAMM explicitly simulates the effects of temperature, soil moisture and substrate supply on the kinetics of soil organic matter (SOM) depolymerization. MCNiP is a stoichiometrically constrained model of microbial maintenance and growth respiration, exoenzyme production, and C and N uptake and mineralization. Here we present the results of this model merger, focusing on how temperature, soil moisture, substrate limitation, and the stoichiometry of microbial processes individually and interactively regulate gains or losses of C and N from SOM at the Harvard Forest. We compare model performance running DAMM-MCNiP with and without C-N linkages. We find that substrate limitation is a major constraint over SOM decomposition and that N availability can be a strong regulator of decomposition. The C-only formulation of DAMM-MCNiP generally results in greater losses of SOC than the coupled C-N formulation. Future data-model assimilation and parameter estimation will help determine which aspects of the merged model can be well constrained and which aspects will need further refinement through new data collection or meta-analysis.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in mass spectrometry have led to an improved ability to measure high precision isotope ratios at increasingly low analyte concentrations. Combining techniques for enhanced ionization with better counting of small ion beams, we routinely measure isotope ratios on 100’s of pg uranium samples and ≤10 pg plutonium samples with relative standard deviations of 1‰ on major isotope ratios and 10‰ on minor ratios achievable. With slightly larger samples (≤1 ng total U), these precisions can be as low as 0.01‰ (10 ppm) and 1‰ respectively. These techniques can be applied to both nuclear forensics questions where only a small amount of sample is available, as well as geologic questions such as U-Pb or U-Th disequilibrium geochronology from either single small crystals, or microsampled domains from within a heterogeneous sample. The analytical setup is a Cetac Aridus II desolvating nebulizer interfaced with a ThermoScientific Neptune Plus equipped with a jet-type sample cone and x-type skimmer cone. The combination of the desolvating nebulizer with the enhanced cone setup leads to an increase in sensitivity on the order of 10x that of a standard glass spray chamber (~1000V/ppm U). The Neptune Plus is equipped with 9 Faraday cups and 5 electron multipliers (two behind RPQ energy filters for improved abundance sensitivtiy). This allows for the simultaneous collection of all isotopes of either U or Pu with a combination of Faraday cups (e.g., 235U and 238U) and electron multipliers (e.g., 234U and 236U) with other configurations also available (e.g., 235U and 238U can instead be measured on electron multipliers in small samples).\nAs sample sizes get small, the contributions from environmental blanks, as well as interfering species, become increasing concerns. In this study, we will present data on efforts to minimize the contribution of environmental U using scaled down chemical procedures as well as the effect of polyatomic species on the precision and accuracy of actinide isotope measurements and what procedures can be applied to minimize interferences.",

In particular the introduction of annual stress tests to evaluate risks to portfolios at 1:200, 1:20 and annual average loss metrics has provided a prism through which to focus science, engineeering and analytical actcities and the supporting data environment. This approach has driven a deeper understanding of the relationship between hazard, exposure and vulnerability of the build enviornment and helped put a quantitative value on physical and operational resilience. In particular has been the recognition that while structures and operations may be distrupted and disabled during a natural disaster or extreme event the critical issue is how quickly and cheaply functions can be reinstated after the event has passed. This has highlighted the value of enabling structures and institutional processes to close down, or even 'break' in a pre-planned way when forces are exceeded to prevent excessive dislocation and allow capabilities to reinstated in an planned and effective manner. New advances in financial regulation are making this increasingly attractive",

            "abstract": "Sophisticated numerical tools exist for modeling geomorphic processes and linking them to tectonic and climatic systems, but they are often seen as inaccessible for users with an exploratory level of interest. We have improved the accessibility of landscape evolution models by producing a simple graphics user interface (GUI) that takes advantage of the Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development (CHILD) model. Model access is flexible: the user can edit values for basic geomorphic, tectonic, and climate parameters, or obtain greater control by defining the spatiotemporal distributions of those parameters. Users can make educated predictions by choosing their own parametric values for the governing equations and interpreting the results immediately through model graphics. This method of modeling allows users to iteratively build their understanding through experimentation. Use of this GUI is intended for inquiry and discovery-based learning activities. We discuss a number of examples of how the GUI can be used at the upper high school, introductory university, and advanced university level. Effective teaching modules initially focus on an inquiry-based example guided by the instructor. As students become familiar with the GUI and the CHILD model, the class can shift to more student-centered exploration and experimentation. To make model interpretations more robust, digital elevation models can be imported and direct comparisons can be made between CHILD model results and natural topography. The GUI is available online through the University of Maine’s Earth and Climate Sciences website, through the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) model repository, or by contacting the corresponding author.",

To study the physico-chemical characteristics of aerosols over the Thar Desert (Jaisalmer, Rajasthan) during winter (December, 2013), a field campaign has been carried out in Jaisalmer in Rajasthan state. Experiments were conducted inside the city as well as far from the city. The faraway location is close to international border of another country i.e. Pakistan. PM2.5 and PM10 were collected within the city while PM5 was collected far from the city. Particles were collected on Teflon filters for bulk analysis with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), on Tin substrate for individual particle morphology and elemental composition analysis with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) and on the Cu-TEM grid for individual particle morphology and mixing state characterization using High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM). Together with this, aerosol size distribution observation and columnar spectral aerosol optical properties have been carried out with OPC (Optical Particle Counter, GRIMM Model 1.108) and hand held Microtops-II, respectively.\nHRTEM analysis reveals occurrence of carbonaceous fractals found in various mixing states 1) aged with some hygroscopic species 2) embedded in sulfate host 3) semi-externally mixed with sulfate and other species. Core-shell particles were also observed with varying core composition (carbon, typical mineral dust, and calcite) and shell thickness (shell comprising of water). The back trajectory analysis reveals the source of wind from Karachi and Islamabad from Pakistan which may be the potential source of carbonaceous species over the sampling site. SEM-EDS analysis reveals occurrence of mineral dust 1) pure mineral dust (Ca and Si rich) 2) polluted mineral dust (mixed with carbon and Cr) together with some pollutants (rich in carbon, S, K, Cl, Mo and Nb). Signatures of various organics were traced using FTIR. Aerosol columnar spectral optical properties, size distribution and meteorology in tandem with aforementioned aerosol properties will be discussed in detail during the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Strombolian activity – characterized by discrete, impulsive explosions – is common at basaltic volcanoes. The explosions are caused by the arrival, at the volcanic vent, of over-pressured `slugs' of magmatic gas, which have ascended the volcanic conduit. We present data from large-scale analogue experiments which reveal a previously-undescribed process which promotes the formation of large, highly over-pressured `super slugs'. We propose that these large slugs may drive the most violent Strombolian eruptions.\nExperiments were performed at the Large Analogue Volcano Apparatus at Durham University, UK, which comprises a 13m tall, 24cm diameter transparent conduit, surmounting a reservoir of analogue magma held at constant pressure. We simulate a vesiculation event deep in the sub-volcanic plumbing system by fluxing gas into the reservoir. Magma analogues with a range of viscosities are used, giving slug Reynolds numbers in the range 16 to 140,000. At moderate-to-high Reynolds number, we find that the gas rapidly self-organizes to form a conduit-filling lead slug; this slug ascends the column slowly, at a velocity limited by the flux of the falling film of liquid around it. Trailing bubbles, which ascend through the wake of the lead slug, rise much more rapidly. As they catch and coalesce with the lead slug, it grows and becomes increasingly over-pressured. This mechanism causes large slugs to form rapidly and we propose that it underpins the formation of the very large slugs that are responsible for the most explosive strombolian eruptions.",

Bathymetry of the source region (Amante and Eakins, 2009), seismicity studies (e.g., Uchida et al., 2010), and tomographic studies (e.g., Zhao et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2014) support the seamount hypothesis. However, the seamount in our previous study was parameterized by elevated effective normal stress and shear stress on a planar, shallow-dipping subduction plane. In this study, we incorporate seamount geometry into spontaneous rupture models of a non-planar megathrust fault, to examine geometrical effects of a subducted seamount in the 2011 event. In particular, we examine geometrical effects of the seamount with various plausible initial stress conditions on the non-planar fault, including heterogeneous stress fields that may account for effects of previous magnitude 7~8 earthquakes. Furthermore, our non-planar fault is embedded in layered velocity structure, so that combined effects of fault geometrical complexity and surrounding velocity structure on rupture propagation of the 2011 event can be examined. We will compare our synthetics with near-field coseismic GPS and/or seismic recordings to constrain our models. More physical insights into why the rupture propagated in the way it did in the 2011 event will be gained from this study.",

One mechanism for doing so involves utilizing high altitude ballooning as a tool for providing authentic investigation opportunities in the geosciences. As individual states review and make decisions about what role the NGSS will play in their standards, it is important for college and university science teacher preparation programs to prepare current and future teachers to become more comfortable with designing research investigations, controlling variables, anticipating cross-disciplinary connections, refining and analyzing data, and communicating the findings of real and contrived scientific investigation. Many undergraduate and professional development research possibilities exist through high altitude ballooning, including: microbiological experimentation at high altitudes, microcontroller use for context-specific data collection, near-space system development and design, balloon flight-track modeling, and more. Example projects and findings will be shared.   Equally important to creating appropriate learning activities to address NGSS expectations is understanding the context-specific needs and available resources existing in K-12 science classrooms. Findings from semi-structured interviews with a focus group of pre-service and practicing teachers will be presented -- from both participants and non-participants in high altitude ballooning activities -- related to how high altitude ballooning could be (or already is) being used to meet NGSS and state science standards. The two primary outcomes of the presentation are to: 1) inform science teacher preparation programs for purposes of structuring useful and appropriate science methods activities; 2) frame the K-12 science classroom environment for consideration of the practicality of high altitude ballooning activities for meeting state and national science standards.",

The data will be used for the evaluation and improvement of high-resolution air quality models for eventual application in determining the fates of these pollutants and their deposition to the downwind ecosystems. Various chemical species were measured from the National Research Council of Canada Convair-580 aircraft at high time resolution of 1-10 seconds. A total of 22 flights were flown, with 14 flights dedicated to emission validation, 5 flights to transport and transformation of oil sands pollutants, and 5 flights to satellite data validation. An algorithm will be shown to demonstrate how the data from the emission flights can be used to derive a top-down estimate of SO2 emission rates.",

            "abstract": "Surfactant water flooding has been used in petroleum engineering as a technology for enhancing the recovery of petroleum from geological systems following the primary and secondary phases of oil recovery. Enhanced oil recovery or tertiary phase may produce about 25% of additional oil. It is essential to exploit petroleum reservoirs efficiently as oil resources are being continuously depleted and becoming scarce. Recent advances in petroleum engineering involve the application of nanoparticles for enhanced oil recovery. Therefore our experimental research investigates the couple use of surfactants and nanoparticles for enhanced oil recovery. We studied the influence of nonionic and anionic surfactants on the physico-chemical properties of nano-silica particles that are critical for enhanced oil recovery processes. These physico-chemical properties include the interfacial tension between crude oil and nanofluids with and without the addition of surfactants, the contact angle of these (surfactant) nanofluids on mineral thin sections, the size of nanoaggregates in these (surfactant) nanofluids, as well as their surfaces charges. As surfactants impact the physico-chemical properties of nanofluids, multiphase flow will also be impacted.",

            "abstract": "Glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) has, until recently, been estimated using forward models that attempt to determine how the mantle and lithosphere respond to changes in ice loading through time. These models require knowledge of the Earth structure, including mantle viscosity, and ice load history, both of which have large uncertainties for Antarctica. Furthermore, 3-D Earth models are required to adequately accommodate the substantial variations in crustal thickness between West and East Antarctica.\nAn alternative approach is to use observations of crustal motion from GPS, combined with mass trends from GRACE to invert for GIA. However, this is an undetermined problem. Here, we present a novel solution to this problem using the latest methods in statistical modelling of spatio-temporal processes. We use Bayesian hierarchical modelling and employ stochastic partial differential equations to allow us to solve, simultaneously, for ice mass trends and GIA. Here, we focus on the GIA solution derived from a combination of ICESat, ENVISAT, GRACE, InSAR, GPS and regional climate model output data for the period 2003-2009, assuming that GIA is time-invariant over this time frame.\nWe compare our results with forward models and other inverse approaches. Our rates differ substantially regionally compared with the latest forward model solutions. For the Pine Island basin, for example, we obtain a rate close to 1 mm/yr as opposed to over 4 mm/yr for the models IJ05v2 and W12a. Over East Antarctica our rates are generally higher than forward models and we obtain positive values over a large area of Dronning Maud Land, where subsidence is predicted from forward modelling. On the other hand, we obtain negative trends over a large portion of Wilkes Land which is in good agreement with the results from IJ05v2, W12a and AGE-1. Compared to IJ05v2, our maximum uplifts are shifted towards the Ross and Ronne Ice Shelves, corresponding to about 4 and 6 mm/yr respectively. Over the Antarctic Peninsula we predict higher GIA uplifts than forward models, rating between 3 and 6 mm/yr over the entire region.",

            "abstract": "The convexity of soil-covered hillslopes has long been recognized to reflect transport mechanisms of regolith. Intense previous research using cosmogenic isotopes and numerical models mostly focused on the influence of tectonics and erosion rates in regions with silicate rocks, generally downplaying the influence of parameters such as climate, chemical denudation rates and dust flux. The goal of the current research is to characterize and understand how hillslope curvature in carbonate rocks (∂2z/∂x2) vary as a function of precipitation and dust flux. The study area is located in the Eastern Mediterranean across a prominent north-to-south gradient in both precipitation (300 to 1000 mm yr-1) and dust flux (150 to 40 g m-2 yr-1).\nWe combine topographic analysis using high resolution data from airborne LiDAR, field measurements, and numerical modeling. The soil creep diffusion coefficient is evaluated using two different methods: (1) Calculated directly at sites with known cosmogenically-derived erosion rate; (2) Estimated using numerical models at snmites with known initial hillslope form at a known point in time such as volcanic cinder cones with known eruption ages.\nInitial results indicate that soil-mantled, carbonate hillslopes in the sub-humid Eastern Mediterranean are convex and parabolic in form adjacent to the divide and hillslope curvature is strongly correlated with precipitation in an inverse manner. This dependency could reflect: (1) soil creep diffusion coefficients which increase with precipitation, (2) chemical denudation whose relative fraction of the total denudation increases with precipitation, and (3) dust flux which decreases with precipitation. The relative contribution of these 3 components is currently being evaluated.\nDiffusion coefficients were estimated based on numerical modeling of high-resolution, field-measured, hillslope profiles of several cinder cones, across a rainfall gradient from 600 to 900 mm yr-1, without apparent variability in the dust flux. Currently obtained values vary from ~10-2 to ~10-3 m2 yr-1 with no clear-cut precipitation dependency.",

            "abstract": "Our understanding of soil and plant water relations is currently limited by the lack of experimental methods to measure the water fluxes in soil and plants. Our study aimed to develop a new non-destructive method to measure the local fluxes of water into roots of plants growing in soils. We injected deuterated water (D2O) near the roots of lupines growing in sandy soils, and we used neutron radiography to image the transport of D2O through the root system. The experiments were performed during day, when plants were transpiring, and at night, when transpiration was reduced. The radiographs showed that: 1) the radial transport of D2O from soil and roots depended similarly to diffusion and convection; and 2) the axial transport of D2O along the root xylem was largely dominated by convection. To determine the convective fluxes from the radiographs, we simulated the D2O transport in soils and roots. A dual porosity model was used to describe the apoplastic and symplastic pathways of water across the root tissue. Other features such as the endodermis and the xylem were also included in the model. The D2O transport was modelled solving a convection-diffusion numerical model in soil and plants. The diffusion coefficients of the root tissues were inversely estimated by simulating the experiments at night under the assumption that at night the convective fluxes were negligible. Inverse modelling of the experiment at day gave the profile of water fluxes into the roots. For 24 day-old lupine grown in a sandy soil with uniform water content, our modelling results showed that root water uptake was higher at the proximal parts of the roots near soil surface and it decreased toward the distal parts. The method allows the quantification of the root properties and the regions of root water uptake along root systems growing in soils. Future applications of this method include the characterization of varying root systems, the radial and axial hydraulic conductivity of different root types, the changes in root permeability with root age and soil conditions, and the effect of aquaporines, endodermis and number and radius of xylem vessels on water transport.",

            "abstract": "Weathering, erosion and mineralogical sorting processes modify the chemical and isotopic compositions of sediments relative to those of their source rocks. The way and extent to which those processes affect the geochemistry of sediments is however not yet fully understood. Here, we report trace element data as well as Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic compositions of sediments sampled at different water depths in the Ganges, Yamuna and Chambal Rivers draining the Deccan Traps basalts and the crystalline and sedimentary rocks from the Himalayan mountain range and the northern Indian shield.\nIsotopic differences between surface and bed sediments sampled at the same location reach 6 εNd and about 15 εHf units, suggesting that suspended loads and bedloads do not carry similar provenance information. Such differences are explained by the combined effects of differential erosion and mineralogical sorting processes during fluvial transport. Materials eroded from basalts are preferentially transported in suspension near the river surface while materials eroded from more crystalline precursors are transported near the bottom of the river. This depth-dependent provenance within the river channel leads to an overrepresentation of basaltic materials in fine-grained suspended loads that are finally delivered into the ocean and become part of the oceanic terrigenous clays. By contrast, the proportion of basaltic materials in coarser sediments such as bedloads or turbidites is underestimated.\nOur results have important consequences on the use of Nd, Hf and Pb isotopic compositions of sediments as provenance proxies because they indicate that all grain-size fractions must be taken into account to properly trace source compositions. They also suggest that upper continental crust estimates derived from fine-grained sediments, such as suspended loads, may be biased towards basaltic compositions if basaltic outcrops are present in the drainage area.",

            "abstract": "In the context of riverine floodplains, hydrologic connectivity describes the water mediated exchange of matter and energy between the river and its adjacent floodplain. As riverine networks shift from headwater streams to large river systems, flood events transition from short, periodic episodes to longer, sustained flood pulses. While these processes are important to biogeochemical processing, little has been done to quantify the relative influence of physiography on floodplain-river interactions across the nation’s river network. This study examined flow data from over 14,000 USGS gaging stations across the United States. The threshold for flooding, analogous to bankful stage, was estimated using a breakpoint analysis of each gage’s rating curve. Individual floods were then identified across each respective flow record, and a series of metrics were calculated to characterize floodplain connectivity. The distribution and timing of flood events was strongly correlated with basin size and prevailing hydro-climatic conditions (e.g. coastal, interior, and snowmelt systems). Analysis of cumulative flood duration was extended to the entire US stream network, and floodplain connectivity was quantified by the product of stream length and inundation duration. Initial results suggest that floodplain connectivity increases with stream order and highlights the importance of large river floodplains in the fate and transport of materials within riverine networks.",

            "abstract": "One of the best ways to engage students and instill enthusiasm for hydrology is to expose them to hands-on learning. A focus on hydrology field research can be used to develop context-rich and active learning, and help solidify idealized learning where students are introduced to individual processes through textbook examples, often neglecting process interactions and an appreciation for the complexity of the system. We introduced a field course where hydrological measurement techniques are used to study processes such as snow hydrology and runoff generation, while also introducing students to field research and design of their own field project. In the field projects, students design a low-budget experiment with the aim of going through the different steps of a 'real' scientific project, from formulating the research question to presenting their results. In one of the field excursions, students make discharge measurements in several alpine streams with a salt tracer to better understand the spatial characteristics of an alpine catchment, where source waters originate and how they contribute to runoff generation. Soil moisture measurements taken by students in this field excursion were used to analyze spatial soil moisture patterns in the alpine catchment and subsequently used in a publication. Another field excursion repeats a published experiment, where preferential soil flow paths are studied using a tracer and compared to previously collected data. For each field excursion, observational data collected by the students is uploaded to an online database we developed, which also allows students to retrieve data from past excursions to further analyze and compare their data. At each of the field sites, weather stations were installed and a webviewer allows access to realtime data from data loggers, allowing students to explore how processes relate to climatic conditions. With in-house film expertise, these field excursions were also filmed and short virtual excursions were produced, which we plan to use in a large introductory course, exposing students to field research at an early stage.",

Anisotropy tomography can provide new perspective to the continental growth mechanism. In order to study the 3D anisotropic structure of the upper mantle in the south-central Mongolia, we collected the vertical and transverse components of seismograms recorded at 69 broadband seismic stations. We have measured inter-station phase velocities of 7181 Rayleigh waves and 901 Love waves using the frequency-time analysis of wavelet transformation method for the fundamental mode at period range 10~80s. The lateral phase velocity variations are computed by using a regionalization method. These phase velocities have been inverted to obtain the first anisotropic model including Sv velocities, azimuthal and radial anisotropy. The Middle Gobi is associated with low velocity. Based on the distribution of the Cenozoic basalts in the Middle Gobi, it refers that the low velocity anomaly is related to the Cenozoic volcanism. In the northern domain, near to Baikal zone, the azimuthal anisotropy is normal to the Baikal rift and consistent with the fast direction of previous SKS splitting measurements. In the South Gobi, north to Main Mongolian Lineament, the azimuthal anisotropy is NEE-SWW in the crust and NW-SE in the mantle. It indicates that the crust and mantle are decoupled. We propose that the crustal deformation is related to the far-field effects of India-Asia collision and that the mantle flow is correlated with the Baikal rift activity. Further study in process will provide more evidence and insight to better understand the geodynamics in this region.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic islands are intrinsic products of multiple X-line magnetic reconnection. They are closely related to the energy dissipation in reconnection, such as the electron energization. Generally there are three type islands: the primary island formed between two preexisting X-lines; the secondary island formed as a result of tearing instability in an elongated thin current sheet; merged island due to island coalescence between two islands. In this study, we performed a series large-scale two-dimensional electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell simulation to study the magnetic island dynamics and energy dissipation during multiple X-line reconnection.\nThe merged island after coalescence is characterized by strong core field and plasma density dip at the island center. We find that the core field enhancement is caused by the out-of-plane magnetic field pileup, as well as the field line twisting due to Hall effect. Total force points away or tangentially to the surface of density dip within the merged island, which prevents electrons from higher density region entering the lower density region between two merging islands. This is contrary to the force in the secondary island, inside which the total force points towards the island center and constrains plasma there. The coalescence process involves a reconnection at the merging sheet between two islands. Electron frozen-in condition is violated locally along the merging sheet. It is contributed by both the divergence of electron pressure tensor and electron inertial. Energy dissipation is concentrated on the merging line during coalescence, while a train of dynamo (j’•E’<0) and dissipation (j’•E’>0) regions are distributed along the merging sheet after coalescence. Electrons and ions within the density dip at the island center are accelerated anti-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, i.e., along the out-of-plane direction. The resultant distribution can excite the Buneman instability and two-streaming instability, which probably account for the electrostatic solitary waves observed by satellite. The energy and energy flux partition among the different types of islands are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial confluences are natural reactors that can determine the fate of contaminants in watersheds receiving acid drainage. Hydrological, hydrodynamic and chemical factors determine distinct conditions for the formation of suspended particles of iron and aluminum oxyhydroxides. The chemical and physical properties of these particle assemblages (e.g. particle size, chemical composition) can vary according to inflow mixing ratios, hydrodynamic velocity profiles, and chemical composition of the flows mixing at the confluence. Due to their capacity to sorb metals, it is important to identify the optimal conditions for removing metals from the aqueous phase, particularly arsenic, a contaminant frequently found in acid drainage. \nWe studied a river confluence in the Lluta watershed, located in the arid Chilean Altiplano. We performed field measurements and laboratory studies to find optimal mixing ratio for arsenic sorption onto oxyhydroxide particles at the confluence between the Azufre (pH=2, As=2 mg/L) and the Caracarani river (pH=8, As<0.1 mg/L). As the contribution of the acidic stream increased, the concentration of Fe and Al in the solid phase reached a peak at different pHs. Although the optimal pH for As sorption was ~3, the overall maximum removal of As at the confluence, ocurred for pH~4. This is produced because optimal As sorption does not occur necessarily for the highest concentrations of particles being formed. \nWe propose that fluvial confluences could be engineered to enhance the natural attenuation of contaminants. An analogy between confluences and coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation drinking water plants could be used to engineer such intervention.\nAcknowledgements: Proyecto Fondecyt 1130936 and Proyecto CONICYT FONDAP 15110020",

            "abstract": "A means to sense surface PM2.5 levels from space would be a great help to Air Quality Community and requires linking surface PM2.5 to aerosol optical properties and integrated extinction (aerosol optical depth or AOD) readily sensed from space. In the eastern United States, this should be straightforward, since the aerosol is relatively spatially homogeneous, is of the right size to scatter efficiently, and is comprised of sulfate and other anthropogenic compounds readily measured, although changes in relative humidity can confound retrievals. To link the satellite-observed AOD to the surface PM2.5, aircraft observations of aerosol scattering and absorption were conducted over air quality monitoring sites with surface PM2.5 measurements in the Eastern Shore in summer 2013 and 2104. Initial analysis shows that the integrated aerosol extinction within the aerosol layer observed by the aircraft is highly correlated with the PM2.5 concentration observed at the surface. A better correlation was found between the surface PM2.5 concentration and the averaged aerosol scattering in a layer close to the surface. Concurrent VIIRS satellite AOD observations are compared to the aircraft observations of AOD (integrated scattering and absorption). Conditions with good correlation between the satellite AOD and surface PM2.5 were identified.",

            "abstract": "The Taiwan orogenic belt results from a collision between the Luzon Arc and Eurasia Plate. Since the pioneering work of Suppe (1984), many researches have considered the collision to be a result of an oblique collision between the N-S trending Luzon Arc, which moves NW at 8-9 cm/yr., and the NE trending continental margin of the EurasiaPlate. This collision is thought to have produced a southward propagating orogenic system. We combine zircon fission-track ages along the Hsüehshan and Central Ranges with timing of rapid subsidence in the foreland basin to identify the timing of the onset of orogenesis. The oldest completely reset zircon fission-track ages are ca.5 Ma along nearly the entire length of the orogen and the onset of rapid tectonic subsidence in both the northern and southern parts of the foreland basin is also ca. 5Ma. We propose that N-S rifting in the South China Sea created a N-S trending continental margin before the collision rather than the commonly assumed northeast trending margin. Consequently, both this N-S trending continental margin and the Luzon arc of the Philippine Sea Plate were sub-parallel, resulting in a simultaneous collision.",

In the context of a simple energetic framework, variations in SST in both basins are shown to modulate the ITCZ position through the exchange of energy between the surface ocean and the atmosphere. On multi-decadal timescales, the AMO and the PDO exert similar influences on the ITCZ, shifting it northwards when the northern Atlantic and Pacific basins are anomalously warm. Positive SST anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes create inter-hemispheric thermal contrasts in the troposphere, which the tropical atmospheric circulation responds to by shifting the Hadley cells and the ITCZ. On inter-annual timescales, a North Atlantic Oscillation-like pattern of atmospheric forcing dominates North Atlantic sea-surface temperature variability, obscuring the connection between ocean circulation variability and the ITCZ position on those timescales. The differences between oceanic and atmospheric forcing of North Atlantic sea surface temperature on multi-decadal versus inter-annual timescales are discussed in terms of the ocean’s mixed-layer energy budget.",

            "abstract": "Nonlinear interactions involving whistler wave turbulence can result from wave-particle interactions and instabilities in sharp boundary layers. Given sufficient whistler energy density, nonlinear scattering off thermal electrons substantially changes the wave vector direction and energy flux, while inducing a small frequency shift (see Crabtree, Phys. Plasmas 19, 032903 (2012)). In the magnetosphere, boundary layers containing highly sheared plasma flows drive lower hybrid waves, leading to the formation of quasi-static structures in the nonlinearly saturated state. Such processes are being investigated in the NRL Space Physics Simulation Chamber (SPSC) in conditions scaled to match the respective environments. The specific nonlinear process being examined is the scattering of a transversely propagating, primarily electrostatic, lower hybrid wave into a more parallel propagating electromagnetic whistler mode. Sufficiently large amplitude lower hybrid waves have been observed to scatter into whistler modes by scattering from thermal electrons. The plasma response as a function of transmitted lower hybrid wave amplitude is monitored with magnetic antennas. The experiments have demonstrated large changes in wave propagation angle and small frequency downshifts consistent with nonlinear Landau damping when pump wave amplitudes exceed the small threshold value (dB/B0 ~ 4×10-7). *This work supported by the NRL Base Program.",

            "abstract": "Proxy-based reconstructions of past climate have played an integral role in assessments of historical climate change, and tree-ring widths (TRW) have a long history of use in this paleoclimate research due to their annual resolution, widespread availability, and sensitivity of growth processes to variation in temperature and water availability. Increasingly, studies have shown that additional tree-ring metrics—including earlywood and latewood widths (EW and LW, respectively), maximum latewood density, and the intensity of reflected blue light from latewood (BI)—can provide additional information on seasonal climatic variability that is not present in TRW alone due to different processes that affect growth in different parts of the growing season. Studies of these additional tree-ring metrics highlight their utility in climate reconstructions, but to date they have mostly been limited to a few tree species and regions. Here, we extend the range of previous studies on alternative tree-ring metrics by evaluating the seasonal climate signals in TRW, EW, LW, and BI of Pinus ponderosa at six semiarid sites surrounding the Columbia River basin in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW). Cores from each site were cross-dated and EW, LW, and TRW were measured using standard dendrochronological procedures. BI was obtained using a high-resolution flatbed scanner and CooRecorder software. To evaluate the unique climate processes and seasonalities contributing to different dendrochronological metrics, monthly temperature and precipitation from each site were obtained from the PRISM climate model and were correlated with each of the tree-ring metrics using the MATLAB program SEASCORR. We also evaluate the potential of using multiple tree-ring metrics (rather than a single proxy) in reconstructions of precipitation in the PNW. Initial results suggest that 1) tree growth at each site is water-limited but with substantial differences among the sites in the strength and seasonality of correlations between precipitation and tree-ring metrics, and 2) EW tends to be more dependent on conditions in the prior growing season while LW tends to be related to water availability early in the current growing season. Results from this study illustrate the potential utility of multiproxy dendroclimatology for paleoclimate research.",

The rheology of olivine controls the depth to the asthenosphere where ductile flow becomes weaker than the frictional strength of rocks. Evidence for nonlinear viscoelastic deformation has been found in the continental mantle (Freed & Burgmann, 2004), but never before in the oceanic context. Here, we analyze the transient deformation following the 2012 Mw 8.6 Wharton Basin earthquake that was recorded by continuous geodetic stations along Sumatra to show strong evidence for power-law flow in the Wharton Basin asthenosphere. A combination of afterslip on the reactivated fracture zones and viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere can fully explain the geodetic time series. But whereas Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip around the main shock imply widespread subsidence around Banda Aceh, the models that include power-law flow successfully reproduce the regional postseismic uplift. These observations provide us with unprecedented insight about the mechanism of deep, far-reaching, and time-dependent stress transfer between seismic events along the Sumatra subduction zone.",

It has been known that the crust deformation activates and releases gases/charges which generate the atmospheric electric field and currents possibly resulting in luminous phenomena before and during large earthquakes. The lightning activity has been known to be one of key parameters understanding the atmospheric electric field near the Earth’s surface. However, lightning activities during large earthquakes have not yet been studied and reported. It is found that lightning activities significantly increase 3-8 and 20-30 days before the 21 September 1999 Mw7.6 earthquake. A statistical analysis has been conducted to study lightning activities over the epicenter 30 days before and after 78 land and 230 sea M≥5.0 earthquakes in Taiwan during 1994-2003. We find that lightning activities over the epicenter occur more frequently few days before the land earthquakes which is termed pre-earthquake lightning anomaly (PELA). For earthquakes with larger magnitudes, the PELA appears more frequent and expands a larger area from the epicenter. Our results confirm that the PELA associated with the M≥6.5 land earthquakes with the depth less than 20 km and 18 cumulative days meet the significant level 0.05. These suggest that for the PELA, the Earth’s surface deformation plays an important role during the earthquake preparation period. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for developing lithosphere-atmosphere coupling model of earth system sciences.",

Increases in computer power recently have allowed large-eddy simulations (LES; grid spacing of O(100 m)) of deep convection, which are beginning to increase our understanding of this unresolved issue. Our research examined the Weather Research and Forecasting model in LES mode (WRF-LES) as a potential tool to further our understanding of deep convective cloud dynamics and microphysics. Idealized and nested WRF-LESs were made for 02 September 2013, a day on which 3 aircraft from the recent NASA SEAC4RS campaign extensively sampled deep convection during all phases of its lifecycle. When modeling deep convection at the LES scale, one of the greatest uncertainties is the choice of cloud microphysical parameterization. Thus, we tested the sensitivity of the WRF-LESs to several microphysical schemes. Simulated flight tracks were used to evaluate the WRF-LESs against the dynamical and microphysical data gathered during the SEAC4RS aircraft cloud penetrations. Results indicated the importance of cloud microphysical parameterizations when making deep convective LESs, especially if they are used to develop cumulus parameterizations. Results from the idealized WRF-LESs then were used to “tune” a real-data run in which the WRF-LES domain was nested within a mesoscale domain. This multi-scale nesting of an LES provides a framework for making detailed simulations of case studies when high-resolution observed data are available for evaluation. This nesting approach also might provide a new method, which uses more realistic atmospheric forcing for the LES, to develop cumulus parameterizations.",

The results of previous studies showed that some were frequency dependent while others were frequency independent. They used different methods and limited digital earthquake data. We analyzed seismograms of 400 earthquakes recorded at seismic stations operated by Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, Korea Meteorological Administration, and Korea Electric Power Research Institute from January 2001 to June 2014. The magnitudes (ML) were between 2.0 and 5.1, the hypocentral distances between 20 and 120 km. We used ground velocities by removing the instrument response for the safety purpose. Seismograms of 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-16, and 16-32 Hz frequency bands were analyzed to determine frequency dependent Qs-values. Coda normalization technique was employed. To avoid the polarization effect, we utilized the vectorial amplitude of an equation (1), where AE, AN, and AZ are EW, NS, and vertical components of a seismogram, respectively. If the root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of coda waves is less than twice of the noise rms amplitude, the data were ignored. The Qs-values were determined 143, 572, 1214, 1694, and 1856 at frequency bands of 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 Hz, respectively as preliminary results. The best fitting frequency dependent Qs-value presentation was Qs = 318.2f 0.53.",

The measured crustal thickness varies from 29 to 37 km in the eastern part of China, and gradually increase to ~45-50 km towards the central and northwestern parts. The crust beneath the entire Tibetan plateau is as thick as 60 km and extends to over 80 km in several locations. The estimated crustal thickness generally shows a positively correlation with surface topography in most of the study area, but does break in some regions, such as the Tianshan mountain range, the Songliao basin and the Changbaishan-Zhangguangcai Range. The linear slope derived from the crustal thickness and surface topography data shows significant lateral variations, indicating that there exist large variations in density structure across the study area. We also use amplitude ratio between the Ps conversion and reverberation phases to constrain density contrast across the Moho. Our preliminary results indicate that two methods produce roughly similar lateral variations in density structure.",

            "abstract": "The ability of a microbe to persist in low-nutrient environments requires adaptive mechanisms to survive. These microorganisms must reduce metabolic energy and increase catabolic efficiency. For example, Escherichia coli surviving in low-nutrient extended stationary phase have mutations that confer a growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype, thus allowing for persistence for years in low-nutrient environments. Based on the fact that subseafloor environments are characterized by energy flux decrease with time of burial we hypothesize that cells from older (deeper) sediment layers will have more altered genomes compared to sequenced surface relatives and that these differences reflect adaptations to a low-energy flux environment. To test this hypothesis, sediment samples were collected from the Andaman Sea from the depths of 21, 40 and 554 meters below seafloor, with the ages of 0.34, 0.66, and 8.76 million years, respectively. A single operational taxonomic unit within Firmicutes, based on full-length 16S rDNA, dominated these low diversity samples. This unique feature allowed for metagenomic sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq to identify nucleotide variations (NV) between the subsurface Firmicutes and the closest sequenced representative, Bacillus subtilis BEST7613. NVs were present at all depths in genes that code for proteins used in energy-dependent proteolysis, cell division, sporulation, and (similar to the GASP mutants) biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids. Conserved genes such as 16S rDNA did not contain NVs. More NVs were found in genes from deeper depths. These NV may be beneficial or harmful allowing them to survive for millions of years in the deep biosphere or may be latent deleterious gene alterations that are masked by the minimal-growth status of these deep microbes. Either way these results show that microbes present in the deep biosphere experience environmental forcing that alters the genome.",

Cirrus in the TTL plays an important role on the radiation budget of the Earth, and is important ramifications for stratospheric water vapor (chemical/radiative balance in the stratosphere) and the transport process between troposphere and stratosphere. Over the eastern tropical Pacific, the cirrus cloud occurrence in the TTL is normally low because the eastern tropical Pacific is isolated from the deep convective region. However extensive cirrus cloud with a horizontal scale of ~3000 km was found in January 2009 (Taylor et al., 2009). Following Taylor et al. (2009), we investigate the thin cirrus over the eastern tropical Pacific during winters from 2006/2007 to 2012/2013 by using CALIOP data. We found the extensive cirrus clouds (~3000 km >) in January 2009, February 2010, and January 2013, and all three cases were formed by cold temperature anomalies. The anomalies are deeply related to eastward propagating convective systems in the tropics and the penetration of Rossby waves into the tropics.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric measurements of trace gases with ‘known’ emissions provide a means to derive emission magnitudes of other simultaneously measured trace gases, provided sources are co-located and co-varying. Here we consider atmospheric mixing ratio covariations in the fossil fuel derived component of observed CO2 (Cff; derived from high-precision measurements of the radiocarbon fraction of atmospheric CO2) relative to more than 20 other anthropogenic trace gases including CO, CH4, N2O, SF6, and halo- and hydro-carbons over large industrialized land areas. Pairing Cff with boundary-layer concentration enhancements of these gases allows us to determine apparent emission ratios for each gas with respect to Cff. When combined with sample-specific model-derived spatial footprints and the relatively accurate U.S. inventory of fossil fuel emissions (i.e., estimated uncertainty of ±10%), absolute emission rates for the correlate gases are derived. Here we will present U.S. annual emission magnitudes for select gases based on year-round measurements from tall towers and aircraft profiling sites in California, Texas, the mid-west, south-east and north-east for the 2009-2012 period. Statistically significant and coherent spatial and seasonal patterns in emission ratios and absolute emissions are determined for many gases based on these measurements. For HFC-134a and HCFC-22, results derived with this approach generally agree very well with an independent Bayesian-inversion based analysis of the larger number of samples collected and analyzed in our network, but that are not paired with Cff measurements. We believe this approach provides reliable 'top down', observationally-based emission estimates for these gases, many of which influence climate, air quality and stratospheric ozone.",

By characterizing the spatial distribution of the density and temperature inside the lightning channel, in conjunction with these high-resolution opacities, we are able to identify the region from which the observable optical spectrum is emitted. We model this spectrum in detail for visible wavelengths over the range of approximately 400-700 nm, identifying key features in the spectrum.

The same east-west-trending orogenic belts, corresponding to continental terranes which amalgamated with Asia prior to the collision with India, wrap around the Pamir and Tibet. The southern Pamir is equivalent to the Lhasa terrane in Tibet and consists of Paleozoic-Mesozoic meta-sedimentary rocks, rare Proterozoic gneisses, and voluminous Creaceous-Palaeogene granitoids. The Pamir, however, has been displaced northward by approximately 600km with respect to the Tarim Basin. Today, there is strong geophysical evidence that a slab of Asian lithosphere has been underthrust south-southeastward beneath the Pamir.\nIn summer 2013 we installed 85 broad-band magnetotelluric (MT) stations in the southern Pamir covering a 200km wide and 100km long area between Murghab and Khorugh, with a site spacing of approximately 8km. MT data quality is excellent in the sparsely populated southeastern Pamir plateau and heterogeneous or even strongly disturbed by electromagnetic noise in the populated southwestern Pamir. The magnetotelluric survey was part of the interdisciplinary TIPTIMON (Tien-Shan-Pamir Monitoring Program) project.\n3D inversion of the data reveals a prominent low-resistivity zone at a depth of approx. 10 km. This anomaly, with resistivities below 10 Ωm, extends across the entire southeastern Pamir and appears to be limited to the West by the Shakdara dome. The crystalline basement of the Shakdara dome is imaged as resistive material. We interpret the observed low resistivity of the southeastern Pamir is as partially molten felsic material at middle to lower crustal levels.",

The HIM calculates 9 different heat stress and 4 moist thermodynamic quantities using meteorological inputs of T, P, and Q. These heat stress metrics are commonly used throughout the world. We show new methods for integrating and standardizing practices for applying these metrics with the latest Earth system models. We implemented the HIM into CLM4.5, a component of CESM, maintained by NCAR. These heat stress metrics cover philosophical approaches of comfort, physiology, and empirically based algorithms. The metrics are directly connected to the Urban, Canopy, Bare Ground, and Lake modules, to differentiate distinct regimes within each grid cell. The module calculates the instantaneous moisture-temperature covariance at every model time step and in every land surface type, capturing all aspects of non-linearity. The HIM uses the most accurate and computationally efficient moist thermodynamic algorithms available. Additionally, we show ways that the HIM may be effectively integrated into climate modeling and observations. The module is flexible. The user may decide which metrics to call, and there is an offline version of the HIM that is available to be used with weather and climate datasets. Examples include using high temporal resolution CMIP5 archive data, local weather station data, and weather and forecasting models. \nTo provide comprehensive standards for applying the HIM to climate data, we executed a CLM4.5 simulation using the RCP8.5 boundary conditions. Preliminary results show moist thermodynamic and heat stress quantities have smaller variability in the extremes as compared to extremes in T (both at the 95th percentile). Additionally, the magnitude of the moist thermodynamic changes over land is similar to sea surface temperature changes. The metric changes from the early part of the 21st century as compared to the end of the 21st century show that many portions of the world switch from moderate levels of heat stress for the top 2 weeks of a year to severe heat stress for the top 2 weeks of a year. These changes are reflected in livestock (THI); evaporative cooling (SWMP80) and air-conditioning; and industrial, military, and athletic heat stress (sWBGT, DI, HI, etc.).",

            "abstract": "The Alaska Tsunami Forecast Model (ATFM) is a numerical model used to forecast propagation and inundation of tsunamis generated by earthquakes and other means in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. At the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC), the model is mainly used in a pre-computed fashion. That is, results for hundreds of hypothetical events are computed before alerts, and are accessed and calibrated with observations during tsunamis to immediately produce forecasts. ATFM uses the non-linear, depth-averaged, shallow-water equations of motion with multiply nested grids in two-way communications between domains of each parent-child pair as waves get closer to coastal waters. Even with the pre-computation the task becomes non-trivial as sub-grid resolution gets finer. Currently, the finest resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) used by ATFM are 1/3 arc-seconds. With a serial code, large or multiple areas of very high resolution can produce run-times that are unrealistic even in a pre-computed approach.\nOne way to increase the model performance is code parallelization used in conjunction with a multi-processor computing environment. NTWC developers have undertaken an ATFM code-parallelization effort to streamline the creation of the pre-computed database of results with the long term aim of tsunami forecasts from source to high resolution shoreline grids in real time. Parallelization will also permit timely regeneration of the forecast model database with new DEMs; and, will make possible future inclusion of new physics such as the non-hydrostatic treatment of tsunami propagation. The purpose of our presentation is to elaborate on the parallelization approach and to show the compute speed increase on various multi-processor systems.",

            "abstract": "The precipitation from a US West Coast winter storm grows in a complex system. To attempt to quantify the effect of changing aerosol properties on precipitation from such storms, we have conducted a model sensitivity experiment using two case studies from February 2011 over Northern and Central California. The storm from each case was simulated using the Weather Research and Forecast model with Spectral Bin Microphysics which has been modified to allow for aerosol chemistry and surface area sensitive ice nucleation. Each storm contains a strong baroclinic zone which marks a discontinuity in upper-layer long range transported aerosol source. We will present evidence herein which suggests that the baroclinic zone discontinuity in aerosol source is common in West Coast winter storms and may have profound impacts on the growth of precipitation in orographic post-frontal clouds. To isolate the change in aerosol source from the meteorology, we have simulated the time period before and after a cold front transits our model domain in two configurations. In the first, the temporal evolution of aerosol chemistry, size, concentration and vertical location follows that observed by aircraft during an intensive field phase, during which elevated layers containing ice-nuclei active dust and biological aerosols were observed after a cold front. In the second configuration, the aerosol properties approximate those observed during the pre-frontal period and remain constant throughout the simulation. Simulated cloud and precipitation properties are validated using data from a continuous flow diffusion chamber, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and cooperative raingauge stations. We find that introducing an elevated dust and biological aerosol layer immediately after cold front transit increases post-frontal hourly precipitation rates by 23 percent. Greater increases are found when near surface winds are westerly and temperatures are cold. The frequency of clouds with top pressure less than 400 hPa increases dramatically. Analyses of water phase segregation and cloud particle size distributions suggest that cloud microphysical processes other than ice nucleation respond to the proliferation of ice-nuclei active aerosol particles, and are primarily responsible for the precipitation rate increase.",

            "abstract": "Computational models are important tools that can be used to quantitatively understand the evolution of real landscapes. Commonalities exist among most landscape evolution models, although they are also idiosyncratic, in that they are coded in different languages, require different input values, and are designed to tackle a unique set of questions. These differences can make applying a landscape evolution model challenging, especially for novice programmers. In this study, we compare and contrast two landscape evolution models that are designed to tackle similar questions, but the actual model designs are quite different. The first model, CHILD, is over a decade-old and is relatively well-tested, well-developed and well-used. It is coded in C++, operates on an irregular grid and was designed more with function rather than user-experience in mind. In contrast, the second model, Landlab, is relatively new and was designed to be accessible to a wide range of scientists, including those who have not previously used or developed a numerical model. Landlab is coded in Python, a relatively easy language for the non-proficient programmer, and has the ability to model landscapes described on both regular and irregular grids. \nWe present landscape simulations from both modeling platforms. Our goal is to illustrate best practices for implementing a new process module in a landscape evolution model, and therefore the simulations are applicable regardless of the modeling platform. We contrast differences and highlight similarities between the use of the two models, including setting-up the model and input file for different evolutionary scenarios, computational time, and model output. Whenever possible, we compare model output with analytical solutions and illustrate the effects, or lack thereof, of a uniform vs. non-uniform grid. Our simulations focus on implementing a single process, including detachment-limited or transport-limited fluvial bedrock incision and linear or non-linear diffusion of material on hillslopes.

Trade-offs exist between the two modeling platforms, and these are primarily in speed and ease-of-use.",

            "abstract": "Northern South America is identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to be affected by climate change. Furthermore, recent extreme wet seasons over the region have caused diverse socio-economic consequences. Hence, the evaluation of the representation of local climate of rainfall simulations at intra-annual seasonal and inter-annual time scales by the CMIP5 models is urgently required, in order to identify and analyze projections of regional and local climate under a global climate change scenario. Here, we evaluate the ability of seven of the CMIP5 models (selected based on literature review) to represent the seasonal mean precipitation and its inter-annual variability over northern South America. Our results suggest that it is easier for models to reproduce rainfall distribution during boreal summer and fall over both oceans and land, since during these seasons, not only incoming radiation, but also ocean-atmosphere feedbacks over Atlantic and Pacific oceans, locate the ITCZ on the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, models exhibit the worse simulations of the seasonal mean precipitation during boreal winter and spring, when these processes have opposite effects locating the ITCZ. Our results suggest that the models with a better representation of the oceanic ITCZ and the local low-level jets over northern South America, such as the Choco low-level jet, are able to realistically simulate the main features of seasonal precipitation pattern over northern South America.",

The observed wavelengths of the interfacial waves and bedforms are inconsistent with existing theories and scalings. A linear analysis, based on the viscous layer-averaged long-wave equations for the fluid mud and the Meyer-Peter-Mueller equation for sediment transport within the underlying seabed, indicates instability to interfacial waves and bedforms with spatial and temporal scales consistent with the observations. In the model solution, the bedforms force interfacial waves, which in turn create velocities and stresses that produce a net transport of sediment within the seabed toward the bedform crests, thus causing bedform growth and enhancing the forcing of the interfacial waves. The observations and the model results suggest that interfacial waves formed by the mud-seabed instability might create mixing that helps control the thickness, density and viscosity of the mud layer, thus influencing the transport of mud and the damping of surface waves.",

            "abstract": "Near-primary melt compositions (i.e., in equilibrium with >Fo89 olivine) are rare in arc systems. Yet, such melts provide essential views of mantle-derived melts, without further modification by fractional crystallization or other crustal processes, and reveal the diversity of melt compositions that exist in the arc mantle wedge. Here, we present new measurements of naturally glassy, near-primary olivine-hosted melt inclusions from one dredge of Evita seamount (SS07/2008 NLD-02) in the southern Vanuatu arc system. Two distinct basalt types were identified in hand sample upon collection, based on contrasting phenocryst assemblage (Type 1: 1% phenocrysts; Type 2: 15% phenocrysts). We selected melt inclusions from each type and determined major elements, S, and Cl by EMP, H2O and CO2 by FTIR, trace elements by LA-ICP-MS, and Fe3+/∑Fe ratios by XANES. Melt inclusions from both lava types show equilibrium with ≥Fo90 olivine, consistent with host olivine compositions, and thus are near-primary melt compositions that have escaped major modification since departing the mantle wedge. Both have similar maximum dissolved H2O (~2.3 wt.%), high Mg# (48-75), and are basalt to basaltic andesite (SiO2 49-55 wt.%). However, the two lava types have very different major and trace element compositions. Inclusions from Type 1 show relatively flat REE patterns and classic negative anomalies in Nb and Ta, and positive anomalies in Pb and Sr typical of normal arc basalts, and have Fe3+/∑Fe ratios similar to global arc basalts (~0.24). In contrast, melt inclusions from Type 2 exhibit steeply sloped REE patterns with strong depletions in the HREE that suggest garnet in the source lithology for these magmas, either in the subducting slab or the mantle wedge. Moreover, the Type 2 inclusions have high La/Yb (29.5-43) and Sr/Y (50-58), which are classically attributed to partial melting of the basaltic slab, although these inclusions are basaltic, not andesitic. Type 2 inclusions also have Fe3+/∑Fe ratios that are among the highest measured in natural terrestrial glasses (~0.32). The compositions of these near-primary basalts indicate that melts of the mantle wedge, and perhaps melts of the slab, form under oxidizing conditions.",

            "abstract": "Subzones of both reduced and enhanced permeability are often ascribed to fault zones, consistent with a fault-core/damage-zone conceptualization, with associated implications for assessing potential contaminant transport. Within this context, a 31-day pumping test was conducted in relation to a relatively minor, 2000 m long fault zone cutting fractured Cretaceous sandstone interbedded with siltstone and shale at a groundwater remediation site in the Simi Hills of southern California during March-April 2013. Our objective was to evaluate the potential hydrogeologic influence of the fault zone on groundwater movement across and along it by observing the spatial patterns of drawdown and estimated hydraulic properties. A 122 m deep open borehole was pumped at a constant rate of approximately 112 L/min while monitoring hydraulic heads in 14 observation wells, two completed with multi-level systems, within 750 m of the pumping well. Hydraulic heads were monitored for more than 9 months before, during, and after the test. Prior to the test, we used the site’s three-dimensional, equivalent-porous-media groundwater flow model to anticipate the potential response of alternative fault-zone permeability structures. The results suggest that the fault zone may be slightly more permeable (by a factor of about 2 or less) and less confined than the fractured sandstone away from the fault, and is not a significant barrier to groundwater flow across it. Within the areal extent of observed drawdown, the site’s hydrostratigraphic structures exhibited a relatively greater hydraulic influence. The pattern and magnitude of observed drawdown lie within the range of pre-test model simulations, and the test results are now being used to revise and recalibrate the model.",

            "abstract": "We spatially analyze the control over evapotranspiration (ET) imposed by soil moisture across the United States using daily estimates of satellite-derived soil moisture and data-driven ET over a nine-year period (June 2002-June 2011) at 305 locations. The soil moisture data are developed using 0.25-degree resolution satellite observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), where the 9-year time series for each 0.25-degree pixel was selected from three potential algorithms (VUA-NASA, U. Montana, & NASA) based on the maximum mutual information between soil moisture and precipitation (Tuttle & Salvucci (2014), Remote Sens Environ, 114: 207-222). The ET data are developed independent of soil moisture using an emergent relationship between the diurnal cycle of the relative humidity profile and ET. The emergent relation is that the vertical variance of the relative humidity profile is less than what would occur for increased or decreased ET rates, suggesting that land-atmosphere feedback processes minimize this variance (Salvucci and Gentine (2013), PNAS, 110(16): 6287–6291). The key advantage of using this approach to estimate ET is that no measurements of surface limiting factors (soil moisture, leaf area, canopy conductance) are required; instead, ET is estimated from meteorological data measured at 305 common weather stations that are approximately uniformly distributed across the United States. The combination of these two independent datasets allows for a unique spatial analysis of the control on ET imposed by the availability of soil moisture. We fit evaporation efficiency curves across the United States at each of the 305 sites during the summertime (May-June-July-August-September). Spatial patterns are visualized by mapping optimal curve fitting coefficients across the Unites States. An analysis of efficiency curves and their spatial patterns will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Lawsonite eclogites and blueschists are accessible records of processes that occur at depth in subducting slabs and can therefore provide information about the chemical and physical evolution of subduction zones. In composite blueschist-eclogite terranes, blueschists may have formed (1) by prograde metamorphism (pre-eclogite), (2) at the same P-T conditions as eclogite-facies metamorphism as a result of differences in bulk composition, H2O content, or oxidation state, or (3) from retrogression of eclogite, e.g. during exhumation. Field and petrologic observations of lawsonite eclogite and blueschist in the Sivrihisar Massif, Turkey, suggest that some blueschist formed from eclogite during exhumation in the subduction channel, whereas results from thermobarometry suggest that some blueschist formed at the same P-T conditions as eclogite. To test the age, petrologic, and tectonic relationship of coexisting eclogite and blueschist, we applied in situ UV laser ablation 40Ar/39Ar phengite geochronology to eclogite- and blueschist-facies rocks representing different structural positions and displaying different phengite textures and coexisting mineral assemblages.\nPhengite from fresh lawsonite eclogite yield an age of 93 ± 2 Ma and have the narrowest spread in ages (<12 Ma) of any rock type analyzed. Retrogressed (epidote) eclogite yields a mean weighted age of 82 ± 2 Ma. In contrast to the tightly constrained ages obtained in eclogite pods, blueschists and blueschist-facies quartzite exhibit discrete age populations ranging from 82 Ma to 110 Ma. Deformed phengite clusters from lawsonite garnet blueschist record age populations at 82 Ma and 92 Ma. Phengite from lawsonite-garnet veins and glaucophane-rich margins of eclogite pods also record 92 Ma. Omphacite-bearing lawsonite blueschist and a blueschist-facies quartzite from the same structural position contain age populations at 97 Ma and 110 Ma. These results document a sequence of events from prograde blueschist-facies (> 93 Ma) to peak eclogite-facies metamorphism and vein formation (~93 Ma) to retrograde metamorphism (< 90 Ma). Combined with P-T estimates, these new results distinguish prograde from retrograde blueschist assemblages and allow calculation of burial/exhumation rates over the depth range ~80–45 km in a subduction zone.",

We developed the retrieval algorithms that use CloudSat and CALIOP on CALIPSO and also the one for CloudSat, CALIOP and MODIS on Aqua. There are several possible sources of uncertainties in the retrieved values. The backscattering properties of ice particles have not been yet fully understood in lidar wavelengths. There are also uncertainties in the retrieval results in radar- or lidar-only detected cloud regions where only one of the two sensors detected clouds. Multiple scattering contribution in space-borne lidar observations has not been fully evaluated too.\nIn order to assess and reduce these uncertainties, we introduced two approaches. Analyses of independent physical quantities based on the same physical ice particle models used in the retrievals of microphysics might be useful in order to test consistency in the ice particle model and its scattering properties. Second approach is to develop a new type of ground-based active sensor system. Concerning the first approach, backscattering color ratio of ice particles was derived from the backscattering coefficient at 532nm and 1064nm for periods before and after the change of the laser tilt angle from 0.3 degrees off nadir to 3 degrees off nadir. Then we examined relationships between the retrieved color ratio and the retrieved microphysics and found the relations agreed with the theoretically estimated ones.For the second approach, Multi-Field of view Multiple Scattering Polarization Lidar has been developed to resolve the angular dependence of backscattering and depolarization ratio and has been employed to evaluate the uncertainties in the retrievals. We performed global evaluation of ice microphysical properties and examined relationships between ice microphysics and ice super saturation information from AIRS on Aqua.\nFinally we introduced the JAXA-ESA satellite mission EarthCARE that will be launched in 2016. There are four sensors on the EarthCARE, i.e., Doppler cloud profiling radar (CPR), high spectral resolution lidar at 355nm (ATLID), multi-spectral imager (MSI) and broad band radiometer (BBR).

            "abstract": "Rivers are a fundamental resource to physical, ecologic and human systems, yet quantification of river flow in high-latitude environments remains limited due to the prevalence of complex morphologies, remote locations and sparse in situ monitoring equipment. Advances in hydrodynamic modeling and remote sensing technology allow us to address questions such as: How well can two-dimensional models simulate a flood wave in a highly 3-dimensional braided river environment, and how does the structure of such a flood wave differ from flow down a similar-sized single-channel river? Here, we use the raster-based hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD-FP to simulate flood waves, discharge, water surface height, and velocity measurements over a ~70 km reach of the Tanana River in Alaska. In order to use LISFLOOD-FP a digital elevation model (DEM) fused with detailed bathymetric data is required. During summer 2013, we surveyed 220,000 bathymetric points along the study reach using an echo sounder system connected to a high-precision GPS unit. The measurements are interpolated to a smooth bathymetric surface, using Topo to Raster interpolation, and combined with an existing five meter DEM (Alaska IfSAR) to create a seamless river terrain model. Flood waves are simulated using varying complexities in model solvers, then compared to gauge records and water logger data to assess major sources of model uncertainty. Velocity and flow direction maps are also assessed and quantified for detailed analysis of braided channel flow. The most accurate model output occurs with using the full two-dimensional model structure, and major inaccuracies appear to be related to DEM quality and roughness values. Future work will intercompare model outputs with extensive ground measurements and new data from AirSWOT, an airborne analog for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which aims to provide high-resolution measurements of terrestrial and ocean water surface elevations globally.",

            "abstract": "The depositional age and provenance of the Liuqu Conglomerate (LC), distributed along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone (IYSZ) in South Tibet, remain controversial, leading to different interpretations, such as a Paleogene basin deposited during India-Asia collision (Wang et al., 2010) or the result of the collision between India and an intra-oceanic arc (Aitchison et al., 2007). Here, we report low-temperature thermochronometry data (apatite fission track, apatite and zircon U-Th/He) for the LC in the Xigaze area, to constrain its depositional age, provenance and burial-exhumation history. Five samples from Liuqu yielded consistent AFT ages of ~6-8Ma, and dispersed single-grain AFT ages of six samples range from ~ 140 to 5 Ma, and single grain AFT ages for grains with >0.4 Cl (wt%) content was calculated three age-peaks of ~16.4 ±3.0, 37.3 ± 6.4 and 89.5 ± 22.2 Ma. Four groups of detrital ZHe ages, including 18 scattered single grain ages in the range of ~20 - 107.9 Ma, yielded four age peaks of ~20, 37, 66 and 104 Ma. We interpret the AHe ages of the LC as having been completely thermally reset, while AFT ages have been partially annealed and ZHe ages have not been thermally reset, suggesting that the post-depositional maximum temperature of the LC was > 80 °C and < 110°C. Collectively, our results indicate that the Liuqu Conglomerate was probably deposited in the Early Miocene time, similar to the Qiuwu-Dazhuka conglomerates which are located in the northern part of the IYSZ, as one component of the Gangrinboche Group, and was derived from the Xigaze forearc basin, Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone, as well as the Tethyan Himalaya. Furthermore, the Liuqu Conglomerate was exhumed to the surface by post-depositional incision of a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo river by the Late Miocene time.\nAitchison, J. C.; Ali, J.

            "abstract": "This study describes the impacts of projected climate change on reservoir inflows across the United States. For this purpose, we focused on several large U.S. reservoirs where inflow to reservoir is non-regulated (i.e. unaffected by human influence or upstream regulation) and also have long-term streamflow observations. We first simulated the 1980-2012 historic hydrologic conditions using the marco-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model at 1/24th degree grid cell resolution. The VIC-routing model was then used to simulate and compare with observed streamflow at the selected reservoir inflow locations. To project the climate change effects on reservoir inflows, the VIC model was then driven by 12-member dynamically downscaled and bias corrected meteorological forcings ensemble, which was generated by using 12 selected Global Climate Models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 as an initial and boundary conditions in a regional climate model, RegCM4. Each set of dynamical downscaling experiment was carried out at 18 km horizontal grid spacing over the continental U.S. and parts of Canada and Mexico, and consisted of 41 years in the historic period (1965-2005) and 41 years in the near-term future period (2010-2050) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. To better understand the impact of projected future changes in temperature and precipitation on shifts in streamflow discharge and distribution, and its implications on reservoir storage, temporal trends in reservoir inflows were also explored. Furthermore, hydrologic sensitivities experiments were conducted to identify the factors affecting the streamflow response to changes in precipitation and temperature. This study provides estimates for changes in the reservoir inflows over the next several decades in response to potential climate variations that can be used for optimized water supply management in the downstream areas.",

            "abstract": "With little exception, New Mexico thunderstorms contain a main negative charge region and a lower (weaker) positive region, whereby the dominate polarity of cloud-to-ground lightning is negative. This Normal Polarity (NP) charge structure is observable via the New Mexico Tech Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), which has been operated by Langmuir Laboratory since the late 1990s. In contrast, an LMA deployed for the 2012 Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) project revealed that thunderstorm charge structures were predominantly anomalous—i.e. not NP—in north-central Colorado. These anomalous charge structures are characterized by positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) lightning, and lower-than-normal CG rates. The difference in charge structure between the two geographic locations could possibly be correlated with the scale of forcing: New Mexico storms are predominantly formed by mesoscale (small-scale) forcing, whereas Colorado can have larger synoptically-forced thunderstorms. To gain further insight into the relationship between the scale of forcing and the resulting charge structures, LMA data from the 2014 Upward Lightning Triggering Study (UPLIGHTS) will be used to determine electrical characteristics of thunderstorms in western South Dakota. The charge structures of similar storm morphologies from each geographic location—central New Mexico, north-central Colorado, and western South Dakota—will be compared.",

            "abstract": "Heavy rainfall event magnitude and distribution are expected to change with the changing climate in Kansas. Investigating trends of intense rainfall events provides important information for improved water management decisions. The daily rainfall data from 1890 to 2012 were analyzed for 23 stations in Kansas for annual daily maximum, upper 1%, 5%, and 10% of daily rainfall. Increasing trends were found at the majority of stations for all parameters since 1890. The daily annual maximum ranged from 129 mm (Saint Francis) in the northwest to 356 mm (Fort Scott) in the southeast with the slowest increase of 0.05 mm/10yr (Elkhart) in the southwest and the greatest increase of 4.2 mm/10yr (Independence) in the southeast. In general, eastern Kansas exhibited a higher increasing trend for the daily annual maximum rain. The monthly annual maximum ranged from 291 mm (Lakin) in the west to 626 mm (Horton) in the northeast, both in June. In addition to the entire period (1890–2012), four consecutive periods, 1891–1920, 1921–1950, 1951–1980, and 1981–2010, were selected to analyze the variability of extremes over time. The trend and variability of heavy rainfall events over the subperiods did not match the entire period, further supporting the high variability in the region. The analysis showed that the daily heavy rainfall event patterns are changing, especially in the recent years (1980–2010). The results are useful for updating hydrologic structural designs and water management techniques which impact agricultural production, society, and economy.",

            "abstract": "The cycle of nitrogen in soil is complex, consisting of many simultaneous occurring transformation processes. So far, microorganisms have been thought to govern N cycling in soil. Nevertheless, plant roots and their associated mycorrhizal symbionts may exert control on N turnover for example by input of labile C to soil. However, studies investigating the effect of roots on gross N turnover rates are scarce. We conducted a 15N tracer study under field conditions to reveal the effect of plants on soil N cycle. The experiment includes three treatments: (a) control, (b) excluding roots and (c) excluding roots + mycorrhiza. On the study site, exclusion of roots + mycorrhiza has previously been shown to increase N2O emissions which indicate that plants affect internal N cycling. 15NH4NO3 and NH415NO3 were given to the soil and traced for a period of 10 days. Gross N turnover rates were determined applying a numerical 15N tracing model. Results on N turnover rates showed that roots and their fungal symbionts increased N cycling probably by input of labile C to soil which may results in an activation of the microbial biomass. While gross N mineralization increased by 270 and 313 % compared to the treatment excluding roots + mycorrhiza, NH4+ immobilization increased by 402 and 489 %. Differences in ammonium and nitrate immobilization further indicated that ammonium was the preferred N source for roots and microorganisms. While ammonium availability decreased with trenching (0.59 compared to -0.47 and -0.96 µg N g-1 d-1), the opposite was true for nitrate (0.50 compared to 2.08 and 2.18 µg N g-1 d-1), explaining the increased N2O emissions which were likely caused by denitrification. Further, plants increased dissimilarity nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and affected autotrophic nitrification probably by the release of nitrification inhibitors and by influencing ammonium availability. We conclude that plants and their mycorrhizal symbionts actively control N cycling in soil. By mechanism such as increased microbial N assimilation, increased DNRA or inhibition of nitrification plants may increase N availability and prevent losses of nitrate",

A strategy that combines qualitative, quantitative and applied evaluation of the DSWE has been devised to refine a prototype product and to document DSWE ECV characteristics for potential users. The first phase of production and characterization will be limited to the United States and its territories. Given this scope, sixty eight Landsat path/row locations across the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico were selected for qualitative assessment of the DSWE. These qualitative assessments are quickly completed through comparison of the DSWE with existing geospatial databases. Rigorous assessment of DSWE uncertainty is being achieved through various statistical comparisons of surface water extent measured over subareas of Landsat scenes with surface water extent derived in a systematic fashion from various airborne and satellite remote sensing systems. Additional research is aimed at developing most cost-efficient means of generating those evaluation data from the aforementioned remote sensed data as well as in-situ sensors and citizen science contributions. At the same time, the utility of prototype DSWE data for various science and resource applications is being examined by targeted users in other government agencies and Universities.",

            "abstract": "Land degradation usually involves largely irreversible vegetation changes in drylands. A typical case of vegetation change is the shrub-encroachment process that has been taking place over the last 150 years in the Chihuahuan Desert, where large areas of grasslands dominated by perennial grass species (black and blue grama) have transitioned to shrublands dominated by woody species (mainly creosotebush and mesquite), accompanied by accelerated water and wind erosion. An array of mechanisms are involved in this process, including external triggering factors such as precipitation variations and land-use change, and endogenous amplifying mechanisms brought about by soil erosion-vegetation feedbacks. We analyze the structure and dynamics of vegetation at an 18-km2 grassland-shrubland ecotone in the northern edge of the Chihuahuan desert (McKenzie Flats, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico) by investigating the relationship between decade-scale (2000-13) records of medium-resolution remote sensing of vegetation phenology (MODIS NDVI) and precipitation. Our analysis indicates that spatial variations in the NDVI-rainfall relationship reflect functional differences in leaf phenology and water use for herbaceous and shrub vegetation. Herbaceous vegetation shows quick growth pulses associated with short-term (previous 2 months) precipitation, while shrubs show a slow response to medium-term (previous 5 months) precipitation. We use these relationships to (a) determine the broad-scale spatial distribution of dominant vegetation types, and to (b) decompose the NDVI signal into partial net primary production (NPP) components for herbaceous vegetation and shrubs across the study site. We further analyze the influence of inter-annual variations in seasonal precipitation on remotely sensed NPP. Plant growth for herbaceous vegetation is particularly synchronized with monsoonal summer rainfall. For shrubs, annual NPP is better explained by winter plus summer precipitation, overlapping the monsoonal period of rain concentration. Our results suggest that changes in precipitation pattern comprising reductions in monsoonal summer rainfall and/or increases in winter precipitation may enhance the shrub-encroachment process in desert grasslands of the American Southwest.",

            "abstract": "Probing the effects of a dynamic stress perturbation and the timing of earthquake nucleation is necessary for understanding the remote interaction of large magnitude events and the possibility of a remote hazard increase. Catalog data containing 35 years of M≥5.5 earthquakes allows us to explore the records for periods of enhanced or suppressed seismic activity. We consider 113 M≥7.5 mainshocks between 1977-2012 as sources of a transient stress on receiver faults at remote distances. Our study focuses on seismic activity on time scales from days to months. One objective is to search for evidence of delayed dynamic triggering of large magnitude events; i.e. an increase in M≥5.5 remote earthquakes following a M≥7.5 mainshock, similar to the global increase following the 2012 M8.6 Indian Ocean earthquake [Pollitz et al., 2012]. We restrict the data to regions of elevated strain during the passage of surface waves by calculating the strain field for the M≥7.5 mainshocks. The strain field is determined using empirical scaling laws and through synthetic seismograms. Using a threshold of 0.1 µstrain and temporal window of ±1-year we stack daily rate curves for M≥5.5 pre- and postshocks in order to resolve rate deviations from the background rate. Our results do not indicate an observable change in activity when considering the collective set of 113 mainshocks used in the study. Additionally, our method enables us to look for periods of reduced seismic activity in order to test the hypothesis of dynamic shadowing; i.e. a seismic quiescent period following a transient stress. The results suggest a subtle decrease in daily rates of M≥5.5 earthquakes following the mainshocks, but activity changes are not below the confidence intervals for the background rate and cannot significantly support the hypothesis. We conclude that a global increase in M≥5.5 earthquakes following a transient stress is a rare occurrence.

            "abstract": "The magnetosphere exhibits a variety of geomagnetic activities in response to different solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) input. Global-scale geomagnetic activities, such as those due to substorms and storms, are reflected in the Kp, AE and Dst indices, which are constructed from ground-based magnetometer observations. Understanding how and the conditions under which a geomagnetic storm or substorm occurs are outstanding questions in heliophysics and space weather predication. While it is generally accepted that Earth-directed coronal mass ejections from the sun can cause geomagnetic storms and substorms in the magnetosphere, the specific necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of both the solar wind drivers and pre-existing magnetospheric conditions, for triggering different types of geomagnetic activities are yet to be delineated. For example, while it is generally thought that geomagnetic storms can be triggered by extended intervals of southward IMF Bz, it is still not clear how and at what point during the southward-IMF Bz interval a storm will arise, and how the storm-triggering process may be affected by the pre-existing state of the magnetosphere. To address these specific questions, we have applied the magnetospheric state prescription technique developed by Fung and Shao [2008]. We have used solar wind and geomagnetic indices data taken in 1970-2009 to constructed a magnetospheric state lookup table and applied the table to perform out-of-sample predictions or prescriptions of the Kp, AE and Dst indices during different geomagnetic storm intervals (with minimum Dst ≤ -100 nT) that occurred after 2009. Our presentation will discuss the validity of the magnetospheric state prescription technique and the role of different magnetopsheric state parameters in prescribing geomagnetic storm development.\nFung, S.

            "abstract": "The Brazilian energy sector is under continued expansion. The majority of energy power generation in the country is done through hydropower, which represents around 88% of the energy originated from renewable sources in the country. Still, only 10% of the high potential for production of the Amazon basin is currently availed, and this raises attention for the implantation of new hydropower plants in the region.\nWhen a hydropower plant is considered to be built, the natural characteristics of the region are taken into account, considering that the rainfall regime follows certain stationarity. However, under the possibility of global change, the expected capacity of the plants may be compromised.\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate if the current hydropower plants of some Amazon River tributaries can maintain their functionality under global environmental change conditions. For that, based on the discharge data and hydropower information available by Brazilian National Agency of Water and Energy we will infer the energy potential of these hydropower dams for the historic period that will be compared with the energy potential for future discharge under global environmental change conditions. The future discharge will be generated by the Distributed Hydrological Model developed at the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (MHD-INPE), driven by different climate change scenarios projected by regional and global atmospheric models, associated with land use scenarios projected by a dynamic land use model (LUCC-ME/INPE). MHD-INPE will be calibrated through observed discharges for 1970-1990 using current land use conditions, and will generate discharges for the period of 2000 to 2050. In addition, special attention will be given to the presence of secondary forest growth in the land use scenarios in order to identify the importance of considering this use in the modelling exercise, since that use is not usually considered in hydrological modelling studies.",

            "abstract": "We describe a decision analysis in the presence of uncertainty that combines a non-probabilistic approach (information-gap decision theory) with a probabilistic approach (Bayes’ theorem). Bayes’ theorem is one of the most popular techniques for probabilistic uncertainty quantification (UQ). It is effective in many situations, because it updates our understanding of the uncertainties by conditioning on real data using a mathematically rigorous technique. However, the application of Bayes’ theorem in science and engineering is not always rigorous. There are two reasons for this: (1) We can enumerate the possible outcomes of dice-rolling, but not the possible outcomes of real-world contamination remediation; (2) We can precisely determine conditional probabilities for coin-tossing, but substantial uncertainty surrounds the conditional probabilities for real-world contamination remediation. Of course, Bayes’ theorem is rigorously applicable beyond dice-rolling and coin-tossing, but even in cases that are constructed to be simple with ostensibly good probabilistic models, applying Bayes’ theorem to the real world may not work as well as one might expect. Bayes’ theorem is rigorously applicable only if all possible events can be described, and their conditional probabilities can be derived rigorously. Outside of this domain, it may still be useful, but its use lacks at least some rigor. The information-gap approach allows us to circumvent some of the highlighted shortcomings of Bayes’ theorem. In particular, it provides a way to account for possibilities beyond those described by our models, and a way to deal with uncertainty in the conditional distribution that forms the core of Bayesian analysis. We have developed a three-tiered technique enables one to make scientifically defensible decisions in the face of severe uncertainty such as is found in many geologic problems. To demonstrate the applicability, we apply the technique to a CO2 leakage problem. The goal is to identify a safe injection rate that will not cause unacceptable environmental problems. The analyses take into account existing uncertainties in the form variables with known and unknown probabilistic distributions. ",

The study area is located at about 74o30’N and 58 o40’W where high-resolution seafloor imagery were collected from ~200-500 m water depth. These data were analyzed and compared to existing high-resolution satellite imagery of exposed glacial landforms from the nearby coastal areas. Offshore geophysical mapping equipment consisted of a Kongsberg EM2040 multibeam that was bow-mounted on the sailing vessel Explorer of Sweden together with a Seatex MRU5+ motion sensor and GPS antennas. In addition, a GAVIA autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from University of Iceland with installed Geoswath interfometric sonar and Marine Sonic side-scan was used. The data from these systems permitted the production of both 5-m (for the EM2040) and 2-m (for the Geoswath) resolution bathymetric grids for landform analyzes. Sediment characterization analysis was also undertaken using the co-registered backscatter data. The exposed onshore landforms were studied using data from the high-res QuickBird satellite images with a 2-m pixel resolution. Geomorphic analysis of the data shows that past tectonic and glacial scouring processes have shaped the present-day landscape in both the offshore and onshore study areas. The terrain consists of glacially eroded bedrock covered with very thin surficial sediments resembling a ‘cnoc-and-lochan’ terrain, although the degree of erosion varies spatially, probably as a result of local variations in the rock properties. Different glacially influenced features are identified and described in the study. These features have been used to understand and infer past ice-sheet processes, particularly ice-flow direction and the extent of ice-cover on the continental shelves from previous extreme glaciation events. The backscatter information from the high-resolution interferometric sonar show fine-scale sedimentation patterns which are used to infer bottom water circulation. The study highlights that the use of the high-resolution seafloor mapping systems significantly enhance the quality of geomorphologic landform assessment.",

            "abstract": "Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) are ubiquitous in the atmosphere, and represent an important fraction of volatile organic compounds. Additionally some OVOC species may pose health risks. OVOCs can affect the oxidative and radiative budget of the atmosphere since they are precursors to ground level ozone, hydroxyl radicals and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). OVOCs such as methanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, crotonaldehyde, methylvinylketone (MVK), methylethylketone (MEK) and acrolein can be emitted from anthropogenic and biogenic sources. Additionally, they are the secondary products of the photo-oxidation of hydrocarbons (biogenic and anthropogenic). Understanding the magnitude of these sources is a prerequisite for accurate representations of radical cycling, ozone production and SOA formation in air quality models. The sources of OVOCs in the Alberta Oil Sands (OS) region have not previously been well characterized. In the summer of 2013, airborne measurements of various OVOCs were made in the Athabasca oil sands region between August 13 and September 7, 2013. Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) was used to measure methanol, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, crotonaldehyde, MVK, MEK, acrolein as well as other hydrocarbons. Emission ratios (ER) for several OVOCs (relative to carbon monoxide; CO) were used to estimate direct anthropogenic emissions from OS industrial sources, while the calculated OH radical exposures were used to estimate the production and removal of secondary anthropogenic OVOCs. The results indicate that OVOCs such as acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde and MVK have both primary and secondary anthropogenic and biogenic sources. However, species such as methanol and acrolein are from biogenic and anthropogenic sources, respectively. The results of this work will help to characterize sources of OVOCs and the factors influencing their atmospheric fate in the Oil Sands region.  ",

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the nature of climate information needed within the air-transport sector. Air transport is not a single economic sector with uniform needs for climate data: airport, airline, and air-navigation services are the principal sub-sectors, each with their own particular climate-related decision contexts. For example, airports function as fixed infrastructure that is primarily affected by probabilities of extreme events that could hamper runway/taxiway operations, interfere with worker availability, or impede travel to and from the airport by passengers. Airlines, in contrast, are more concerned with changes in atmospheric conditions (upper-air turbulence, convective weather events, etc.) that might require consideration in long-term decisions related to flight-planning processes and aircraft equipage. Air-navigation service providers have needs that are primarily concerned with assurance of safe spatial separation of aircraft via sensor data and communications links. In addition to present-day commercial air transport, we discuss what climate data may be needed for new types of air transport that may emerge in the next couple of decades. These include, for example, small aircraft provided on-demand to non-pilot travelers, high-altitude supersonic business and commercial jets, and very large numbers of un-manned aircraft. Finally, we give examples relating to key technical challenges in providing decision-relevant climate data to the air-transport sector. These include: (1) identifying what types of climate data are most relevant the different decisions facing the several segments of this industry; (2) determining decision-appropriate time horizons for forecasts of this data; and (3) coupling the uncertainties inherent in these forecasts to the decision process.",

A systematic search of the Mars Express (MEX) ion data using an orbit filtering criteria is described, using magnetometer data from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) to determine the solar wind motional electric field (Esw) direction. Two levels of statistical survey are presented, one focused on times when the MEX orbit was directly in line with the Esw and another for all angles between the MEX location and the Esw. For the first study, within the three-year overlap of MGS and MEX, 9 orbit intervals were found with clear and unambiguous high-energy O+ observations, all with flows roughly Esw directed. The second survey used a point-by-point determination of MEX relative to +Esw and contained many thousands of 192-s measurements. This study yielded only a weak indication for an Esw-aligned plume. Furthermore, the y-z components of the weighted average velocities in the bins of this y-z spatial domain survey do not systematically point in the Esw direction. The first survey implies the existence of this plume and shows that its characteristics are seemingly consistent with the expected energy and flight direction from numerical studies, while the second study softens the finding and demonstrates that there are many planetary ions beyond the IMB moving in unexpected directions. Several possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed.",

This study was focused on (a) isolation and characterization of pure strain and mixed microbial communities able to degrade HMW PAHs and (b) further evaluation of the ability of the isolated microbes to degrade HMW PAHs mixtures in the absence and presence of indigenous flora.\nFluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and pyrene were selected as the representative HMW PAHs in this study. A pure bacterial strain, identified as Herbaspirillum chlorophenolicum FA1, was isolated from activated sludge. A mixed bacterial community designated as consortium-4 was isolated from petroleum contaminated soils, containing Pseudomonas sp. FbP1、Enterobacter sp. FbP2、Hydrogenophaga sp. FbP3 and Luteolibacter pohnpeiensis. FbP4. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that bacterial strains of Herbaspirillum chlorophenolicum FA1 and Luteolibacter pohnpeiensis. FbP4 can also degrade fluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and pyrene. Experiment results showed that both strain FA1 and consortium-4 could degrade fluoranthene, benzo[b]fluoranthene and pyrene within a wide range of temperature, pH and initial PAHs concentration. Degradation of HMW PAHs mixtures (binary and ternary) demonstrated the interactive effects that can alter the rate and extent of biodegradation within a mixture. The presence of indigenous flora was found to either increase or decrease the degradation of HMW PAHs, suggesting possible synergistic or competition effects. Biodegradation kinetics of HMW PAHs for sole substrates, binary and ternary systems was evaluated, with the purpose to better characterize and compare the biodegradation process of individual HMW PAH and mixtures of HMW PAHs. Results of this study could advance our understanding of HMW PAHs biodegradation and help to develop successful bioremediation strategies.\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41102148), and the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20110091120063).",

NHWAVE, a fully dispersive wave model with a vertical sigma-coordinate, is extended to model moving objects by including vertical boundary fitted meshing and horizontal immersed boundary method.

For NHWAVE, model estimates of surface wave patterns generated by oscillating surface objects are compared to LIDAR measurements from corresponding laboratory experiments. For LIGGGHTS, the stress-strain response is measured for collections of bonded particles under tension and/or compression, then compared to available lab and field data. Results will also be presented from simplified MIZ simulations with the coupled system, in which waves pass through groups of rigid ice blocks and their refraction, diffraction, and reflection are measured. Finally, we will provide a preview of an upcoming series of targeted virtual experiments in which momentum/energy exchange between waves and ice floes is measured under varied conditions.\n ",

            "abstract": "We compare estimates of the spatial distribution of water quantity provided (annual water yield) from two ecohydrologic models: the widely-used Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the much simpler water models from the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) toolbox. These two models differ significantly in terms of complexity, timescale of operation, effort, and data required for calibration, and so are often used in different management contexts. We compare two study sites in the US: the Wildcat Creek Watershed (2083 km2) in Indiana, a largely agricultural watershed in a cold aseasonal climate, and the Upper Upatoi Creek Watershed (876 km2) in Georgia, a mostly forested watershed in a temperate aseasonal climate. We evaluate (1) quantitative estimates of water yield to explore how well each model represents this process, and (2) ranked estimates of water yield to indicate how useful the models are for management purposes where other social and financial factors may play significant roles.\nThe SWAT and InVEST models provide very similar estimates of the water yield of individual subbasins in the Wildcat Creek Watershed (Pearson r = 0.92, slope = 0.89), and a similar ranking of the relative water yield of those subbasins (Spearman r = 0.86). However, the two models provide relatively different estimates of the water yield of individual subbasins in the Upper Upatoi Watershed (Pearson r = 0.25, slope = 0.14), and very different ranking of the relative water yield of those subbasins (Spearman r = -0.10). The Upper Upatoi watershed has a significant baseflow contribution due to its sandy, well-drained soils. InVEST’s simple seasonality terms, which assume no change in storage over the time of the model run, may not accurately estimate water yield processes when baseflow provides such a strong contribution. Our results suggest that InVEST users take care in situations where storage changes are significant.",

Yet such data are often used independently and in isolated fashion, thus missing their potential complementary features. We describe a novel joint land-atmosphere data assimilation system that will simultaneously handle multiple modeling components and multiple streams of data. This challenging task is achieved using the Local-Ensemble-Transform-Kalman Filter (LETKF) that has been shown to be a powerful tool in a variety of atmosphere, ocean and carbon data assimilation settings. It includes a number of advanced features, including quantification of transport error using ensemble meteorological analysis, variable localization, and up-scaling flux tower via a footprint observation operator. The system offers an opportunity to combine the 'top-down' atmosphere approach that gives best large-scale constraint with the 'bottom-up' ground-based approach that depicts smaller scale processes and their changes. We will present some initial results using the atmospheric models SPEEDY, GEOSChem, and the terrestrial ecosystem model VEGAS.",

            "abstract": "Several studies show that near surface winds acquire anticyclonic (cyclonic) vorticity and accelerate (decelerate) when flow in the same direction as positive (negative) orientation of the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradient. Many of them were made over different oceanic thermal fronts in the world analyzing contrasts in SST gradients. However, still remains much uncertainty about how strong is this wind modulation, particularly on areas in need of studies and in-situ data, such as the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Region (BMC) where intense SST gradients are found. This study brings results of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations, configured with nested grids, where it is compared the influence of distinct synoptic patterns observed at BMC where three different SST patterns are imposed to WRF. These patterns are: (1) with a typical smoothed SST field, named as Control; (2) Small Eddy, which is the same as Control but adding an eddy of 1° radius and a +2°C amplitude; and (3) Intense Eddy, which is also the same as Control, but where an eddy of 1° radius and +4°C amplitude is added. The artificial imposed eddy is analogous to the SST patterns observed at BMC, with different intensities. The simulations were integrated for 76 hours using initial and lateral boundary conditions from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model with 0.5° resolution. The results showed that the wind at 10m height is influenced by the diurnal cycle of turbulence in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) modified by variations in SST. The wind magnitude changes up to 1m.s-1 over a 4/50°C.km-1 SST gradient and 0.6m.s-1 over a 2/50°C.km-1 SST gradient. This effect generates meso-scale disturbances that propagate to larger scales leading to disturbances in remote areas. Thus, the preliminary analyses are suggesting that there is an interaction between the meso and synoptic scale playing a role. Mechanisms such this one might not be captured by atmospheric global models used in low spatial resolution. Often, that is the case seen on operational models.",

            "abstract": "Thick sections of halite (tens of meters) from the ICDP Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project core were precipitated during extremely dry periods, when the lake level was low and fresh water availability was scarce. The detailed description of the sedimentological record during periods of halite precipitation shows alternations between halite and mud with gypsum layers that are tens of cm to a few meters thick. The halite alternates between small cumulated crystals that are formed on the water surface and large bottom-growth crystals with low densities of fluid inclusion bands that are formed on the lake floor. The large crystals are associated with mud layers and show more mud between the crystals, while the small cumulate crystals have much less detritus and contain ‘halite rafts’, which are formed under high evaporation conditions.\nThe thick sections of halite cannot form only due to evaporation of the Dead Sea basin brines, and requires a continuous source of salt from fresh water input and brines discharging from the subsurface in order to facilitate the observed amount of salt over time. The salt is added and accumulated in the brines during glacials and wetter periods, when the lake level is high, and probably stratified, and then precipitates during drier periods, when the fresh water discharge into the lake decreases. Based on the chemical compositions of past Dead Sea lakes, from fluid inclusions in the halite (Na/Cl~0.3-0.6), we estimate that ~3-6 cm of halite precipitates per 1 m of lake level drop. The amount of salt in the core indicates periods of significant lake level drop (up to 100 m), represented by intervals of ~3 m of halite. The mud intervals between the halite segments indicate increases in the fresh water discharge, and possibly the formation of a stratified lake (from freshwater addition), which does not facilitate halite precipitation.\nThe discharge into the lake can be constrained according to the steady-state discharge with a certain lake level, which suggests a maximal water discharge of between 240 and 900 million m3/y. Assuming a linear relationship with precipitation, this suggests a 25-50% average precipitation relative to the present. Large variations in Br concentration in halite, Na/Cl ratios and Mg concentration in fluid inclusions, may suggest even lower lake levels, and drier conditions.",

            "abstract": "To determine the electric-resistivity structure in coastal areas, airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys have been used many places. These results showed AEM can reveal seawater depth, sediment thickness, and depth to bedrock. However, until now, AEM could only reveal the resistivity structure to a depth of ∼200 m in coastal areas. Conventional AEM, using an airborne inductive source limits the depth of exploration because the presence of a conductor, such as saline surface water, decreases the penetration of the AEM signal. In order to enhance the depth of exploration, we used a grounded electrical source aligned parallel to the coast line and towed a magnetic receiver in the air. The method, called grounded-electrical-source airborne transient electromagnetics, or GREATEM (Mogi et al., 1998), should enhance survey depth in coastal areas, since this method galvanically injects electric current into the ground. The method has increased the depth of exploration to 800 m in on-shore areas (Mogi et al., 2009, Ito et al. 2014).\nWe have carried out a GREATEM survey at Kujukuri beach in central Japan, where an alluvial plain is dominated by sedimentary rocks and shallow water. Another GREATEM survey was performed at northwestern Awaji Island, where granitic rocks crop out onshore.\nIn these studies, we faced issues how do we evaluate an effect of sea water on the data. To circumvent this problem, we used a three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic (EM) modeling scheme based on the staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) method (Fomenko and Mogi, 2002) to study the effects of oceanic saltwater on GREATEM survey data at coastal areas.\nThe models consisted of two adjacent layers where sea is a conductive thin sheet placed on top of a unifirm half space ( 100 Ohm-m). Then, we performed numerical forward modeling using the SFD method to generate a 3-D resistivity structure models from GREATEM field survey data at both of Kujukuri beach and the Nojima fault. As a result, we have evaluated the effects of complicated structure, such as sea on GREATEM survey data and have obtained information regarding seawater invasion in sedimentary rocks and a resistivity structure along an active fault. This study indicates that the GREATEM system can be used for the assessment of natural disaster areas.",

            "abstract": "The rate of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet continues to increase in response to increased surface melt and the retreat, acceleration and thinning of marine-terminating outlet glaciers. Marginal thinning is concentrated on the southeastern and western coasts; areas drained by numerous large, fast-flowing marine-terminating glaciers. Considerable temporal variability exists in the timing of regional mass loss, with an emerging picture of a clockwise progression of mass loss spreading from the southeast to the west of the ice sheet. The partitioning of regional mass loss into surface mass balance and glacier dynamic driven components is a question of considerable scientific interest.\nWe present a mass budget for the Northwest Greenland ice sheet, along with long term, high temporal resolution records of glacier flow velocity and calving front position. We feature track optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ (slc-on), Landsat-8 OLI, ERS-1 SAR, ERS-2 SAR and Envisat ASAR data covering the period 1985-2014. It has been suggested that some Northwest Greenland glaciers have undergone two periods of dynamic mass loss over this time period. Our records span 1985-2014 for these glaciers and 2000-2014 for other large outlets. Velocity records were converted into ice discharge estimates using bedrock and surface Digital Elevation Models and assumptions about depth integrated velocity and ice density. Surface Mass Balance (SMB) model output was used to complete the mass budget.\nThe 30 year observational record shows that the 21st century period of glacier dynamic change in Northwest Greenland is exceptional and ongoing. Our results do not support the assertion of an earlier period of dynamic mass loss in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, many of the observed dynamic changes initiated substantially prior to the gravimetric observation of increased regional mass loss from summer 2005 onwards. Modelled SMB exhibits a strong negative anomaly between 2006 and 2009, caused by increased run-off. The satellite gravimetric observation of increased regional mass loss likely captures a decrease in surface mass balance superimposed on ongoing dynamic mass loss.",

The studied line has the length of 56m, the electrode interval is of 2m. In addition, there are two boreholes along the line (one with 3 electrodes and the other one with 2) in order to improve data quality and precision. The boreholes also have a multi-level sampling system that indicates the fluid (gas or water) presence in relation to depth. With our results it was possible to map the gas plume position and its area of extension in the sections as it is a positive resistivity anomaly, with the gas level having approximately 5m depth. With the time-lapse analysis (Matlab script) between the obtained 2D resistivity sections from the site, it was possible to map how the biogas volume and position change in the landfill in relation to time. Our preliminary results show a preferential gas pathway through the subsurface studied area. A consistent relation between the gas depth and obtained microbiological data from archea and bacteria population was also observed.",

            "abstract": "Hydrologic change is occurring in many basins throughout the Midwestern U.S. not only in the mean annual streamflow but across a spectrum of magnitudes and frequencies. Disentangling the causative mechanisms responsible for these changes such as anthropogenic factors, e.g., artificial drainage to increase agricultural productivity, and climatic shifts in precipitation patterns is important for planning effective mitigation strategies. We have begun unraveling these changes in a human impacted agricultural landscape in the Midwestern U.S., specifically two subbasins of the Minnesota River Basin in Minnesota: the Redwood and Whetstone River Basins, where there has been a shift in agriculture from small grains to soybeans. This shift occurred at different times for each basin (1976 and 1991, respectively) and when soy covered about 20% of the basin area an apparent shift in the hydrologic regime also occurred as evidence by visual inspection of the hydrographs. Precisely quantifying the nature of this hydrologic regime shift however is a challenge and this work adds in this direction. Using Copulas and the joint probability distribution of daily precipitation and streamflow, we quantified a significantly higher dependence between precipitation and streamflow increments in the mid-quantiles (0.1-0.6; attributed to the artificial drainage to the stream rather than the slower infiltration and subsurface runoff) and no significant change for high quantiles (because for extreme storms the artificially fast drainage does not differ much hydrologically from the naturally fast overland flow). We further performed a multi-scale analysis of streamflow increments via wavelets to quantify the changes in the magnitude and frequency of the rising and falling limbs of hydrographs, confirming the above findings. Since precipitation changes were confirmed not to be significant, it is suggested that streamflow changes are largely driven by a change in land use and not climate in these basins. The implications of these changes for sediment production and transport and the ecologic integrity of these rivers are important and relevant to management decisions.",

            "abstract": "Bird (2003) and others suggested the existence of Amur plate in northeastern Asia with its incipient plate boundary along western Honshu – Sakhalin – Stanovoy Mountains – Lake Baikal – Mongolia – Hebei Province, China – Yellow Sea – East China Sea – Nankai Trough. The seismicity along East China Sea and Yellow Sea sections of the suggested boundary is diffuse and does not delineate such boundary. However, recent earthquakes that have occurred along the Yellow Sea region during 2011-2014 show predominantly strike-slip faulting along near vertical nodal planes. These earthquakes may provide an opportunity to study details of the proposed boundaries of Amur plate. Waveform data from broadband seismographic stations in the region around Yellow Sea are analyzed in an attempt to shed light on the nature of the incipient plate boundary for the proposed Amur plate in Yellow Sea region. Regional waveform modeling and deviatoric moment tensor inversion suggest that a broad scale stress field in Yellow Sea region is ENE–WSW trending subhorizontal compressive stress, σ1, with N-S trending horizontal extensional stress, σ3. In such regional stress regime, earthquake mechanisms are predominantly vertical strike-slip faulting, but it allows some E-W normal faulting due to N–S extension. The most likely mode of deformation in Yellow Sea region appears to be right-lateral strike-slip faulting along N-S trending transform faults, and E–W trending normal faulting that accommodates a broad regional stress regime. This is a typical kinematics of rifting at rifted continental margins such as Gulf of California. We observed a broad regional seismic velocity variation along various wave propagation paths as well as indications of crustal thickness variation. Thinner crust beneath Yellow Sea region is indicated from waveform modeling which can support evolution of rifting process.",

            "abstract": "The global ocean comprises the Earth’s largest biome, with microorganisms playing a dominant biogeochemical role. However, the potential for production of new microbial biomass within the subseafloor is rarely considered in traditional oceanographic paradigms of carbon cycling or microbial food webs. In this study, we used RNA Stable Isotope Probing (RNA SIP) to determine the microbial community composition and genetic repertoire of active subseafloor autotrophs in warm venting fluids from Axial Seamount. RNA is a responsive biomarker because it is a reflection of cellular activity independent of replication, and RNA SIP thus provides access to both the function of a microbial community and the phylogeny of the organisms accountable for key functions. Diffuse fluids were incubated shipboard at 30°C, 55°C, and 80°C with 13DIC and H2. Metatranscriptomic sequencing of both the enriched and non-enriched RNA was carried out from 13C and 12C controls. In addition, filtered fluid samples were preserved in situ for comparative meta -transcriptomic and -genomic analyses. Diverse lineages of bacteria and archaea and accompanying metabolisms were detected in situ, but RNA SIP results show dominance of three different groups of autotrophs active under each experimental condition. At 30°C, members of the Sulfurimonas genus dominated, with genes for hydrogen oxidation, nitrate reduction, and carbon fixation via the rTCA cycle highly expressed. At 55°C, both Caminibacter and Nautilia transcripts were detected for rTCA cycle, hydrogen oxidation, and nitrate reduction. At 80°C, transcripts for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis mediated by members of Methanocaldococcus were detected. These results suggest the subseafloor hosts various anaerobic chemolithoautotrophs that span a wide temperature range, with hydrogen playing a key role in microbial metabolism. Complementary experiments are currently being carried out on the seafloor with a novel in situ incubator unit to provide further insights to primary productivity in the subseafloor.",

The cross-polar cap potential difference during southward IMF conditions appears to be on average slightly (~7%) larger in the SH compared with the NH, while the neutral wind magnitude and vorticity amplitude are mostly larger in the NH than in the SH, especially during high solar activity conditions. We attribute such behaviour to peculiarities of the hemispheres due to the non-dipolar portions of Earth's main magnetic field that constitute substantial differences between the geomagnetic field configurations of both hemispheres. They cause in particular different magnetic field flux densities in the opposite polar regions and different offsets of the invariant poles with respect to the rotation axis of the Earth. The pole is presently displaced almost twice the distance in the SH compared to the NH, which has substantial implications for the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system under the influence of external drivers. To analyse this behaviour, we have run several numerical simulations using the first-principle Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere (CMIT) model under various seasonal conditions. The survey of both the numerical simulation results and the observations confirm prominent asymmetries between the two hemispheres for these parameters.",

            "abstract": "Cassini has been orbiting Saturn for over ten years now. During this epoch, the ring shadow has moved from covering a large portion of the northern hemisphere to covering a large swath south of the equator and continues to move southward. At Saturn Orbit Insertion in 2004, the ring plane was inclined by ~24 degrees relative to the Sun-Saturn vector. The projection of the B-ring onto Saturn reached as far as 40N along the central meridian (~52N at the terminator). At its maximum extent, the ring shadow can reach as far as 48N/S (~58N/S at the terminator). The net effect is that the intensity of both ultraviolet and visible sunlight penetrating into any particular latitude will vary depending on both Saturn’s axis relative to the Sun and the optical thickness of each ring system. In essence, the rings act like venetian blinds.\nOur previous work [1] examined the variation of the solar flux as a function of solar inclination, i.e. ~7.25 year season at Saturn. Here, we report on the impact of the oscillating ring shadow on the photolysis and production rates of hydrocarbons in Saturn’s stratosphere and upper troposphere, including acetylene, ethane, propane, and benzene. Beginning with methane, we investigate the impact on production and loss rates of the long-lived photochemical products leading to haze formation are examined at several latitudes over a Saturn year. Similarly, we assess its impact on phosphine abundance, a disequilibrium species whose presence in the upper troposphere is a tracer of convective processes in the deep atmosphere.\nWe will also present our ongoing analysis of Cassini’s CIRS, UVIS, and VIMS datasets that provide an estimate of the evolving haze content of the northern hemisphere and we will begin to assess the implications for dynamical mixing. In particular, we will examine how the now famous hexagonal jet stream acts like a barrier to transport, isolating Saturn’s north polar region from outside transport of photochemically-generated molecules and haze.\n [1] Edgington, S.G., et al., 2012.

[2013, New approach for solving the inverse boundary value problem of Laplace’s equation on a circle: Technique renovation of the Grad-Shafranov (GS) reconstruction, J. Geophys. Res. Space., 118, 2876-2881], a couple of Hilbert transform relations were applied to the study of the ill-posedness for the essential GS reconstructions. In this further study, a detailed derivation for these reciprocal relations are presented in case of the plane circular region, and then the reciprocal relations are extended to apply to the plane rectangular region after a conformal mapping procedure. While for the case of plane rectangular region, it is confronted by a traditional problem of the so-called corner singularities, which divided the extended reciprocal relations into four integrals with end-point singularities. With the help of the extended Euler-Maclaurin expansion, new quadrature schemes are developed for these singular integrals. Benchmark testing with the analytic solutions on a rectangle boundary has also show the efficiency and robustness of these extensions. The new solution approach is also developed with the introduced reciprocal relations, and an iterated Tikhonov regularization scheme is applied to deal with the ill-posed linear operators appearing in the discretization of the new approach. The special case on the rectangular boundary is benchmarked with the analytic solutions. Numerical experiments highlight the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. A robust solution approach is expected to be developed based on these new results for the GS equation on any 2D region with partial-known boundary conditions.",

            "abstract": "The global budget of isotope ratios in the Earth's water cycle is poorly understood because of large uncertainties in the isotopic composition of continental evapotranspiration. Additional uncertainties exist in the global pattern of marine boundary layer vapor D/H isotope ratios and the magnitude of their influence on oceanic evaporation. Here, we use satellite retrievals of marine boundary layer vapor HDO and H2O from the Tropospheric Emissions Spectrometer (TES) corrected to match surface vapor collected during cruises in the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans to resolve the global D/H isotope ratio budget. After our correction, satellite retrievals are un-biased, and have an average error of 14 permil when compared with 1341 satellite retrievals that were co-located with surface observations. Using TES retrieval spanning the globe, we calculate the global oceanic evaporation flux isotopic composition as approximately -30 permil, and combined with estimates of precipitation isotope ratios, a global mass balance is applied to quantify terrestrial evapotranspiration and runoff composition. The flux-weighted average isotopic composition of precipitation is estimated at approximately -37 permil, with oceanic precipitation having a value of approximately -32 permil and terrestrial precipitation having a value of approximately -52 permil. Based on our mass balance, terrestrial evapotranspiration has a flux-weighted average composition of -69 permil and terrestrial runoff has an average composition of -16 permil, which corresponds to a terrestrial enrichment of 37 permil for runoff relative to terrestrial precipitation. Knowledge of the entire HDO budget provides constraints on terrestrial evaporation/transpiration partitioning as well as tropospheric entrainment of moisture into the boundary layer, both poorly understood components of the global hydrologic cycle. These calculations provide a critical test of an essential global closure theory upon which many previous studies have been based, and we find that there are significant shortcomings in the historical assumptions made. Our findings have implications for interpreting climate proxies including ice cores and biological deposits of oxygen isotopes as well as understudying contemporary water resource distributions.",

This study presents a multi-faceted analysis of several newly identified sea surface temperature dipole locations, located via the traditional empirical orthogonal function analysis, as well as cross correlation analysis, of sea surface data from just over the last century. We begin with the analysis of two dipole modes ranged over the high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (located in the South Pacific and South Indian Ocean). These dipole modes have inter-annual periodicity as well as seasonal modes, with clear impacts on local, continental precipitation. Specifically, this study shows synchronization of sea surface temperature dipoles, their interactions with sea level pressure and winds, and makes steps towards understanding the dynamics of their connections via deconvolution of their respective climate signals. In order to study these effects, we define an index representing the time evolution of each dipole mode to follow the teleconnections of the sea surface temperature dipole modes with respect to other variables. This also allows for comparison with known, major, climate indices, allowing us to establish the effects of these oscillations as well as demonstrate the uniqueness of our new dipoles from these overarching influences. This study provides a more in depth understanding of teleconnection ocean-atmosphere dynamics, their effects on their local climates and distant climates, as well as their persistence over the previous century.",

Cells were separated from sediment layers (37 and 84 meters below the seafloor) deposited at site 60, hole B, near Anholt Island tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Ten single amplified genomes from 4 bacterial and 1 archaeal lineages were chosen from the 60 successfully sorted cells.

Two lineages have not been genomically sampled before, while all 5 are frequently found in a variety of marine sediment habitats. The genome assemblies range in completeness from 45 – 85% and contain a number of phylogenetically relevant genes that has helped to anchor their position in the tree of life.

However the strainmeters can capture signals with superior precision at local spatial scales, in particular in the short-period, from minutes to a month. Many relatively small-scale events (e.i. SSEs, creeps) have been successfully determined on the subduction zones. Istanbul located near the most active parts of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) has been monitored by different observing techniques such as seismic networks and continuous/survey-mode GPS networks for decades. However, it is still essential to observe deformation in a broad range of temporal and spatial scales (from seismology to geodesy and to geology). Borehole strainmeters are very sensitive to deformation in the range of less than a month.\nIn this study, we present a new project, financially and technically supported by Istanbul Development Agency (ISTKA) and UNAVCO, respectively, which includes the installation of two borehole strainmeters are being deployed in European side of Istanbul in Marmara Region. Since these instruments can also respond to non-tectonic processes, it is necessary to have more instruments to increase spatial coherence and to have additional sensors to detect and model noise (such as barometric pressure, tides, or precipitation). The introduced monitoring system will provide significant insight about the creeping phenomenon and the possible SSE to our understanding of seismic hazards in active zones and possible precursors. Our long term objective is to build a borehole monitoring system in the region. By integrating various data obtained from borehole observations, we expect to get a better understanding of dynamics in the western NAF.

In the face of these challenges, adaptive reservoir regulation is becoming all the more ncessary.\nWater resources management in Northern California relies on the coordinated operation of several multi-objective reservoirs on the Trinity, Sacramento, American, Feather, and San Joaquin Rivers. To be effective, reservoir regulation must be able to (a) account for forecast uncertainty; (b) assess changing tradeoffs among water uses and regions; and (c) adjust management policies as conditions change; and (d) evaluate the socio-economic and environmental benefits and risks of forecasts and policies for each region and for the system as a whole.\nThe Integrated Forecast and Reservoir Management (INFORM) prototype demonstration project operated in Northern California through the collaboration of several forecast and management agencies has shown that decision support systems (DSS) with these attributes add value to stakeholder decision processes compared to current, less flexible management practices. Key features of the INFORM DSS include: (a) dynamically downscaled operational forecasts and climate projections that maintain the spatio-temporal coherence of the downscaled land surface forcing fields within synoptic scales; (b) use of ensemble forecast methodologies for reservoir inflows; (c) assessment of relevant tradeoffs among water uses on regional and local scales; (d) development and evaluation of dynamic reservoir policies with explicit consideration of hydro-climatic forecast uncertainties; and (e) focus on stakeholder information needs.\nThis article discusses the INFORM integrated design concept, underlying methodologies, and selected applications with the California water resources system.

            "abstract": "The regions surrounding Lake Ontario (e.g. the Adirondack mountain region and its northern border with Canada) are among the most seismically active regions in the Eastern US. However, only scant knowledge exists of the location and geometry of faults, suture zones, or crustal thickness variations that may localize strain in the crust beneath sections of New York, Pennsylvania and Ontario. Our aim is to determine the crustal density and magnetic susceptibility contrasts (e.g., steep faults, intrusive bodies, Moho topography) which give rise to anomaly patterns and to place constraints on their geometries and locations. With a better understanding of these structures, we will examine how the distribution of the faults and steep contacts throughout the region compare with zones of active seismicity.\nUtilizing the North American Gravity Database, we created a profile that crosses a narrow Bouguer anomaly with steep gradients surrounded by Bouguer anomaly highs transecting the lake and extending onshore east of Rochester, subparallel to the seismically active Clarendon-Linden fault. Euler deconvolution and ‘worm’ analyses show that this narrow anomaly is bounded by east-dipping faults that extend to mid-crustal levels.\nWe perform receiver function analyses of Earthscope TA stations in the region in order to constrain crustal thickness and lateral variations in Vp/Vs. These receiver functions at onshore sites in the area show complex Moho structure which partially explains our anomaly.Additionally, a vintage seismic profile coupled with the Lake Ontario bathymetry dataset was used to place constraints on sedimentary strata thicknesses and to identify structures within Proterozoic basement. Predictive models of crustal variations were created from a potential field profile, receiver functions, and a seismic profile to test interpretations. The Moho topography alone does not fully explain the short wavelength gravity anomaly, and a sedimentary basin of 3-5 km in depth is also needed to explain the observed Bouguer gravity anomaly patterns. We use these techniques to extend density mapping throughout the region.",

            "abstract": "As dissolved chemical elements are transported in the subsurface, their mixing with other compounds and potential reactivity depends on the creation of local scale chemical gradients, which ultimately drive diffusive mass transfer and reaction. The distribution of concentration gradients is in turn shaped by the spatial gradients of flow velocity arising from the random distribution of solid grains. We present an experimental investigation of the relationship between the microscale flow stretching properties and the effective large scale mixing dynamics in porous media. We use a flow cell that models a horizontal quasi two-dimensional (2D) porous medium, the grains of which are cylinders randomly positioned between two glass plates [de Anna et al. 2013]. In this setup, we perform both non diffusive and diffusive transport tests, by injecting respectively microsphere solid tracers and a fluorescent dye. While the dye front propagates through the medium, it undergoes in time a kinematic stretching that is controlled by the flow heterogeneity, as it encounters stagnation zones and high velocity channels between the grains. The spatial distribution of the dye can then be described as a set of stretched lamellae whose rate of diffusive smoothing is locally enhanced by kinematic stretching [Le Borgne et al., 2013]. We show that this representation allows predicting the temporal evolution of the mixing rate and the probability distribution of concentration gradients for a range of Peclet numbers. This upscaling framework hence provides a quantification of the dynamics of effective mixing from the microscale Lagrangian velocity statistics.\n",

The landslide, characterized as a debris avalanche – debris flow – rotational slide, was triggered by heavy precipitation in the region and initiated from a 200 m tall section of Pleistocene glacial deposits. The entire landslide encompassed an area of 1.2 km2. To understand the mobility of this landslide, we performed geological and geomorphological mapping throughout the initiation, transport, and deposition zones. In addition, we mapped a 450-m-long cross-section through the western distal lobe created by the excavation to reopen the SR530 roadbed to temporary traffic. Samples collected during mapping were used for geotechnical testing to evaluate the mobility of the landslide materials.\nOur detailed (1:300) geological mapping of the excavation revealed the juxtaposition of sand (glacial outwash) and clay (glaciolacustrine) debris avalanche hummocks towards the distal end of the landslide. Further, we found that two sections of the roadbed, having a combined length of at least 150 m, were entrained in the landslide. Throughout the debris avalanche deposit, 1:1200-scale geomorphological mapping identified a preponderance of sand boils located within thinner deposits between hummocks, suggesting that liquefaction played a role in the landslides mobility. In the central distal end of the landslide, we mapped on-lap deposits, wherein distal debris flow material overrode smaller hummocks of the larger debris avalanche deposit. Discovery of these deposits indicates that the run out of the landslide might have been even longer in places had topographic barriers (i.e., the other side of the valley) not reflected the flow back towards itself.",

            "abstract": "The ROSETTA spacecraft arrived in the vicinity of the comet in early August. As part of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), the Mutual Impedance Probe (RPC-MIP) is designed to measure the bulk plasma properties in the comet environment. MIP is an active RF probe. It consists of two transmitters, which can operate separately as a monopole or coupled as a transmitting dipole, and a receiving dipole. The operating range of MIP is 7 kHz to 3.5 MHz that allows covering the plasma density range expected during the mission from solar wind to deep coma densities. The baseline distance between the transmitter and the receiver is 40-60 cm, which allows probing plasmas with Debye lengths up to 20-25 cm. For longer Debye lengths, MIP uses one of the two Langmuir Probes of the RPC-LAP instrument  located at about 4 m from the MIP receiving dipole, which allows probing plasma with Debye lengths up to about 2 m. The MIP receiving dipole (baseline 1 m) can also be used in a passive mode to measure the electrical activity in the comet environment in the same frequency range. In the active mode, MIP measures the coupling complex impedance between the transmitting monopole (or dipole) and the receiving dipole. To model the frequency response of MIP, a surface charge distribution method is used that takes into account the charge distribution induced on the spacecraft structures by the transmitter. The spacecraft surface is approximated by discrete elements smaller in size than the plasma Debye length. In our model, it is assumed that each spacecraft elementary surface carries a uniform charge distribution. The electric field measured by the receiver is the sum of the contributions from the transmitter itself and of all the elementary surfaces that represent the spacecraft. The frequency of the transmitted current is varied in frequency steps. Assuming a transmitted current I(f) of constant amplitude, the potential difference V(f) between the two receivers provides the mutual impedance Z(f)=V(f)/I(f) of the instrument as a function of frequency. The first observations in active mode, as well as the background electric wave activity in the vicinity of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are presented. Preliminary inferred plasma parameters, such as bulk electron density and temperature, are derived by using the model for the MIP frequency response.",

            "abstract": "Larch (Larix spp.) dominant forests occupy about 70% of the permafrost areas in Siberia. Improved understanding of the fate of the larch forests in the face of climate change requires a concerted long term research effort to detect and quantify ecosystem responses. Satellite data analysis offers much improved information on changes in the forest-tundra transitional zone and on forest structure in this area.\nThe LANDSAT data and radar data such as ALOS/PALSAR provide extensive coverage at high resolution (30m pixel). In this study, the utilization of these data for regional canopy height and biomass mapping was examined. The major challenge for characterization of forest in a remote area such as Siberia is the lack of adequate number of training and validation data. The results of using GLAS waveform data to extend field measurements which has been successful in other ecosystems were found to be poor because most of the waveforms were acquired when the deciduous larch tree had no needles. In this study, the stereo optical data from high resolution spaceborne imagery (HRSI) were used to a generate canopy height model (CHM) by identifying both tree top and ground surface in these sparse forests. The regression models between the field measured canopy height, biomass and the stereo CHM were developed and the field data were extended to the forested areas within the entire stereo images, providing more data for training and validation. We compare the mapping results from two methods. One uses GLAS waveform data and the other uses high resolution stereo imagery to extrapolate field measurements. Results demonstrate the potential and limitations using high resolution stereo imagery to provide training information of sparse larch forest in Siberia.",

            "abstract": "The Microwave Integrated Retrieval System (MiRS), which is the official NOAA microwave retrieval algorithm for processing passive microwave observations from more than 7 different operational satellites, has been extended to data from the recently launched GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). Using a variational approach, the system simultaneously retrieves hydrometeor profiles (e.g. cloud, rain, and ice), as well as sounding and surface state parameters, which are all parts of the multidimensional state vector. MiRS is a physically-based optimal estimation algorithm, that finds a solution by minimizing a two-term cost function: 1) the departure of the forward model simulated radiances from the satellite measurements, and 2) the departure of the retrieved parameters from their a priori information. The community radiative transfer model (CRTM) is used as both the forward and Jacobian operator in simulating the radiances, with the goal of fitting the multichannel measurements within the assumed radiometric noise levels.\nOnce, the state vector is retrieved, further post-processing is carried out to derive important hydrometeor products such as the cloud water path, ice water path, and rain water path, which are then converted to surface rain rate using a physical relationship between water path amount and surface rain rate derived from offline simulations of a mesoscale model. Additional derived geophysical products include total precipitable water from vertical moisture profiles, and the sea ice concentration and the snow water equivalent from emissivity spectra. Since, the surface emissivity is included as part of the state vector, an all-surface retrieval has been possible without compromising a smooth transition of the geophysical products across different surfaces.\nIn this presentation, several examples of retrieved geophysical parameters using the MiRS 1DVAR algorithm applied to measurements from the GMI sensor on-board the GPM core satellite will be shown. When available, comparisons with collocated independent data will be included. Moreover, the algorithm is readily applicable to both cross-track sounders and conical imagers without needing any cross-calibration of radiometric measurements between the sensors in the GPM constellation.",

            "abstract": "The equilibrium relationship α17O/16Oa-b = (α18O/16Oa-b)θ makes the analysis of δ17O redundant for most terrestrial applications. However the θ term varies with temperature, so that ultra-high precision δ17O data provide additional information not available from δ18O alone. If the δ18O and δ17O values of formation water covary in a known way (e.g., meteoric water, ocean water), then a unique solution for both temperature and the δ18O of the formation fluids can be obtained from the combined δ18O-δ17O mineral values. The paired δ18O-δ17O values are in essence a single mineral thermometer. Unlike clumped isotopes or combined δ18O-δD data, the δ18O and δ17O values of a mineral have identical 'diagenetic potential', and will only be altered with a high F/R ratio. We have made an empirical determination of the temperature dependence on θ = -710/T2 + 0.5305 using Pleistocene diatom data from ODP Leg 177, Site 1093 (δ18O = 39.610, δ17O = 20.536‰), which is almost identical to Pack and Herwartz (EPSL, 2014). Application to ancient cherts gives the following results: The δ18O-δ17O values of cherts vary systematically with age, from Archean to Proterozoic to Phanerozoic. The Archean cherts are incompatible with modern seawater under any temperature conditions. Instead they have equilibrated with water of δ18O= -10±3 (‰ vs SMOW) at 50 to 70°C. These data support a lighter ocean in the Archean by ~5‰. Proterozoic cherts equilibrated at 35-50°C with meteoric water of -8±3‰ and Phanerozoic cherts equilibrated with mixed meteoric water/ocean water at similar temperatures and higher δ18O values (‑3±3‰).\nThe δ18O values of lacustrine diatoms from the Valles Caldera, NM, vary by over 20‰ between glacial and interglacial times. The combined δ18O-δ17O values of interglacial diatoms give T= ~12°C, δ18Ometeoric water = -9‰. A glacial age diatom sample gives T=<10°C, δ18Ometeoric water = -20‰. These data could not be obtained from the δ18O values alone. The Δ'17Oθ=0.528 values of the glacial and interglacial diatoms are -0.22 and ‑0.19‰, respectively. This change is in excellent agreement with changes seen in Δ'17O values of Vostok Antarctic ice between glacial and interglacial periods (Landais et al., GRL, 2008) and is evidence for a lower relative humidity moisture source in glacial periods.",

            "abstract": "Crop fertilization contributes to more than 40% of total anthropogenic emissions of ammonia (NH3) in Illinois. NH3 released into the atmospheric environment reacts readily with acidic compounds to form small diameter (<2.5µm) particulate matter (PM2.5) resulting in human health effects and deposition to surfaces causing eutrophication. Such emissions are not well characterized, and improved measurements are needed to further validate air quality models. This study seeks to provide improved understanding of the emission pathway of agricultural NH3 by measuring bi-directional flux of gaseous NH3 in an intensively managed agroecosystem.\nA relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) system was deployed above a maize canopy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI) Energy Farm. Average NH3 flux was measured throughout the growing season in four-hour periods during the morning and afternoon. The REA coefficient (β) was monitored for the duration of the season. The highest atmospheric NH3 concentration (8.11 μg/m3) was observed during the period nearest fertilization, with a mean concentration of 4.02 μg/m3 ± 2.15 μg/m3. Generally, larger upward fluxes of gaseous NH3 coincided with higher atmospheric NH3 concentration, but large variations were observed during the season. Observed NH3 flux ranged from -0.20 µg /m2s to 0.97 µg/m2s, where negative flux indicates deposition.",

            "abstract": "Frequent earth observations are essential for assessing the risks involved with global climate change, its feedbacks on carbon, energy and water cycling and consequences for live on earth. Often, satellite-remote sensing is the only practical way to provide such observations at comprehensive spatial scales, but relationships between land surface parameters and remotely sensed observations are mostly empirical and cannot easily be scaled across larger areas or over longer time intervals. For instance, optically based methods frequently depend on extraneous effects that are unrelated to the surface property of interest, including the sun-server geometry or background reflectance.\nAs an alternative to traditional, mono-angle techniques, multi-angle remote sensing can help overcome some of these limitations by allowing vegetation properties to be derived from comprehensive reflectance models that describe changes in surface parameters based on physical principles and radiative transfer theory. Recent results have shown in theoretical and experimental research that multi-angle techniques can be used to infer and scale the photosynthetic rate of vegetation, its biochemical and structural composition robustly from remote sensing. Multi-angle remote sensing could therefore revolutionize estimates of the terrestrial carbon uptake as scaling of primary productivity may provide a quantum leap in understanding the spatial and temporal complexity of terrestrial earth science.\nHere, we introduce a framework of next generation tower-based instruments to a novel and unique constellation of nano-satellites (Figure 1) that will allow us to systematically scale vegetation parameters from stand to global levels. We provide technical insights, scientific rationale and present results. We conclude that future earth observation from multi-angle satellite constellations, supported by tower based remote sensing will open new opportunities for earth system science and earth system modeling.",

            "abstract": "Fluids are major agents of mass and heat transport in the Earth crust and in subduction zones. Fluid inclusions, metasomatic field relations and experimental evidence suggest that these fluids can contain important ligands, including halogens, sulfates, sulfides, etc. The ligands participate in the complexation of rock-forming elements during mineral dissolution to high-T and P. Although models of high- element metasomatism typically assume that H2O dominates the fluid’s solvent properties, however, H2O may be a relatively minor component in the high-PT brines that are increasingly recognized in the lower crust and mantle. Understanding the evolution of solubility mechanisms as fluids change from dilute aqueous solutions to salt-rich brines is hindered by the absence of experimental investigation of this transition. To address this problem, we conducted experiments on the solubility of calcite in sodium-halide solutions at 8 kbar and 700 °C using hydrothermal piston-cylinder weight-loss methods. Investigated salts were NaL , where L=F, Cl, Br, I, at concentrations ranging from 0.15 molal to 20 molal (XNaL ~ 0.3). At these conditions, the fluid is a single supercritical fluid phase . Run durations were 4 to 20 hours. Results demonstrate systematic trends with ligand ionic size, and locate a major mechanistic transition in the vicinity of XNaL~ 0.1 for all calcite-H2O-NaL systems. At lower than this critical composition (Xcrit), calcite solubility displays a pronounced concave shape indicating involvement of water during the dissolution process. At XNaL> Xcrit , the shape becomes convex with no apparent effect of decreased H2O activity in the fluid. The solubility patterns suggest that the solvent properties are dominated by those of H2O at XNaL< Xcrit, but at XNaL> Xcrit, H2O is a solute in a solution behaving as a molten salt. Geological evidence suggests that salt concentrations may reach values similar to or greater than Xcrit in a range of metamorphic and igneous systems in the middle and lower crust. Our study implies that such fluids are best modeled as molten salt solutions, even at relatively water-rich compositions. This conclusion provides a foundation for developing models of metasomatic processes involving saline fluids in the deep crust and subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "The geologic map of the Death Valley Junction 30’ x 60’ quadrangle encompasses many geologic features recording the Cenozoic volcano-tectonic evolution of central Death Valley. Most notable is the central Death Valley rhombochasm. The rhombochasm is a 65x80-km rhombic pull-apart basin complex that occupies the releasing step-over between the northern Death Valley—Furnace Creek and southern Death Valley faults. Stewart (1983) documented this feature by palinspastically restoring offset thrust fault segments and isopachs, thereby closing the rhombochasm. The central Death Valley volcanic field records the coincident and related magmatism that occurred during the extension and strike-slip strain that formed the rhombochasm. In the multi-stage evolution of this tectonomagmatic feature, changes in volcanic and structural styles, rates, and loci were synchronized, both spatially and temporally. The volcanic field covers an area of 3600 km2, and consists of >700 km3 of lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic deposits. Cenozoic map units reflect four major eruptive stages: Stage 1 (11-9 Ma: rhyolite and andesite), Stage 2 (9-7.5 Ma: dacite>basalt>andesite), Stage 3 (7-5 Ma: dacite>basalt), and Stage 4 (4.5-0.7 Ma: basalt). The predominant loci of eruptive centers migrated northwestward during this volcanic evolution, coeval with northwestward migration of adjacent depocenters. Stage 1 and 2 volcanism is broadly correlative to the supradetachment stage of rhombochasm development. Related intrusions include exposed upper-plate hypabyssal and lower-plate plutonic bodies. Stage 3 and 4 volcanism occurred during two tectonic stages in which higher-angle faults cut across the detachment fault, forming basins that are nested within the original detachment-floored area of the rhombochasm. Time-transgressive changes from dominantly silicic and intermediate magmas in Stages 1 and 2 to dominantly mafic and lesser intermediate magmas in Stages 3 and 4 coincided with decreases in eruptive volumes and rates. As a result, early syn-detachment basin fill in the rhombochasm is dominantly volcanic, whereas post-detachment basin-fill is mainly sedimentary. Only the westernmost part of the rhombochasm is still tectonically active, reflected in Quaternary faulting of young basin fill in central Death Valley.",

On the morning of 7 August more heavy ions were detected, this time a very cold beam of ions in the O to CO2 mass range at an energy of a few 100 eV, moving approximately orthogonal to the solar wind flow direction. Over the coming weeks and months we expect to see signatures of ion pick up, mass loading, possibly ions reflected from the comet surface.

De-mixing is predicted to occur in density functional theory, although the pressure-temperature-composition conditions depend on the details of the calculations and do not always occur at conditions expected in giant planetary interiors. We have re-examined this problem with a new exchange-correlation functional that has been shown to yield better agreement with essentially exact quantum Monte Carlo results than does the generalised gradient approximation (PBE). We perform molecular dynamics based on density functional theory with the vdW-DF2 functional. The simulations are performed in the NPT ensemble giving us a more direct means of assessing chemical equilibrium than previous isochoric simulations. We find, in contrast to recent predictions based on PBE, that hydrogen and helium are soluble at conditions of the Jovian and Saturnian interiors and that helium rainout is not expected to occur in these planets. We explore the underlying reasons for these differences and discuss the implications for giant planetary evolution.",

Of the 36 spectral bands of MODIS, five are in infrared spectral regions suitable for the derivation of SST; this is a significant improvement on the AVHRR, the heritage instrument. In addition, the spectral response functions of MODIS are narrower than those of the AVHRR, the measurements are digitized to 12-bits instead of 10, and the uncertainty in the geolocation of the pixels is much smaller. However, the complexity of the optical design of MODIS led to instrumental artifacts in the infrared measurements, the consequences of which became apparent only after launch. But corrections for these have been developed and applied, so the SST measurements are of high quality and have many applications. The presentation will review progress in developing high quality SSTs and discuss the benefits of the new Version 6 SST algorithms and the SST fields they will produce.",

In the DKB, we observed an upward shift of snow-line altitude (ΔSLA) by more than 180 m, a terminus retreat of on average ~ 400 m, and an increase of 17.6 ± 3.1% in debris coverage between 1962 and 2011. Moreover, we observed that (i) glaciers with increased debris cover have experienced a reduced termini retreat; (ii) negative mass balances (i.e., ΔSLA) induce increases of debris coverage; (iii) slight, but statistically insignificant acceleration of the surface area loss since early 1990s; but a significant loss for the largest glaciers (>10 km2) that have accumulation zones at higher elevations and along the preferable south–north direction of the monsoon; (iv) a significant ΔSLA; moreover, the largest glaciers present median ΔSLA that are nearly double than that of the smallest; this finding leads to a hypothesis that these glaciers are shrinking, not only due to warming temperatures, but also as a result of decreasing precipitation due to a weakening Asian monsoons registered over the last few decades. Furthermore, we present first results on the geodetic glacier mass and velocity changes of selected glaciers, and climatic trends. In fact, less accumulation due to the observed decrease of precipitation should cause lower glacier flow velocity until to the ice stagnation of tongues as observed by other previous studies in the region. Finally, we compared our findings with other studies in the high mountain Asia and conclude that the shrinkage of these glaciers are less than that of western and eastern Himalaya, and southern and eastern Tibetan Plateau. The location in higher elevations have likely reduced the impact of warming on these glaciers, but have not been excluded from a relentlessly continuous and slow recession process over the past 50 yrs.",

            "abstract": "Over the past few decades, much work has been done to constrain the viscosity structure of the Earth's mantle using inverse techniques, viscoelastic modelling and post-glacial rebound data. Variations in the Earth's geoid provide constraints on the density structure in the mantle. We begin by deriving density models from a large range of seismic tomography models using appropriate velocity-density scaling factors which vary with depth. We then compute the synthetic geoid to compare with observed gravity anomalies in the Earth. This work improves on past results from geoid inversions by using a larger set of tomographic models, including more recent models. We find there are notable differences between using S- and P- wave tomographic models, with the S-wave models providing a better fit with the observed geoid. We explore the appropriate scaling factor for velocity to density conversion to use for different types of tomographic models. The different tomographic models also result in different viscosity profiles needed to produce the appropriate geoid to fit the observations. A unique viscosity profile corresponding to each tomographic model is not found but rather a family of different viscosity profiles preferred by each model. All models found an increase in the lower mantle viscosity provided the best correlation with the observed geoid but the magnitude of increase varied. Moreover, multiple profiles provide the best correlation when varying both the transition zone and lower mantle viscosity. Using the 3D mantle convection model, Stag-YY (e.g., Tackley, 2008), we are further able to explore the effect of lateral variations in viscosity in addition to the radial variations.\nREFERENCES\nTackley, P.

            "abstract": "Using the data sets of the FY-2C and FY-2E hourly equivalent temperature of black body (TBB) from 2005 to 2010, the mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in warm season (March-September) over the Tibetan Plateau are investigated. The large-scale environmental characteristics during the MCSs’ life cycle are also analyzed using the NCEP FNL data. The results show that the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau is the high-frequency occurrence area of MCSs. There is noticeable inter-monthly and diurnal variation in the distribution of MCSs over the Tibetan Plateau. The MCSs precipitation occurs more frequently in the summer season and from sunset to midnight. Most of the MCSs over the Tibetan Plateau are eastward propagating, low-speed, short-life meso-β convective systems. With respect to the large-scale atmospheric condition, the results indicate that in the upper troposphere there is a wind divergence center, and in the low troposphere there is a moisture convergence center associated with strong upward vertical motion, that is beneficial to the occurrence of strong convection. Also, in the mid troposphere (500 hPa) there exists an eastward positive vorticity advection, which might be a reason for the MCSs moving toward the east. The large-scale atmospheric condition in spring is different from that in summer. The vertical wind shear is the main factor for the MCSs to occur in spring, and the unstable atmosphere structure is the reason for the MCSs to occur in summer.",

            "abstract": "Models of geodynamic processes require constitutive equations that describe the rheological properties of olivine-rich mantle rocks. An extensive database exists for high-temperature deformation of olivine single crystals and aggregates. However, extrapolation of flow laws derived from high-temperature experiments to temperatures typical of the lithospheric mantle results in significant overestimation of olivine strength. Although some studies have explored the low-temperature deformation of olivine, constitutive equations describing the rheological properties of the four dominate dislocation slip systems over a large range of temperature and stress conditions have yet to be established. To investigate the rheological properties of olivine single crystals deforming by dislocation creep at asthenospheric and lithospheric temperatures, a series of direct shear experiments were carried out. The direct shear geometry permits isolation of the four dominate dislocation slip systems, whereas only two slip systems can be independently activated during triaxial compression. The experiments were carried out in a gas-medium deformation apparatus at temperatures of 1000-1300°C, a confining pressure of 300 MPa, and shear stresses of 81 to 334 MPa that result in shear strain rates of 1.0 x 10-5 to 2.6 x 10-3 s-1. At high-temperature and low-stress conditions, strain rate follows a power law relationship with stress. At low-temperature and high-stress conditions, strain rate depends exponentially on stress. These observations are consistent with a transition from strain rate limited by a climb-controlled dislocation mechanism at higher temperatures to strain rate limited by a glide-controlled dislocation mechanism at lower temperatures.",

            "abstract": "Water limitations in dryland ecosystems are predicted to intensify with climate change due to the combination of decreased precipitation and increased warming. Plants in these ecosystems may be living at or near their tolerance limits, and thus subtle changes in water availability may have dramatic effects on their performance. To examine the impacts of subtle, but chronic reductions in water availability, we established a network of 40 rainfall removal shelters across a range of plant communities, soil types and elevations in the Colorado Plateau. Each site consisted of a control plot receiving ambient precipitation paired with a drought plot that received a 35% precipitation reduction. After three years, we observed a range of ecosystem-level responses to the treatments by key plant functional types. The experimental drought had dramatic effects on the C3 grasses (mortality and cover changes), but the treatment effects were relatively minor for the C4 grasses (cover change only) and C3 shrubs (no treatment effects on cover or mortality). We investigated the mechanisms behind the relative drought tolerances of the latter two plant functional types by measuring the ecophysiological responses of three dominant species on the Colorado Plateau: Pleuraphis jamensii (C4 grass), Coleogyne ramosissima (C3 shrub) and Ephedra viridis (C3 shrub).\nDuring the 2014 growing season, we measured mid-day leaf water potential and net photosynthesis monthly for these dominant species under the control and drought treatments (n=5). We analyzed the effects of treatment, month and their interaction on these measurements using a mixed effects model for each species separately. Overall, P. jamensii was the most sensitive to drought of the three focal species as evidenced by significant effects of drought on both leaf water potential and net photosynthesis (30% reduction). Neither of the C3 shrubs had significant treatment effects on either ecophysiolgoical variable. These results provide mechanistic evidence behind the ecosystem-level effects; the drought treatments are causing stress in C4 grasses but not C3 shrubs. These results suggest that subtle but chronic changes in water availability may alter the structure and function of the Colorado Plateau ecosystem by differentially impacting key plant functional types.",

IOM-1/4 solutions are then used to give lateral boundary condition to an eddy resolving (1/12° horizontal resolution) north Indian Ocean Model (IOM-1/12). The physics in eddy permitting and eddy resolving model is same. The forcing is same in all three model simulations. The analysis of model solutions during January 2010 to June 2013 shows significant improvement in upper ocean variability in IOM-12 as compared to INCOIS-GODAS and IOM-1/4.

            "abstract": "Geological systems consisting of a porous reservoir and a low-permeable caprock are prone to hydraulic fracturing, if pore pressure rises to the effective stress. Under certain conditions, hydraulic fracturing is associated with sediment remobilisation, e.g. sand injections or pipes, leading to reduced seal capacity of the caprock. In dynamically scaled analogue experiments using granular materials and air pressure, we intent to investigate strain patterns and deformation mechanisms during caprock failure and fluidisation of shallow over-pressured reservoirs. The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of leakage potential of a sealing formation and the fluidisation potential of a reservoir formation depending on rock properties and effective stress.\nFor reliable interpretation of analogue experiments, physical properties of analogue materials, e.g. frictional strength, cohesion, density, permeability etc., have to be correctly scaled according to those of their natural equivalents. The simulation of caprock requires that the analogue material possess a low permeability and is capable to shear failure and tensional failure. In contrast, materials representing the reservoir have to possess high porosity and low shear strength.\nIn order to find suitable analogue materials, we measured the stress-strain behaviour and the permeability of over 25 different types of natural and artificial granular materials, e.g. glass powder, siliceous microspheres, diatomite powder, loess, or plastic granulate. Here, we present data of frictional parameters, compressibility and permeability of these granular materials characterized as a function of sphericity, grain size, and density. The repertoire of different types of granulates facilitates the adjustment of accurate mechanical properties in the analogue experiments. Furthermore, conditions during seal failure and fluidisation can be examined depending on the wide range of varying physical properties.",

Working with experienced facilitators, the expert panel will create a detailed synopsis of the tasks and responsibilities characteristic of their profession, as well as the skills, knowledge and behaviors that enable them to succeed in the workplace. After the panel finishes their work, the task matrix and associated narrative will be vetted and validated by a larger group of additional professionals, and then disseminated for use by educators and employers.\nThe process we are using is called DACUM (Developing a Curriculum), adapted by EDC and optimized for emergent professions, such as the “big-data-enabled professional.” DACUM is a well-established method for analyzing jobs and occupations, commonly used in technical fields to develop curriculum and training programs that reflect authentic work tasks found in scientific and technical workplaces. The premises behind the DACUM approach are that: expert workers are better able to describe their own occupation than anyone else; any job can be described in terms of the tasks that successful workers in the occupation perform; all tasks have direct implications for the knowledge, skills, understandings and attitudes that must be taught and learned in preparation for the targeted career.\nAt AGU, we will describe the process and present the finalized occupational profile.",

            "abstract": "The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) solar irradiance is one of the primary energy sources into the Mars atmosphere. Photons in this wavelength range heat, dissociate, and ionize the constituents of the upper atmosphere, hence knowledge of the solar irradiance is vital in determining not only the state of the planet’s atmosphere, but its variability and potential for atmospheric escape. The solar EUV irradiance varies on all timescales and is the result of the highly variable activity on the Sun. During the primary mission of the Mars Atmosphere Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN), the planet will be on a different side of the Sun than the Earth and will therefore be subjected to potentially very different irradiances than the standard Earth-based monitors can capture, particularly for short timescale variations such as on daily (active region evolution) or sub-daily (flares) scales. The EUV monitor on MAVEN measures the solar input to the Mars atmosphere with three broadband radiometers at 121-122 nm (H Ly-α), 17-22 nm, and 0-6 nm, capturing solar transition region, coronal, and flaring emissions. The EUV measurements will be at a 1-second cadence. The broadband measurements can be used as direct indicators of the timing and magnitude of solar irradiance variations. The EUV data will also be combined with interpolated Earth-based measurements using a proxy model to generate a full irradiance spectrum from 0-190 nm in1-nm bins at a 1-minute cadence for use in Mars atmospheric studies. This paper will present the EUV monitor measurements and data products and the synergies with the other MAVEN instruments and atmospheric studies.",

Despite the complexity, the weak temperature sensitivity and strong mineralogical control offer Mg isotope compositions of carbonate rocks as a paleoproxy to provide constraints on environmental records, and an index for diagenesis and low degree metamorphism.\nHere, we present four cases describing 1) how Mg isotope varied during the mineralogical transition from aragonite (corals) to calcite; 2) how δ26Mg, 87Sr/86Sr ratios of a Cambrian limestone changed due to the formation of secondary high-Mg calcite; 3) how δ26Mg and trace metal compositions of limestones can be used to reconstruct ocean chemistry, and 4) how δ26Mg, 87Sr/86Sr ratios of dolomite can be used to infer ocean chemistry in the deep time.",

            "abstract": "Recent satellite observations and simulations have clarified that plasma outflows play an important role in abrupt changes in the ion composition in the plasmasheet and ring current during geomagnetic storms. Statistical studies by Strangeway et al. [2005] and Brambles et al. [2011] indicated that fluxes of ion outflows are correlated well with soft electron precipitation (precipitating electron density and electron density in the loss cone), and DC and Alfvenic Poynting fluxes using the data obtained by the FAST satellite near the cusp region in the dayside during the 24-25 September 1998 geomagnetic storm. To evaluate the correlations for H+ and O+ ions separately, we performed statistical studies using the ion composition data in addition to the ion, electron, and field data obtained by the FAST satellite during January 1998 and January 1999. The longer dataset enables us to identify empirical formulas between outflowing O+ and H+ ion fluxes and precipitating electron densities, DC and Alfvenic Poynting fluxes in a wide solar zenith angle (SZA) range (45°-145°). These empirical formulas would be useful for global magnetospheric simulations as the boundary conditions. Under dark conditions, H+ ion fluxes increases with increasing precipitating electron density, but not as much as those do under sunlit conditions. The precipitating electron density that corresponds to the H+ ion flux of ~107 /cm2/s （mapped to 1000 km altitude） decreases with increasing SZA. This SZA dependence is less clear for O+ ions as compared with H+ ions. The empirical formulas between outflowing O+ and H+ ion fluxes and DC and Alfvenic Poynting fluxes are not so strongly affected by SZA. Under sunlit conditions, the flux O+ ions tends to be larger than that of H+ ions, while H+ ions tend to become dominant under dark conditions. Intense ion (especially O+ ion) outflow events (>108 /cm2/s mapped to 1000 km altitude) mostly occurred under sunlit conditions or near the terminator.",

            "abstract": "Current regional to global and daily to annual Evapotranspiration ( ET) estimation mainly relies on surface energy balance (SEB) ET models or statistical empirical methods driven by remote sensing data and various meteorology databases. However, these ET models face challenging issues—large uncertainties from inevitable input errors, poorly defined parameters, and inadequate model structures. The eddy covariance measurements on water, energy, and carbon fluxes at globally available FLUXNET tower sites provide a feasible opportunity to assess the ET modelling uncertainties. In this study, we focused on uncertainty analysis on an operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) algorithm for ET estimation at multiple Ameriflux tower sites with diverse land cover characteristics and climatic conditions. The input land surface temperature (LST) data of the algorithm were adopted from the 8-day composite1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature. The other input data were taken from the Ameriflux database. Results of statistical analysis indicated that uncertainties or random errors from input variables and parameters of SSEBop led to daily and seasonal ET estimates with relative errors around 20% across multiple flux tower sites distributed across different biomes. This uncertainty of SSEBop lies in the error range of 20-30% of similar SEB-based ET algorithms, such as, Surface Energy Balance System and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land. The R2 between daily and seasonal ET estimates by SSEBop and ET eddy covariance measurements at multiple Ameriflux tower sites exceed 0.7, and even up to 0.9 for croplands, grasslands, and forests, suggesting systematic error or bias of the SSEBop is acceptable. In summary, the uncertainty assessment verifies that the SSEBop is a reliable method for wide-area ET calculation and especially useful for detecting drought years and relative drought severity for agricultural production. Reduction of errors from input variables (i.e., LST from MODIS) and key parameters (i.e., hot temperature boundary) in topographically complex areas and high albedo and emissivity surfaces can significantly improve the ET calculation of the SSEBop model.",

            "abstract": "Sand mining in alluvial rivers by hydraulic or bucket dredge causes a significant disturbance within the geomorphic processes controlling river form and function. While the reach-scale impacts of dredging associated with a general decline in sediment availability (e.g., channel incision) are well documented, the effects of the borrow pit on the local flow and sediment transport field are not well understood. These local effects are important because they control the post-dredge evolution of the borrow pit, setting the lifespan of the pit as well as affecting channel morphology on a reach-scale. This study documents the observed morphological evolution of a large (1.46 x 106 m3) borrow pit located on a lateral sandbar in the lower Mississippi River channel that was mined for coastal restoration purposes using a time series of multibeam bathymetric surveys. Observations show that within the 2.5 year study period, 53 % of the initial pit volume infilled with sediment, decreasing pit depth by 0.88 m/yr on average. To explore the possible controls of the observed pit infilling, a calibrated 3D hydraulic model (Delft3D) was used to simulate flow and sediment transport within the affected river reach. Results indicate that the observed infilling rates were closely related to predicted sediment supply rates and borrow pit geometry. The pit geometry (pit depth, length) influenced the predicted magnitude of the bed stress within the pit relative to its initial pre-dredged bed stress value, i.e., the bed stress reduction ratio (R*), a metric that was correlated with the magnitude and spatial distribution of infilling. A simple 1D model was derived using sediment supply and R* to simulate temporal and spatial patterns of pit infilling. This model was able to closely approximate the cumulative amount of observed infilling during the study period and reproduce realistic longitudinal infilling patterns. Additional infilling model experiments show that, for a borrow pit of a set volume located within a lower Mississippi river channel bar, creating deeper rather than longer borrow pits can reduce the time required to infill with sand by an order of magnitude. Study results provide insight into the resilience of alluvial river channels after a disturbance and the sustainability of sand mining as a sediment source for coastal restoration.",

            "abstract": "Mapping of surface deformation using Interferometric SAR requires estimation and removal of phase from different sources including topographic phase and variations in path delay due to propagation through the ionosphere and atmosphere. One additional term that is particularly relevant in urban environments is the differential phase due to thermal expansion of structures. Uncorrected, the thermal expansion phase leads to loss of persistent scatterers, especially in the upper part of tall buildings, and large errors in the deformation time series. The objective of our work was to estimate and mitigate the thermal expansion phase such that the PSI solution can include tall buildings that have significant thermal phase signatures as well as improving the accuracy for all scatterers affected by thermal effects.\nIn the first order approximation the thermal expansion depends linearly on the temperature difference as well as on the length of the object with a material dependent thermal expansion coefficient. Both the material dependent coefficient and the effective object length are typically not well known for a persistent scatterer. Applying for each scatterer a linear regression with respect to the temperature difference on the stack of residual phases that include the thermal phase, permits determination of a thermal sensitivity parameter β (radians/degree C) and an intercept. The temperature phase model can then be applied to subtract a thermal phase term. The temperature phase model can also be extended by interpolation to points not yet included in the solution allowing the PS solution to extend to structures previously not part of the solution.\nWe present an analysis of the thermal expansion phase signal for a stack of 48 TerraSAR‑X 2m resolution stripmap mode scenes acquired over Barcelona, Spain during the period 2007-Dec-30 to 2011-Nov-07. Maps of the residual phase before and after correction for thermal expansion as well as the thermal expansion parameter are presented (see Figures 1 and 2), confirming a significant improvement in the spatial coverage and quality.",

            "abstract": "The smallest earthquakes go unmeasured except in unusual circumstances. These events are potentially of great importance for understanding and characterizing earthquake physics. For instance the GR relation at small magnitude remains an open question. Micro earthquakes are also potentially of great importance for applications ranging from earthquake precursors to probing the earth’s stress state. As these smallest of earthquakes are the most numerous, their spatial and temporal response to changes in the stress field or variations in the frictional properties of faults may tell us a great deal about the elastic properties of the crust. Here we describe an approach to detect these smallest events, based on waveform coherence.\nWe describe a method to detect microseismicity that can be applied without dense specialized arrays. Traditional earthquake detection algorithms require the identification of phase arrivals or use a finite number of templates to scan continuous data. Correlating waveforms or waveform envelopes from nearby stations has been used to detect non-traditional seismic emissions like non-volcanic tremor. We modified this method to search for microseismicity. We do not explicitly identify or locate individual events. Instead, we quantify how microseismicity varies in time and space. By applying this method to real data we demonstrate that in addition to detecting all cataloged events, we also detect many smaller events.",

            "abstract": "A warm, water-bearing Archean Earth, when the Sun was young and faint, remains a paradox to the scientific world. Abundant geological data suggests that Archean Earth had standing water at the surface, despite the fainter Sun. An explanation of this paradox is vital to the understanding of Earth’s history and coevolution with life. If the surface of the planet was not being kept warm by the Sun, which was 25% less luminous than now, it must have been kept warm a different way—by an atmospheric composition high in greenhouse gases. Constraints on these gases come from the geological record, which have provided proxies for the redox state of the atmosphere (limiting H2 and O2), the total atmospheric pressure, and the partial pressure of certain gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Previous attempts at solutions to the paradox are consistent with some, but not all, of the geological proxies.\n The constraints are used as inputs for a 1-D photochemical code, which calculates atmospheric composition and predicts the abundances of atmospheric gases that affect climate, particularly methane (CH4) and gaseous hydrogen (H2). A coupled 1-D radiative-convective climate code is then used to calculate the corresponding surface temperature. Critically, the improved photochemical code maintains strict redox boundary conditions, and is being further updated to ensure that the redox fluxes from volcanoes and mid-ocean ridge vents are consistent with both each other and the redox state of the mantle. These code improvements will lead to changes in both the inputs to the atmosphere from volcanoes and the sink for oxidants at mid-ocean ridges, in turn affecting the abundance of redox-sensitive greenhouse gases such as CH4 and H2. The main purpose of this project is to extend simulations of the Archean surface environment down into the mantle, and to search for a solution to the faint young sun paradox that is consistent with the geological proxies. Beyond having interesting implications on Archean Earth’s climatic history, this study effectively uses Archean Earth as an analog environment in which to test a new tool for simulating the effects of mantle geochemistry on (exo)planetary atmospheres and environments.",

            "abstract": "The studies that quantify the human and economic costs of increasing exposure of cities to various natural hazards consider climate change and increasing population and economic activity, but assume constant urban extent. Accurate estimates of the potential losses due to changing exposure of cities, however, require that we know where they will grow in the future. Here, we present the first-ever estimates of the changing exposure of urban infrastructure to floods and droughts due to urban land expansion from 2000 to 2030. Although the percent of land that is urban within the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) increases globally only slightly to 13% by 2030, the amount of urban land is predicted to increase 230% to 234,000 km2. In 2000, about 30% of global urban land (i.e., nearly 200,000 km2) was located in the high-frequency flood zones; by 2030, this will reach 40%, (i.e., over 700,000 km2). The emerging coastal metropolitan regions in Africa and Asia will be larger than those in the developed countries and thus will have larger areas exposed to flooding. The urban extent in drylands will increase nearly 300,000 km2, reaching almost 500,000 km2. Urban land exposed to both floods and droughts is expected to increase over 250%. There are significant geographical variations in the rates and magnitudes of urban expansion exposed to floods or droughts or both. Our findings show that even without factoring in the potential impacts from climate change, the extent of urban areas exposed to flood and drought hazards will increase, respectively, 2.7 and almost 2 times by 2030. Our global view on changing geographical patterns of urban exposure to flood and drought hazards can facilitate effective mitigation and adaptation against these hazards at multiple scales.",

Structural description for cuttings/cores and stress/strain analyses based on anelastic strain recovery (ASR) and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) for core samples were performed. The followings are structural characteristics:\na) The intact cuttings include slickenlined surfaces, scaly fabric, deformation bands, minor faults and mineral veins. Scaly fabric is increasingly observed below ~2200 mbsf.\nb) The cored interval is characterized by steep bedding planes (>75˚). A fault zone with a few mm-size angular clasts is present in the core (2204.9–2205.8 mbsf).\nc) SEM images in the upper part of Hole C0002N show little evidence for opal diagenesis. The fabric lacks a strongly preferred orientation in clay-rich materials, except along striated micro-fault. Below 2625 mbsf, compaction fabrics in clay–rich materials can be observed.\nThe overall character of the deformation (independent particulate flow with limited evidence for cataclastic deformation) in the cuttings is suggestive that deformations occurred in a relatively shallow environment.\nStress analyses based on the ASR for three whole-round samples from Hole C0002P showed good curve of the strain recovery and identified vertically-oriented σ2-axes with horizontal σ1 and σ3-axes. Paleomagnetic works are still continued to detect three-dimensional stress information.\nMagnetic fabrics deduced from AMS ellipsoids show moderate flattening fabric parallel to the bedding plane (Kmin inclined perpendicular to the bedding plane). Although magnetic foliation (Kint/Kmin) decreases and Kmin-inclination is disturbed in the fault zone, magnetic lineation (Kmax/Kint) didn’t show variation, indicative of brittle deformation occurring in the fault zone. Major reduction in the mean susceptibility is identified in the fault zone, which implies chemical reaction which decreases concentration of magnetic minerals occurred along the fault zone.",

We have developed numerical algorithms to study the characteristics of MSTIDs as indicated by their phase velocities, their propagation directions, and their scale-sizes. We have also constructed a method to automatically detect plasma depletions that exist in South and Central America. These two methods allow us to study the day-to-day variability and the conjugate characteristics of MSTIDs and depletions at low and mid-latitudes. We found that mid-latitude (magnetic latitude > 25°) TEC depletions occur mainly during magnetically active conditions, exhibit conjugate characteristics, persist for very long periods, and last up to afternoon hours when the Kp index is high (Kp > 5o). However, we have also detected some cases of mid-latitude TEC depletions that occur during quiet magnetic conditions. These events preferentially develop during the June solstice and do not map to the opposite hemisphere. MSTIDs occur in Central America and the Caribbean region quite often. They are defined to be conjugate when the peaks and valleys of their TEC distributions closely coincide in opposite hemispheres, their scale sizes are equal and their phase velocities are mirror images with respect to the magnetic equator. We also describe the statistics of MSTIDs that show conjugate properties.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of future changes of sandy shores are often unreliable in regions with highly variable historical change rates, as is frequently the case along coasts dominated by Pleistocene glacial deposits. In an effort to improve estimates of future coastal change for the outer section of the Provincelands at the distal end of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, we applied a simple one-dimensional numerical model to calculate net longshore sediment transport rates for three time periods: 1833-1889, 1889-1933 and 1933-2010. Since the entire 9 km study area was within a single littoral cell and included its terminus (at Long Point), we back-calculated net transport rates from that point of no transport to estimate the transport at updrift locations throughout the study area. The results for all three time periods indicated a net alongshore transport rate on the order of 100,000 cubic meters per year entering the study area (at Race Point). However, the transport rate patterns for the three periods varied markedly, albeit consistently, throughout the study area. Regional decreases and increases in transport rates, indicating zones of net accretion and erosion, were pronounced in the earliest period, less so in the second, and almost absent in the third. We interpret these results as indicating that the study area has been evolving toward an increasingly stable morphology over the past two centuries.",

            "abstract": "Tracking labeled substrates through microbial mat systems can help elucidate carbon dynamics, species interactions, and niche partitioning, but the inherent microbial complexity of these systems makes them difficult to probe with single analytical techniques. Here we use a combination of different tools to track three labeled substrates through a benthic phototrophic mat from Hot Lake. Hot Lake is a hypersaline, meromictic lake located in an endorheic basin in north-central Washington which, despite extreme salinity and seasonal water temperatures (> 55 ˚C), hosts dense, phototrophic benthic microbial mats. Cyanobacteria are the dominant CO2-fixing organisms in the system and we seek to understand the spatial and metabolic controls on how the carbon initially fixed by mat cyanobacteria is transferred to associated heterotrophic populations spread throughout the mat strata.\nWe performed ex situ incubations over a complete diel cycle with 13C labeled bicarbonate, acetate, and glucose. Traditional elemental analysis IRMS provided an estimate of bulk label uptake to total biomass and showed that both bicarbonate and acetate were incorporated only during daylight while glucose uptake was nearly constant through the cycle. Spatially resolved isotope analysis using laser ablation IRMS showed distinctive patterns between the different substrates with bicarbonate having highest uptake in the top third of the mat, acetate uptake focused near the mat’s center, and glucose showing similar uptake at all mat depths. Proteomic analysis showed a longer lag in substrate conversion to protein than to biomass and a distinct spike in the number of labeled peptides in the bicarbonate incubation near the end of the diel cycle. Proteomic analysis confirmed that photosynthetic organisms showed the highest rates of label conversion to protein but heterotrophic organisms also incorporated label into their peptides. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated the high conversion of organic substrates to storage compounds within the biomass. Taken together, these orthogonal data combine to show distinct differences in the fate of the applied substrates. Using this combination of analytical methods can build a detailed picture of carbon dynamics in complex microbial systems.",

Techniques have been developed to derive the magnetic meridional component of neutral winds in the thermosphere using values of hmF2 derived from ionosonde measurements. The winds obtained from hmF2 are termed ‘equivalent’ neutral winds because they comprise both neutral wind and electric field contributions to any changes in hmF2. The method has been shown to provide winds that agree well with winds from other techniques and it has the advantage of being able to provide diurnal winds at the large number of mid-latitude ionosonde sites. Equivalent neutral winds are currently being generated using a vast global ionosonde database of mid-latitude ionosonde measurements that spans the years 1961-1990 with the aim to develop a new empirical wind model. In the database, there are nearly 100 ionosonde sites in the mid-latitudes and the wind values being generated at each site have a one-hour time resolution. This paper presents comparisons of the derived equivalent neutral winds with other observations and wind models. The paper will also examine the wind behavior with solar activity at different locations.",

            "abstract": "For large-scale sediment transport predictions, an important parameter is the settling or terminal velocity of particles because it plays a key role in determining the concentration of sediment particles within the water column as well as the deposition rate of particles onto the seabed. The settling velocity of particles is influenced by the fluid dynamic environment as well as attributes of the particle, such as its size, shape, and density. This laboratory study examines the effects of turbulence, generated by an oscillating grid, on both synthetic and natural particles for a range of flow conditions. Because synthetic particles are spherical, they serve as a reference for the natural particles that are irregular in shape. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and high-speed imaging systems were used simultaneously to study the interaction between the fluid mechanics and sediment particles’ dynamics in a tank. The particles’ dynamics were analyzed using a custom two-dimensional tracking algorithm used to obtain distributions of the particle’s velocity and acceleration. Turbulence properties, such as root-mean-square turbulent velocity and vorticity, were calculated from the PIV data. Results are classified by Stokes number, which was based-on the integral scale deduced from the auto-correlation function of velocity. We find particles with large Stokes numbers are unaffected by the turbulence, while particles with small Stokes numbers primarily show an increase in settling velocity in comparison to stagnant flow. The results also show an inverse relationship between Stokes number and standard deviation of the settling velocity. This research enables a better understanding of the interdependence between particles and turbulent flow, which can be used to improve parameterizations in large-scale sediment transport models.",

            "abstract": "The remote location and inaccessibility of many active volcanic systems around the world hinders detailed investigation of their eruptive dynamics. One methodology for monitoring such locations is through the utilisation of multiple satellite datasets to elucidate underlying eruption dynamics and aid volcanic hazard mitigation. Whilst satellite datasets are often analysed individually, here we exploit the multi-platform NASA A-Train satellite constellation, including the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on Aura and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua. OMI measures volcanic emissions (e.g. sulphur dioxide, ash) whilst MODIS enables monitoring of thermal anomalies (e.g. lava flows, lava lakes, pyroclastic deposits), allowing analysis of a more diverse range of volcanic unrest than is possible using a single measurement technique alone, and permitting cross-correlation between datasets for specific locations to assess cyclic activity. A Multi-taper (MTM) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis was implemented at an initial sample site (Soufriere Hills volcano [SHV], Montserrat) facilitating cycle identification and subsequent comparison with existing ground-based data. Corresponding cycles at intervals of 8, 12 and ~50 days were identified in both the satellite-based SO2 and thermal infrared signals and ground-based SO2 measurements (Nicholson et al. 2013), validating the methodology. Our analysis confirms the potential for identification of cyclical volcanic activity through synergistic analysis of satellite data, which would be of particular value at poorly monitored volcanic systems. Following our initial test at SHV, further sample sites have been selected in locations with varied eruption dynamics and monitoring capabilities including Ambrym (Vanuatu), Kilauea (Hawaii), Nyiragongo (DR Congo) and Etna (Italy) with the intention of identifying not only cyclic signals that can be attributed to volcanic systems but also those which are artefacts of the measurement technique employed.",

We studied α-FeOOH as a function of pressure up to 75 GPa using X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and observed that it undergoes a spin transition beginning at approximately 50 GPa. In γ-FeOOH, we see a spin transition beginning around 35 GPa. β- FeOOH does not show any indication of a spin transition for pressures up to 65 GPa. Analysis of our X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shows that neither β-FeOOH nor γ-FeOOH undergoes any obvious phase structural transition with both appearing to amorphize above ~20 GPa. We present the derived EOS of β and γ and compare them with recently published data on α and ε. We note that β –FeOOH displayed distinct behavior when compared to the other three polymorphs; it was significantly less compressible and did not undergo a spin transition over the pressure range studied.",

Shell thickness changes in planktonic foraminifera have previously been linked to variations in carbonate ion concentration, light intensity, temperature and nutrient availability, providing a proxy for past changes in seawater properties. While culture studies are invaluable in assessing the main controls on shell calcification in certain species, open ocean studies are needed to understand the impact of multi-stressor environments on shell parameters of multiple species and their potential as palaeo-proxies.\nIn this study, we present data on shell thickness of four depth-stratified species of modern planktonic foraminifera (Globoratalia truncatulinoides, Globoratalia inflata, Orbulina universa, Globigerinoides ruber-pink) from bi-weekly time-series sediment trap samples in the Sargasso Sea (Ocean Flux Program). We also use species flux, geochemical data and measured hydrographic data from Bermuda Atlantic time series to understand the seasonal and interannual changes in shell thickness due to changes in seawater properties.\nWe show that short-lived environmental perturbations such as cyclonic eddies affect local hydrographic conditions and can dramatically influence species fluxes and shell thicknesses. Our results suggest that a combined morphometric and geochemical approach to fossil planktonic foraminifera would allow a better understanding of calcification response to past environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Important biological, physical and chemical processes, such as fluxes of oxygen, nutrients and contaminants, occur across sediment-water interfaces. These processes are influenced by bioturbation activities of benthic animals. Bioturbation is thought to be significant in releasing metals to the water column from contaminated sediments, but metals contamination also affects organism activity. Consequently, the aim of this study was to consider the interactions of biological activity, sediment chemistry, pore water transport, and chemical reactions in sediment mixing and the flux and toxicity of metals in sediments. Prior studies have modeled bioturbation as a diffusive process. However, diffusion models often do not describe accurately sediment mixing due to bioturbation. To this end, we used the continuous time random walk (CTRW) model to assess sediment mixing caused by bioturbation activity of Lumbriculus variegatus worms. We performed experiments using fine-grained sediments with different levels of zinc contamination from Lake DePue, which is a Superfund Site in Illinois. The tests were conducted in an aerated fresh water chamber. Fluorescent particulate tracers were added to the sediment surface to quantify mixing processes and the influence of metals contaminants on L. variegatus bioturbation activity. We observed sediment mixing and organism activity by time-lapse photography over 14 days. Then, we analyzed the images to characterize the fluorescent particle concentration as a function of sediment depth and time. Results reveal that sediment mixing caused by L. variegatus is subdiffusive in time and superdiffusive in space. These results suggest that anomalous sediment mixing is probably a ubiquitous process, as this behavior has only been observed previously in marine sediments. Also, the experiments indicate that bioturbation and sediment mixing decreased in the presence of higher metals concentrations in sediments. This process is expected to decrease efflux of metals from highly contaminated sediments by reducing biological activity.",

The vast majority of traditional paleoclimate simulation studies using General Circulation Models include representations of the atmosphere and ocean as well as a dynamic sea ice model. In this we study new presents model results from a GCM that also includes a detailed ocean biogeochemical scheme HadOCC. HadOCC is an ecosystem model, meaning it contains an explicit representation of planktonic species (both autotrophic phytoplankton and heterotrophic zooplankton) and is an NZPD model (Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Detritus). It is also able to simulate air-sea gas exchange and primary productivity in the surface and near-surface as well as full ecosystem interaction throughout the water column.\nCompared to the present day, the Latest Cretaceous represents a very different world, both in terms of its atmospheric composition and in the configuration of the continents. It also offers the prospect of studying a past warm climate with significantly enhanced CO2 levels compared to the preindustrial era. For the simulations presented here, atmospheric CO2 levels are set to be four times their preindustrial values (290 parts per million).\nThe combination of a very different continental configuration and hugely enhanced atmospheric CO2 levels results in a very different climate from what we know today. To first order, ocean temperatures are significantly higher and circulation patterns are very different. The combination of these fundamentally important ocean properties means that the resulting biological activity (which will be shown in an annual mean and seasonal sense) is able to provide clues as to which oceanic areas were more biologically active than others. Because of the fully dynamic and coupled nature of the biology and physics of this modelling framework, surface and benthic processes (and their interactions) can be studied without the need for inference concerning the connection between the two. It is hoped that this presentation will stimulate future collaborations between modellers and experimentalists and will also be of use for future targeted drilling cruises.",

More sophisticated inventories methodologies for at least key emission source are needed due to policy-driven air quality directives. Quantifying land cover changes on an annual basis requires greater spatial and temporal disaggregation of input data. The main aim of this study is to develop a methodology for using Earth Observations (EO) to identify annual land surface changes that will improve emissions inventories from agriculture and land use/land use change and forestry (LULUCF) in the UK. First goal is to find the best sets of input features that describe accurately the surface dynamics.\nIn order to identify annual and inter-annual land surface changes, a times series of surface reflectance was used to capture seasonal variability. Daily surface reflectance images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 500m resolution were used to invert a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model to create the seamless time series. Given the limited number of cloud-free observations, a BRDF climatology was used to constrain the model inversion and where no high-scientific quality observations were available at all, as a gap filler. The Land Cover Map 2007 (LC2007) produced by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) was used for training and testing purposes. A prototype land cover product was created for 2006 to 2008. Several machine learning classifiers were tested as well as different sets of input features going from the BRDF parameters to spectral Albedo. We will present the results of the time series development and the first exercises when creating the prototype land cover product.",

            "abstract": "Using teleseismic shear-wave splitting measurements from the SESAME array and EarthScope Transportable Array, we are quantifying sources of seismic anisotropy beneath the southern Appalachians and the adjacent rifted Coastal Plain. SESAME (Southeastern Suture of the Appalachian Margin Experiment; 2010-2014), an EarthScope Flexible Array, consisted of 85 stations that spanned Georgia, northern Florida, and parts of North Carolina and Tennessee. Stations were most densely spaced in southern Georgia across the hypothesized suture between Laurentia and the exotic Suwannee terrane, which is thought to have been part of Gondwana and to have collided with Laurentia in the late Paleozoic. The region experienced rifting in the Mesozoic, leading to the creation of the South Georgia Rift Basin.\nShear-wave splitting in SKS and SKKS phases indicates the presence of significant anisotropy in the mantle. Splitting times range from 0.4 s to 3.2 s, but are typically 1.0-1.5 s. SK(K)S splitting fast directions are dominated by an overall NE-SW trend, but significant fast direction differences occur between sub-regions of the array. At stations within the higher topography of the Blue Ridge terrane, fast directions are predominantly NE-ENE, and show little systematic variation with back-azimuth. At stations further to the southeast in the Inner Piedmont and Carolina terranes, fast directions are ENE-ESE. Closer to the Atlantic coast and in a sub-region that experienced significant rifting in the Mesozoic, a strong variation of fast direction with backazimuth is observed. Spatial overlap of paths with different fast directions indicates that the backazimuthal pattern reflects a rotation of azimuthal anisotropy with depth, rather than simple lateral variations.\nThe laterally-rapid spatial variations between these groups indicates that the SK(K)S waves are likely sampling differences in lithospheric anisotropy between adjacent terranes, superimposed on any asthenospheric anisotropy. We are in the process of modeling the splitting observed in each group with layered models of anisotropy, including dipping olivine a-axes, with the goal of relating the splitting patterns to past orogenic and rifting processes and present-day asthenospheric flow.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have investigated the distribution of C3 and C4 grasses along climatic gradients because they illustrate complex interactions between abiotic and biotic controls on ecosystem functions. Yet few studies have examined belowground components of these distributions, which may present very different patterns compared to aboveground measures. In this study, we surveyed grass species cover and collected soil and root samples from field plots at 100 - 150 m elevation intervals along a climatic gradient in Hawai‘i. We examined how the relationship between soil carbon isotopic composition (δ13C), a proxy for C4 productivity and dominance, and % C4 cover changed along a climatic gradient. Results showed that δ13C underpredicted C4 dominance in wetter sites. Indeed, the relationship between % C4 cover and soil δ13C became more negative with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) based on a linear mixed-effects model (F 1,34 = 12.25, P < 0.01). Soil δ13C in wetter sites indicated a larger C3 contribution than estimated by aboveground cover, which was in part due to C3 root biomass increasing (P < 0.05) whereas C4 root biomass did not change along the precipitation gradient. C3 and C4 grasses appear to allocate disproportionately belowground, thus a different understanding of C4 ecological dominance may emerge when considering both above and belowground components. Our results show that belowground allocation and interpretation of soil δ13C need to be more carefully considered in global vegetation and carbon models and paleoecological reconstructions of C4 dominance.",

            "abstract": "Long-range transport of ozone is of great concern, yet the source-receptor relationships derived previously depend strongly on the source attribution techniques used. Here we describe a new tagged ozone mechanism (full-tagged), the design of which seeks to take into account the combined effects of emissions of ozone precursors, CO, NOx and VOCs, from a particular source, while keeping the current state of chemical equilibrium unchanged. We label emissions from the target source (A) and background (B). When two species from A and B sources react with each other, half of the resulting products are labeled A, and half B. Thus the impact of a given source on downwind regions is recorded through tagged chemistry. We then incorporate this mechanism into the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART-4) to examine the impact of anthropogenic emissions within North America, Europe, East Asia and South Asia on ground-level ozone downwind of source regions during 1999-2000. We compare our results with two previously used methods -- the sensitivity and tagged-N approaches. The ozone attributed to a given source by the full-tagged method is more widely distributed spatially, but has weaker seasonal variability than that estimated by the other methods. On a seasonal basis, for most source/receptor pairs, the full-tagged method estimates the largest amount of tagged ozone, followed by the sensitivity and tagged-N methods. In terms of trans-Pacific influence of ozone pollution, the full-tagged method estimates the strongest impact of East Asian (EA) emissions on the western U.S. (WUS) in MAM and JJA (~3 ppbv), which is substantially different in magnitude and seasonality from tagged-N and sensitivity studies. This difference results from the full-tagged method accounting for the maintenance of peroxy radicals (e.g., CH3O2, CH3CO3, and HO2), in addition to NOy, as effective reservoirs of EA source impact across the Pacific, allowing for a significant contribution to ozone formation over WUS (particularly in summer). Thus, the full-tagged method, with its clear discrimination of source and background contributions on a per-reaction basis, provides unique insights into the critical role of VOCs (and additional reactive nitrogen species) in determining the nonlinear inter-continental influence of ozone pollution.",

Since mine closure plans require landscape reclamation, methods for fen construction are being investigated. As reclamation goals include the return of ecosystem function, criteria for evaluation must be developed. In this study we compare soil concentrations and spectrophometric properties of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from a constructed fen during its first growing season with that collected from three diverse, undisturbed reference fens in the region.\nThe constructed fen had lower DOC concentration than all the reference fens. Based on E2/E3, E4/E6 and specific UV absorbance of the DOC, the constructed fen had DOC with significantly greater humic content, aromatic nature, and larger molecular size than the reference fens. Results from laboratory DOC production studies indicate that these patterns are likely due to the limited DOC contribution from the newly planted vegetation at the constructed fen, resulting in DOC largely derived from humified peat placed during construction. These preliminary results suggest that DOC concentration and chemistry provide information about the ecological development of the constructed system that could be useful for evaluating reclamation success through time.",

However, it has been challenging for scientist to discover and access data due to variable data formats, non-digital data holdings, and transitioning data discovery portals. In 2014, NGDC made a concerted effort to identify, ingest, and archive all publicly available magnetic trackline data for access via a new Trackline Geophysical Data web-based interface. Non-digital data were digitized and added to the Global Geophysical Database and are now available for download in a common MGD77 format. All ancillary and analog data are accessible via the same interface, without having to navigate through multiple directories or prompts. The result is over 16.5 million miles of magnetic trackline data are now available, both through NGDC’s improved user interface and as a web service for incorporation into other portals. This allows the geoscience community unprecedented access to global geophysical magnetic trackline data from a secure long-term archive.\nThe addition of 6.5 million miles of magnetic trackline data to the database, since the previous release of the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid (EMAG2), will give NGDC the ability to improve the model coverage, especially in areas of low coverage, such as around the Eltanin Fracture Zone in the South Pacific. This poster will focus on some key data additions and how they will help us validate the accuracy of the ocean age model/directional gridding algorithm and improve the Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid going forward.",

The GEOSS Common Infrastructure (GCI) allows users to search, access, and use the resources contributed by the GEOSS members.\nThe GEO DAB (Discovery and Access Broker) is the GCI component in charge of interconnecting the heterogeneous data systems contributing to GEOSS. Client applications (i.e. the portals and apps) can connect to GEO DAB as a unique entry point to discover and access resources available through GCI, with no need to implement the many service protocols and models applied by the GEOSS data providers. The GEO DAB implements the brokering approach (Nativi et al., 2013) to build a flexible and scalable System of Systems.\nUser authentication/authorization functionality is becoming more and more important for GEOSS data providers and users. The Providers ask for information about who accessed their resources and, in some cases, want to limit the data download. The Users ask for a profiled interaction with the system based on their needs and expertise level. Besides, authentication and authorization is necessary for GEOSS to provide moderated social services – e.g. feedback messages, data “fit for use” comments, etc.\nIn keeping with the GEOSS principles of building on existing systems and lowering entry-barriers for users, an objective of the authentication/authorization development was to support existing and well-used users’ credentials (e.g. Google, Twitter, etc.).\nDue to the heterogeneity of technologies used by the different providers and applications, a broker-based approach for the authentication/authorization was introduced as a new functionality of GEO DAB. This new capability will be demonstrated at the next GEO XI Plenary (November 2014).\nThis work will be presented and discussed.\nRefenrences\nNativi, S.; Craglia, M.; Pearlman, J., \"Earth Science Infrastructures Interoperability: The Brokering Approach,\" Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, IEEE Journal of , vol.6, no.3, pp.1118,1129, June 2013",

            "abstract": "An accurate and spatially explicit estimation of ecosystem traits such as leaf area index and chlorophyll content is of fundamental importance for biogeochemical modeling. In this perspective remotely sensed spectral information has been shown to be a powerful tool for investigating ecosystem traits and their dynamics. Unluckily the availability of remote sensed hyperspectral data is still limited. On the other side hyperspectral imaging technology for near surface sensing has been recently quickly developing. Instruments are becoming much lighter allowing for being transported on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). UAV imagery is spatially limited but offers more flexibility compared to satellite based sensors allowing for specific and high-resolution scenes acquisition. In this context the use of spectral information for inverting radiative transfer models is a widespread approach to estimate biophysical parameters from earth observation data and its application to near surface sensing is offering new opportunities for spatial explicit estimates of ecosystem traits.\nIn the present study we apply an inverted radiation transfer model to two grassland sites with differing management regimes. The objective was to derive ecosystem traits and to provide insights on scaling effects by using multiple spectral measurements techniques addressing different spatial scales. The application is to link point to landscape scale estimates through a better understanding of the scaling effects.\nFor addressing this objective this we made use of a handheld field spectrometer and an UAV-borne imaging Fabry-Peroth interferometer for characterizing the sampling plots. The PROSAIL model parameters were then calibrated by using a Monte Carlo approach. We applied the same method using modis reflectances for the pixels surrounding the experimental plots. The accuracy and reliability of the estimated ecosystem traits with the different methods were then further compared to direct measurements. This allowed to assign uncertainties to the satellite based estimates.\nOur approach showed the importance of taking in account the spatial variability of ecosystem biophysical properties addressing scales ranging from plot to landscape.",

In this study, we compared model simulated cloud fraction (CF), liquid water path (LWP), and precipitation with the ground-based and satellite observations at the ARM SGP site from 2002 to 2008 in response of changing the relaxation times. Relaxation techniques are used in simulation to prevent large model error during the simulation. Study revealed that the simulated results agree with observations much better in temperature and q profiles in the 3-hr scale, while the 24-hr scale can produce precipitation and CF closer to the observations. That is, the short relaxation time scale tends to produce dryer atmosphere, which inhibits precipitations and clouds development. For precipitation rate, results of SCM under 24h (3h) are 2.24 (1.35) mm/day, respectively, compared with the ARM observation of 2.43 mm/day. For CF, we have reached the following conclusions: (1) the results of SCM 24h (3h) are 46% (39%)against an observation of 56%; (2) Simulations under 24h and 3h relaxation time can capture the seasonal trend reasonably well, but underestimate the CF, especially for high clouds. The diurnal cycles of simulated clouds tend to peak too early (6 am) compared to the observations (12 am). The mean cloud profiles around 850hPa are improved due to the improvement of PBL turbulence parameterizations. Strong bias occurs in the cloud frequency, simulations predict too much (little) occurrence of mid (high) clouds, and a notable peak in August that is not shown in the observations. For LWP, the simulation under 24h (3h) relaxation time result 157 (171) g/m2, respectively, the one at 24h closes to the ARM value 149 g/m2. The diurnal cycle of simulated LWP peaks later than observations. Results from this study can be used as guidance for the further development of the GISS Model.",

CELiS is a prototype instrument development by the Space Dynamics Laboratory to demonstrate a small, low power, eye-safe lidar system capable of monitoring PM fence-line concentration of fugitive dust from off-road vehicle activity as part of the SERDP (Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program) Measurement and Modeling of Fugitive Dust Emission from Off-Road Department of Defense Activities program.\nCELiS is small, lightweight and easily transportable for quick setup and measurement of PM concentration and emissions. The instrument is mounted on Moog Quickset pan and tilt positioner. Ground support equipment includes portable racks with laser power and cooler, power supplies, readout electronics and computer. The complete CELiS instrument weighs less than 300 lbs., is less than 1 cubic meters in volume and uses 700 W of 120V AC power. CELiS has a working range of better than 6km and a range resolution of 1.5m-6m.\nCELiS operates in a biaxial configuration at the 1.5μm eyesafe wavelength. The receiver is an off-axis parabolic (OAP) telescope, aft-optics and alignment assembly and InGaAs APD detector readout. The transmitter is a 20Hz PRF - 25mJ Quantel 1.574 μm laser with a 20x beam expander. Both the receiver and transmitter are mounted on a carbon fiber optical breadboard with a custom mounting solution to minimize misalignment due to thermal operating range (0-40 C) and pointing vectors.\nAny lidar system used to monitor fence-line PM emissions related to off-road training activities will be subject to a strict eye-safety requirement to protect both troops and wildlife. CELiS is eyesafe at the output aperture.\nCELiS has participated in two Dugway Proving Ground Lidar exercises performing within expectations. Retrieval of particulate matter concentration is presented in companion poster by K. Moore.",

            "abstract": "The thermodynamically-constrained fluxes of gases to and from a biosphere has profound, planet-wide consequences. These fluxes can directly control the redox state of the surface environment, the atmospheric composition, and the concentration of nutrients and metals in the oceans. Through these direct effects, they also create strong forcings on the climate, the redox state of the interior of the planet, and the detectability of the biosphere by remote observations. In this presentation, we will model chemosynthetic-based biospheres, and apply them to questions related to the habitability of Archean Earth. This will be accomplished by coupling together two models: one model codifies a thermodynamic energy balance concept for habitability (Hoehler, 2009); the other model predicts a planet’s atmospheric composition and climate while balancing the redox state of the surface environment (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014). The result of this coupling is the calculation of a self-consistent planetary surface environment, that treats the ecosystem as one system component that is coupled to atmospheric, oceanic, and subsurface system components. The model will predict the standing biomass size, net biological productivity, and resulting gas fluxes to and from a biosphere with a given set of volcanic and hydrothermal inputs to the planetary surface. This will also enable predictions of the secondary effects life has on its environment, including controls on climate and the long-term evolution of the redox state of the planet’s surface and near-surface. Finally, this will aid us in predicting the strength of biosignatures for remote observations and ultimately help us interpret spectra from extrasolar planets. In this presentation, we will review the energy balance concept for habitability, describe how that has been codified in our models, and give preliminary results from this coupling.",

            "abstract": "A fundamental goal of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) is to enable investigation of the role that small, short-term strain transients play in the release of accumulated stress along fault zones. The detection of slow earthquakes along the San Andreas in the 1990’s and the discovery of Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) events in Japan and Cascadia in the following years suggested that fault slip modes could span the temporal range from seismic to slow-deformation processes. Strainmeters provide the sensitivity required to detect short-term, nanostrain-level transients and so for this reason clusters of co-located strainmeters and seismometers were included in the PBO design. Arrays of strainmeters, each forming a mini fault observatory, were installed along the San Jacinto Fault, the creeping section of the central San Andreas, in the Eastern California Shear Zone, in two volcanic zones, Mt St Helens and Yellowstone and a regional scale network was built along the Cascadia Subduction Zone megathrust fault. Currently the network consists of 75 borehole and 6 long baseline strainmeters. Since the installation of the first strainmeter in 2005 the instruments have provided unprecedented temporal resolution of multiple creep events along the central section of the San Andreas, post-seismic transients in Anza and ETS events in Cascadia,\nUNAVCO generates Earthscope Level 2 data products for the strainmeters. These include models for the earth tides, barometric responses, long-term borehole trends plus areal and shear strain time-series. Processed time-series are updated automatically every 24 hours and a follow-up data set reviewed by a data engineer is released every 7 to 10 days. Site information, data quality assessment, strain plots and time-series data for all PBO strain instruments can be obtained from the UNAVCO strain and seismic web page (http://www.unavco.org/data). In this presentation we will highlight some of the strain transients these instruments have measured, outline the processing steps required to extract these subtle transient signals from the data, and describe the strainmeter data products available UNAVCO including newly implemented web services.",

            "abstract": "McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica, is characterized by two particular geophysical processes. (1) Marine ice accretion supplies most of the ice shelf material rather than meteoric ice from glacier outflow and snow-falls. (2) A brine layer infiltrates the ice shelf laterally up to 20-km inward. The infiltration mainly initiates at the ice-front from sea water percolation when the firn/snow transition is below sea-level. A better characterization of the McMurdo ice shelf could constrain our knowledges of these mechanisms and assess the stability of the region that hosts numerous human activities from the close McMurdo station (USA) and Scott base (New-Zealand). McMurdo ice shelf is also an analog for the Jovian icy moon Europa where brine pockets are supposed to reside in the ice crust and accretion to occur at the 10-30-km deep ice-ocean interface.\nThe University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) acquired two radar survey grids over the McMurdo Ice Shelf during southern summers 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 with the High Capability Radar Sounder (HiCARS) on-board a Basler DC-3 aircraft. HiCARS transmits a chirped signal at 60-MHz central frequency and 15-MHz bandwidth. The corresponding vertical resolution in ice is 5-10 m. An important design goal of the radar was to maintain sufficient dynamic range to correctly measure echo intensities.\nHere we present the brine infiltration extent and bathymetry derived from its dielectric horizon well distinguishable on the HiCARS radargram. We complement the ice-shelf characterization by classifying its surface thanks to the novel Radar Statistical Reconnaissance (RSR) methodology. The RSR observable is the statistical distribution of the surface echo amplitudes from successive areas defined along-track. The distributions are best-fitted with a theoretical stochastic envelop parameterized with the signal reflectance and scattering. Once those two components are deduced from the fit, they are used in a backscattering model to invert surface properties such as roughness, density, and/or impurity load. This combined analysis gives new insights into the superficial processes and exchanges at the McMurdo ice shelf.",

            "abstract": "The Apollo 17 mass spectrometer, LACE, first measured mass 40 particles in the lunar atmosphere, and over a nine-month period, detected variations correlated with the lunar day (Hoffman et al., 1973, LPSC, 4, 2865). LACE detected a high particle density at dusk (0.6-1.0x104 cm-3), decreasing through the lunar night to a few hundred cm-3, then increasing rapidly before dawn to levels 2-4 times greater than at dusk. No daytime measurements were made due to instrument saturation. Given the LACE measurements’ periodic nature, and the Ar abundance in lunar regolith samples (Kaiser, 1972, EPSL, 13, 387), it was concluded that mass 40 was likely due to Ar. Benna et al. (2014, LPSC, 45, 1535) recently reported that the Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS) aboard LADEE also detected Ar (mass 40) with similar diurnal profiles.\nWe report on UV spectra of the lunar atmosphere as obtained by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Aboard LRO is the UV-spectrograph, LAMP (Lyman Alpha Mapping Project), spanning the spectral range 575 to 1965 Å. LAMP is typically oriented toward the surface and has been mapping the Moon since September 2009. LAMP also observes the tenuous lunar atmosphere when the surface is in darkness, but the atmospheric column below LRO is illuminated. We have previously used nadir oriented twilight observations to examine the sparse lunar atmosphere (Feldman et al., 2012, Icarus, 221, 854; Cook et al., 2013, Icarus, 225, 681; Stern et al., 2013, Icarus, 226, 1210; Cook & Stern 2014, Icarus, 236, 48). In Cook et al., 2013, we reported an upper limit for Ar of 2.3x104 cm-3. Since then, we have collected additional data and refined our search method by focusing on the regions (near equator) and local times (dawn and dusk) where Ar has been reported previously. We have carefully considered effective area calibration and g-factor accuracies and find these to be unlikely explanations for the order of magnitude differences. We will report new results, which provide much lower density upper limits than any previous detection and continue to explore other potential sources of uncertainty in these results.",

            "abstract": "The GRACE satellites, launched in 2002, have provided data for more than 130 monthly gravity models in its 11 years of operation. Comparison of the models mainly shows the changes in continental water and snow storage.\nCNES/GRGS has recomputed its solutions providing now updated Release 3 (RL03-v1) gravity solutions in terms of spherical harmonics up to degree/order 80. They are based on GRACE GPS and KBR data, as well as on LAGEOS-1/2 SLR data mainly to solve degrees 1 and 2 more accurately. Compared to the previous Release 2, it is now based on reprocessed Level-1B.v2 data, and it includes several improvements regarding dealiasing a priori models such as the FES2012 ocean tide model, ECMWF ERA-interim (atmosphere) and TUGO (non IB-ocean) models every 3 hours. The orbit parameterization with respect to KBR and accelerometer data has been modified with the goal to better constrain the dynamics. Finally, the inversion procedure is now done by Eigen values decomposition, which allows - by truncation of negligible Eigen values - a direct interpretation of the gravity solutions without the need for additional filtering.\nThis RL03, completed to Summer 2014, can be easily compared to project groups RL05 solutions thanks to the newly developed “Grace Plotter” tool (www.thegraceplotter.com).",

            "abstract": "The Himalayas and the adjacent Tibetan Plateau represent the largest region of elevated topography and anomalously thick crust on Earth. Understanding the formation and evolution of the region has been the focus of many tectonic and numerical models. While some of these models (i.e. thin sheet model) have successfully illustrated some of the basic physics of continental collision, none can simultaneously represent active processes such as subduction, underthrusting, channel flow or extrusion, for which fully 3D models are required.\nHere, we employed the 3D code LaMEM to investigate the role that subduction, continental collision and indentation play on lithosphere dynamics at convergent margins, and the implications they have for the Asian tectonics. Our model setup resembles a simplified tectonic map of the India-Asia collision zone and we performed a large number of 3D simulations to analyse the dynamics and the conditions under which large topographic plateaus, such as the Tibetan Plateau can form in an integrated lithospheric and upper-mantle scale model.\nResults of models with linear viscous rheologies show different modes between the oceanic subduction side (continuous subduction, trench retreat and slab roll-back) and the continental collision side (trench advance, slab detachment, topographic uplift and lateral extrusion of material). Despite the complex dynamics and the great variation in slab shape across the subduction-collision zone, which are consistent with tomographic observations, we note that slab-pull alone is insufficient to generate high topography in the upper plate.\nSeveral studies suggested that external forces (i.e. ridge push, plume push or slab suction) must be important in order to sustain the on-going convergence of India towards Eurasia. We show that external forcing and the presence of strong blocks such as the Tarim Basin within the Asian lithosphere are necessary to create and shape anomalously high topographic fronts and plateaus, analogous to the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.\nNext, we present a few models with more complex (power-law viscous and plastic) rheologies and compare them with linear viscous models.\nFunding was provided by the ERC under the European Community’s Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) / ERC Grant agreement #258830.",

In the Atlantic basin, dry air may be associated with the Saharan Air Layer or mid-latitude frontal systems. The interannual variability of the frequency of the middle and upper level dry air layer and its impacts on tropical cyclone activity over the Atlantic are examined in this study. EOF analysis revealed dominant modes of interannual variability of dry air layer frequency over the tropical north Atlantic, with strong variations over the western and central Atlantic between 15-30N. In the negative phase of the modes, tropical cyclone activity is increased over the Atlantic basin, especially over the Main Development Region. In the positive phase, tropical cyclones form less frequently and the storm tracks shift westward. The leading modes show relatively weak correlation to the AMM and NAO, but the EOF modes do indicate a relationship to the large scale circulation through an analysis of deep layer shear shear and the subtropical high. The steering flow from the modulation of the subtropical high and the values of vertical wind shear are consistent with the distribution of TC activity in some areas, but the impacts of the dry air patterns are required to fully explain the TC activity.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience programs that focus on long-term waste management in the geosphere commonly aim to develop a conceptual model that explains porewater residence time and the mechanisms and time scales for solute transport. Diffusion is the dominant transport process in low-permeability rocks so measurement of rock diffusion properties is important, but measurements at the laboratory scale can be highly variable due to changes in lithology, porosity, confining pressure and pore-fluid composition at scales of cm to 10’s of m. The natural analogue approach, using tracers such as Cl, Br, 18O and 2H that commonly display conservative behaviour, provides a means to scale up the results of laboratory measurements to understand the larger-scale controls on porewater residence time and solute transport. The principal challenge in applying this approach is the difficulty of obtaining high-quality tracer concentration data from porewater in low-permeability rocks. Additional insight into solute transport and reaction processes could be gained by collecting data for the concentrations of major cations but these data are even more difficult to obtain. Using data from the geoscience site characterization for the Ontario Power Generation proposed Deep Geologic Repository at the Bruce site in southwest Ontario, this presentation will illustrate some of the problems with standard methods for obtaining porewater compositional data . Methods such as core squeezing and advective displacement simply do not work because the permeability and the water content are too low. The crush-leach method has been used but is susceptible to artifacts from dissolution of soluble minerals (halite, anhydrite, gypsum and celestite), ion exchange and difficulty in assigning a porosity value to specific solutes. In order to overcome these limitations and improve the outcome from the natural analogue approach, a new method has been developed that extracts porewater directly into hydrophyllic cellulosic paper by placing it in direct contact with the rock. Results will be presented to demonstrate that this method has potential to provide high-quality data for major cations, anions and porewater isotope systems (18O, 2H, 87Sr/86Sr) of interest, thereby extending the use of the natural analogue technique to a greater range of solute tracers.",

            "abstract": "The Peruvian flat slab is the largest region of flat slab subduction in the world today and therefore represents an excellent location to study the dynamics and evolution of shallow subduction. We aim to provide insight on current open questions on the topic such as what is the response of the mantle to flat slabs? What is the degree of coupling between a flat slab and the upper plate? What role does slab buoyancy and the subduction of thickened oceanic crust play, such as for the Nazca Ridge? We address these questions by investigating seismic anisotropy across the region using stations belonging to PULSE (PerU Lithosphere and Slab Experiment). We analyze shear wave splitting using a variety of different phases (e.g. local S, SKS, sSKS, and PKS), and also investigate anisotropy observed from the transverse component of receiver functions. We find that mantle flow is modified by flat subduction both below and above the slab. Laterally and along strike there are also sharp boundaries in the anisotropic structure, revealed in both the local S and *KS splitting, that correlate with the present day location of the Nazca Ridge. We infer that the thin mantle layer above the flat slab has been primarily deformed by the southwards migration of the Nazca Ridge across the flat slab region, with trench-parallel deformation trailing the ridge and heterogenous deformation directly in front of it. This supra-slab mantle heterogeneity to the south of the ridge appears to result in a large region of null *KS splitting despite indications that the sub-slab mantle below is anisotropic. Our results are consistent with trench normal flow in the mantle beneath the flat slab and that the slab dip exerts a control on the orientation of mantle flow. ",

The direction finding of a two-axis magnetic sensor provides the azimuth of NBEs relative to the measurement station, and the temporal information contained in the reflected waves of NBEs in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide provides constraints on the range and height (by adopting the typical value for the height of ionosphere at daytime/nighttime); the curvature of Earth is taken into account with some empirical relationship derived from the numerical simulation. We applied the method to the LF data recorded on three days during the summer season of 2013, and the results are evaluated by comparing with the radar observation of thunderstorms. The new data recorded in summer of 2014 will also be examined by comparing the location result with that derived from a long-baseline network of LF magnetic sensors using the time-of-arrival technique.",

            "abstract": "We investigate how river long profiles and their knickzones and knickpoints interact with uplift (i.e. base level fall) rate and lithology. These results highlight lithogenic controls on knickpoint evolution. First, based on dated and regionally correlated incision markers from West Africa, we reconstructed the entire paleo-long profiles of big rivers such as the Niger at ca. 24, 11 and 6 Ma, as well as the Eocene topography those rivers have dissected. Though spatially and temporally variable, incision remained mostly below 10 m/my with a mean around 5 m/my. The spatial stability of both the river outlets and divides imposed maintenance or increasing concavity of the river long profiles through time, resulting from spatially contrasted adjustment of river segments bounded by recurrent lithogenic knickzones that persisted since 24 Ma. Drainages evolved preferentially by very slow slope decrease or uniform incision in between the stationary knickzones of evolving amplitude, with apparently no relation to base level change. Therefore, knickzone height or position may not simply reflect the transient response of big rivers to base level fall as predicted by stream-power incision river models. Second, we study river profiles experimentally on an 80 cm-long and 2 cm-wide flume filled with a ‘bedrock’ cohesive paste made of silica flour mixed with water and kaolinite. Water is introduced from one extremity at a constant discharge to erode the bedrock. Uplift rate is controlled by a sliding gate at the outlet of the flume while the properties of the bedrock evolve by changing the percentage of kaolinite. During the experiment, knickpoints cyclically migrate upstream. At the foot of the knickpoint face, bedrock is over-eroded to form a plunging pool. The eroded kaolinite is washed away while the silica is rapidly deposited downstream to form a sediment layer whose slope adjusts to the flow regime. A new knickpoint will not be created until the stream removes this layer and carves into the bedrock, providing a nice example of self-organization along the profile. The rate of knickpoint retreat is rather constant with increasing uplift rate and diminishes with increasing bedrock strength. Rather than increasing knickpoint velocity, the profile adapts to increasing uplift rate by increasing the rate of knickpoint creation.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing of airglow emission provides a powerful approach to the measurement of composition, temperature and winds in the thermosphere, on short and long time scales, including the responses to magnetic storms. Of the available emissions, one that has not been exploited to its full potential is the O+ (2P-2D) pair of doublets at 732.0 and 733.0 nm wavelength. This presentation is of recently analyzed results from WINDII, the Wind Imaging Interferometer on NASA’s Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, launched in 1991. WINDII is a Doppler Michelson interferometer with the capacity to measure airglow emission rates, Doppler temperatures from line widths and winds from Doppler shifts. One of the filters used to select specific airglow emissions was intended for measurement of the P1(2) line of the (8,3) Meinel band of OH at 731.63 nm but it also transmitted the O+ lines of interest. These have recently been retrieved from the data and are the basis of this presentation. The O+ emission is produced in the daytime, primarily from the photo-ionization of atomic oxygen and so knowing the solar flux the concentration of atomic oxygen can be determined. As a first step the variation of the emission rate on solar flux, solar zenith angle and conjugate photoelectron flux has been investigated, and preliminary results on atomic oxygen concentration are presented. In addition, ion winds can be determined from the Doppler shifts of the emission, which may be compared with the neutral winds obtained with WINDII from the atomic oxygen O(1S) and O(1D) emissions at 557.7 nm and 630.0 nm respectively. This possibility will allow the study of the interactions between the thermosphere and ionosphere for a wide range of conditions.\n ",

We apply a multiple point source inversion method based on waveform modeling of both direct P and SH waves and near-surface reflected pP and sSH waves. The method is used to study source processes of 29 deep-focus earthquakes from 1994 to 2013, with Mw > 7.0 and depth > 400 km.\n26 of 29 deep-focus earthquakes can be modeled by our method reasonably well, using one to six point sources. The results are summarized as follow:\n(1) The 2013 Mw 8.3 Okhotsk and 1994 Mw 8.2 Bolivia earthquakes, the two largest ever-recorded earthquakes, have off-plane source distributions. The two earthquakes consist of several subevents distributed off a particular plane.\n(2) 16 of these earthquakes have subevents which could be distributed in a plane but with different fault plane orientations that are inconsistent with a rupture plane. Most of the variations of fault plane orientation are about 20˚, but some are up to 45˚.\n(3) A relatively uniform propagating velocity cannot be found for each earthquake. The subevents are randomly distributed in space and time. A triggering mechanism may be required to interpret the feature. The fast and slow triggering is uncorrelated with the cold and hot subduction slab.\n(4) Most of these deep-focus consists of normal faults, however, thrust faults exist in two regions, north Tonga-Kermadec Slab and the junction of Japan slab and Mariana slab.\nWe suggest that these deep-focus earthquakes have their subevents occurring in a pre-existing weak zone and, triggering each other.",

            "abstract": "La Gloria Pluton (LGP) is a 10 Ma shallow elongated NNW reservoir of 17 km length and 4-6 km width as part of a NS trend of Miocene plutons in Central Chile. New LA-ICPMS U-Pb ages in zircons of La Gloria Pluton indicate that crystallization occurs mostly within an interval between 11.2 to 10 Ma, with southeastward decreasing ages. Zircon crystallization ages are consistently older at the boundaries of the pluton than at the center for a given cross-section. At regional scale the ages of LGP follows a plutonic trend of southward decreasing age: Estero Yerba Loca (10 Ma) and San Francisco Batholith (SFB), in the north; and Cerro Mesón Alto (12.5 Ma) and San Gabriel (SG; 13 Ma), in the south. Both regional and local (within-LGP) age trends suggest: 1) a progressive northward migration of the main deep magmatic source during the Miocene; and 2) a southeastward lateral propagation of the magma during the reservoir construction. The lateral propagation of the magma is also supported by subhorizontal mineral and magnetic lineations with a preferred NNW orientation within LGP.\nThe within-pluton age distribution and internal configuration suggest incremental construction with horizontal propagation of magma within channels. Because the lateral migration of the magma play an important role on the thermal structure of the cooling pluton we perform numerical simulations that account for reheating caused by refilling along the axial core of the pluton . We speculate that pre-existing shallow crustal structures (faults and folds) would allow lateral magma canalization, particularly between the lower highly deformed volcanic Abanico Fm. and the less deformed overlaying volcanic Farellones Fm. The pluton distribution and internal organization in and around LGP suggest incremental construction with vertical and horizontal migration of magma within channels and reservoirs, yielding plutonic complexes with protracted ages and elongated geometries.",

            "abstract": "It is important to understand the fate and transport of contaminants in limestone aquifers because they are a major drinking water resource. This is challenging because they are highly heterogeneous; with micro-porous grains, flint inclusions, and being heavily fractured. Several modeling approaches have been developed to describe contaminant transport in fractured media, such as the discrete fracture (with various fracture geometries), equivalent porous media (with and without anisotropy), and dual porosity models. However, these modeling concepts are not well tested for limestone geologies. Given available field data and model purpose, this paper therefore aims to develop, examine and compare modeling approaches for transport of contaminants in fractured limestone aquifers.\nThe model comparison was conducted for a contaminated site in Denmark, where a plume of a dissolved contaminant (PCE) has migrated through a fractured limestone aquifer. Multilevel monitoring wells have been installed at the site and available data includes information on spill history, extent of contamination, geology and hydrogeology. To describe the geology and fracture network, data from borehole logs was combined with an analysis of heterogeneities and fractures from a nearby excavation (analog site). Methods for translating the geological information and fracture mapping into each of the model concepts were examined. Each model was compared with available field data, considering both model fit and measures of model suitability. An analysis of model parameter identifiability and sensitivity is presented.\nResults show that there is considerable difference between modeling approaches, and that it is important to identify the right one for the actual scale and model purpose. A challenge in the use of field data is the determination of relevant hydraulic properties and interpretation of aqueous and solid phase contaminant concentration sampling data. Traditional water sampling has a bias towards fracture sampling, however concentrations in the limestone matrix are needed for assessing contaminant rebound. The comparison with data showed how much information is required to discriminate between models, and recommendations on how to identify the best modeling approach are presented.",

An accurate quantitative understanding of the sources, sinks, and chemical transformation of bromine species is thus important to understand the bromine budget in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), which also serves as a gate to the stratosphere. Vertical transport of very short-lived organic bromine precursors, such as CHBr3, CH2Br2 and inorganic product gases has been identified as the main source of bromine in the UTLS. However, the contribution of inorganic vs. organic compounds is not well quantified, particularly in the tropical UTLS. A number of chemical processes, including the role of ice particles for the transformation and cycling of inorganic bromine species are also poorly understood.\nA limb scanning Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy Instrument was deployed on-board NASA’s unmanned high-altitude Global Hawk aircraft during the 2011, 2013, and 2014 NASA Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX). Flights in the eastern and western Pacific were performed to study, among other topics, the chemistry of bromine and ozone in the subtropical and tropical UTLS. Here we will present observations of BrO, NO2 and other trace species made by this instrument at altitudes between 15 – 20 km. The measurement methodology as well as the procedure to retrieve vertical trace gas concentration profiles will be briefly presented.

            "abstract": "In recent decades it has become clear how vulnerable developing and developed regions are to drought. This seems to continue and can worsen when considering possible impacts of climate change. For many regions it is well established what the possible impact is, however mostly at a large spatial scale and with a high level of uncertainty. This study tries to reduce this uncertainty and uses projections at a small spatial scale (~25 km). The main purpose is twofold: to identify new methods to assess the impacts of climate change on drought and to apply these methods to a case study: the Meuse basin in France and Belgium. Drought is assessed by applying the Standardized Precipitation Index at different temporal scales (1, 3, 6 and 12 months) related to different types of droughts; meteorological, agricultural, hydrological and extreme long-lasting events respectively. The assessment is based on the output of 13 high resolution Regional Climate Model (RCM) runs driven by five different Global Climate Models using SRES A1B as emission scenario.\nResults show that in general RCMs have difficulties in simulating drought indicators and tend to simulate a more temporally variable climate than observed. For each drought indicator a weighted average is calculated based on the error of each RCM run. Based on this weighted average it was found that for most temporal scales there will be a significant increase in the number of drought events (between +7% and +44%). For meteorological drought, it was found that the average duration increases (11%), the average deficit increases (40%) and the average intensity increases (28%). For agricultural drought, the average duration increases (14%), the average deficit increases (50%) and the average intensity increases (40%). For hydrological drought, the average duration does not increase significantly (less than 10%), the average deficit increases (34%) and the average intensity increases (27%). For extreme hydrological drought events, the average duration increases (12%), the average deficit increases (40%) and the average intensity increases (22%). For all temporal scales, changes in the variability of drought duration, deficit and intensity are larger than changes in average values. The different drought types will affect a larger area in the future compared to the historical period.",

Regulations designed to address these impairments can be costly, raising questions about the value of the public benefits that would result from additional investments in improving surface water quality. Benefit studies often rely on costly surveys or other detailed data collection, limiting the ability to apply nonmarket valuation methods to address policy needs. We assessed the recreational value of changes in water quality using freely-available geotagged photographs as a proxy for recreational visits to lakes. We find that improved water clarity is associated with greater lake photo-visitation and that lake users are willing to travel further to visit clearer lakes. We estimate a one-meter increase in lake clarity in Minnesota and Iowa lakes is associated with $22 in increased willingness-to-pay per trip and generates 1,400 additional annual visits per lake, holding all other lake attributes constant.

            "abstract": "Predictions of future climate depend strongly on trends in net uptake or release of carbon by the land biosphere. However, model estimates of the strength of the net global land sink during the Industrial Era vary widely. Here we evaluate results from an ensemble of uncoupled models taken from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP) and forced by the same input fields. When compared to estimates inferred from atmospheric CO2 observations (i.e., fossil fuel emission + net land use change - atmospheric increase - ocean uptake), MsTMIP models estimate, on average, a stronger global net land uptake of carbon (e.g., -0.3 to 8.7 Pg C/yr from 2000 to 2010, where a negative flux represents a net release to the atmosphere). Some models consistently show the land surface as a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, which is inconsistent with the other terms in the global anthropogenic CO2 budget. In addition, regional differences in land carbon exchange are compared across models and to estimates derived from atmospheric inversions and inventory based approaches. Using the semi-factorial simulations of the MsTMIP activity, we examine how model estimates of the cumulative global net land sink diverge over the period 1900 to 2010, and the degree to which model sensitivity to forcing factors contribute to this divergence. We link differences in estimates of the cumulative land sink back to each model’s sensitivity to climate variability, CO2 fertilization, nitrogen limitation, and net land-use change. Throughout the 110-year time period, the strength of carbon uptake in most models appears to be strongly sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations (CO2 fertilization effect). The strength of this relationship, however, varies across models depending on model structure (e.g., stronger CO2 fertilization effect in models without an interactive nitrogen cycle with N limitations) and across decades (e.g., strong sensitivity of net flux to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations after 1970s).\nhttp://nacp.ornl.gov/MsTMIP.shtml\nHuntzinger et al.

            "abstract": "High mountain lakes of the Sierra Nevada are excellent indicators of anthropogenic global change due to their limited capacity to buffer acid deposition, their sensitivity to changes in snowpack dynamics and their oligotrophic nutrient status. In this presentation, we examine long-term records of hydrochemistry and biological monitoring at the Emerald Lake watershed to assess whether high elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada are changing in response to climate change or changes in atmospheric deposition of nutrients and acid. To provide a broader context for these changes, we augment these long-term records with results from paleolimnological analysis that examines changes in nutrient status and acid buffering capacity of Sierra Nevada lakes over the past two millennia. Our research suggests that, although atmospheric deposition is the dominant driver of twentieth century ANC trends, aquatic communities in the Sierra Nevada are responding to combined effects from acidification, climate change, and eutrophication. Early in the twentieth century the primary stressor effecting Sierra Nevada lakes was acid deposition driven by SO2 emissions. As the century and industrialization progressed, NOx levels increased adding a eutrophication stressor while simultaneously contributing to acidification. Effects were further complicated by a warming climate in the late twentieth century, as warmer temperatures may have contributed to the recovery of ANC in lakes via increased weathering rates, while simultaneously enhancing eutrophication effects.",

            "abstract": "Forecasting rainfall in areas with sparse monitoring efforts is critical to making inferences about the health of ecosystems and built environments. Recent advances in scientific computing have allowed forecasting and climate models to increase their spatial and temporal resolution. Combined with observed point precipitation from monitoring stations, these models can be used to inform dynamic spatial statistical models for precipitation using methods from geostatistics and machine learning.\nTo prove the feasibility, process, and capabilities of these statistical models, we present a case study of two statistical models of precipitation for the Amazon River basin from 2003-2010 that can infer a spatial process at a point using areal data from numerical model output. We investigate the seasonality and accumulation of rainfall, and the occurrence of no-rainfall and large-rainfall events. These parameters are used since they provide valuable information on possible model biases when using climate models for forecasts of the future process of precipitation in the Amazon basin. This information can be vital for ecosystem, agriculture, and water-resource management.\nWe use observed precipitation data from weather stations, three areal datasets derived from observed precipitation (CFSR, CMORPH-CRT, GPCC) and three climate model precipitation datasets from CMIP5 (MIROC4h, HadGEM2-CC, and GISS-E2H) to construct the models. The observational data in the model domain is sparse, with 195 stations in the approximate 7×106 square kilometers of the Amazon basin, and therefore requires the areal data to create a more robust model.\nThe first model uses the method of Bayesian melding to combine and make inferences from the included data sets, and the second uses a regression model with spatially and temporally-varying coefficients. The models of precipitation are fitted using the areal products and a subset of the point data, while another subset of point data is held out for verification. The statistical models are evaluated based on the predictive performance using metrics such as mean absolute errors and coverage of predictive intervals. Precipitation estimates from the climate models are also evaluated on the basis of their performance in analyzing the accumulation, seasonality, and occurrence of rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Forests might actively transport atmospheric moisture from the oceans, according to the biotic pump of atmospheric moisture (BiPAM) hypothesis. The BiPAM hypothesis appears to be supported by the fact that precipitation drops exponentially with distance from ocean along non-forested land transects, but not on their forested counterparts. Yet researchers have discussed the difficulty in defining proper transects for BiPAM studies. Previous studies calculate precipitation gradients either along linear transects maximizing distance to the ocean, or along polylines following specific atmospheric pathways (e.g., aerial rivers). In this study we analyzed precipitation gradients along curvilinear streamlines of wind in tropical South America. Wind streamlines were computed using long-term quarterly averages of meridional and zonal wind components from the ERA-Interim and NCEP/NCAR reanalyses. Total precipitation along streamlines was obtained from four data sources: TRMM, UDEL, ERA-Interim, and NCEP/NCAR. Precipitation on land versus distance from the ocean was analyzed along selected streamlines for each data source. As predicted by BiPAM, precipitation gradients did not decrease exponentially along streamlines in the vicinity of the Amazon forest, but dropped rapidly as distance from the forest increased. Remarkably, precipitation along streamlines in some areas outside the Amazon forest did not decrease exponentially either. This was possibly owing to convergence of moisture conveyed by low level jets (LLJs) in those areas (e.g., streamlines driven by the Caribbean and CHOCO jets on the Pacific coast of Colombia). Significantly, BiPAM held true even along long transects displaying strong sinuosity. In fact, the general conclusions of previous studies remain valid. Yet effects of LLJs on precipitation gradients need to be thoroughly considered in future BiPAM studies.",

            "abstract": "The total surface area of rivers and streams is a key quantity for estimating gaseous emissions from fluvial networks to the atmosphere. Presently, the most sophisticated evaluations of continental-scale river surface area rely on: 1) calculating river width from digital elevation models (DEMs) by scaling width to upstream drainage area via downstream hydraulic geometry (DHG) relationships; 2) extrapolating river width and length from large to small river basins using Horton ratios; and 3) extrapolating empirical relationships between climate and percentage water cover to from low- to high-latitude basins where hydrologically conditioned topographic data does not exist. Here we use the recently developed North American River Width (NARWidth) dataset to estimate the total surface area of North American rivers and streams. NARWidth is the first fine-resolution, continental-scale river centerline and width database. The database is derived from Landsat satellite imagery and contains measurements of >2.4×105 km of rivers wider than 30 m at mean annual discharge. We find that datasets that estimate river width by applying DHG relationships to DEMs underestimate the abundance of wide rivers and do not capture the widest rivers observed by NARWidth. We attribute these differences to: 1) the tendency of stream gauges to be located at stable, single channel sites, leading to a potential bias of measured river width relative to the representative river width throughout a river’s entire length; and 2) physiographic conditions that are not captured by DHG and can cause substantial deviation from strict width-discharge relationships. We then calculate the total surface area of North American rivers by extrapolating the strong observed relationship between total river surface area and width at different widths (r2>0.996 for 100-2000 m widths) to narrow rivers and streams. We find that the total surface area of North American rivers is ~1.38×105 km2 for all rivers wider than 1 m and ~2.30×105 km2 for all rivers wider than 0.1 m, values ~32-121% greater than the most robust previous estimate used to evaluate greenhouse gas efflux from rivers. Our estimation of North American river surface area indicates that present evaluations of gaseous emissions from rivers to the atmosphere should likely be revised upwards.",

            "abstract": "Relatively direct constraints on the pattern of mantle deformation can be obtained from observations of seismic anisotropy. An understanding of the geometry of mantle flow in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle is particularly important for our understanding of whole mantle dynamics, as the transition zone represents an important internal boundary layer in the mantle. While much of the lower mantle is thought to be isotropic, several recent studies have found evidence for anisotropy in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle. Here we use the source-side shear wave splitting technique to investigate anisotropy at mid-mantle depths (transition zone and uppermost lower mantle) in the Tonga-Kermadec, Sumatra, New Britain, New Hebrides, and Philippines subduction zones. We measure splitting of direct teleseismic S phases originating from deep events (>350km) that have been corrected for the effect of upper mantle anisotropy beneath the seismic stations. We find evidence for considerable anisotropy at mid-mantle depths in all subduction systems studies, with delay times ranging up to ~3 sec and average delay times of ~1-1.5 sec. Several individual measurements on phases originating at depths greater than 600 km exhibit delay times greater than 1 sec, suggesting a significant contribution from anisotropy in the uppermost lower mantle. We document significant variability in the dominant fast directions both within and among individual subduction systems, with a mix of directions that are parallel, perpendicular, or oblique to the slab strike. This variability suggests differences in the deformation geometry among different subduction systems. As further constraints on the elasticity and deformation of mid-mantle minerals become available, our data set can be used to constrain mid-mantle flow patterns associated with subduction.",

            "abstract": "The structural, magmatic and metamorphic characteristics of Archean greenstone belts and associated TTG (tonalite, trondhjemite and granodiorite) gneisses in southern West Greenland are comparable to those of Phanerozoic convergent plate margins, suggesting that Archean continents grew mainly at subduction zones. These greenstone belts are composed mainly of tectonically juxtaposed fragments of oceanic crust including mafic to ultramafic rocks, with minor sedimentary rocks. Volcanic rocks in the greenstone belts are characterized mainly by island arc tholeiitic basalts, picrites, and boninites. The style of deformation and geometry of folds in 10 cm to 5 m wide shear zones are comparable to those occur on 1 to 50 km scale in the greenstone belts and TTG gneisses, suggesting that compressional tectonic processes operating at convergent plate boundaries were the driving force of Archean crustal accretion and growth. Field observations and trace element data suggest that Archean continental crust grew through accretion of mainly island arcs and melting of metamorphosed mafic rocks (amphibolites) in thickened arcs during multiple tectonothermal events. Fold patterns on cm to km scale are consistent with at least three phases of deformation and multiple melting events generating TTG melts that intruded mainly along shear zones in accretionary prism and magmatic arcs. It is suggested that Archean TTGs were produced by three main processes: (1) melting of thickened oceanic island arcs; (2) melting of subducted oceanic crust; and (3) differentiation of basaltic melts originating from metasomatized sub-arc mantle wedge peridotites.",

            "abstract": "The Cache La Poudre (CLP) watershed in Northern Colorado was impacted by the High Park fire, which burned from June 9th through July 1st of 2012. The CLP watershed serves as a source of drinking water for three water districts in Northern Colorado, including the City of Fort Collins. Sampling was conducted during four different storm events immediately after the fire was extinguished. The sampling was expanded through spring and summer 2013 in order to capture the flush of debris from the wildfire into the CLP River. Samples were also collected from an unburned control site for comparison. Surface water samples were analyzed for parameters including nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) characterization. In addition, bench scale treatment analyses were conducted to better understand the impacts of the wildfire on treatment processes for drinking water utilities. Lastly, leaching of stream bank sediments was conducted to determine the potential longer term inputs of burned material to the stream water. The overarching goals of the sampling campaign were to: 1) Evaluate the impact that wildfires have on the properties of DOM, specifically with respect to DBP formation and speciation (TTHM, HAA5, HAN, NDMA); 2) Establish the condition under which the source water could be effectively treated (using coagulation) to remove DBP precursors; 3) Evaluate the use of fluorescence spectroscopy as a surrogate for the concentration and reactivity of DOM in the CLP watershed; and 4) Assess the quantity and quality of DOM leached from streambed sediments. Preliminary results showed elevated DOC levels during the storm events and at wildfire impacted sites compared to the unburned site following the fire. DBP yields were higher for the four storm events following the fire when compared to yields for the control site located upstream of the burn area, and also when compared to data from a previous DBP study conducted on similar Colorado source waters in 2010. Fluorescence spectroscopy shows promise as a tool for discerning differences in DOM quality between burned and unburned areas of the CLP watershed. Ultimately, the results of this study will offer insight for recovering this watershed as a sustainable water source and will prepare utilities for future wildfires.",

            "abstract": "A community’s ability to effectively respond to and recover from natural hazards depends on both the physical characteristics of the hazard and the community’s inherent resilience. Resilience is shaped by a number of factors including the residents’ perception of and preparedness for a natural hazard as well as the level of institutional preparedness. This study examines perception of and preparedness for lahar hazards from Mount Baker and Glacier Peak in Washington’s Skagit Valley. Through an online survey, this study isolates the influence of specific variables (e.g., knowledge, past experience, scientific background, trust in various information sources, occupation, self-efficacy, sense of community) on risk perception and explores reasons behind the frequent disconnect between perception and preparedness. We anticipate that individuals with more extensive education in the sciences, especially geology or earth science, foster greater trust in scientists and a more accurate knowledge, understanding, and perception of the volcanic hazards in their community. Additionally, little research exists examining the extent to which first responders and leaders in response-related institutions prepare on a personal level. Since these individuals work toward community preparedness professionally, we hypothesize that they will be more prepared at home than members of the general public. Finally, the Skagit Valley has a significant history of flooding. We expect that the need to respond to and recover from frequent flooding creates a community with an inherently higher level of preparedness for other hazards such as lahars. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of what controls risk perception and the interplay between perception and preparedness. At a broader level, this study provides local and state-level emergency managers information to evaluate and improve response capabilities and communication with the public and key institutions in order to more effectively protect communities during future crises.",

            "abstract": "Exposure to water waves in lakes is an important control on the structure and distribution of both submerged and shoreline vegetative communities. Wave exposure incident on the shoreline limits the distribution of shrubs on both lake and coastal margins by preventing establishment of seedlings via bed disturbance and uprooting. The goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between bed stress due to wave action and the spatial distribution of woody seedling establishment in Catahoula Lake, Louisiana, USA. The lake bed consists of a broad, seasonally inundated flat bordered by a band of woody shrubs. Annual summer de-watering of the lake allows the lake bed to support a moist-soil herbaceous vegetation community, but recent encroachment by woody shrubs over the past ~70 years threatens ecosystem conversion. We use the University of Miami Wave Model (UMWM) to simulate surface wave evolution and bed shear stress for a range of dominant wind conditions and water levels. UMWM is a 3rdgeneration ocean wave model that solves the wave energy balance equation given wind forcing input. While the model has been previously validated in deep water and coastal ocean applications, this study validates the model in very shallow water where bed-induced wave dissipation is a significant process. Model results show that waves of sufficient energy to prevent establishment or to uproot seedlings are common in areas of the lake that are experiencing the least woody encroachment. Areas of the lake bed that are experiencing encroachment are often sheltered from the strongest waves due to the lakes orientation with respect to dominant winds and prior establishment of woody growth, which dissipates wave energy significantly. Results are consistent with some otherwise-unexplained conditions at the lake such as spatially inconsistent relationships between elevation and vegetation communities. We use model results to investigate feedbacks between woody encoachment (both new and established growth) and dominant climatic forcing and resulting wave action and to identify critical bed shear stress thresholds for seedling establishment.",

We used glaciological assessments to select mountain glaciers that are most sensitive to summer temperature change. We evaluate the amplitude of past advances and use a simple and robust mountain glacier model to estimate the corresponding lowering of the equilibrium line altitudes. 10Be surface exposure dating, based on recent and new local production rate calibrations, provide the chronological framework for this study.\nThe timing and, to a certain extent the amplitude, of the investigated Late Glacial mountain glacier culminations in northern mid- (and high-) latitudes show a high level of internal consistency, indicating regional to hemispheric summer temperature changes by a few oC as the primary driver on a regional to hemispheric scale. The consistency of the northern mountain glacier pattern during the Late Glacial period extents to the southern hemisphere, suggesting that mountain glacier fluctuations during this interval were in phase, and thus do not show a bipolar seesaw signature. In contrast, the much smaller-scale Holocene mountain glacier fluctuations show a different picture, with robust inter-hemispheric differences in the mountain glacier records. We discuss potential climate scenarios that might help to explain the observed Late Glacial and Holocene mountain glacier pattern.",

We first applied Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) analysis to 1980-2012 daily surface JJA ozone observations from the EPA Air Quality System and correlated the resulting EOFs with NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis meteorology. The first three leading EOF patterns describe (1) a broad decrease of ozone in the eastern US linked to a southward shift of the 500 hPa polar jet, (2) a north-south dipole pattern associated with the Bermuda High system when its western boundary extends along the East coast, and (3) an east-west dipole pattern linked to a westward shift of the Bermuda High, an enhanced low level jet in the Central Plains, and troughing of the polar jet in the Midwest. In the Midwest and Northeast, we found that the correlation between detrended JJA MDA8 ozone and polar jet frequency ranges between -0.75 and -0.86 over 1980-2012, depending on the time period selected. In the Southeast, the influence of Bermuda High on ozone variability depends on the location of its west edge. Westward movement increases the ozone only when the JJA Bermuda High west edge is located west of 87.5°W, while northward movement increases ozone in all years.\nUsing Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5) models, we found that the polar jet in the Northeast migrates poleward by ~1 degree and the Bermuda High west edge shifts westward by ~3 degree by 2100. The poleward shift of jet wind leads to a decrease of jet frequency in the Midwest and Northeast, resulting in a +2 ppbv increase of JJA ozone. This westward shift of the Bermuda High west edge enhances the Great Plains low level jet and strengthens the anticyclonic circulation in the Southeast. Our results imply that the climate penalty may increase JJA mean MDA8 ozone by 3-5 ppbv in the Southeast by 2100.",

Recent results of PIC simulations (Cai et al., 2014) have recovered the general expected features of the cusp issued from both previous experimental and MHD simulation results. One new striking feature was the evidence of an Alfven transition layer (ATL) almost adjacent to the upper edge of the stagnant exterior cusp (SEC), through which the plasma flow transits from super (from magnetosheath) to sub-(to SEC) Alfvenic regime in a good agreement with experimental data statistics performed by Lavraud and al. (2005) but not mentionned in MHD results. In complement to these experimental results, present simulations displayed in the image show that (i) the ATL largely extends out of the upper cusp region until even reaching the subsolar region, (ii) the ATL presents some assymetry around the meridian plane ; (iii) it has a 3D structure which is analyzed in details (not performed before); (iv) the middle region of the ATL (3D) located above the upper cusp presents a depletion where its width is much thinner and corresponds to a privilegied region where large plasma flows are observed which suggests strong local plasma precipitation. We take advantage of the 3D PIC simulations in order to analyze carfefully this area and plasma précipitation, and to separate plasma flows passing through the nearby reconnection lobes located along the magnetopause (and above the ATL) from those which do not. The main goal is to establish a link between the 3D dynamic of the reconnection lobes and of the upper cusp region.",

            "abstract": "In the analysis of seismic activity, assessment of earthquake detectability of a seismic network is a fundamental issue. For this assessment, the completeness magnitude Mc, the minimum magnitude above which all earthquakes are recorded, is frequently estimated. In most cases, Mc is estimated for an earthquake catalog of duration longer than several weeks. However, owing to human activity, noise level in seismic data is higher on weekdays than on weekends, so that earthquake detectability has a weekly variation [e.g., Atef et al., 2009, BSSA]; the consideration of such a variation makes a significant contribution to the precise assessment of earthquake detectability and Mc.\nFor a quantitative evaluation of the weekly variation, we introduced the statistical model of a magnitude-frequency distribution of earthquakes covering an entire magnitude range [Ogata & Katsura, 1993, GJI]. The frequency distribution is represented as the product of the Gutenberg-Richter law and a detection rate function. Then, the weekly variation in one of the model parameters, which corresponds to the magnitude where the detection rate of earthquakes is 50%, was estimated. Because earthquake detectability also have a daily variation [e.g., Iwata, 2013, GJI], and the weekly and daily variations were estimated simultaneously by adopting a modification of a Bayesian smoothing spline method for temporal change in earthquake detectability developed in Iwata [2014, Aust. N. Z. J. Stat.]. Based on the estimated variations in the parameter, the value of Mc was estimated.\nIn this study, the Japan Meteorological Agency catalog from 2006 to 2010 was analyzed; this dataset is the same as analyzed in Iwata [2013] where only the daily variation in earthquake detectability was considered in the estimation of Mc. A rectangular grid with 0.1° intervals covering in and around Japan was deployed, and the value of Mc was estimated for each gridpoint. Consequently, a clear weekly variation was revealed; the detectability is better on Sundays than on the other days. The estimated spatial variation in Mc was compared with that estimated in Iwata [2013]; the maximum difference between Mc values with and without considering the weekly variation approximately equals to 0.2, suggesting the importance of accounting for the weekly variation in the estimation of Mc.",

The combination of CALIOP and CloudSat measurements, and those acquired by future space-based lidar/radar missions, forms an extended time series of three-dimensional aerosol/cloud distributions. The global lidar/radar observations help us understand fast atmospheric processes that are relevant to aerosol-cloud-radiation-climate interactions and the energy/water cycle. If calibration errors are small enough, the lidar/radar observation time series can also provide better constraints for studying atmosphere/ocean interaction processes on inter-annual and decadal time scales.\nCALIOP provides the best aerosol/cloud detection, discrimination and vertical distributions. CALIOP’s depolarization ratio is one of the best calibrated measurements made by the A-Train sensors. Over the life of the CALIPSO mission, the vertical distribution measurements and the stability of the CALIOP depolarization ratio calibration has remained within 1%. CALIOP’s depolarization ratio measurements can be used for studying changes in aerosol and ice cloud characterizations, multiple scattering processes of water clouds, and the backscatter of ocean subsurface particulates. Using depolarization ratio measurements from CALIOP together with collocated A-train instruments, we will evaluate the seasonal and inter-annual changes in global and regional aerosol and cloud profiles, as well as ocean subsurface properties, in order to answer the following questions:\nHow do cloud properties, such as cloud fraction, cloud vertical distributions, cloud phase and cloud temperature, of Northern and Southern Hemispheres respond to changes in SST and solar insolation? \nDo we see global and/or regional changes in microphysical properties of water clouds during the past 8 years?\nAre the changes in water cloud microphysical properties correlated with changes in aerosols, ocean surface or subsurface properties?

For example, strong force from winds and waves fractures the thick sea ice into pieces or floes, which then collide with each other. In studies of the Polar Regions with satellite SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery, identification of ice floes and their distribution is particularly important for examining for both large and small scale applications.In this paper, a Graph-Cut (GC) based feature extraction and fusion technique has been proposed for effective segmentation of SAR images and following on FSD analysis. Though GC based approach has been used in the segmentation of natural images, the application of it on SAR image in this context is rare. Based on an energy minimization process, the GC technique has utilized a graph based representation in grouping pixels for segmentation. To deal with sparkle noise, effective pre-processing and image filter is also applied.To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, real SAR images with a high resolution of 16k by 16k are used for both visual assessment and quantitative analysis. In comparison to several state-of-the-art algorithms such as watershed and K-means it is found kernel based GC approach yields the most accurate results as shown in Fig. 1.\nFig. 1: One example image (t-l) and its ground truth (t-m) along with results of segmentation using graph cut (t-r) and (b-l), watershed (b-m) and K-means (b-r).",

            "abstract": "In this decade the big data revolution has permeated in many fields, ranging from financial transactions, medical surveys and scientific endeavors, because of the big opportunities people see ahead. What to do with all this data remains an intriguing question. This is where computer scientists together with applied mathematicians have made some significant inroads in developing deep learning techniques for unraveling new relationships among the different variables by means of correlation analysis and data-assimilation methods. Deep-learning and big data taken together is a grand challenge task in High-performance computing which demand both ultrafast speed and large memory. The Tianhe-2 recently installed at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou is well positioned to take up this challenge because it is currently the world’s fastest computer at 34 Petaflops. Each compute node of Tianhe-2 has two CPUs of Intel Xeon E5-2600 and three Xeon Phi accelerators. The Tianhe-2 has a very large fast memory RAM of 88 Gigabytes on each node. The system has a total memory of 1,375 Terabytes. All of these technical features will allow very high dimensional (more than 10) problem in deep learning to be explored carefully on the Tianhe-2. Problems in seismology which can be solved include three-dimensional seismic wave simulations of the whole Earth with a few km resolution and the recognition of new phases in seismic wave form from assemblage of large data sets.",

Analysis of satellite detected fires conducted for 2007 show substantial biomass burning in the vicinity of Kilimanjaro and maximum mid visible MODIS retrieved aerosol optical depth over Kilimanjaro during the month of July. For selected case days in 2007, numerical simulations were conducted using WRF Chem to assess the impact of biomass burning aerosols on orographic cloud formation on Kilimanjaro. Numerical modeling experiments with and without smoke emissions were conducted. Satellite derived smoke emissions are utilized in numerical model experiments considering biomass burning aerosol effects. Nested grid configuration was used in the experiments to establish a fine grid of 100 km x 100 km domain and 1 km grid spacing over the complex terrain of Kilimanjaro. For case days considered, numerical model simulations show substantial impact of biomass burning aerosols on orographic cloud formation. There is a net increase in cloud liquid water path with maximum increase in excess of 10%. Orographic precipitation also show increase in rainfall of up to 10% at higher elevations. Whereas there is average reduction in downwelling solar radiation 18 Wm-2 up to elevations of 5000m, impacts at the mountain peaks are minimal. Processes leading to the differences in cloud formation and results from numerical simulations are conducted for additional case study days during other seasons and will be discussed",

Precipitation is diagnosed and falls to the surface instantaneously. Studies have shown that more sophisticated microphysics schemes generally give better results compared with observations. We are testing several sophisticated microphysics schemes from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) in the GFS.

Therefore, the behavior of iron alloys of similar composition at the temperatures and pressures that resemble the conditions of Earth’s core is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the inner workings of our planet. The melting behavior of iron alloys is especially important as it sheds light on the conditions at the boundary between Earth’s solid inner core and its liquid outer core, as well as puts constraints on the age of the inner core. Here, we report the melting curve of iron alloys based on laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments. Four-color multi-wavelength imaging radiometry is used to determine the temperature profiles of the heated spot during melting and electron microscopy is used to map the compositional and textural changes of the iron alloys. An automated analysis of the texture, composition and temperature of the hot spots is conducted with an in-house developed image processing script, which identifies the melting point of the alloys and the preferred host phases of minor elements (e.g., Ni, Cr, Mn) at high-pressure/temperature conditions.",

The AfricaArray geophysics field school, which is run by Wits, has been teaching field-based geophysics to African students for over a decade. In the first 2-3 weeks of the program, the U.S. students are given basic instruction in near-surface geophysics, South African geology, and South African history and culture. The students then join the Wits AfricaArray geophysics field school – working alongside Wits students and students from several other African universities to map the shallow subsurface in prospective areas of South Africa for platinum mining. In addition to the primary goals of collecting and interpreting gravity, magnetic, resistivity, seismic refraction, seismic reflection, and EM data, students spend time mapping geologic units and gathering information on the physical properties of the rocks in the region (i.e. seismic velocity, density, and magnetic susceptibility). Subsurface targets include mafic dikes, faults, the water table, and overburden thickness. Upon returning to the U.S., students spend 2-3 weeks finalizing their project reports and presentations. The program has been effective at not only providing students with fundamental skills in applied geophysics, but also in fostering multicultural relationships, preparing students for graduate work in the geosciences, and attracting STEM students into the geosciences. Student presenters will discuss their experiences gained through the field school and give their impressions about how the program works towards the goal of increasing diversity in the geosciences in the U.S.",

            "abstract": "Neish and Lorenz [Icarus 228 (2014), 27-34] suggested that Titan's lowest elevations are extensive wetlands based on crater distributions. With a Titan general circulation model (GCM), we examine whether low-lying wetlands at mid-latitudes provide sufficient surface-level moisture to trigger convective cloud formation there, as well as investigate the dynamical processes responsible for different cloud morphologies. GCMs of Titan have shown that the atmospheric circulation transports methane away from low latitudes and into the polar regions on average. Several of these models simulate moist and cloudy conditions over the summer pole, in agreement with observations of convective clouds over the south pole during its summer. However, observations of cloudiness over Titan's southern mid-latitudes that occurred around solstice and persisted until after autumnal equinox are perplexing. GCMs tend to only simulate mid-latitude clouds around equinox, and only when imposing very wet surface conditions. In GCMs where surface moisture is allowed to vary self-consistently, the mid-latitudes are dry and cloud formation is inhibited. However, these models ignore topography. The GCM in this study is three-dimensional and fully simulates Titan's methane cycle, including variable surface moisture, as well as Titan's temperatures and atmospheric superrotation. Comparison of model results to recent obsrvations of the latitudinal humidity distribution of the troposphere will help discriminate between surface distributions. These simulations can therefore begin to constrain the distribution of surface methane, beyond Titan's distinctive lakes and seas, available to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The complexity of lithospheric rheology and the necessity to resolve the deformation patterns near the free surface (faults and folds) sufficiently well places a great demand on a stable and scalable modeling tool that is capable of efficiently handling nonlinearities. Our code LaMEM (Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model) is an attempt to satisfy this demand.\nThe code utilizes a stable and numerically inexpensive finite difference discretization with the spatial staggering of velocity, pressure, and temperature unknowns (a so-called staggered grid). As a time discretization method the forward Euler, or a combination of the predictor-corrector and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta can be chosen. Elastic stresses are rotated on the markers, which are also used to track all relevant material properties and solution history fields. The Newtonian nonlinear iteration, however, is handled at the level of the grid points to avoid spurious averaging between markers and grid. Such an arrangement required us to develop a non-standard discretization of the effective strain-rate second invariant. Important feature of the code is its ability to handle stress-free and open-box boundary conditions, in which empty cells are simply eliminated from the discretization, which also solves the biggest problem of the sticky-air approach – namely large viscosity jumps near the free surface. We currently support an arbitrary combination of linear elastic, nonlinear viscous with multiple creep mechanisms, and plastic rheologies based on either a depth-dependent von Mises or pressure-dependent Drucker-Prager yield criteria.\nLaMEM is being developed as an inherently parallel code. Structurally all its parts are based on the building blocks provided by PETSc library. These include Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov nonlinear solvers with convergence globalization techniques (line search), equipped with different linear preconditioners. We have also implemented the coupled velocity-pressure multigrid prolongation and restriction operators specific for staggered grid discretization. The capabilities of the code are demonstrated with a set of geodynamically-relevant benchmarks and example problems on parallel computers.\nThis project is funded by ERC Starting Grant 258830",

            "abstract": "El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a climatological phenomenon that occurs in the tropical Pacific Ocean which has a direct influence on the climate of western Pacific nations. This study evaluated the meteorological effects of ENSO on the economies of Indonesia and the Philippines. It was hypothesized that decreased precipitation in the western Tropical Pacific region during El Niño events causes decreases in agricultural production in the region resulting in a negative effect on a nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Furthermore, during La Niña events, when precipitation increases, an increase in the nation’s agricultural GDP and overall GDP is expected.\nAnnual GDP data were obtained from the World Bank and the Bank of Indonesia for 1960-2012. Sea surface temperatures (SST) data, in the Niño 3.4 region, were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climate Data Center.\nData of the agricultural and total GDP of Indonesia and the Philippines had inconclusive correlations with ENSO signal data. By examining data between smaller time segments of the overall 1960-2012 timeframe, more conclusive results could not be discerned.\n Indonesia’s quarterly non-oil GDP for 2000-2009 was independently correlated with ENSO providing better insight on the variables’ relationship during discrete ENSO phenomena. The results provided strong correlation coefficients of 0.831 and 0.624 in support of the antithesis as well as -0.421 in support of the hypothesis. An economic anomaly known as the East Asian Financial Crisis may have been the cause of the unexpected correlations however more data is needed to be certain.\nOverall, the results demonstrated weak to moderate correlations between studied variables. However, more data is needed to reach substantial conclusions.",

            "abstract": "The controllability of CO2 geological storage can ensure the integrity of storage operations, requiring a precise monitoring of reservoir fluids and properties during injection and over time. In this context, deep saline aquifers offer a large capacity of storing CO2, but the accessibility to long term behavior studies remains limited until now. The Maguelone shallow experimental site located near Montpellier (Languedoc, France) provides such an opportunity for the understanding and accuracy of hydrogeophysical monitoring methods. The geology, petrophysic and hydrology of this site have been studied in details in previous studies, revealing the presence of a thin saline aquifer at 13-16 m depth surrounded by clay-rich materials. The site as a whole provides a natural laboratory to study CO2 injection at field scale, shallow depth, hence reasonable costs. The monitoring setup is composed of a series of hydrogeophysical and geochemical methods offering measurements of fluid pore pressure, electrical resistivity, acoustic velocities as well as pH and fluid properties and chemistry.\nTo assess the response of the reservoir during CO2 injection, all measurements need to be compared to a representative baseline. Long after a series of gas injection experiments at Maguelone, fluctuations overtime of reservoir fluids and properties (such as pore fluid pH) were discovered at steady state, demonstrating the natural variability of the site in terms of biogenic gas (H2S, CH4, CO2) production and transfer.\nFor this, a new resistivity baseline had to be constructed for all observatories. From this, the downhole gas saturation was determined versus depth and time from time-lapse resistivity logs analysed on the basis of other logs and laboratory measurements. The Waxman and Smits model (1968) for electrical properties of sand-clay formations was modified to estimate the gas saturation in 4D, to account for surface conductivity and pore connectivity. High frequency logging and monitoring of electrical properties both, with several measurements per hour and a dm-scale resolution, provide and insight into subsurface dynamics in terms of gas flow and storage, with biogenic gas saturations ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 %. This natural contribution has to be taken into account for upcoming experiments.",

            "abstract": "Decades of aerosol measurements on Barbados have yielded a detailed picture of African mineral dust transport to the Caribbean Basin that shows a strong seasonal cycle with a maximum in boreal summer and a minimum in winter. Recently Prospero et al. (Global Biogeochemical Cycles, 2014) presented 10 years (2002 – 2011) of aerosol measurements made at Cayenne, French Guiana, along with concurrent dust measurements on Barbados. The Cayenne study, coupled with satellite products and other evidence, shows that during spring African dust is carried to a broad region of northeastern South America in quantities comparable to, or greater than, those measured at Barbados in summer. Various lines of evidence suggest that the sources that impact on Cayenne in spring are mainly in the Sahel region, including the Bodélé Depression. In summer transport to Barbados is believed to be most affected by emissions that lie in more northerly regions. Thus the record of measurements at Cayenne and Barbados provide a data set that could be used to test the ability of dust transport models to replicate the seasonal shift of dust sources and the consequent impact on transport to these two sites.\nHere we attempt to link the measurements at Cayenne and Barbados to specific source regions using the GFDL global climate model (Donner et al., 2011) which simulates aerosol mass distributions for dust and other aerosol components. Winds are nudged with the NCEP re-analysis as in Li et al. (2008). The model is run repeatedly over the years 1999-2010, activating dust sources in only one North African country in each run (e.g., Mali, Mauritania, Algeria, Niger, etc.). The model accurately depicts the strong seasonal contrast in dust transport to Barbados and Cayenne and shows the changing impact of African sources over the course of the year. In our presentation we will discuss the model results and compare them to the measurements at the receptor sites. It is notable that during the dust seasons at these receptor sites, dust has a dramatic impact on PM10 concentrations so that the average 24-hour PM10 concentrations frequently exceed the World Health Organization air quality guideline, 50 µg m-3. Our model results will be discussed in this context as well.",

            "abstract": "Spherical Slepian localization functions are a useful method for studying regional mass changes observed by satellite gravimetry. By projecting data onto a sparse basis set, the local field can be estimated more easily than with the full spherical harmonic basis. We have used this method previously to estimate the ice mass change in Greenland from GRACE data, and it can also be applied to other planetary problems such as global magnetic fields.\nEarth's static geoid, in contrast to the time-variable field, is in large part related to the internal density and rheological structure of the Earth. Past studies have used dynamic geoid kernels to relate this density structure and the internal deformation it induces to the surface geopotential at large scales. These now classical studies of the eighties and nineties were able to estimate the mantle's radial rheological profile, placing constraints on the ratio between upper and lower mantle viscosity.\nBy combining these two methods, spherical Slepian localization and dynamic geoid kernels, we have created local dynamic geoid kernels which are sensitive only to density variations within an area of interest. With these kernels we can estimate the approximate local radial rheological structure that best explains the locally observed geoid on a regional basis. First-order differences of the regional mantle viscosity structure are accessible to this technique.\nIn this contribution we present our latest, as yet unpublished results on the geographical and temporal pattern of ice mass changes in Antarctica over the past decade, and we introduce a new approach to extract regional information about the internal structure of the Earth from the static global gravity field. Both sets of results are linked in terms of the relevant physics, but also in being developed from the marriage of Slepian functions and geoid kernels. We make predictions on the utility of our approach to derive fully three-dimensional rheological Earth models, to be used for corrections for glacio-isostatic adjustment, as necessary for the interpretation of time-variable gravity observations in terms of ice sheet mass-balance studies.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the diurnal variation of mixed-layer ozone in Huntsville AL, Southeast United States on September, 6, 2013 during the SEAC4RS field campaign. The dynamics and chemistry of the mixed layer are studied with a Large-Eddy Simulation model coupled with a chemical module and Ozone DIAL observations. In this study, we will present calculations of ozone entrainment fluxes using continuous observation by co-located ozone DIAL and Compact Wind Aerosol Lidar (CWAL) at the campus of University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). As a part of Tropospheric Ozone Lidar NETwork (TOLNET), UAH ozone DIAL can provide continuous ozone observation in the altitude range from 125 m AGL to 12 km, with 10-min temporal resolution and 150 – 550 m vertical resolution. We also perform an ozone budget study using the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES), reasonable approximations of dry deposition, in conjunction with ozone entrainment observations.\nIn this case study, the enhancement of ozone in the mixed layer results from the local emissions of NOx and VOCs. The NOx and VOCs emitted at surface entered into mixed layer by atmospheric turbulence and produced ozone within the whole mixed layer. Simultaneously, non-turbulent air in the residual layer, which is at top of the morning mixed layer, participates in convective mixing through entrainment processes. The clean air in the residual layer decreases the ozone enhancement rate in the mixed layer. After the mixed layer reaches its stable height at 1700m, the large-scale subsidence not only decreases PBL growth but also enhances the entrainment process. The PBL NOx and VOCs mix into the free troposphere through detrainment before producing ozone by photochemical reaction. We have following conclusions from this case study: 1) the relationship between boundary layer height and PBL ozone is complicated. Higher PBL height does not always mean lower PBL ozone. 2) The LES calculation results illuminate the interaction between meso-scale and local (urban)-scale air quality issues.",

            "abstract": "Spatially referenced soil inventory datasets facilitate the mapping of forest soil organic carbon (SOC) at large spatial scales via statistical interpolation. When spatial autocorrelation is present in these data, geostatistical modeling strategies may lead to improved accuracy and a better understanding of the uncertainty within the predictive model. In this study, we compared spatial and non-spatial Bayesian hierarchical models for predicting SOC across forested lands in the nation of Germany. We used observations from the E.U. Joint Research Centre’s LUCAS topsoil database, coupled with predictor variables drawn from remote sensing data products, to address the following objectives: (1) examine patterns of spatial autocorrelation in a national forest SOC dataset; (2) compare spatial and non-spatial models for predicting forest SOC at new locations; and (3) apply the selected model to map predicted soil carbon, along with associated uncertainty estimates, across a grid covering all German forests. Exploratory analyses indicate that there is spatial autocorrelation in the SOC data, and our results suggest that incorporating this spatial dependence within the model framework offers a 9-10 percent reduction in root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) relative to non-spatial models within our study region. By adopting a Bayesian hierarchical approach, where full posterior distributions may be generated at each prediction location, we found significant uncertainty relative to mean estimates when scaling up plot data to the national scale, even when spatial dependence was accounted for. Our results suggest that while accounting for spatial dependence improves predictive performance, difficulty associated with establishing clear relationships between forest SOC and predictor variables limits model precision. By conditioning predictions on both the model parameters and input data, Bayesian hierarchical models were important to our understanding of the model uncertainty. By demonstrating that geostatistical models are a valid approach for mapping forest SOC at broad scales, and that even “best case” predictive methods are likely to be highly uncertain, these results have important implication for efforts to develop soil carbon stock baselines at broad spatial scales.",

Current observation is five-direction mode, which observes a vertical direction, as well as directions of 30-degree tilted to the north, south, east and west.\n Now we try to upgrade the system to observe any direction in the sky using a new laser transmission system and a PC-controllable telescope. The transmission system is composed of two electric rotary stages and two mirrors with the vertical and horizontal axes to emit the laser. The pointing repeatability to the same direction was measured to be within 0.1 mrad. The azimuth and elevation of the telescope was adjusted using the position of some bright stars. The pointing repeatability of the telescope was confirmed to be about 0.3.mrad. Using a CCD camera, laser trajectory can be monitored with the telescope image so that we can tweak the direction.\n Current subject we are focusing on is to make automatic and successive observations to a set of directions in the sky.

            "abstract": "During subduction, prograde metamorphism leads to the disappearance of Fe3+-rich phases in serpentinites (mostly magnetite and lizardite). This redox reaction is accompanied with a decrease of Fe3+/FeTot ratio in serpentinites and a release of fluid mobile elements (e.g. B, S) but little is known about the iron mobility in fluids during subduction. We investigate this problem with an isotopic study of Fe in serpentinites from Western Alps ophiolites. These samples record different metamorphic conditions modelling a subduction gradient that allow deciphering the impact of prograde metamorphism on the Fe isotopic composition of serpentinites during subduction.\nAt mid-oceanic ridges, ultramafic rocks are serpentinized by interaction with seawater derived fluids. This process leads to the replacement and oxidation of ferromagnesian minerals (olivine and orthopyroxene) to Fe3+-rich lizardite and magnetite (Liz-serpentinite). Mantle peridotites commonly display δ56Fe between -0.1 and +0.1 ‰ while Liz-serpentinites display a δ56Fe ranging from -0.09 to +0.04 (± 0.03)‰, which could potentially reflect interactions with low-δ56Fe hydrothermal fluids. During subduction, from greenschist to blueschist facies, the transition lizardite to antigorite leads to a progressive disappearance of magnetite and a reduction of Fe in serpentine. This redox reaction is accompanied with an increase of δ56Fe from +0.03 to +0.13‰. At eclogite facies, fully recrystallized Atg-serpentinites display a δ56Fe ranging from +0.14 to +0.20‰ while partly dehydrated serpentinites composed of antigorite, secondary olivine and chlorite display a lower δ56Fe ranging from -0.03 to +0.03‰.\nOur results show that, during the first 70 km of subduction, the transition lizardite to antigorite conduct to the formation of a serpentinite with a high δ56Fe value that can be accompanied with the loss of a low δ56Fe fluid. The increase of δ56Fe in serpentinites is correlated with a decrease of Fe3+/FeTot ratio suggesting that the main factor controlling Fe isotopic fractionation during the transition lizardite to antigorite is the oxidation state. At greater depth, antigorite breakdown is accompanied with a reduction of iron in serpentinites and a decrease of δ56Fe suggesting that release fluids could have a high δ56Fe value.",

To better understand its sedimentation, denudation, and mountain building history; we conduct a detailed magnetostratigraphic study on the Dashankou section in the Kashi Depression of the Tarim Basin. Paleomagnetic samples were collected from 985 sites of a 3187m-thick section from the exposed Neogene sediments. Magnetostratigraphy is correlating with polarity chrons C5r.3r to C2An.1n dated between ~12.4 and ~3.0 Ma on the GTS2012 geomagnetic polarity time scale. The substantial increase in accumulation rate in the Dashankou section at ~6.7 Ma may be the signature of a pulse of rapid uplift comparable to that observed in the northern Chinese Tianshan Mountains. We argue that climatic changes may have modulated the sedimentary record during the Neogene times, but they don’t appear to be a dominant control on sediment accumulation between ~7.0 and ~2.58 Ma. On the other hand, the basal age of the Xiyu Conglomerates studied here is ~3.2 Ma, and the accumulation rate of the Late Pliocene conglomerates was mostly controlled by both tectonics and climatic cooling. Our results indicate that the present high relief of the Tianshan Mountains is the result of dominant phases of uplift at ~6.7 Ma and the Early Pleistocene.",

            "abstract": "Gravel braided rivers have complex lateral and vertical patterns of grain size sorting characterizing the river deposit and patchiness within the channel. Sorting has direct interactions with bed material transport processes for which it is important to know both the surface grain size relative to morphology and also the distribution of sizes in the morphological active layer involved in sediment transport over longer time periods. In the field, analysis of vertical sorting from direct sampling is either extremely laborious or requires long-term tracer studies of burial and mixing. We approached the problem from a new direction using a small-scale physical model of a braided channel to map bed elevation changes and grain size over time. The braided channel was developed at a slope of 1.5% and discharge of 2.1 l/s. The grain size distribution in the model is an approximately 1:30 scaled distribution of medium fluvial gravel with median size 1.3mm (D10 0.3 mm, D90 4mm). Vertical stereo images (with pixel resolution of approximately 1mm) of the dry bed were taken at one hour intervals over 40 hours of flume running time during which a large area of the river was re-worked. DEMs were derived photogrammetrically with mean elevation error of about 4mm. Surface grain size was mapped using a 7x7 pixel window and based on a calibrated relationship with the entropy values of the grey level co-occurrence matrix for the images. Consequently each pixel in the DEM also has an associated grain size. Over the 40 hour period the range of elevation and grain size variations over the river bed can be used to analyse the vertical particle-size sorting pattern within the morphological active layer (the layer between the maximum and minimum elevations at each point) and the presence of any vertical stratification in particle size. In braided channels with active bed scour and bar migration particle exchange occurs in a morphological active layer with thickness of the order of 10D90. The layer is well-mixed with no strong correlation between depth in the bed and the grain size. The size distributions of the upper-most and lower-most layers are very similar. At the flume scale, all grain sizes occur with almost equal probability over the bed depth. Reciprocally, at any bed elevation all grain sizes occur with almost equally probability.",

Preliminary results indicate crustal thickness of 20 – 30 km, a sedimentary basin with low velocities, and a Pn velocity of 7.9 – 8.0 km/s.",

            "abstract": "Comparing Suomi-NPP VIIRS aerosol retrievals to AERONET ground measurements plays a vital role in evaluating the maturity status of the VIIRS aerosol products. The study applied the Multi-sensor Aerosol Product Sampling System (MAPSS) to compare VIIRS aerosol products and the heritage MODIS (C5.1 & C6) and MISR aerosol products with AERONET measurements over the VIIRS's operational period. The accuracy and precision of the VIIRS aerosol products, as determined by comparison with AERONET measurements, were evaluated against JPSS-1 performance evaluation threshold values. Regional, seasonal and geometrical dependence of the deviation of the satellite retrievals from the ground measurements were characterized and compared. Results indicate comparable performance of the VIIRS aerosol optical depth EDR and Ångström Exponent EDR (over ocean) to their counterparts from the heritage sensors. The findings on the spatial and temporal patterns of the differences between the satellite aerosol retrievals and AERONET will aid in the improvement of the VIIRS aerosol products as we transition from NPP to the JPSS-1.",

We perform the WPIA for rising tone electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves (so-called EMIC triggered emissions), of which generation mechanism is essentially the same as the chorus emissions. THEMIS observation data (EFI, FGM, and ESA) are used for the WPIA. In the WPIA, we calculate (1) the inner product of the wave electric field and the velocity of the energetic protons: Wint, (2) the inner product of the wave magnetic field and the velocity of the energetic protons: WBint, and (3) the phase angle ζ between the wave magnetic field and the perpendicular velocity of the energetic protons. The values of (1) and (2) indicate the existence of the resonant currents inducing the nonlinear wave growth and the frequency change, respectively. We find the negative Wint and positive WBint at the nonlinear growing phase of the triggered emission as predicted in the theory [e.g. Omura and Nunn, 2011, Shoji and Omura, 2013]. In histogram of (3), we show the existence of the electromagnetic proton holes in the phase space generating the resonant currents. We also perform a hybrid simulation and evaluate WPIA method for EMIC waves. The simulation results show good agreement with the in-situ THEMIS observations.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Sound sector of Antarctica features a unique, polar desert ecosystem characterized by low temperatures, hyper-aridity, and high-speed winds. These climatic conditions result in limited water sources, sparse vegetation, underdeveloped soils, and abundant unconsolidated sediment easily influenced by wind-driven transport. Radiogenic isotopes (87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd) provide constant signatures of dust from source- to sink-areas. Accordingly, aeolian dust derived from arid regions has been recognized in many studies as an important tracer of atmospheric circulation, as well as a tool for deciphering past climatic conditions in dust source regions. However, while major global dust sources (e.g. from South America, Africa, and Asia) are well studied and easily identifiable via distinct isotopic signatures when encountered in different depositional environments (e.g. Antarctic ice cores), local material from sources in and around the ice-free Dry Valleys and surrounding areas have remained in need of further documentation. We analyzed 40 samples of silt, sand, glacial drift, and weathered regolith material in both fine (<5µm) and coarse fractions collected from Victoria Land and the McMurdo Sound sector, including Cape Royds, Cape Bird, and the McMurdo Ice Shelf. Here we present an ArcGIS-generated, high-precision geochemical map of Antarctic PSAs synthesized from our data and combined with geomorphological and stratigraphic information on the studied sites. We believe that our expanded isotopic catalogue and map can be used to enhance and/or prompt regional studies in a variety of disciplines, such as by providing greater constraints on models of regional dust variability and transport pathways and of the melting history of the Antarctic ice sheet, and by determining the provenance of dust archived in ice cores, lake sediment, soil records, and impurities in Antarctic sea-ice.",

            "abstract": "Oil-in-water emulsions are typically employed during remediation to promote biotic reduction of contaminants. Emulsions, however, hold promise for encapsulated delivery of many types of active ingredients required for successful site remediation or long-term site stewardship. Our research is currently focused on using alkalinity-containing particles held within oil-in-water emulsions to sustain control of subsurface pH. Here we describe results from laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling conducted to quantify the kinetics associated with the emulsion delivery and alkalinity release process.\nKinetically stable oil-in-water emulsions containing (~60 nmCaCO3 or ~100 nm MgO particles) were previously developed using soybean oil and Gum Arabic as a stabilizing agent. Batch and column experiments were employed to assess the accessibility and release of the alkalinity from the emulsion. Successive additions of HCl were used in batch systems to produce several pH responses (pH rebounds) that were subsequently modeled to elucidate release mechanisms and rates for varying emulsion compositions and particle types. Initial results suggest that a linear-driving-force model is generally able to capture the release behavior in the batch system when the temporally-constant, lumped mass-transfer coefficient is scaled by the fraction of particle mass remaining within the droplets. This result suggests that the rate limiting step in the release process may be the interphase transfer of reactive species at the oil-water interface.\n1-d column experiments were also completed in order to quantify the extent and rate of alkalinity release from emulsion droplets retained in a sandy medium. Alkalinity release from the retained droplets treated a pH 4 influent water for 25-60 pore volumes (the duration depended on particle type and mass loading), and the cessation in treatment corresponded to exhaustion of the particle mass held within the oil. Column experiments were simulated using a transport code containing the linear-driving-force expression evaluated in the batch experiments. In these simulations the lumped mass transfer coefficient was fit and compared with values predicted using existing correlations for liquid-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces in porous media.",

            "abstract": "The precise timing and duration of Heinrich Stadials (HS) remains a topic of active debate. Here we present multiple NE Brazilian stalagmites known to grow during HS 4\n[i]\n. Using a combination of U/Th dating, confocal microscopy, and stable isotope analysis, we aim to provide additional age constraints on the Brazilian pluvial anomaly associated with HS 4. Stalagmite growth in this region is caused by increased rainfall due to a southerly displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone during HS Events. We focus on three stalagmites—TBV40, TBV63, and TBR14—collected from Toca da Boa Vista (TBV) and Toca da Barriguda (TBR) caves\n[ii]\n, respectively. TBV40 and TBV63 each contain an aragonite phase U/Th dated from 40.02 to 39.57 ka B.P., followed by a calcitic phase U/Th dated from 39.27 to 38.74 ka B.P., within errors of ±0.1 ka. The switch from aragonite to calcite at approximately 39.57 ka B.P. is characterized by an abrupt 4‰ decrease in the δ18O record of TBV40. We infer that rainfall increased over NE Brazil at this time. TBR14 has a single calcite growth phase from 39.66 to 39.45 ka B.P., which correlates in part with the calcite phases of TBV40 and TBV 63. Stable isotope values for TBR14 are similar in range, trend, and absolute values to the correlative calcite portion of TBR40. Fluorescent banding was discovered in the calcitic portion of all three stalagmites using confocal laser scanning microscopy. If annual, band-counts may add additional constrains to the duration of the HS 4 growth phases. Adopting ice core band-counting methods, an average of 325±128 bands per sample and 17 small hiatuses were identified. The estimated duration of the calcitic HS 4 growth phases is therefore consistent with the U/Th dates. Growth phases may correlate in detail with other global records of HS 4, such as the Hulu Cave record\n[iii]\nfrom China, with the aragonitic portion correlating to the weak monsoon immediately following Chinese Interstadial 9 and the calcitic portion correlating with the subsequent yet weaker monsoon.\n[i] Wang et al.

            "abstract": "Wildfire is a key perturbation in the earth system to modulate climate variability by changing emissions and energy budget. Fire activities show broad spatial and temporal variability with distinct regional and seasonal characteristics. To improve modeling capability for fire activities, we newly developed a region-specific fire model with emission estimation and plume rise module in the latest Community Land Model (CLM) of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Using the observations in the past decade, we improve the fire model by applying natural and socioeconomic constraints for fire occurrence and spread separately for 14 regions and as a function of major Plant Functional Type (PFT) categories. We then add an emission module into the fire model that accounts for the interactions between fire activities and climate variability. Plume rise processes are also incorporated into this emission module for better vertical allocation of aerosol emissions from fires, which are important for simulating long-range transport of fire aerosols and their climate effects. Observation-based evaluation of simulation results using the new fire model demonstrates enhanced modeling performance for both global intensity and regional variability of wildfires, which lay the foundation for investigating wildfire feedback to regional and global climate. The impacts on improving the modeling capability of assessing the radiative forcing of fire aerosols are assessed.",

            "abstract": "Frequent exposure to elevated levels of ozone leads to negative impacts on ecosystems including the loss of ozone-sensitive tree species and agricultural crops in many regions of the United States. Information on emission sources contributing to these losses is crucial for developing a successful strategy to mitigate the negative effects of ozone on vegetation. A cumulative ozone exposure metric, W126, has been considered by the US EPA for use as secondary ozone standard. The rural West of the US has been demonstrated to have an especially great potential for disconnect between attaining primary versus W126-based ozone standards. In this work we separate the relative impact of emissions sources for the W126 in the Western US using forward and adjoint simulations with the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. The obtained source contributions are separated by different locations, species, and sectors and are combined with representative concentration pathway (RCP) anthropogenic emission scenarios to project future changes in W126 through 2050. Focusing on the foreign influences we find that the change in Chinese emissions alone is projected to lead to up to 20% increase in the W126 levels in the West and is strongly dependent on the RCP scenario. We further use concentration-response functions based on the W126 index to estimate the loss of four ozone-sensitive species in the West – ponderosa pine, Douglas Fir, red alder and quacking aspen.",

            "abstract": "The Fraser River basin in southwestern Canada is a large (250,000 km2), relatively undisturbed temperate river basin with a wide range of topographic, geologic, and climatic features. Extensive sampling of dissolved and particulate organic and inorganic geochemical properties in recent years have created a detailed framework for understanding the cycling of inorganic weathering products, sediments, and organic matter. Organic carbon fluxes in the Fraser River are influenced by spatial heterogeneity in source contributions and seasonal variability in hydrology. Fluxes of both dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) to the Strait of Georgia are dominated by the annual spring freshet. During the very early portion of the freshet, concentrations of both DOC and suspended sediments increase rapidly. While the organic carbon content of sediments decreases, increased sediment concentration compensates to cause a rise in POC concentration. The compositions of DOC and POC also change during the spring freshet. Optical properties of DOC shift from less aromatic, lower molecular weight pre-freshet DOC towards more aromatic, higher molecular weight DOC during the freshet, reflecting a shift from deep to shallow runoff flowpaths. DOC composition gradually returns to pre-freshet conditions throughout the summer, then undergoes a second shift towards freshet-like composition during the fall, likely due to basin-wide rain events. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) also vary between seasons and in different tributaries. Using the DIC and major element composition of a headwater tributary strongly influenced by carbonate weathering, we estimate that the majority of DIC in the Fraser River is derived from sources other than carbonate weathering. A significant correlation between non-carbonate-derived DIC and DOC concentration suggests that DOC respiration is the primary source of non-carbonate-derived DIC, and is responsible for >80% of the total DIC flux of the Fraser River throughout the year. The combined flux of DOC (2.7x1010 mol C yr-1) and POC (~1.1x1010 mol C yr-1) represents ~1% of annual net primary productivity in the Fraser basin, which is a relatively high proportion for large rivers globally, particularly given its relatively low suspended sediment yield.",

We show for the first time that, when measuring parallel to the local magnetic field direction, the full statistical signature of the magnetic and Elsässer field fluctuations is that of a non-Gaussian globally scale invariant process. This is distinct from the classic multifractal scaling observed when the local magnetic field is perpendicular to the flow direction. These observations are interpreted as evidence for the weakness, or absence, of a parallel magnetofluid turbulence energy cascade. As such, these results present strong observational contraints on the statistical nature of intermittency in turbulent plasmas.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Operation IceBridge (OIB) mission, initiated in 2009, collects airborne remote sensing measurements over the polar regions to bridge the gap between NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation satellite (ICESat) mission and the upcoming ICESat-2 mission in 2017. OIB combines an evolving mix of instruments to gather data on topography, ice and snow thickness, high-resolution photography, and other properties that are more difficult or impossible to measure via satellite. Once collected, these data are stored and made available at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado. To date, there are nearly 120 terabytes of data available, and there are about three more years of data collection left.\nNSIDC developed an initial map-based data portal that displayed the flightlines flown by OIB and allowed users to select data products associate with these flightlines. However, this portal was difficult to use because it focused on the flightlines rather than the data products. In 2013, OIB data providers largely revamped their data delivery process, reformatting data to better adhere to NASA standards and generating substantially more metadata with each data product. Because of this change, NSIDC has been able to develop a significantly more powerful map-based portal for search, discovery and access of these data products. This new portal allows users to focus on the data products themselves, with spatial, temporal and other filters operating on the products rather than the flightlines. This presentation shows the power of the new portal as well as the process the teams went through to make the transition to better metadata generation and use.",

            "abstract": "Satellite laser ranging (SLR) has long been used to measure the distance from a ground station to an Earth-orbiting satellite in order to determine the spacecraft position in orbit, and to conduct other geodetic measurements such as plate motions. This technique can also be used to transfer time between the station and satellite, and between remote SLR sites, as recently demonstrated by the Time Transfer by Laser Link (T2L2) project by the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiaes (CNES) and Observatorire de la Cote d’Azur (OCA) as well as the Laser Time Transfer (LTT) project by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, where two-way and one-way measurements were obtained at the same time. Here we report a new technique to transfer time between distant SLR stations via simultaneous one-way laser ranging (LR) to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft at lunar distance. The major objectives are to establish accurate ground station times and to improve LRO orbit determination via these measurements. The results of these simultaneous LR measurements are used to compare the SLR station times or transfer time from one to the other using times-of-flight estimated from conventional radio frequency tracking of LRO. The accuracy of the time transfer depends only on the difference of the times-of-flight from each ground station to the spacecraft, and is expected to be at sub-nano second level. The technique has been validated by both a ground-based experiment and an experiment that utilized LRO. Here we present the results to show that sub-nanosecond precision and accuracy are achievable. Both experiments were carried out between the primary LRO-LR station, The Next Generation Satellite Laser Ranging (NGSLR) station, and its nearby station, Mobile Laser System (MOBLAS-7), both at Greenbelt, Maryland. The laser transmit time from both stations were recorded by the same event timer referenced to a Hydrogen maser. The results have been compared to data from a common All-View GPS, and showed < 1 nanosecond precision and accuracy over 6 months. Time transfer experiments between NGSLR and McDonald Observatory SLR station at Fort Davis, Texas have also been conducted and analysis of the data will be presented.",

            "abstract": "This study will investigate changes in precipitation organization in a warmer climate using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and CMIP-5 ensemble climate simulations. This work builds from an existing four-year NEXRAD radar-based precipitation climatology over the southeastern U.S. that uses a simple two-category framework of precipitation organization based on instantaneous precipitating feature size. The first category - mesoscale precipitation features (MPF) – dominates winter precipitation and is linked to the more predictable large-scale forcing provided by the extratropical cyclones. In contrast, the second category - isolated precipitation – dominates the summer season precipitation in the southern coastal and inland regions but is linked to less predictable mesoscale circulations and to local thermodynamics more crudely represented in climate models. Most climate modeling studies suggest that an accelerated water cycle in a warmer world will lead to an overall increase in precipitation, but few studies have addressed how precipitation organization may change regionally. To address this, WRF will simulate representative wintertime and summertime precipitation events in the Southeast US under the current and future climate. These events will be simulated in an environment resembling the future climate of the 2090s using the pseudo-global warming (PGW) approach based on an ensemble of temperature projections. The working hypothesis is that the higher water vapor content in the future simulation will result in an increase in the number of isolated convective systems, while MPFs will be more intense and longer-lasting. In the context of the seasonal climatology of MPF and isolated precipitation, these results have implications for assessing the predictability of future regional precipitation in the southeastern U.S.",

            "abstract": "Three sizable geomagnetic storms were recorded in September 2011. The intensity of geomagnetic storms (Dstmin: minimum Dst) are -69, -70, -101 nT and the storms’ onset time are September 9, 17, and 26, respectively. A sequence of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) correspond causing these three geomagnetic storms. The severe geomagnetic storm (Dstmin < -100 nT) on 26 September was caused by a couple of CMEs erupted on 24 September. Wind spacecraft detected an interplanetary (IP) shock at ~11:18 UT on 26 September but no magnetic cloud was recorded behind the IP shock. A severe geomagnetic storm was recorded ~6 hours after the IP shock passed through the Wind spacecraft. Geomagnetic index (Dst) dropped to -101 nT which was due to the z-component of interplanetary magnetic field (Bz) dropped to ~ -20 nT.\n Both September 9th and 17th IP shocks have followed by a magnetic hole with a very sharp change in both magnetic field and density. Inside the magnetic holes, both solar wind velocity and temperature are almost constant, and the peak of density and dip of magnetic field occurred near the centre of the magnetic field hole. Peak densities were close to ~94, ~60 cm-3 near the centre of the hole on Sept. 09, 17, respectively.\nA global, three-dimensional (3-D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical model with inputs based on actual solar observations (e.g., velocity of the CME) is used to simulate the responses of the 3-D heliosphere. These velocity pulses are deduced from STEREO-A which are used to minic the initiation of the observed 15 CMEs at lower boundary (2.5 Rs) to investigate the CME evolution from the Sun to the Earth during September 03-30, 2011.\nSimulated background solar wind parameters (velocity, density, magnetic field, and temperature) are matched well with 1 AU in-situ measurement from Wind spacecraft. In summary, we have successfully simulated these CMEs' evolution and the IP shocks arrival time at 1 AU by comparison with Wind measurement.\nIt is found that background solar wind is an important factor on the propagation of IP shocks and CMEs. The simulation results are also useful for explaining “How were the magnetic holes formed behind the IP shocks?”\n *Work of CCW was supported by ONR 6.1 program",

Because atmospheric processes are subject to a wide variety of internal and external variables, understanding the overall forces driving the composition, structure, and dynamics requires an integrated analysis from all the available data. Eight instruments on the spacecraft are collecting in-situ and remote sensing data on the fields and particles, neutral and ionized, that make up Mars' upper atmosphere.\nAs the scientific questions MAVEN is designed to answer require an understanding of the data from multiple instruments, the project has designed a software toolkit to facilitate the access, analysis, and visualization of the disparate data. The toolkit provides mission scientists with easy access to the data from within the IDL environment, designed to ensure that users are always working with the most recent data available and to eliminate the usual difficulties of data from a variety of data sources and formats. The Toolkit also includes 1-, 2-, and interactive 3-D visualizations to enable the scientists to examine the inter-relations between data from all instruments, as well as from external models. The data and visualizations have been designed to be as flexible and extensible as possible, allowing the scientists to rapidly and easily examine and manipulate the data in the context of the mission and their wider research programs.",

            "abstract": "We studied the effects on oil sweep efficiency of the proportion, hierarchical organization, and connectivity of high-permeability open-framework conglomerate (OFC) cross-sets within the multi-scale stratal architecture found in fluvial deposits. Utilizing numerical simulations and the RVA/Paraview open-source visualization package, we analyzed oil production rate, water breakthrough time, and spatial and temporal distribution of residual oil saturation. The effective permeability of the reservoir exhibits large-scale anisotropy created by the organization of OFC cross-sets within unit bars, and the organization of unit bars within compound bars. As a result, oil sweep efficiency critically depends on the direction of the pressure gradient. When pressure gradient is oriented normal to paleoflow direction, the total oil production and the water breakthrough time are larger, and remaining oil saturation is smaller. This result is found regardless of the proportion or connectivity of the OFC cross-sets, within the ranges examined. Contrary to expectations, the total amount of trapped oil due to the effect of capillary trapping does not depend on the pressure gradient within the examined range. Hence the pressure difference between production and injection wells does not affect sweep efficiency, although the spatial distribution of oil remaining in the reservoir depends on this value. Whether or not clusters of connected OFC span the domain does not affect sweep efficiency, only the absolute rate of oil production. The RVA/Paraview application allowed us to visualize and examine these non-intuitive results.",

            "abstract": "Crust and lithosphere formed in modern island arc and plume environments exhibit strong contrasts in both structure and composition compared to present day continents. The limited inventory of Hadean and Eoarchean material available for study, the possibility that the preserved record is biased, and the lack of continental crust on other terrestrial planets, make it difficult to determine the nature of the first continental nuclei. Nonetheless, certain first order similarities in preserved Archean continental crust suggest that these continental nuclei (microcontinents or protocontinents) allow us to establish limits on processes of early crustal genesis Based on geochemical (elemental and isotopic), geochronologic, and petrologic data from Paleo- to Mesoarchean rocks preserved in the northern Wyoming Province, we propose a multi-stage evolution of a continental nucleus that reflects a secular change from plume- to plate-related processes. 1) 4.0-4.1 Ga: mafic and ultramafic magmas formed a section of thickened lithosphere over a zone of upwelling primitive mantle; 2) 3.6-4.0 Ga: continuity of magmatism recorded in detrital zircons does not favor growth by episodic subduction; Hf isotopes in zircon suggest extensive crustal recycling with some juvenile additions; 3) 3.6-3.2 Ga: a major crust-forming interval with infusion of new crust derived from more depleted sources, including a hydrous, garnet-bearing source; 4) intervening granulite facies metamorphism of supracrustal rocks and orthogneisses, clockwise PTt path, coupled with ductile deformation (~ 750-800oC and 6-8 Kbar); 5) ~2.8-2-9 Ga: a second period of major magmatism resulted from subduction and a volcanic arc was built on the older 3.2-3.5 Ga crust. This geochemical record indicates that the earliest crust formed through diapiric upwelling and anhydrous melting of primitive mantle in a plume setting, followed by recycling of this crust with only limited juvenile additions in the Paleoarchean; in the Mesoarchean the tectonic regime changed to a plate environment that produced two major crust-forming events in a volcanic arc setting—the first involved primarily juvenile additions from the mantle (3.5-3.2 Ga interval) and the second (2.8-2.9 Ga) included melting of a deep mafic source and recycling of sediments similar to Phanerozoic arcs.",

            "abstract": "Northern latitude forests represent an important global sink for carbon dioxide (CO2). Estimating the landscape-scale exchange of CO2 is complicated by the heterogeneity of forested areas. Airborne eddy-covariance measurements can complement continuous tower-based measurements for determining the magnitude and spatial variability of carbon uptake in forested areas, and to assess means for scaling-up. While aircraft provide accessibility, the resulting flux measurements represent a narrow time slice, and average over a comparatively large source area. The goal of this study is to improve our ability to attribute aircraft flux data to finer spatial scales. We hypothesize that this can be achieved by (i) improving the spatial scale of the sampling method, (ii) examining inter-day variability, and (iii) relating airborne eddy-covariance flux estimates to remote sensing determinations of the land cover.\nFor this purpose identical flight experiments were conducted on May 29 and June 1, 2014 over a 240 km2 region encompassing the Harvard University EMS eddy flux tower at Harvard Forest, MA, using the Purdue University ALAR aircraft. In the early afternoon of each day, 19 flight legs, 20 km in length, were flown over the heterogeneous forest canopy. The two replicate experiments allow assessment of inter-day variability in CO2 exchange under similar meteorological conditions. Furthermore, the experiments were coordinated with high-resolution (≤1 m) and medium-resolution (≤100 m) remote sensing retrievals of forest canopy structure and composition (NEON AOP) and soil moisture (NASA AirMOSS), respectively. This unprecedented hierarchy of observations enables evaluation of the ability of different data processing approaches to calculate finer scale CO2 exchange with the surface.\nAnalyses of the flights conducted on May 29 and June 1 show a transect-averaged (± 1σ) CO2 uptake of 13 ± 3 µmol m-2s-1 and 11 ± 2 µmol m-2s-1, respectively. In complement to the aircraft-based estimates, tower measurements averaged over the course of the flights show a CO2 uptake of 6 ± 2 µmol m-2s-1 and 4 ± 1 µmol m-2s-1, respectively.

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) have a profound influence on air quality and climate, but large uncertainties exist in modeling SOA on the global scale. In this study, five SOA parameterization schemes, including a two-product model (TPM), volatility basis-set (VBS) and three cloud SOA schemes (Ervens et al. (2008, 2014), Fu et al. (2008) , and He et al. (2013)), are implemented into the global chemical transport model (MOZART-4). For each scheme, model simulations are conducted with identical boundary and initial conditions. The VBS scheme produces the highest global annual SOA production (close to 35 Tg·y-1), followed by three cloud schemes (26-30 Tg·y-1) and TPM (23 Tg·y-1). Though sharing a similar partitioning theory to the TPM scheme, the VBS approach simulates the chemical aging of multiple generations of VOCs oxidation products, resulting in a much larger SOA source, particularly from aromatic species, over Europe, the Middle East and Eastern America. The formation of SOA in VBS, which represents the net partitioning of semi-volatile organic compounds from vapor to condensed phase, is highly sensitivity to the aging and wet removal processes of vapor-phase organic compounds. The production of SOA from cloud processes (SOAcld) is constrained by the coincidence of liquid cloud water and water-soluble organic compounds. Therefore, all cloud schemes resolve a fairly similar spatial pattern over the tropical and the mid-latitude continents. The spatiotemporal diversity among SOA parameterizations is largely driven by differences in precursor inputs. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the evolution, wet removal, and phase partitioning of semi-volatile organic compounds, particularly above remote land and oceanic areas, is critical to better constrain the global-scale distribution and related climate forcing of secondary organic aerosols.",

Recently, a new high-quality 3D seismic data is acquired in south Yinggehai basin (YGHB) and the detailed interpretations on those seismic profiles as well as RMS amplitude attributes and variance slices reveal a submarine channel system developed in late Miocene, which could be supplied from Hainan Island via turbidity currents so that it would be filled with sand-rich turbidites as good hydrocarbon reservoir. Based on the integration between regional seismic survey and some boreholes, the investigations on its infilling architectures and depositional processes are carried out. The results show that it composes two converged submarine channels with two channelized submarine fans to their west and the main submarine channel (MSC) is characterized by a downstream increasing width and is infilled by sediments with high amplitude seismic facies, which could be originated from channelized submarine fans. Furthermore, the complicated depositional processes around the confluence region of these two channels are pointed out and the interactions between the submarine channel system and nearby channelized submarine fans are discussed. The detailed illustration on the seismic features and depositional processes of the subsurface submarine system provides us better understanding deepwater sedimentary dynamics and would be more benefit for the hydrocarbon exploration in similar deepwater area around the world.",

            "abstract": "Many geologists have discussed slope instability caused by gas-hydrate dissociation, which could make movable fluid in pore space of sediments. However, physical property changes caused by gas hydrate dissociation would not be so simple. Moreover, during the period of natural gas-production from gas-hydrate reservoir applying depressurization method would be completely different phenomena from dissociation processes in nature, because it could not be caused excess pore pressure, even though gas and water exist. Hence, in all cases, physical properties of gas-hydrate bearing sediments and that of their cover sediments are quite important to consider this phenomena, and to carry out simulation to solve focusing phenomena during gas hydrate dissociation periods.\nDaini-Atsumi knoll that was the first offshore gas-production test site from gas-hydrate is partially covered by slumps. Fortunately, one of them was penetrated by both Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) hole and pressure-coring hole. As a result of LWD data analyses and core analyses, we have understood density structure of sediments from seafloor to Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR). The results are mentioned as following.\n・Semi-confined slump showed high-density, relatively. It would be explained by over-consolidation that was result of layer-parallel compression caused by slumping.\n・Bottom sequence of slump has relative high-density zones. It would be explained by shear-induced compaction along slide plane.\n・Density below slump tends to increase in depth. It is reasonable that sediments below slump deposit have been compacting as normal consolidation.\n・Several kinds of log-data for estimating physical properties of gas-hydrate reservoir sediments have been obtained. It will be useful for geological model construction from seafloor until BSR.\nWe can use these results to consider geological model not only for slope instability at slumping, but also for slope stability during depressurized period of gas production from gas-hydrate.\nAcknowledgement\nThis study was supported by funding from the Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan (MH21 Research Consortium) planned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).",

            "abstract": "In recent spacecraft observations, coherent electrostatic solitary wave (ESWs) structures are observed in various regions of the Earth’s magnetosphere. Over the years, many researchers have attempted to model these observations in terms of electron/ion acoustic solitary waves by using nonlinear fluid theory/simulations. The ESW structures predicted by fluid models can be inadequate due to its inability in handling kinetic effects. To provide clear view on the application of the fluid and kinetic treatments in modeling the ESWs, we perform both fluid and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of ion acoustic solitary waves (IASWs) and estimate the quantitative differences in their characteristics like speed, amplitude, and width. It is noted that a long time evolution of Gaussian type perturbations in the equilibrium electron and ion densities generated the nonlinear IASW structures in both fluid and PIC simulations. The IASW structures represent vortices of trapped electrons in PIC simulations. We find that the number of trapped electrons in the wave potential is higher for the large amplitude IASW, which are generated by large-amplitude initial density perturbation (IDP). The present fluid and PIC simulation results are in close agreement for small amplitude IDPs, whereas for large IDPs they show discrepancy in the amplitude, width, and speed of the IASW, which is attributed to negligence of kinetic effects in the former approach. The speed of IASW in the fluid simulations increases with the increase of IASW amplitude, while the reverse tendency is seen in the PIC simulation. The present study suggests that the fluid treatment is appropriate to model the IASW observations when the magnitude of phase velocity of IASW is less than the ion acoustic (IA) speed obtained from their linear dispersion relation, whereas when it exceeds IA speed, it is necessary to include the kinetic effects in the model.",

We construct a series of four synthetic catalogs containing various types of clustering, with each catalog containing 10000 events over 100 years with magnitudes above M = 6. We apply a suite of statistical tests used in the literature to each catalog in order to evaluate the ability of each test to identify the catalog as nonrandom. Our results show that detection ability is dependent on the quantity of data, the nature of the type of clustering in the catalog, and the specific signal used in the statistical test. Catalogs that exhibit a stronger time variation in the seismicity rate are generally easier to identify as nonrandom for a given background rate. We also show that in some cases, a test that fails to identify a catalog as nonrandom can have predictive power to bound the range of possible clustering strengths of a certain type. Our results help in the interpretation of the results of statistical tests on the global earthquake record since 1900.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution surface atmospheric fields play a crucial role in modeling the ocean surface and subsurface processes. For narrow sea basins surrounded by complex topography, like the Red Sea, available global reanalyses may not supply accurate boundary information to ocean models because of their coarse resolution. To fulfill the respective needs of ocean models in the Red Sea, we have generated high-resolution regional reanalysis by assimilating available observation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for a period of one year (2009). The three-/four-dimensional variational data assimilation (3/4DVAR) methods were used for assimilation. We have evaluated the quality of these regional reanalysis products using observations from synoptic stations, scatterometers and buoy. We have also compare the outputs with three global reanalysis datasets of different resolutions; NCEP-GFS, ERA-Interim and Japanese 55 Year Reanalysis. The comparison suggests that the seasonal pattern of wind is reasonably reproduced in all the reanalysis products, however there is an increased sensitivity around mountain gaps for high-resolution reanalysis, where the channeling effect is well represented in 4DVAR with an accurate spatial structure. Among the ocean surface processes, waves are one of the quick and direct responders of changes in wind fields. We have considered a wave model set up for the Red Sea to evaluate the relevance of the different reanalysis products. Comparison with buoy observations indicates that wave simulations resulting from the regional reanalysis are more accurate than the global reanalysis products.",

            "abstract": "Enabling real-time decision support, particularly under conditions of uncertainty, requires computationally efficient algorithms that can rapidly generate recommendations. In this paper, a suite of model predictive control (MPC) genetic algorithms are developed and tested offline to explore their value for reducing CSOs during real-time use in a deep-tunnel sewer system. MPC approaches include the micro-GA, the probability-based compact GA, and domain-specific GA methods that reduce the number of decision variable values analyzed within the sewer hydraulic model, thus reducing algorithm search space. Minimum fitness and constraint values achieved by all GA approaches, as well as computational times required to reach the minimum values, are compared to large population sizes with long convergence times.\nOptimization results for a subset of the Chicago combined sewer system indicate that genetic algorithm variations with coarse decision variable representation, eventually transitioning to the entire range of decision variable values, are most efficient at addressing the CSO control problem. Although diversity-enhancing micro-GAs evaluate a larger search space and exhibit shorter convergence times, these representations do not reach minimum fitness and constraint values. The domain-specific GAs prove to be the most efficient and are used to test CSO sensitivity to energy costs, CSO penalties, and pressurization constraint values. The results show that CSO volumes are highly dependent on the tunnel pressurization constraint, with reductions of 13% to 77% possible with less conservative operational strategies. Because current management practices may not account for varying costs at CSO locations and electricity rate changes in the summer and winter, the sensitivity of the results is evaluated for variable seasonal and diurnal CSO penalty costs and electricity-related system maintenance costs, as well as different sluice gate constraint levels. These findings indicate that optimal operating strategies are governed by tunnel pressurization constraint values regardless of the CSO penalty and energy costs.",

In this project we are evaluating the climatology of the nocturnal E region based on the computed E-region Total Electron Content (ErTEC) below 150km. For this, we considered seasonal variation, solar activity, and geomagnetic disturbances. We have analyzed 120 days of data covering the nocturnal E region altitudes (below 150km) from 1986 to 1999. As a conclusion, in the midnight period the ErTEC values are lower during high solar flux in all the seasons except for summertime; it responds differently to solar flux. Results also show high electron density during winter, only at sunset and sunrise. In terms of geomagnetic conditions, summer has a very low percentage of variation for geomagnetic activity while Equinox period display strong variability between ErTEC values during high and low solar activity periods due to geomagnetic disturbances. In addition, winter time exhibits decreasing of ErTEC with the increase of geomagnetic condition independently of the solar activity.",

            "abstract": "The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the world’s strongest current, and acts as a conduit that transports water between Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. ACC transport is a key metric used to evaluate the accuracy of ocean and climate models. The canonical transport of 134 Sv through Drake Passage, the narrowest choke point of the ACC, derives from a year-long experiment conducted in 1979 (DRAKE79). Recent studies suggest that this historical value may be biased low by as much as 20%. DRAKE79 transport estimates resulted from a complicated synthesis of historical data and in-situ measurements, and relied heavily on the outcome of referencing three hydrographic sections with directly measured currents. This study focuses on evaluating DRAKE79’s geostrophic referencing technique. We hypothesized that the horizontal spacing and temporal averaging of current meters led to a bias in the historical estimate. Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) was used as a test bed to evaluate DRAKE79 methods. A mean AAC transport of 181.5 ± 17.6 Sv was obtained by applying DRAKE79 methods to 2005 SOSE output. This value is greater than SOSE’s “true” geostrophic transport (153.0 ± 5.7) by 29 Sv. This difference resulted primarily from linear interpolation between two lost moorings; however the horizontal spacing of the current meters did not resolve the narrow jets of the ACC regardless of mooring loss. Within SOSE, geostrophic transports referenced with velocities at all mooring locations resulted in a mean transport of 161.0 ± 10.2 Sv. Temporal smoothing of the reference velocities, using up to a 20-day running mean, had minimal impact on the mean transport estimate. A next step would evaluate whether the mooring positions should be modified within SOSE to capture the same circulation features as DRAKE79.",

            "abstract": "The ability to make range resolved measurements of CO2 in the lower atmosphere is critical to helping understand regional scale sources and sinks while providing data essential for validating the future ASCENDS mission. The Return-to-Zero Pseudo Noise modulation technique has been explored for making range resolved retrievals of CO2 within the lower troposphere using commercial off the shelf technology. It generates multiple laser pulses within the detector’s field of view while still enabling range resolved measurements. This permits a much higher duty cycle to be achieved than if using a normal pulsed laser. Because of issues relating to how this technique treats background counts a different approach to the conventional DIAL online/offline has been explored. This involves stepping over an absorption line using a number of discrete wavelengths to map out the line. The data is then fit to a theoretical curve which permits the accurate determination of CO2 over the path. This approach is similar in implementation to that employed by the Goddard ASCENDS instrument except that the laser is now modulated with the RZPN technique. An assessment of this approach with particular emphasis on how it treats background counts will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "A multitude of actual processes operating on hydrological networks may exhibit binary outcomes such as clean streams in a river network that may become contaminated. These binary outcomes can be modeled by node removal processes (attacks) acting in a network. Network robustness against attacks has been widely studied in fields as diverse as the Internet, power grids and human societies. However, the current definition of robustness is only accounting for the connectivity of the nodes unaffected by the attack. Here, we put forward the idea that the connectivity of the affected nodes can play a crucial role in proper evaluation of the overall network robustness and its future recovery from the attack. Specifically, we propose a dual perspective approach wherein at any instant in the network evolution under attack, two distinct networks are defined: (i) the Active Network (AN) composed of the unaffected nodes and (ii) the Idle Network (IN) composed of the affected nodes. The proposed robustness metric considers both the efficiency of destroying the AN and the efficiency of building-up the IN. This approach is motivated by concrete applied problems, since, for example, if we study the dynamics of contamination in river systems, it is necessary to know both the connectivity of the healthy and contaminated parts of the river to assess its ecological functionality. We show that trade-offs between the efficiency of the Active and Idle network dynamics give rise to surprising crossovers and re-ranking of different attack strategies, pointing to significant implications for decision making.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization, climate uncertainty, and ecosystem change represent major challenges for managing water resources. Water systems and the forces acting upon them are complex, and there is a need to understand and generically represent the most important system components and linkages. We developed a framework to facilitate understanding of water systems including potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for sustainability. Our goal was to produce an interdisciplinary framework for water resources research to address water issues across scales (e.g., city to region) and domains (e.g., water supply and quality, urban and transitioning landscapes). An interdisciplinary project (iUTAH – innovative Urban Transitions and Aridregion Hydro-sustainability) with a large (N=~100), diverse team having expertise spanning the hydrologic, biological, ecological, engineering, social, planning, and policy sciences motivated the development of this framework. The framework was developed through review of the literature, meetings with individual researchers, and workshops with participants. The Structure-Water-Actor Framework (SWAF) includes three main components: water (quality and quantity), structure (natural, built, and social), and actors (individual and organizational). Key linkages include: 1) ecological and hydrological processes, 2) ecosystem and geomorphic change, 3) planning, design, and policy, 4) perceptions, information, and experience, 5) resource access, and 6) operational water use and management. Our expansive view of structure includes natural, built, and social components, allowing us to examine a broad set of tools and levers for water managers and decision-makers to affect system sustainability and understand system outcomes. We validate the SWAF and illustrate its flexibility to generate insights for three research and management problems: green stormwater infrastructure in an arid environment, regional water supply and demand, and urban river restoration. These applications show that the framework can help identify key components and linkages across diverse water systems.",

            "abstract": "River deltas are intricate landscapes with complex channel networks that self-organize to deliver water, sediment, and nutrients from the apex to the delta top and eventually to the coastal zone. The natural balance of material and energy fluxes which maintains a stable hydrologic, geomorphologic, and ecological state of a river delta, is often disrupted by external factors causing topological and dynamical changes in the delta structure and function. A formal quantitative framework for studying river delta topology and transport dynamics and their response to change is lacking. Here we present such a framework based on spectral graph theory and demonstrate its value in quantifying the complexity of the delta network topology, computing its steady state fluxes, and identifying upstream (contributing) and downstream (nourishment) areas from any point in the network. We use this framework to construct vulnerability maps that quantify the relative change of sediment and water delivery to the shoreline outlets in response to possible perturbations in hundreds of upstream links. This enables us to evaluate which links (hotspots) and what management scenarios would most influence flux delivery to the outlets, paving the way of systematically examining how local or spatially distributed delta interventions can be studied within a systems approach for delta sustainability.",

            "abstract": "A ‘tailing’ pattern of rapid initial contaminant concentration decline followed by sustained release at a lower concentration is commonly produced by active remediation strategies. The ability of aquitard layers to cause this pattern is recognized. However, we hypothesize that nonlinear sorption combined with intragranular diffusion and mass storage within coarse, porous grains, can also cause tailing. Our project combines laboratory measurements of the equilibrium sorption isotherm for trichloroethene (TCE), release measurements from granular samples, and simulations of retarded intragranular diffusion. A novel aspect of our study is that we are examining a sample containing condensed kerogen as the primary form of organic matter on the impact of TCE mass storage, uptake and release rates. The kerogen-containing marine sedimentary rock used in our study is representative of the source rock of the surficial glacial aquifers in the southern Ontario, Canada region. The fact that energy producing shale units occur within the regional stratigraphic sequences indicates the high level of thermal maturation of the kerogen that comprises the sorbent for TCE in these samples. The equilibrium sorption isotherm spans nearly five orders of magnitude in aqueous concentration and is nonlinear. Preliminary comparisons between the mass release curve for grains equilibrated with a high TCE aqueous concentration (ca. 1000 mg/L) show that the physically-based model, which represents release controlled by intragranular diffusion with nonlinear local equilibrium sorption, provides a reasonable fit to the observed data with modest adjustment of the independently determined parameters. Additional experiments documenting TCE release from samples equilibrated at different initial aqueous concentrations and of different grain sizes will also be evaluated using the model and the results compared. Through extending simulations to the field scale, our results will contribute to a general understanding of the importance of the subject processes in sustaining contaminant plumes and will inform more effective remediation.",

            "abstract": "Okmok Volcano, a dominantly basaltic volcanic complex that occupies most of the northeastern end of Umnak Island, is among the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc (Lu and Dzurisin, 2014). Minor ash eruptions were reported a dozen times since the 1930s. Blocky basalt flows were extruded during dominantly effusive eruptions in 1945, 1958, and 1997, together with minor amounts of ash. From the 1930s to 1997, all of Okmok’s eruptions originated from Cone A within the summit caldera. The most recent eruption at Okmok during July-August 2008 was by far the largest and most explosive eruption since at least the early 19th century. The eruption issued from a new vent in the northeast part of the caldera near Cone D, about 5 km northeast of Cone A. The eruption was strongly hydrovolcanic in nature and produced a new tuff cone roughly 240 m high, dramatically altering the landscape inside the caldera.\nInterferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations suggest that a magma reservoir, probably an interconnected network of magma bodies of varying sizes located beneath the caldera and centered ~3 km BSL, was responsible for volcano-wide deformation during 1992-2008, including the 1997 and 2008 eruptions (Lu and Dzurisin, 2014). The reservoir inflated at a variable rate before the 1997 and 2008 eruptions, and withdrawal of magma during both eruptions depressurized the reservoir, causing rapid volcano-wide subsidence. In this study, we report re-inflation of the Okmok reservoir from 2008 to 2014. InSAR imagery from X-band TerraSAR-X, C-band Envisat and L-band ALOS PALSAR satellites indicate that Okmok started inflating soon after the end of 2008 eruption at a rate of 5-10 cm/year, which is confirmed by GPS measurements. Deformation modeling suggests the inflation source is located beneath the center of Okmok caldera at ~3 km BSL, which is essentially the same location responsible for uplift and subsidence during 1992-2008.\nLu, Z., and Dzurisin, D., 2014. “InSAR Imaging of Aleutian Volcanoes: Monitoring a Volcanic Arc from Space”, Springer Praxis Books, Geophysical Sciences, ISBN 978-3-642-00347-9, 390 pp.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) deposition-induced soil acidification has become a global problem. However, the response patterns of soil acidification to N addition and the underlying mechanisms remain far from unclear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 106 studies to reveal global patterns of soil acidification in responses to N addition. We found that N addition significantly reduced soil pH by 0.23 on average globally. However, the response ratio of soil pH varied with ecosystem types, N addition rate, N fertilization forms, and experimental durations. Soil pH decreased most in grassland, whereas boreal forest was insensitive to N addition in soil acidification. Soil pH decreased linearly with N addition rates. Addition of urea and NH4NO3 contributed more to soil acidification than NH4-form fertilizer. When experimental duration was longer than 20 years, N addition effects on soil acidification diminished. Environmental factors such as initial soil pH, soil carbon and nitrogen content, precipitation, and temperature all influenced the response ratio of soil pH. Base cations of Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ were critical important in buffering against N-induced soil acidification at the early stage. However, N addition has shifted global soils into the Al3+ buffering phase. Overall, this study indicates that acidification in global soils is very sensitive to N deposition, which is greatly modified by biotic and abiotic factors. Global soils are now at a buffering transition from base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+) to non-base cations (Mn2+ and Al3+). This calls our attention to care about the limitation of base cations and the toxic impact of non-base cations for terrestrial ecosystems with N deposition.",

In order to constrain the abundances of light elements in planetary cores, it is crucial to determine the density and sound velocity of Fe-light element alloying liquids under core conditions. In this study, sound velocities of Fe-rich liquids were determined by combining the ultrasonic measurements with synchrotron X-ray radiography and diffraction techniques under high-pressure and temperature conditions from 1 to 6 GPa and 1573 to 1973 K. An Fe-C composition (Fe-5wt%C) and four Fe-Si compositions (Fe-10wt%Si, Fe-17wt%Si, Fe-25wt%Si, and FeSi) were studied. Compared to our previous results on the velocity of Fe and Fe-S liquids at high pressures (Jing et al., 2014, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 396, 78-87), the presence of both C and Si increases the velocity of liquid Fe, in contrast to the effect of S. The measured velocities of Fe-C and Fe-Si liquids increase with compression and decrease slightly with increasing temperature. Combined with 1-atm density data in the literature, the high-pressure velocity data provide tight constraints on the equations of state and thermodynamic properties such as the adiabatic temperature gradient for Fe-C and Fe-Si liquids. We will discuss these results with implications to planetary cores.",

            "abstract": "Microfabrics of natural rocks as well as of those deformed in laboratory experiments are studied post-mortem, the history of fabric evolution being inferred from a finite state. This is a major drawback when being interested in modification of fabrics related to progressive deformation. Here we present a novel approach to analyze and compare fabrics in different stages of evolution, taking spatial position to mimic a time series. Using this approach, evolution in time can be investigated on one sample deformed in a single indentation creep test. Such experiments at high temperatures and atmospheric pressure provide information on mechanical properties of rock-forming minerals as well as on microfabrics developed during inhomogeneous deformation underneath the indenter. Using a conventional creep apparatus, a cylindrical alumina indenter, 2 mm in diameter, is driven by a dead load into the flat surface of a specimen. A penetration depth of 1 mm is typically reached after hours to days, depending on material, applied temperature, and load. Previous experiments on natural, polycrystalline anhydrite carried out at temperatures between 700°C and 920 °C yield a stress exponent of 3.9 indicating deformation in the dislocation creep regime, consistent with microstructural observations (Dorner et al., 2014; Solid Earth). Within a cone-shaped region in front of the indenter, the original microfabric appears entirely unaffected. The neutral cone is mantled by highly deformed shear zones. During progressive indentation this structure of undeformed cone and shear zones propagates into the specimen. Thus, for a homogeneous starting material, serial sections of the deformed specimen normal to the indenter axis provide insight into fabrics in distinct stages of evolution. Microfabrics developed at different distance in front of the approaching indenter can be taken to represent a time series. A disadvantage of the technique is that the history of shear zone deformation is complex, comprising components of tangential stretching and simple shear, which complicates the interpretation of fabrics and crystallographic preferred orientations. Notwithstanding, indentation creep tests seem to be a sound experimental approach to study microstructural evolution in time using a single experimentally deformed sample.",

            "abstract": "Ripples are directly influenced by the intensity and direction of near bed flow. Ripple geometric response to unidirectional or oscillatory dominant forcing has definable characteristics respective to each regime, but is less understood in conditions of combined forcing, specifically orthogonal wave and mean current forcing. Previous studies (e.g. Smyth and Li, 2005; Lacy et al., 2007) have suggested that increasingly divergent orientation in wave and current forcing may increase ripple crest sinuosity (meandering). This, in turn, affects ripple migration and ripple defect generation and density (Faraci and Anderson, 2002). In similar fashion, seabed objects, through scour and current steering, may affect ripple morphology, disrupting ripple migration and serving as nodal points for ripple defect generation. With the Fingerprint Algorithm imagery analysis technique (Skarke and Trembanis, 2011), it is now possible to effectively quantify spatial-temporal evolution of ripple morphology from acoustic imagery. Using in situ hydrodynamic and acoustic imagery data from near-shore instrument moorings, this study investigates the influence of combined flow on ripple sinuosity patterns and the relationship of sinuosity to ripple defect location and density. Further, it examines defect density with respect to proximity and orientation to seabed objects, and considers specific characteristics of object influence on ripple migration patterns. Initial findings suggest ripple defect density increases in area of increased ripple crest sinuosity and near seabed objects.",

            "abstract": "Estimating the spatiotemporal distribution of soil water content is crucial for ecosystem understanding because of its strong influence on vegetation dynamics, surface-subsurface energy exchange, water and heat flux, microbial activity and biogeochemical mechanisms. In particular, quantifying Arctic ecosystem feedbacks to climate requires advances in monitoring soil moisture in sufficiently high resolution over modeling-relevant scales, and in understanding its coupling with landscape and soil characteristics.\nAs part of the DOE Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE-Arctic) we investigated diverse strategies to estimate the soil water content spatial distribution in Arctic tundra using various proxies including electrical conductivity from electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and from electromagnetic induction imaging, dielectric permittivity from time-domain reflectometery (TDR), and vegetation index from low-altitude multi-spectral imaging. In addition to occasional campaigns along a 500x40 m corridor, high temporal resolution is achieved through continuous monitoring of surface and subsurface dynamics along a 35 m transect using ERT, temperature loggers, TDR, and visible and NIR imaging from pole-based cameras. This was conducted at the NGEE Barrow, AK site.\nThe results of this study inform on the complementary nature of and trade-offs between various approaches with regard to accuracy, resolution and coverage. In short, while point-scale measurements are relatively hard data, ERT data improves spatiotemporal monitoring of soil water content and state, and low-altitude aerial imaging can be used to extend predictions at larger scale using field-dependent relationships. Importantly, this study enables the identification of spatiotemporal links between soil and landscape properties (such as water inundation, vegetation, topography, thaw layer thickness, water content, temperature, and snow thickness). While some of these properties show strong co-variability, other features show more spatially and temporally variable relations or more complex linkages. Overall, identifying such links is crucial for extrapolating strong knowledge at specific sites over larger scales and for improving parameterization of models simulating ecosystem feedbacks to climate.",

            "abstract": "The POLENET-ANET project is simultaneously resolving crustal motions, measured by GPS, and earth structure and rheological properties, mapped by seismology. Measured vertical and horizontal crustal motion patterns are not explained by extant glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models. These models have ice histories dominated by ice loss following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and rely on 1D earth models, with rheological properties varying only radially. Seismological results from POLENET-ANET are revealing significant complexity in lateral variation in earth properties. For example, crustal thickness variations occur not only across the East-West Antarctic boundary, but also between crustal blocks within West Antarctica. Modeling of mantle viscosity based on shear wave velocities shows a sharp lateral gradient from high-to-low viscosity in the Ross Embayment, a much more gradual gradient in the Weddell Embayment, and very low viscosities below Marie Byrd Land and the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE). Remarkable vertical and horizontal bedrock crustal motion velocity magnitudes, directions and patterns correlate spatially, in many aspects, with earth property variations mapped by seismology.\nWithin the ASE, extremely high upward velocities are flanked by subsiding regions – neither predicted by GIA models. Given the thin crust and low mantle viscosity, it is likely that this is not an LGM signal, which would have already relaxed, and uplift due to the elastic response to modern ice mass change clearly is important. Along the East-West Antarctic boundary in the Ross Embayment, GIA-induced horizontal crustal motions are toward, rather than away from, the principal ice load center, correlating spatially with the strong lateral gradient in crustal thickness and mantle viscosity. In the Weddell Embayment region, where crustal thickness is intermediate between East and West Antarctica and mantle viscosity values are moderate, crustal motions show the best match with predictions of GIA models. It is clear that lateral variations in earth properties fundamentally control the isostatic response to ice mass changes in Antarctica. Ongoing, integrated seismic-GPS studies are critical to developing the next generation of GIA models.",

            "abstract": "Continued changes to the thermal, hydrological and geotechnical conditions of permafrost have led to degradation and changes in the active layer resulting in increased permafrost disturbance across the Canadian High Arctic. Active layer detachments (ALDs) and mudboils, two forms of permafrost disturbance, are both triggered by high pore-water pressure resulting from deep active layer thaw and increased precipitation. Recent work completed at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO), in the Canadian High Arctic, has found that these two features of permafrost disturbance are associated with distinct environments; ALDs are commonly found on vegetated slopes, whereas mudboils occur on flat, less vegetated terrain. This implies that on transitional slopes pore water pressures may continue to increase resulting in ALDs in these areas over others. Mudboils act as an indicator of potentially hazardous subsurface fluid pressures that may lead to slope failure. Susceptibility maps generated using predictive modeling approaches can provide insight into landscape characteristics driving the formation of both types of features by identifying areas with high, moderate, and low susceptibility to future disturbance.\nPermafrost slope disturbance susceptibility models have been successfully applied to a study area at CBAWO to identify areas prone to future slope disturbance. Using a generalized additive model (GAM), the model was fitted for disturbed and undisturbed locations using GIS-derived geomorphological predictor variables including: slope, potential incoming solar radiation, wetness index, curvature, geology, and distance to water. Current modeling is underway to produce mudboil susceptibility maps using the same predictor variables, with the addition of vegetation. Comparison of the resulting susceptibility maps can be used to understand the relation between the two forms of disturbance through the assessment of their spatial distribution. Both active layer detachments and mudboils are driven by similar climatic and landscape phenomena, and as such, greater knowledge of the spatial links between them is needed to understand the nature of future permafrost degradation.",

            "abstract": "Low-frequency radio observations of the Sun with the MWA have revealed a previously unknown class of weak radio events, with durations on the order of 1 second or less, and frequency widths of a few MHz. This radio phenomenon is not well-understood, and insight generation is difficult due to the large volume of data produced by the MWA at rates of several terabytes per hour. To address this situation, we developed a new approach for the detection, characterization, and classification of such events, as well as for the well-known Type III flares. Our technique consists of a pipeline of processing steps that starts with background noise estimation and subtraction. Radio events are then isolated algorithmically using region-growing techniques, wavelet decompositions, and thresholding. Physical parameter metadata for each event are then extracted and stored in a database. Scientists can query these data, filter events based on specified properties, and generate statistics and plots for exploratory studies. Our toolset is the first to empower MWA solar scientists with such computational intelligence in order to enhance their ability to interpret large numbers of short-lived events in voluminous MWA data. Computer vision approaches on solar images obtained from optical, x-ray, and infrared instruments are thus complemented by detections of phenomena in the radio frequency domain.",

Recent 16S rRNA gene studies examining temporal microbial community dynamics of returned fluids from hydraulically fractured wells in the Marcellus Shale indicate ecosystem changes from aerobic, low-salt associated microbes in injected fluids to anaerobic, halophilic taxa in produced fluids several months after fracturing. To further characterize changes in the ecology, functional potential and biosignatures of observed taxa, we sequenced genomic DNA from three key time points after fracturing (T7, T82, and T328; Tn, n = days) and analyzed their lipid signatures. The metagenomic profiles verify 16S rRNA gene trends, revealing strain-type changes in dominant Bacteria of Marinobacter, Halomonas, and Halanaerobium and the Archaeal genus Methanolobus through time. Novel species within the γ-Proteobacteria were also observed. Reconstructed genomes show as bioavailable N decreases through time, genes associated with N2 fixing and obtaining N from organic pools (ncd2, nit1, and eutCB) increase in T82 and T328 samples after oxidized nitrogen species (NO3) are depleted. Further, S oxidizing genes were only detected in the T7 sample with incomplete pathways for dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR). Later time points showed an increase in abundance of sulfonate importer genes and the anaerobic DSR gene, asrA, suggesting the use of sulfite and sulfonates for S acquisition after sulfate is depleted. Lipid analyses confirmed distinct profiles between T82 and T328 and revealed differences in 16 and 18 C monounsaturated fatty acids, indicative of gram (-) bacteria. The lipid profile from T328 was markedly less diverse than that of T82 and indicated a very limited community, as supported by the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic data. This research integrates metagenomic data with lipid profiles to characterize temporal changes in biosignatures and the functional potential of N and S metabolic genes of deep shale microbes.",

From the InSAR solution, we see a strong depth cut-off at 10km depth, above which there was no slip on the fault. We have carried out an investigation of the geomorphological expression of the fault in quaternary material, to determine whether the fault reaches the surface and, if so, whether this upper section could fail in an earthquake. On the western segment of the Van fault, we observe quaternary scarps coincident with the surface projection of the fault segment identified by InSAR, which displace quaternary alluvial fan and lake-bed deposits. These are coincident with the observation of fault gouge in quaternary deposits at a road cutting, providing evidence for a fault reaching the surface and suggesting that the upper section is capable of rupturing seismically. We use structure-from-motion photogrammetry, differential GPS and terrestrial LiDAR to determine offsets on two generations of fault scarps, and the creep offsets from the period following the earthquake. Preliminary radiocarbon and OSL dates from two uplifted terrace surfaces allow us to estimate a late quaternary geological slip-rate for the fault. Following the GPS and InSAR solution of Dogan et al. 2014 (GRL v41,i7), we also present field evidence and satellite image observations confirming the presence of a splay fault within the northern suburbs of Van city, which experienced creep following the 2011 earthquake. This fault is observed to be particularly evident in the early high resolution satellite imagery from the declassified CORONA missions, highlighting the potential for these datasets in identifying faults in areas now covered by urban sprawl. It remains unclear whether this fault could fail seismically. The fault which failed in 2011 is a north dipping reverse fault, unmapped prior to the earthquake. We identify similar geomorphological structures in the surrounding region, highlighting the need for further detailed tectonic mapping of the region.",

            "abstract": "Rat (also called Hawadax) Island in the western Aleutian forearc is located at the southern terminus of the Bowers Ridge where the Aleutian and Bowers Ridges meet at ~180° W. Relative to nearby Aleutian Islands, Rat Island is northwest of Amchitka, southeast of Kiska and south of Little Sitkin Volcano. Given the location of Rat Island, the question arises as to whether the geochemistry of the volcanic rocks reflects the Aleutian Arc or Bowers Ridge and what insight can be gained into processes forming the Aleutian and Bowers Ridges. In their reconnaissance mapping of Rat Island, the USGS (Lewis et al., 1960) separated the volcano-sedimentary units on Rat Island into the older Rat and younger Gunners Cove Formations, which were considered to be Oligocene-Miocene in age based on fossil evidence. A new 12.91±0.06 Ma plagioclase Ar/Ar age for a Rat Formation andesite porphyry shows the Rat Island rocks are significantly younger than the ~26 Ma andesitic and ~ 22 Ma seamount rocks dated by Wanke et al. (2012) on the Bowers Ridge. The new age places the Rat Formation andesites in the latest middle Miocene magmatic episode recognized along the Aleutian Arc from Medny Island in the west to Unalaska Island in the east.\nChemically magmatism on Rat Island progressed from the calc-alkaline porphyritic hornblende andesites in the Rat Formation to the tholeiitic basalts in the Gunners Cove Formation, in contrast to much of the Aleutians where the typical sequence is reversed. The Rat Formation andesites have REE patterns like Aleutian volcanic rocks to the east, classic subduction zone depletions in Nb and Ta, slight enrichments in Th and larger enrichments in Ba, U, K, Pb and Sr as do most pre-Pleistocene Aleutian magmatic rocks to the east. Rat andesites (57-65% SiO2) differ from Bowers Ridge andesites (55-59% SiO2) in having less adakitic-like Sm/Yb (~ 2 vs. ~3-4) and La/Ta (47-80 vs. 100-160) ratios. εNd values (+7 to +8.9) on Rat Island are similar to those on Adak to the east and lower than those on Attu to the west and on the Bowers Ridge; 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70315-0.70335) are similar to those on Adak and the Bowers Ridge. Overall, the geochemistry of Rat Island magmatic rocks resembles central and eastern Aleutian pre-Pleistocene magmatic rocks and is distinct from that of most pre-Pleistocene rocks in the western Aleutians.",

            "abstract": "Early warning is a key element for disaster risk reduction. In recent decades, major advancements have been made in medium range and seasonal flood forecasting. This progress provides a great opportunity to reduce agriculture damage and improve advisories for early action and planning for flood hazards. This approach can facilitate proactive rather than reactive management of the adverse consequences of floods. In the agricultural sector, for instance, farmers can take a diversity of options such as changing cropping patterns, applying fertilizer, irrigating and changing planting timing. An experimental medium range (1-10 day) flood forecasting model has been developed for Bangladesh and Thailand. It provides 51 sets of discharge ensemble forecasts of 1-10 days with significant persistence and high certainty. This type of forecast could assist farmers and other stakeholders for differential preparedness activities. These ensembles probabilistic flood forecasts have been customized based on user-needs for community-level application focused on agriculture system. The vulnerabilities of agriculture system were calculated based on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Indicators for risk and vulnerability assessment were conducted through community consultations. The forecast lead time requirement, user-needs, impacts and management options for crops were identified through focus group discussions, informal interviews and community surveys. This paper illustrates potential applications of such ensembles for probabilistic medium range flood forecasts in a way that is not commonly practiced globally today.",

            "abstract": "Recent public interest in high volume slickwater hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) has drawn increased interest in wastewater management practices by the public, researchers, industry, and regulators. The management of wastes, including both fluids and solids, poses many engineering challenges, including elevated total dissolved solids and elevated activities of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). One management option for wastewater in particular, which is used in western Pennsylvania, USA, is treatment at centralized waste treatment facilities [1]. Previous studies conducted from 2010-2012 indicated that one centralized facility, the Josephine Brine Treatment facility, removed the majority of radium from produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid (HFFF) during treatment, but low activities of radium remained in treated effluent and were discharged to surface water [2]. Despite the treatment process and radium reduction, high activities (200 times higher than upstream/background) accumulated in stream sediments at the point of effluent discharge. Here we present new results from sampling conducted at two additional centralized waste treatment facilities (Franklin Brine Treatment and Hart Brine Treatment facilities) and Josephine Brine Treatment facility conducted in June 2014. Preliminary results indicate radium is released to surface water at very low (<50 pCi/L) to non-detectable activities, however; radium continues to accumulate in sediments surrounding the area of effluent release. Combined, the data indicate that 1) radium continues to be released to surface water streams in western Pennsylvania despite oil and gas operators voluntary ban on treatment and disposal of HFFF in centralized waste treatment facilities, 2) radium accumulation in sediments occurred at multiple brine treatment facilities and is not isolated to a single accidental release of contaminants or a single facility.\n[1] Wilson, J.

            "abstract": "Mean winter air temperatures have risen by approximately 2.5˚ C per decade over the last fifty years in the northeastern U.S., reducing the maximum depth of winter snowpack by approximately 26 cm over this period and the duration of winter snow cover by 3.6 to 4.2 days per decade. Forest soils in this region are projected to experience a greater number of freeze-thaw cycles and lower minimum winter soil temperatures as the depth and duration of winter snow cover declines in the next century. Climate change is likely to result not only in lower soil temperatures during winter, but also higher soil temperatures during the growing-season. We conducted two complementary experiments to determine how colder soils in winter and warmer soils in the growing-season affect microbial activity in hardwood forests at Harvard Forest, MA and Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH. A combination of removing snow via shoveling and buried heating cables were used to induce freeze-thaw events during winter and to warm soils 5˚C above ambient temperatures during the growing-season. Increasing the depth and duration of soil frost via snow-removal resulted in short-term reductions in soil nitrogen (N) production via microbial proteolytic enzyme activity and net N mineralization following snowmelt, prior to tree leaf-out. Declining mass specific rates of carbon (C) and N mineralization associated with five years of snow removal at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest may be an indication of microbial physiological adaptation to winter climate change. Freeze-thaw cycles during winter reduced microbial extracellular enzyme activity and the temperature sensitivity of microbial C and N mineralization during the growing-season, potentially offsetting nutrient and soil C losses due to soil warming in the growing-season. Our multiple experimental approaches show that winter climate change is likely to contribute to reduced microbial activity in northern hardwood forests.",

            "abstract": "As the Earth’s climate is predicted to change significantly in terms of warmer temperature and higher precipitation extremes during this century due to the increased combustion of fossil fuels, accurate estimations of the frequencies of future hydrological extremes are important to understanding the potential impacts of changes in climate on water resources management, particularly in accessing flood risk. The goal of this study is to use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a distributed landscape-scale hydrological model, to predict current streamflow and the potential impacts of climate change on future stream flows in the Illinois River watershed in the Midwestern United States. Subsequently Gumbel distribution (Extreme Value Type Ⅰ) is fitted to the annual maxima simulated streamflow to derive a number of return periods of future hydrological extremes. The question in this study is: How do the return periods of future hydrological extremes change under future climate change scenarios and what factors cause the change? Daily simulated future streamflow from 2046-2065 and 2081-2100 are simulated using SWAT model based on nine separate downscaled global climate models (GCM) with three emissions scenarios. SWAT model predictions generally indicate that annual streamflow will likely decrease due to warmer temperatures. Based on the simulated daily streamflow, probability models for annual maxima flows frequency analysis are developed using Gumbel distribution and the values of hydrological extremes for different return periods including 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 years are derived. The change of return periods of hydrological extremes and the implications will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The link between volatiles and mantle melting has so far been illuminated by experiments, revealing that ppm concentration levels of carbon and other volatiles in the Earth’s mantle induce partial melting. Pressure-temperature conditions of incipient melting for CO2-H2O-peridotite [1] match fairly well with the upper part of the LVZ, as the redox melting [2] with the lower part. Recent experimental studies about the Earth mantle conductivity have shown the importance of small amounts of hydrated CO2-rich melts in the geophysical signature of the LVZ [3]. Although such melts are stable under the P-T-fO2 conditions of the LVZ [1-2, 4-6], the variability of these parameters complicates the definition of their chemical composition.\nUsing Margules’ formalisms, we established a multi-component model describing the Gibbs free energy of melt produced by mantle melting in presence of CO2-H2O, that are carbonatite-carbonated melt-nephilinite-basanite and basalt with increasing degree of partial melting. This parameterization is calibrated on crystal-liquid, redox, fluid-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria obtained by experimental studies in the P-T range 1-10 GPa and 900-1800°C.\nWe propose a calculation of the composition of melts produced in the oceanic LVZ as a function of ages (temperature) and chemical heterogeneities (water, alkalis). At about 80 km depth, we show that the composition of the melts is > 30 wt% SiO2 for ages < 30 Ma, and comes closer to the carbonatitic terms for older lithosphere. Besides lateral chemical variations, our model calculates the melt composition along an oceanic ridge adiabat, predicting an abrupt compositional transition between a H2O-rich carbonatitic melt and a carbonated silicate melt, between 130 km and 100 km. We propose a chemical mapping of the melt composition (and of the degree of partial melting) as a function of the distance to the ridge and of the depth. Our model represents an innovating attempt to connect the chemical variations between carbonated and silicated melts with the geophysical observations.\n[1] Wallace & Green, 1988, Nature 335, 343-346\n[2] Stagno et al., 2013, Nature 493, 84-88\n[3] Sifré et al., 2014, Nature 509, 81-85\n[4] Presnall & Gudfinnsson, 2005, SPGSA 388, 207-216\n[5] Hirschmann et al., 2009, PEPI 176, 54-68\n[6] Dasgupta et al., 2013, Nature 493, 211-215",

            "abstract": "Weather is the most significant factor affecting aircraft operations, accounting for 70-80% of passenger delays and costing airlines hundreds of millions of dollars per year in lost revenue. Temperature and airport elevation significantly influence the maximum allowable takeoff weight of an aircraft by changing the surface air density and thus the lift produced at a given speed. For a given runway length, airport elevation, and aircraft type there is a temperature threshold above which the airplane cannot take off at its maximum weight and thus must be weight restricted. The number of summer days necessitating weight restriction has increased since 1980 along with the observed increase in surface temperature. Climate change is projected to increase mean temperatures at all airports and significantly increase the frequency and severity of extreme heat events at some. These changes will negatively affect aircraft performance, leading to increased weight restrictions especially at airports with short runways and little room to expand. For a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, we find that the number of weight restriction days between May and September will increase by 50-100% at four major airports in the United States by 2050-2070 under the RCP8.5 high emissions scenario. These performance reductions may have a significant economic effect on the airline industry, leading to lower profits and higher passenger fares. Increased weight restrictions have previously been identified as potential impacts of climate change, but this study is the first to quantify the effect of higher temperatures on commercial aviation.",

            "abstract": "Here we present volatile (CO2, H2O, F, S, Cl) and major element data from >200 naturally glassy, olivine-hosted melt inclusions and glasses erupted from five seamounts proximal to the Juan de Fuca Ridge. This includes 90 analyses of melt inclusions from the Vance Seamount chain and 126 analyses from two small, mafic (glass MgO > 9 wt%) near-axis cones (T461 and T881). We provide geochemical constraints on both the compositional variations and the depths of crystallization beneath the seamounts using vapor-saturation pressures derived from CO2-H2O concentrations. These data suggest crystallization occurs beneath the two near-axis cones from seafloor pressures to 6400 bars corresponding to depths up to 9 km below the seafloor. This range of crystallization is similar to that calculated from olivine-hosted melt inclusions from the adjacent Juan de Fuca Ridge axis. By contrast, crystallization pressures from Vance Seamounts are more limited with pressures ranging from 400 to 1300 bars or depths of 0.7 to 3.8 km below seafloor. The Vance Seamounts have a prominent peak in depths of crystallization at ~2-3 km below seafloor in histograms, perhaps suggesting that it is the preferred depth of melt storage and crystallization beneath seamounts chains. By contrast, crystallization peaks beneath the small, near-axis cones are less prominent and occur slightly deeper at 3–4 km below seafloor.\nOverall, S and F concentrations in the seamount melt inclusions are similar to on-axis inclusions; however, Cl concentrations in the seamounts are remarkably low. On-axis inclusions have an average of 61 ppm Cl and range from 4–163 ppm. By contrast, Cl concentrations in the seamounts range from 3–82 ppm, but have an average of only 11 ppm. Excess Cl in mid-ocean ridge lavas is often attributed to contamination by seawater or brines associated with hydrothermal circulation. We suggest that the low Cl concentrations in the seamount inclusions may result from either a seamount mantle source that is depleted in Cl compared to the on-axis source (perhaps from a previous melting event on-axis) or it may indicate that the off-axis melt inclusions preserve the true upper mantle compositions, while all on-axis lavas are contaminated by interaction with the pervasive hydrothermal system or previously altered crust.",

In recent decades, large scale peatland fire has occurred frequently in that region, in which many areas of peatland were reclaimed with intention to use the land for forest plantation and rice paddy. We conducted a plot-scale peat burning experiment to elucidate the characteristics of gaseous carbon emission from a tropical peatland fire at the ground level.\nThe experimental site was established at an open area 20 km southeast from Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The size of the burning plot is 4 m in length and 3 m in width. Gas samples were collected at heights of 1.0, 0.5, 0.0 (aboveground), −0.1 and −0.2 m (belowground) through stainless steel and/or aluminum tubes settled across the edge of the plot. The concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4) and particulate matter (PM) was determined. Soil temperature was recorded every 10 minutes 0.1 and 0.2 m below the ground surface. Twelve iron rods were installed in 1-m by 1-m square grid to determine the depth of burn scar.\nAfter ignition, flaming stage of peat burning was ceased within 1-2 hours. The following smoldering stage continued for a week. In the flaming stage, soil temperature at −0.1 m increased tentatively. After the smoldering stage began, the temperature rapidly increased to 350–450°C. Response of soil temperature at −0.2 m was less prominent. Concentrations of gaseous components became maximal in the flaming stage. During the smoldering stage, the concentrations gradually decreased. The influence of burning on CO2 and PM was prominently remained at −0.1 m, whereas those at −0.2 m were not so much. The averaged burnt depth was 5.8±5.1 cm. Based on bulk density of 0.22 g/cm3 and carbon content of 55.5%, the amount of carbon lost from the plot was 85.3 kg. Most of the gaseous carbon was evolved as CO2. The second major emission form was CO, which increased from 7% in the flaming stage to about 20% in the smoldering stage. The proportions of CH4 and PM were consistently small.",

            "abstract": "We present a detailed analysis of the suitability of a network with four densely placed, continuous carbon measurement sites located on the Swiss Plateau for regional-scale (~100-500 km) carbon exchange studies. Two sites are located atop mountain ridges approximately 500 m above the valley floor, one site is a small tower in flat terrain, and one site is a 212 m tall tower atop a gentle hill. The analysis concentrates on the evaluation of a regional numerical weather prediction model’s ability to represent the local meteorology, and on source sensitivities (footprints) simulated with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model. Simulated and measured meteorology compares very well for the flatland sites whereas the mountaintop site comparisons illustrate discrepancies in simulated meteorological variables due to the inability of the model to resolve the complex topography. Furthermore, the meteorological comparison suggests an accurate representation of the convective boundary layer over the Swiss Plateau on average. We find large differences between the simulated footprint extents in winter and summer and between summer's nocturnal and daily footprint, illustrating the ability of simulations to represent seasonal and diurnal variability. We find that far-field influence increases with increasing measurement height as well as being dependent on local topography-induced flow patterns. This study illustrates the fruitfulness of simulated and measured meteorology comparison and detailed analysis of footprint simulations, and we argue that similar analysis is a necessary initial step for regional carbon exchange studies. The four measurement sites with the CarboCount CH project complement one another to represent typical land cover types for Switzerland and Europe, and provide information rich data sets for forthcoming regional carbon exchange studies, of which we also present first results.",

The compilation of our new dataset and published ages in the region presents a new temporal-spatial pattern: (1) Separated by the boundary faults of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis, a temporal gap at 13-7 Ma exists in the cooling history of the study area, with ages younger than 7 Ma clustering within the syntaxis, while ages older than 13 Ma distributing in the Gangdese belt. The gap could be a manifestation of the reactivated rapid cooling of the syntaxis since 7 Ma on the background of slow cooling all over the region, which temporally constrains the initial propagation of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. (2) Ages in the syntaxis and the surrounding region show an annulus shape that younging toward Namche Barwa-Gyala Peri peak that is the core of the syntaxis, from 7-4 Ma and 4-2 Ma in the vicinities to 2-1 Ma in the core, which presents a spatially progressive acceleration in the cooling and exhumation towards the core. This observation indicates that the syntaxis experiences an inward acceleration along a vertical stalk rather than large-scale lateral propagation since late Miocene. The new findings argue that cooling revealed by biotite 40Ar/39Ar method was driven by tectonic contraction. We propose a model for the development of the Namche Barwa syntaxis that dominated by impulsive accelerating and subordinated by progressive accelerating driving by gravitational isostasy.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms control all major biogeochemical cycles, yet the importance of microbial community structure for ecosystem function is widely debated. Indeed, few nutrient cycling models directly account for variation in community structure, leading some researchers to speculate that this information could provide important and missing explanatory power to predict ecosystem function. However, if variation in environmental variables strongly correlates with variation in microbial community composition, then information on microbial community composition may not improve models. Here, we use a data synthesis approach to ask when and where information on the microbial community matters for predictions of ecosystem function. We collated data from approximately 100 different studies and used statistical approaches to ask if models with data on microbial community composition significantly improved models of ecosystem function based on environmental data alone. We found that only 25% of models of ecosystem processes were significantly improved with the addition of data on microbial community composition. Specifically, we found that for phylogenetically broad processes, diversity indicators yielded more significant increases in explanatory power than abundance data. Our results also demonstrate that for phylogenetically narrow processes, qPCR data on functional genes yielded higher explanatory power than for broad processes. Further, we found that all types of data on microbial community composition explained more variation in obligate processes compared to facultative processes. Overall, our results suggest that trait distributions both within communities and within individuals affect the relative importance of microbial community composition for explaining ecosystem function.",

Since the train traffic is active 24 hours, there is no quite time. The train signal is dominating for periods longer than 1 s and is a near field source. The transfer function of the magnetotelluric sounding (MT) is influenced by this near field source, the phase is going to zero and amplitude increase with slope 1 for longer periods. Since this dominating noise is present all day robust magnetotelluric processing technique to identify and remove outliers are not applicable and sufficient.\nThe remote reference technique has successfully been applied for magnetotelluric soundings Combining an disturbed local MT data set with the data of the remote station, which is recording simultaneously the horizontal magnetic fields, can improve the data quality. Finding a good remote station during field survey is difficult and expensive.\nThere is a permanent MT remote reference station in Germany.

            "abstract": "It is well known that river and estuary tides are large enough in many regions of the world. If not probably accounted for, tides hinder hydrologic studies and adversely impact other applications such as storm surge predictions in coastal deltaic regions. In regions deprived of gage data, tides have been detected in estuaries, large rivers, or topographic trapped water bodies using satellite geodetic measurements. However, comprehensive modeling of river or estuary tides with high-spatial resolution (~30 m) remains elusive. Here we use three space geodetic techniques, satellite radar altimetry, GPS, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)/SAR Interferometry data, independently or jointly, in selected regions of coastal wetlands, and rivers to conduct proof of concept studies involving empirical ocean tide modeling. In particular an innovative technique, which infers high-resolution (~30 m) water level observations using polarimetric SAR backscatter data in vegetated estuary, has been developed for empirical tide modeling. In addition to its high spatial resolution, the use of backscatter data would make it easier to construct longer and continuous time series towards resolving tidal frequencies. Despite of the fact that all SAR satellites are on sun synchronous orbits and their data lack the solar tides, we show that some major tidal constituents are indeed retrievable. Here illustrative studies and preliminary tidal modeling results in the Sundarbans mangrove forest estuary, Bangladesh, and the Amazon basin wetlands are presented.",

            "abstract": "In controlled environments, bacteria and suspended sediment particles are linked via the creation of a composite structure (\"bacteria-sediment associations\"; BSA), with associated effects on size, density and hydrodynamics. However, the presence of these particles, and their corresponding effect on sedimentary processes is not well documented in many environments. Here, we compile field data from 20 glacier-fed systems in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, to illustrate: 1) the presence, and (quantity) of bacteria-sediment associations; 2) the presence of in-situ composite particles and their associated settling velocities; 3) the simulated impact of bacteria-sediment associations on settling velocity via controlled manipulation in the laboratory. In general, a significant portion of the fine suspended sediment typical of these systems was associated with bacteria and/or present in a composite-form -- not as primary, individual particles. Four key findings include: 1) Along a 80 kilometre river transect, up to 40% of bacteria were associated with sediment particles; 2) Manipulation of bacteria concentration in the laboratory has revealed a positive relationship between sediment settling velocity, creation of composite particles and bacteria concentration; 3) Composite particles dominated the suspended sediment load among all 20 systems, especially for larger particles; and 4) Measurements reveal these composite particles are settling at rates significantly below that predicted by Stokes Law. The formation of composite particles is especially important in lakes where laminated sediments are used for paleoenvironmental reconstruction (varved), as bacteria can modulate the rate at which some of this sediment reaches the lake floor. These results highlight the importance of bacteria in Earth surface processes and, more specifically, the sediment dynamics within glacier-fed systems.",

            "abstract": "In many dynamic vegetation models, degradation of the tropical forests is induced because they assume that productivity falls rapidly when temperatures rise in the region of 30-40°C. Apart plant respiration, this is due to the assumptions on the temperature optima of photosynthetic capacity, which are low and can differ widely between models, where in fact hardly any empirical information is available for tropical forests. Even less is known about the possibility that photosynthesis will acclimate to changing temperatures. The objective of this study to is to provide better estimates for optima, as well as to determine whether any acclimation to temperature change is to be expected.\nWe present both new and hitherto unpublished data on the temperature response of photosynthesis of Amazon rainforest trees, encompassing three sites, several species and five field campaigns. Leaf photosynthesis and its parameters were determined at a range of temperatures. To study the long-term (seasonal) acclimation of this response, this was combined with an artificial, in situ, multi-season leaf heating experiment.\nThe data show that, on average for all non-heated cases, the photosynthetic parameter Vcmax weakly peaks between 35 and 40 ˚C, while heating does not have a clearly significant effect. Results for Jmax are slightly different, with sharper peaks. Scatter was relatively high, which could indicate weak overall temperature dependence. The combined results were used to fit new parameters to the various temperature response curve functions in a range of DGVMs. The figure shows a typical example: while the default Jules model assumes a temperature optimum for Vcmax at around 33 ˚C, the data suggest that Vcmax keeps rising up to at least 40 ˚C. Of course, calculated photosynthesis, obtained by applying this Vcmax in the Farquhar model, peaks at lower temperature. Finally, the implication of these new model parameters for modelled climate change impact on modelled Amazon forests will be assessed, where it is expected that predicted die-back will be less.",

            "abstract": "Using a multi-model/multi-parameter ensemble consisting of (i) eight combinations of global and regional climate models, (ii) two statistical downscaling methods, and (iii) the HBV hydrological model with 25 calibrated parameter sets, we simulated daily discharge for a control (1961-1990) and future period (2071-2099) to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on flood seasonality and flood generating processes (FGPs) in six catchments with mixed snowmelt-rainfall regimes in Norway. For the catchments in northern and south-eastern Norway, we found more frequent autumn and winter events (partly also of higher magnitude) leading to possible shifts in the current flood regime from spring and early summer to autumn and winter. The possible shifts in flood regimes correspond to an increasing importance of rainfall as a FGP in all catchments considered, while rainfall replaces snowmelt as the dominant FGP in those catchments showing the largest changes in flood seasonality. The analysis of the relative role of the single ensemble components in contributing to overall uncertainty show that hydrological model parameter uncertainty is highest in those catchments showing the largest shifts in flood seasonality and FGPs. This points to difficulties in the time-transferability of the calibrated hydrological parameter sets under changing hydrometeorological conditions and highlights the need of alternative calibration approaches.\nIn this study, we detect time periods in the observation data sets of catchments showing changes in observed hydrometeorological conditions and differing phases of predominant flood seasonality. The HBV model is calibrated for the detected time periods using the Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) global optimization algorithm, and split sampling tests are applied to study the role of the calibrated hydrological parameter sets under changing conditions. Preliminary results show that the hydrological model parameters are sensitive to the different calibration periods. The approach allows for detecting hydrological parameter sets which are better suited to simulate discharge for future conditions and which may help to reduce hydrological parameter uncertainty in the assessment of climate change impacts on flood seasonality and its underlying generation processes.",

            "abstract": "The Advanced Simulation Capabililty for Environmental Management (ASCEM) program is developing an approach and open-source tool suite for standardized risk and performance assessments at legacy nuclear waste sites. These assessments begin with simplified models, and add geometric and geologic complexity as understanding is gained. The Platform toolsets (Akuna) generates these conceptual models and Amanzi provides the computational engine to perform the simulations, returning the results for analysis and visualization.\nIn this presentation we highlight key elements of the design, algorithms and implementations used in Amanzi. In particular, the hierarchical and modular design is aligned with the coupled processes being sumulated, and naturally supports a wide range of model complexity. This design leverages a dynamic data manager and the synergy of two graphs (one from the high-level perspective of the models the other from the dependencies of the variables in the model) to enable this flexible model configuration at run time. Moreover, to model sites with complex hydrostratigraphy, as well as engineered systems, we are developing a dual unstructured/structured capability. Recently, these capabilities have been collected in a framework named Arcos, and efforts have begun to improve interoperability between the unstructured and structured AMR approaches in Amanzi. To leverage a range of biogeochemistry capability from the community (e.g., CrunchFlow, PFLOTRAN, etc.), a biogeochemistry interface library was developed called Alquimia.\nTo ensure that Amanzi is truly an open-source community code we require a completely open-source tool chain for our development. We will comment on elements of this tool chain, including the testing and documentation development tools such as docutils, and Sphinx. Finally, we will show simulation results from our phased demonstrations, including the geochemically complex Savannah River F-Area seepage basins.",

            "abstract": "The geographic remoteness of the ultraslow Gakkel Ridge in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean raises many questions about the nature and biogeography of its habitats. In 2001, the two-ice-breaker mission AMORE (RV POLARSTERN and USCGC HEALY) detected hydrothermal plumes and evidence for seafloor venting associated with volcanic ridges rising from the rift valley floor of 4.2 km depth (Edmonds et al., 2003; Michael et al., 2003). The AURORA expedition in July 2014 (RV POLARSTERN Cruise PS86) targeted this “Aurora” field at the SW limit of Gakkel Ridge, to investigate its habitats, communities and their energy sources. No robots can yet be deployed through ice-cover to explore such deep habitats and ice-breaking research vessels cannot hold position in the thick multiyear ice. Instead, we estimated ice-drift to predict suitable start positions, then attached POLARSTERN to a matching ice floe, to achieve the bottom trajectories that we required for targeted exploration. The Aurora mount is volcanic in origin formed from mounded pillow basalts overlain by about a meter of sediment and cut through by steep cliffs revealing basalt pillows in outcrop and in talus piles. We identified persistent plume activity in the water column above the mount at 3100-3600 m (800-300 m off-bottom of its top) characterized by anomalies in turbidity, Eh, methane, temperature, density, and elevated microbial chemoautotrophic activity. Using a towed camera-, and multisensor- platform (OFOS) we located active venting as the source of this plume together with inactive chimneys and associated craters on the SW flank of Mt.Aurora. Its dominantly filter-feeding fauna is apparently sustained by venting of energy-rich fluids and microbial transfer of this geofuel into nutrition. This communication presents first results of our recent fieldwork and experimental investigations in Summer 2014 to explore deep-sea ecosystems in ice-covered oceans.",

In the geosciences, it is commonly used to describe petroleum reservoir and seal rocks as well as to grade aggregates for the design of asphalt and portland cement concretes. It's wide utility stems from its ability to characterize a wide range of pore throat sizes (from nanometers to around a millimeter). The fundamental physical model underlying mercury intrusion porosimetry, the Washburn Equation, is based on the assumption that rock porosity can be described as a bundle of cylindrical tubes. 3D printing technology, also known as rapid prototyping, allows the construction of intricate and accurate models, exactly what is required to build models of rock porosity. We evaluate the applicability of the Washburn Equation by comparing properties (like porosity, pore and pore throat size distribution, and surface area) computed on digital porosity models (built from CT data, CAD designs, or periodic geometries) to properties measured via mercury intrusion porosimetry on 3D printed versions of the same digital porosity models.",

Satellite weather observations are critical for effective monitoring of the developments, propagations and disseminations of cold clouds and their expected adverse weather conditions as they move across national and transnational boundaries. The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) which is the national weather service provider for Nigeria, utilizes an array of satellite products obtained from mainly the European Meteorological Satellite (EUMETSAT) for its routine weather and climate monitoring and forecasts. Overtime, NiMet has used weather workstations such as MSG, SYNERGIE and now PUMA for accessing satellite products such as RGB, Infra-red, Water vapour and the Multi-sensor Precipitation Estimate (MPE) obtained at near real-time periods.\nThe satellite imageries find extensive applications in the delivery of early warning of raising of severe weather conditions such as dust storm and dust haze during the harmattan season (November – February); and thunderstorm accompanied by severe lightning and destructive strong winds. The paper will showcase some special cases of the tracking of squall lines and issuance of weather alerts through the media. The good result is that there was limited damage to infrastructure and no loss of life from the flash floods caused by the heavy rainfall from the squally thunderstorm.",

Understanding the degree to which food production and consumption relies on trade is vital to understanding how to sustainably meet growing food demands across scales. We use detailed bilateral trade statistics and data on agricultural management to examine the land use and water consumption embodied in agricultural trade, which we relate to basic nutritional indicators to show how trade contributes to food availability worldwide. Agricultural trade carries enough calories to provide >1.7 billion people a basic diet each year. We identify key commodities and producer-consumer relationships that disproportionately contribute to embodied resource use and flows of food nutrition at the global scale. For example, just 15 disproportionately large soybean trades comprised ~10% the total harvested area embodied in export production. We conclude by framing these results in terms of the fraction of each country’s food production and consumption that is linked to international trade. These findings help to characterize how countries allocate resources to domestic versus foreign food demand.",

            "abstract": "Electron distributions in the exhaust region of magnetotail reconnection with negligible guide field have been reported to be hot and isotropic in previous studies. Here we examined the electron distributions in 32 exhaust regions encountered by the Cluster spacecraft in the magnetotail and document various types of anisotropy. Field-aligned beams are observed in nearly all events. The dominant exhaust distribution is hot and isotropic in 17 events, cold and isotropic in seven events, and hybrid in eight events. The hybrid distribution consists of field-aligned lower energy electrons and isotropic higher energy electrons. Counter-streaming beams are dominant in four of these hybrid events. High energy (>2keV) populations with T_e_perp > T_e_para in addition to counter-streaming beams are frequently observed when the spacecraft are close to the neutral plane (Bx ~ 0), indicating perpendicular heating near the magnetic pile-up region. In exhaust regions with hot and isotropic electron distributions, the peak ion outflow speed is significantly larger and density lower than that in the exhaust with cold and isotropic electrons. We suggest that the cold isotropic exhaust distributions are from the early stages of reconnection, the hot isotropic exhaust distributions are from the well-developed stage, and the hybrid exhaust distributions may indicate a different type of reconnection with the upstream source in the plasma sheet rather than the lobe.",

            "abstract": "To understand the spatial and temporal distribution of deformation (e.g., underplating and exhumation of metamorphic rocks) and earthquakes in subduction zones, it is important to constrain the rheological properties of metamorphic rocks (i.e., altered oceanic crust and sediments), and how they evolve during metamorphic reactions following hydration, carbonation and dehydration of the down-going slab.\nWe conducted triaxial deformation experiments on three mafic schists with various peak metamorphic conditions: a lawsonite-blueschist, a greenschist, and an epidote-amphibole schist, using Griggs-type solid pressure- medium apparatus. Constant strain rate experiments and strain rate stepping experiments were conducted at confining pressures (Pc) from 0.76-2GPa, temperatures (T) from 300-600C and strain rates from 10-5-10-71/s.\nAt a confining pressure of 1 GPa, temperature of 400C and strain rate of 10-5 1/s, differential stresses σd for all mafic schists were higher than 1 GPa. The lawsonite-blueschist and greenschist samples were weaker than epidote-amphibolite samples under all experimental conditions. All types of samples exhibit high stress exponent (> 15) and strain rate strengthening; frictional behavior that inhibits earthquake nucleation. Differential stress increased with increasing confining pressure, while friction coefficient decreased with increasing confining pressure and temperature. The nominal friction coefficient for the lawsonite-blueschist and the greenschist samples was 0.3 to 0.35, values which predict stresses below the Goetze criterion (σd < Pc). Microstructures of recovered samples showed modest buckling and several localized shear zones. These features suggest that the deformation of mafic schist is accommodated by semi-brittle deformation resulting in strain localization on faults. Such weak and aseismic fault zones in subducting slab might promote detachment of oceanic crust from the subducting slab and allow underplating to forearc crust.",

            "abstract": "Natural weathering of ultramafic rocks in mine tailings allows the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 through the formation of magnesium carbonates. The Dumont Nickel Project (DNP) is being studied to estimate the CO2 sequestration potential of future mining residues and to evaluate the impact of mineral carbonation on the quality of mine waste drainage water. For this purpose, experimental cells were built and instrumented in 2011. The first was constructed using milling waste and the second with mining waste. Laboratory characterization of residues and field observations will be combined to propose a quantitative model of mineral carbonation and metal leaching.\nA decrease of CO2 concentration in the mining waste cell, from atmospheric concentrations (~390 ppmv) near the surface of the cell to ~100 ppmv near the bottom, reflects active CO2 consumption by the residues. This cell contains mining waste with a large grain size distribution ranging from blocks (<40cm) to silt-size grains. Magnesium-rich minerals such as lizardite, chrysotile and brucite are the major minerals in the residues. Mineralogical analyses (XRD, SEM and EPMA) reveal precipitation of brugnatellite and hydromagnesite, with a lamellar texture on the surface of serpentine grains. In order to better identify the different processes involved in carbonation, the carbon isotopic composition of the interstitial gases was analysed in-situ with a WS-CRDS instrument. An increase of d13C(air) from -8‰ to ~2 ‰ is correlated with the decrease in CO2 concentration within the cell, and can be explained by dissolution of atmospheric CO2 in interstitial water (Dco2-DIC 11‰) in the DNP mining residues. As gas advection is slow, CO2 supply driven by diffusion is the limiting step in the experimental cell. CO2 dissolution in interstitial water under this limited CO2 supply condition enriches 13C in residual CO2 in interstitial air. Optimized mineral carbonation reactions in DNP mining waste will require an unconstrained CO2 supply.",

            "abstract": "Methanogenesis, unlike many higher energy-yielding metabolisms, can be exergonic in the reverse direction at reasonable concentrations of products and reactants. This is because the ΔGf for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, 4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + H2O, is quite low, and also because hydrogen exerts a fourth-power control on the reaction quotient. This means that common sedimentary metabolisms such as sulfate reduction and metal reduction can draw hydrogen concentrations low enough as a result of their metabolism to make reverse methanogenesis, or anaerobic methane oxidation, exergonic and potentially a useful energy source for life. Previous work has provided evidence for reverse methanogenesis in marine sediments, but an organism capable of both forward and reverse methanogenesis has not been identified. We present evidence in support of the theory that anaerobic methanotrophs (ANME), which are commonly found in methane producing environments, are capable of growth under methanogenic conditions in anoxic incubations of marine sediments from Cape Lookout Bight, NC. Coupled to a large body of literature studying the participation of ANME archaea in methanotrophy (as well as having molecular machinery for methanogenesis), we propose that these difficult-to-culture organisms can also perform methanogenesis when conditions dictate that methanogenesis is exergonic.",

            "abstract": "Following intense rainfalls, during spring 2013 a first-time sliding failure developed over a gentle cultivated slope in Northern Apennines. The slope is made of weakly cemented layered sandstones and subordinate siltstones and mudstones of Eocene age. The morphology is fairly regular with an average angle of 15° that increases up to 25° in the lower part of the slope where the pelitic fraction is no longer present in the bedrock succession. Bedding generally dips into the slope though the presence of faults locally complicate the setting. The sliding interested the upper, more gentle part of the slope with a maximum depth of 10 to 15 meters. Morphological evidences indicate a rotational component of movement and rocks outcropping along the scarp show a moderate degree of weathering. The main landslide body maintained its coherence and only a minor part of the toe mobilized as a fast-moving flow. No building nor infrastructure was affected by the movement but a railway viaduct is present in the lower part of the slope. Following the 2013 failure, movements and pore pressures were monitored in the landslide deposit to control the evolution of the phenomena. During the following winter, the abundant precipitation caused a reactivation of the movement that led to a much larger fast-moving flow. In this work, we document the sequence of events that has interested the slope during the years 2013-2014. Subsequent ground-based and aerial topographic surveys allow to estimate the volumes involved in the different phases of movement. Field evidences and investigations are used to interpret the geotechnical model of the slope and constrain the range of resistances mobilized at failure. The deformations preceding the 2014 reactivation are analyzed together with post-failure landslide deceleration. It is shown that displacements proceeded maintaining sustained moderate velocities for days before the catastrophic reactivation, making difficult to anticipate the acceleration. It took months, and the arrive of the dry season, to return displacement to slow to very slow rates.",

            "abstract": "Water scarcity has become widespread all over the world. Current methods for water scarcity assessment are mainly based on water quantity and seldom consider water quality. Here, we develop an approach for assessing water scarcity considering both water quantity and quality. In this approach, a new water scarcity index is used to describe the severity of water scarcity in the form of a water scarcity meter, which may help to communicate water scarcity to a wider audience. To illustrate the approach, we analyzed the historical trend of water scarcity for Beijing city in China during 1995–2009, as well as the assessment for different river basins in China. The results show that Beijing made a huge progress in mitigating water scarcity, and that from 1999 to 2009 the blue and grey water scarcity index decreased by 59% and 62%, respectively. Despite this progress, we demonstrate that Beijing is still characterized by serious water scarcity due to both water quantity and quality. The water scarcity index remained at a high value of 3.5 with a blue and grey water scarcity index of 1.2 and 2.3 in 2009 (exceeding the thresholds of 0.4 and 1, respectively). As a result of unsustainable water use and pollution, groundwater levels continue to decline, and water quality shows a continuously deteriorating trend. To curb this trend, future water policies should further decrease water withdrawal from local sources (in particular groundwater) within Beijing, and should limit the grey water footprint below the total amount of water resources.",

            "abstract": "The alternate wetting and drying (AWD) technology for rice production does not only save 15-30% of irrigation water, it also reduces methane emissions by up to 70%. AWD is defined by periodic drying and re-flooding of a rice field. Due to its high mitigation potential and its simplicity to execute this practice AWD has gained a lot of attention in recent years.\nThe Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) has put AWD high on its agenda and funds a project to guide implementation of this technology in Vietnam, Bangladesh and Colombia. One crucial activity is a biophysical suitability assessment for AWD in the three countries. For this, we analyzed rainfall and soil data as well as potential evapotranspiration to assess if the water balance allows practicing AWD or if precipitation is too high for rice fields to fall dry.\nIn my talk I will outline key factors for a successful large-scale implementation of AWD with a focus on the biophysical suitability assessment. The seasonal suitability maps that we generated highlight priority areas for AWD implementation and guide policy makers to informed decisions about meaningful investments in infrastructure and extension work.",

            "abstract": "Photosynthesis is the ultimate process that determines crop performance. Changes in environmental conditions subject vegetation to different stresses determining dynamics of photosynthetic rate. In this context, techniques that allow the quantification of spatial and temporal patterns of photosynthesis at different scales would be of great use.\nHyperspectral reflectance techniques have often failed to quantify actual photosynthetic light use efficiency and only allow measuring pigment content and canopy structure. Alternatively passive detection of Sun Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) has the potential to be used in the quantification of the actual photosynthetic rate. Chlorophyll fluorescence is emitted from the core of the photosynthetic machinery and is closely related to vegetation stress, reflecting functional limitations of photosynthetic carbon gain.\nIn this study we aim to assess the potential of SIF to quantify the functional status of photosynthesis in crops. Hereby we present a summary of results obtained at different vegetation levels. Applying the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle we estimated SIF from point and imaging hyperspectral data at leaf and canopy level. For the larger scale, the data were collected using HyPlant, the high performance airborne imaging spectrometer.\nWe expect that local and airborne measurements will greatly facility the development of a potential satellite mission FLEX (FLuorescence Explorer), which is currently under evaluation by the European Space Agency. The FLEX mission proposed to launch a satellite for the global monitoring of steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence in terrestrial vegetation.",

            "abstract": "The Gusandong Tuff is an extensive rhyolitic ignimbrite that has been used as an excellent key bed in the Cretaceous Gyeongsang Basin, SE Korea. Magnetic fabric analysis in the tuff, using AMS (Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility) technique, shows an anomalous fabric which has horizontal k3 and vertical k1 axes in several sites. The fabric is interpreted to be an inverse one attributed to single-domain magnetites. We attempted a stepwise thermal treatment to investigate the changes of AMS axes and parameters (T, PJ) in four sites (KT11B, KT11M, KT18B, KT18M). All these sites dominantly include the specimens showing the anomalous fabric. Rock magnetism shows that magnetites are the main carrier of the AMS fabric. The changing patterns of magnetic fabric during heating are classified into 4 types: (1) Type-0 is characterized by unchanged three principal axes (k1, k2, k3) over all heating steps. (2) Type-I shows the exchange of k1 and k2 axes each other. (3) Type-II is characterized by the exchange of k2 and k3 axes each other. (4) Type-III shows that three principal axes switch their positions with one another. Except for Type-0, most of the magnetic fabrics are transformed gradually. The directional changes of the axes begin between 450-580°C and then terminate near 670°C. After the thermal treatment, all the fabrics become geologically normal as vertical k3 and horizontal k1 axes. It is also notable that the beginning temperatures are nearly equal to those of inflection points in the T-PJ plots. In the sites KT18B and KT18M which showed girdle-distributed and vertical k1 axes, respectively, before the treatment, all the k1 axes become horizontally and co-directionally clustered after the treatment. This result indicates that the thermal treatment can be a strongly useful tool for eliminating the inverse AMS magnetic fabric of natural rocks. The changes of axis orientation and magnitude observed in this study can be reasonably explained with the theoretical inverse fabric model proposed by Rochette et al. (1992) and Ferré (2002). The gradual transformation of the magnetic fabrics is, however, out of accord with the model. This discrepancy is probably caused by the heterogeneity of natural rocks which have various compositions, grain sizes, orientations, shapes, and anisotropy degrees of constituent minerals.",

The objective of this study is to assess the uncertainty of the CMIP5 downscaled general circulation models (GCM). We performed an analysis of the daily, monthly, seasonal and annual variability of precipitation downloaded from the Downscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 Climate and Hydrology Projections website for the state of Louisiana, USA at 0.125° x 0.125° resolution. A data set of daily gridded observations of precipitation of a rectangular boundary covering Louisiana is used to assess the validity of 21 downscaled GCMs for the 1950–1999 period. The following statistics are computed using the CMIP5 observed dataset with respect to the 21 models: the correlation coefficient, the bias, the normalized bias, the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the root mean square error (RMSE). A measure of variability simulated by each model is computed as the ratio of its standard deviation, in both space and time, to the corresponding standard deviation of the observation. The correlation and MAPE statistics are also computed for each of the nine climate divisions of Louisiana. Some of the patterns that we observed are: 1) Average annual precipitation rate shows similar spatial distribution for all the models within a range of 3.27 to 4.75 mm/day from Northwest to Southeast. 2) Standard deviation of summer (JJA) precipitation (mm/day) for the models maintains lower value than the observation whereas they have similar spatial patterns and range of values in winter (NDJ). 3) Correlation coefficients of annual precipitation of models against observation have a range of -0.48 to 0.36 with variable spatial distribution by model. 4) Most of the models show negative correlation coefficients in summer and positive in winter. 5) MAE shows similar spatial distribution for all the models within a range of 5.20 to 7.43 mm/day from Northwest to Southeast of Louisiana. 6) Highest values of correlation coefficients are found at seasonal scale within a range of 0.36 to 0.46.",

The areas offshore of the mid-Atlantic and northeast states are highly favorable to the development of offshore wind farms, and determining the optimal layout for these wind farms is key to their success. We utilize the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to study the influence of wake effects from different wind farm array geometries on the power production of each farm. Using an idealized version of WRF, we are able to use the wind climatology from a NOAA observational buoy near the Delaware Wind Energy Area (WEA) to evaluate the potential wind farm performance during a climatological average year. We then extend these techniques on a regional scale, evaluating performance of farms located in different offshore WEAs. Finally, by using WRF to model the entire region, we evaluate the wind farms’ interactions with one another under various meteorological scenarios in order to account for seasonal wind variability and load requirements.",

            "abstract": "NASA Earth science observations, models, analyses, and applications made significant contributions to numerous aspects of the Third National Climate Assessment (NCA) report and are contributing to sustained climate assessment activities. The agency’s goal in participating in the NCA was to ensure that NASA scientific resources were made available to understand the current state of climate change science and climate change impacts. By working with federal agency partners and stakeholder communities to develop and write the report, the agency was able to raise awareness of NASA climate science with audiences beyond the traditional NASA community. To support assessment activities within the NASA community, the agency sponsored two competitive programs that not only funded research and tools for current and future assessments, but also increased capacity within our community to conduct assessment-relevant science and to participate in writing assessments. Such activities fostered the ability of graduate students, post-docs, and senior researchers to learn about the science needs of climate assessors and end-users, which can guide future research activities. NASA also contributed to developing the Global Change Information System, which deploys information from the NCA to scientists, decision makers, and the public, and thus contributes to climate literacy. Finally, NASA satellite imagery and animations used in the Third NCA helped the pubic and decision makers visualize climate changes and were frequently used in social media to communicate report key findings. These resources are also key for developing educational materials that help teachers and students explore regional climate change impacts and opportunities for responses.",

            "abstract": "In the course of the energy transition, the number of shallow geothermal systems is constantly growing. These systems allow the exploitation of renewable energy from the subsurface, reduced CO2 emission and additionally, energy storage. An efficient performance of geothermal systems strongly depends upon the availability of exploration data (e.g. thermal conductivity distribution). However, due to high exploration costs, the dimensioning of smaller plants (< 30 kW) is generally based on literature values. While standard in-situ-tests are persistent for larger scale projects, they yield only integral values, e.g. entire length of a borehole heat exchanger. Hence, exploring the distribution of the thermal conductivity as important soil parameter requires the development of new cost-efficient technologies.\nThe general relationship between the electrical (RE) and the thermal resistivity (RT) can be described as\nlog(RE) = CR log(RT)\nwith CRas a multiplier depending on additional soil parameter (e.g. water content, density, porosity, grain size and distribution). Knowing the influencing factor of these additional determining parameters, geoelectrical measurements could provide a cost-efficient exploration strategy of the thermal conductivity for shallow geothermal sites. The aim of this study now is to define the multiplier CRexperimentally to conclude the exact correlation of the thermal and electrical behavior.\nThe set-up consists of an acrylic glass tube with two current electrodes installed at the upper and lower end of the tube. Four electrode chains (each with eight electrodes) measure the potential differences in respect to an induced heat flux initiated by a heat plate. Additional, eight temperature sensors measure the changes of the temperature differences. First, we use this set-up to analyze the influence of soil properties based on differing homogenous sediments with known chemical and petro-physical properties. Further, we analyze the influence of the water content by using differing saturation levels. Based on these values, we will define the multiplier CR and finally determine the exact correlation between the thermal and the electrical resistivity.",

Several parameterizations for e.g. convective cloud formation exist, but information on spatial subgrid variation of the cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs) sized aerosol concentration is not known.\nWe quantify this variation as a function of the spatial scale by using datasets from airborne aerosol measurement campaigns around the world including EUCAARI LONGREX, ATAR, INCA, INDOEX, CLAIRE, PEGASOS and several regional airborne campaigns in Finland. The typical shapes of the distributions are analyzed. When possible, we use information obtained by CCN counters. In some other cases, we use particle size distribution measured by for example SMPS to get approximated CCN concentration. Other instruments used include optical particle counters or condensational particle counters.\nWhen using the GCM models, the CCN concentration used for each the grid-box is often considered to be either flat, or as an arithmetic mean of the concentration inside the grid-box. However, the aircraft data shows that the concentration values are often lognormal distributed. This, combined with the subgrid variations in the land use and atmospheric properties, might cause that the aerosol-cloud interactions calculated by using mean values to vary significantly from the true effects both temporary and spatially. This, in turn, can cause non-linear bias into the GCMs.\nWe calculate the CCN aerosol concentration distribution as a function of different spatial scales. The measurements allow us to study the variation of these distributions within from hundreds of meters up to hundreds of kilometers. This is used to quantify the potential error when mean values are used in GCMs.",

            "abstract": "The geophysical detection of ice in the Cryosphere is typically conducted by measuring the absence of water. These interpretations can become non-unique in dry soils or in clay- and silt-rich soils that contain significant quantities of unfrozen water. Extensive laboratory measurements of electrical properties were made on permafrost samples as a function of frequency, temperature, and water content. These laboratory measurements show that the amount of ice can be uniquely obtained by measuring a frequency dependence of the electrical properties over a large frequency range (20 kHz - 10 Hz). In addition, the electrical properties of permafrost are temperature dependent, which can allow for an estimate of subsurface temperature. In order to test this approach in the field, we performed field surveys at four locations in Alaska. We used three low frequency electromagnetic methods: Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP: 20 kHz - 10 Hz), Capacively Coupled Resistivity (CCR: OhmMapper - 16.5 kHz), and DC Resistivity (Syscal ~ 8 Hz). At the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory permafrost tunnel near Fox, AK, we used SIP to measure the average ice concentration of 80 v% and determined the temperature to be –3±1°C by matching survey results to lab data. SIP data acquisition is very slow; therefore, at three sites near Tok, AK, we used CCR to perform reconnaissance of the area. Then SIP and DC resistivity were performed at anomalous areas. The three survey types give very similar absolute resistivity values. We found that while SIP gives the most quantitative results, the frequency dependence from the CCR and DC resistivity surveys is all that are needed to determine ice content in permafrost.",

            "abstract": "The Nile River is the longest in the world with a length of 6,800 km. However, the contrast between the length of the river or the size of the basin and the comparatively small volume of basin runoff generated is a unique feature of the Nile Basin. Due to non-availability of in-situ hydrologic data, we do not clearly understand the spatial distribution of hydrologic sources and sinks and how much they control input–output dynamics? In this study, we integrated satellite-derived precipitation, and modeled evapotranspiration data (2000–2012) to describe spatial variability of hydrologic sources and sinks in the Nile Basin. We also used long-term gridded runoff and river discharge data (1869–1984) to understand the discrepancy in the observed and expected flow along the Nile River. Results indicate that over 2000–2012 period, 4 out of 11 countries (Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda) in the Nile basin showed a positive water balance while three downstream countries (South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt) showed a negative balance. The top three countries that contribute most to the flow are Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya. The study revealed that ~85% of the runoff generated in the Equatorial region is lost in an inter-station basin that includes the Sudd wetlands in South Sudan; this proportion is higher than the reported loss of 50% at the Sudd wetlands alone. The loss in runoff and flow volume at different sections of the river tend to be more than what can be explained by evaporation losses, suggesting a potential recharge to deeper aquifers that are not connected to the Nile channel systems. On the other hand, we also found that the expected average annual Nile flow at Aswan is larger (97 km3) than the reported amount (84 km3). Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mass deviation in storage data analysis showed that at annual time-scales, the Nile Basin shows storage change is substantial while over longer-time periods, it is minimal (<1% of basin precipitation). Due to the large variations of the reported Nile flow at different locations and time periods, the study recommends increased hydro-meteorological instrumentation of the basin. This study improves our understanding of the spatial dynamics of water sources and sinks in the Nile basin and identified emerging hydrologic questions that require further attention.",

Recently the Tsallis q-entropy has been developed as an alternative to the classical entropy for systems in which entropy may be non-extensive. In stochastic hydrology the velocity is generally modeled as a random field. Alternatively, though rarely done, the macro scale dispersion tensor can be modeled as a random function since it can be considered as a function of the random velocity. We demonstrate how Fickian motion can be generalized so that the Tsallis entropy is maximized rather than the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This generalization results simply from using a random dispersion coefficient, and we derive the distribution of this coefficient as a function of q for 1 < q < 3.",

            "abstract": "Simultaneous heliospheric observations of particles, fields, and plasma on closely connected interplanetary magnetic field lines at large (~AU) distances from one another have large potential for addressing many critical science problems in Heliophysics. These include investigations into particle acceleration and transport, the magnetic structure of the inner heliosphere, and solar wind turbulence. We have determined that spacecraft launched from Earth towards Mars and Venus following a Hohmann minimum energy transfer trajectory provide such opportunities as they have a strong tendency to remain well-connected magnetically to Earth (L1) via the Parker magnetic field in the heliosphere. Along with the finding that magnetic connections also established on the return journeys we refer to this circumstance as the Hohmann-Parker effect. Thus, IMAP placement at L1 would have obvious advantages for human exploration missions to and from Mars. In particular the early mission phases of current and future science missions such as MSL, MAVEN, Solar Orbiter, Mars 2020 and beyond provide opportunities for Heliophysics science gain. We already have predicted and confirmed consequences of the effect as correlated high-energy particle parameters at L1 and MSL. We will reiterate predictions and make WSA-ENLIL simulations for the MAVEN s/c orbital path during its transfer from Earth to Mars in 2013/2014. Moreover, we predict the existence of Hohmann-Parker resonance orbits that reestablish HP-effect conditions and evaluate and compare the science value of various resonance orbits. Smallsat missions on such resonance orbits in combination with IMAP would in the future provide us with enormous recurring science potential to solve key Heliophysics science questions.",

These retrievals, however, may be adversely affected by ice hydrometeors, especially during ice precipitation events, which can be observed in mixed phase clouds. We establish that ice hydrometeors produce enhanced brightness temperatures in high frequency ground-based passive microwave observations. This effect is evident in several years of summer season microwave radiometer data collected at Summit Station, Greenland. Using a multi-instrument suite and coupling measurements with well-established gas and liquid absorption models, we can quantify the ice hydrometeor signature. Better knowledge of these ice effects on the passive microwave observations aids in improvement of retrieved properties, such as liquid water path, when ice is present in the column. Additionally, the use of the active cloud radar guides what regimes exhibit predominately ice precipitation. By clearly identifying the ice signature in the high frequency microwave, we establish a unique platform that can be used to assess ice habit models and particle size distributions for Arctic environments.",

Like hurricanes, ARs are long-lived and originate in the tropics before moving poleward until they make landfall. These moisture-laden storms produce significant precipitation over a few days, which can cause potentially devastating flooding. Despite their destructive power, these storms are also an important component of regional water supply. The positive and negative societal influences of ARs make sound scientific predictions of these storms of great value. We assess the climatology and predictability of these storms globally using the GFDL FLOR coupled model. This high-resolution global model has 50 km resolution in the atmosphere and land surface.

Biogenic carbonate is a particularly useful tool for dating marine terraces, as they record chemical signatures of seawater at the time of formation. However, the primary geochemical methods (marine Sr isotopes, U-series disequilibrium, and U-Pb dating) used to date shallow water fauna older than the late Pleistocene are often subject to open system effects, such as diagenesis (recrystallization and meteoric weathering). This is especially problematic for Sr isotope dating during the Mid-Pliocene, when the 87Sr/86Sr seawater calibration curve shows small changes over time, and small variations in 87Sr/86Sr ratios correspond to large uncertainties in ages. To identify pristine carbonate material that generates reliable seawater Sr isotope ratios, we examined different species of Plio-Pleistocene bivalves and corals from various geographic locations and environments by combining optical images, scanning electron microscope (SEM), cathodoluminescence and x-ray diffraction (XRD) with elemental and Sr isotope analyses of micro-drilled calcite and aragonite layers within individual organisms. The results from this study will help to evaluate the effect of secondary diagenesis and recrystallization on trace element abundances and Sr isotope ratios. Using these methods, we show that reliable ages can be achieved using the Sr isotope seawater curve.",

            "abstract": "The characteristics of a typical CO2 storage system allow simplification strategies for reactive transport simulations based on process decoupling. In such systems the feedback of the slow chemical reactions to hydrodynamics is low until the system reaches a substantial hydrodynamic equilibrium. Furthermore, the presence of CO2 is the main driving force for chemical reactions, which are for most reactants kinetically controlled. Hence, the same reaction path is substantially replicated in all elements of the grid exposed to the injected CO2, either in gaseous or in dissolved form. The analysis of\nfully coupled 3D simulations of the Ketzin pilot site for CO2 storage performed with the TOUGHREACT simulator confirms these hypotheses to a large extent, both in homogeneous and in heterogeneous settings. This allows the definition of a simplified one-way coupling combining independent non-reactive hydrodynamic and batch geochemical models. The exposure time to CO2 of each grid element is estimated by the conservative simulations, then the outcome of one single geochemical model per lithofacies is applied to each grid element. A threshold value for the minimum concentration of dissolved CO2 required to start chemical reactions permits to mitigate the discrepancy due to the lack of a mass balance between the independently run simulations. The comparison with fully coupled simulations validates the novel approach. The simplified coupling can tackle a wide class of problems, not only CO2 storage; it allows calculating reactive chemistry on grids comprising millions of elements, overcoming a major limitation of reactive transport models, which are often bounded to 2D radial domains. This is particularly advantageous in highly heterogeneous settings with complex hydrodynamics. The new coupling is demonstrated at full scale for the Ketzin site with simulations up to 15000 years, a result which cannot yet be achieved by fully coupled simulations.",

            "abstract": "Active plate boundaries are an excellent environment for studying the relative importance of stress sources because their relatively high strain rates and frequent earthquakes provide a wealth of information on the orientation of the stress field and the spatio-temporal variations in crustal strain accumulation. Using southern California as a natural laboratory, we combine models of stress accumulation (fault loading) along the various segments of the southern San Andreas Fault System (SAFS), constrained by geodetic observations, with a uniform horizontal stress field representing a regional tectonic driving stress. The loading time on individual faults within the system, as well as the magnitude and orientation of the principal driving stresses, are adjusted so that the orientation of the total stress tensor is in alignment with the observed in situ stress orientation, as determined from an inversion of earthquake focal mechanisms. Because stress tensor orientation can only constrain the relative magnitude of stress contributions, an additional stress contribution from topography supported in the crust is included so that the resulting total stress field model includes both orientation and a lower bound on magnitude. The optimal stress model, comprised of contributions from topography, fault loading, and regional driving stress, predicts a maximum horizontal principal stress (SHmax) that agrees with focal mechanisms to within the 15º across 75% of the region. The optimal model requires 1) the regional driving stress to be closely aligned to the observed SHmax direction with a differential stress of at least 42 MPa at seismogenic depth, and 2) a loading time of at least 2000 years on the main segments of the SAFS, reflecting a temporal signal that spans multiple earthquake cycles. This suggests earthquakes on these fault segments achieve somewhat less than complete release of the accumulated stress from fault loading, such that the shallow crust is near-critically stressed throughout the earthquake cycle. This has important implications for understanding intraplate seismicity because it supports the assertion that relatively small stresses from unconventional sources could play an important role in determining the timing and location of seismic activity in a critically stressed upper crust.",

To support exploration, tools must be developed to accurately access the radiation environment in both free space and on planetary surfaces. The primary tool NASA uses to quantify radiation exposure behind shielding materials is the space radiation transport code, HZETRN. In order to build confidence in HZETRN, code benchmarking against Monte Carlo radiation transport codes is often used. This work compares the dose calculations at Mars by HZETRN and the GEANT4 application, Planetocosmics. The dose at ground and the energy deposited in the atmosphere by galactic cosmic ray protons and alpha particles has been calculated for the Curiosity landing conditions. In addition, this work has considered Solar Energetic Particle events, which allows for a better understanding of the spectral form in the comparison. The results for protons and alpha particles show very good agreement between HZETRN and Planetocosmics.",

            "abstract": "Resolving the future of the ice in the polar regions requires understanding of the changing ice from top to bottom from the center of the ice sheets to the margin where ice interacts with the polar oceans. The IcePod is an imaging system developed to study the ice sheets and polar oceans in a comprehensive fashion from an LC-130. The system has been developed for initial deployment on the New York National Guard’s ski-equipped LC-130s. The IcePod can resolve high resolution surface elevation with a scanning laser and visual cameras, the temperature of the surface with an infrared camera, the thickness and layering of the shallow snow and ice with a high frequency radar and the thickness of the ice sheet with an ice penetrating radar. The IcePod can be moved between aircraft in less than four hours and can be operated on aircraft on routine cargo missions to skiways.\nHere we present IcePod ice-ocean imaging from the top to the bottom of several major outlet glaciers in western Greenland. The data, acquired in July 2014, demonstrates the broad capabilities of the IcePod instrumentation suite. The IcePod resolved the structure of the ice sheet from the accumulation zone to the calving front of Eqip Glacier and 4 adjacent outlet glacier systems. High resolution mapping of the calving front and the upwelling meltwater plumes provides new insights into the structure and dynamics of the turbulent mixing at the ice-ocean interface. Mapping of the ice sheet margin provides insights into the connections between the surface meltwater and the fate of the subglacial water at the ice sheet base. The Greenland data includes airport passes in every flight for calibration of both the lidar and camera systems.\nAn expanded IcePod instrumentation suite will include a gravity meter and a magnetometer. The gravity meter can be used to determine the bathymetry beneath ice shelves. Together the gravimeter and the magnetometer can be used to constrain the regional tectonic frameworks.\nIn November 2014, the IcePod system will be operated in Antarctica targeting the formation of polynyas, the Ross Ice Shelf structure and stability and the distribution of subglacial water in East Antarctica.",

            "abstract": "An average year the production in Norway and Sweden is around 190 TWh and these two countries stand for about 70% of the hydropower energy stored in the available reservoirs of Europe. There are large challenges for the future use of this regulatory capacity with regard to balancing the electricity production in Europe under climate variability, compliance to water management plans under the Water Framework Directive and to the shifts to more renewable, but intermittent, energy sources required by the Renewable Energy Directive. A main aim of this project is to describe the variation over time of hydrological fluxes across Scandinavia in terms of their energy properties and to link that information to climatic factors and the regulation of hydroelectricty. Along these lines we explored daily data of digitalized hydro-climatological data from 1961, which were used to calibrate the HBV-model for 1001 watersheds in Sweden and the energy potential has been estimated as an average for that period (Figure below). These tentative results show that the surface water energy potential constitutes about one per mille of the latent heat flux due to evapotranspiration and it is, therefore, very sensitive to any fluctuation in the energy quantities of the hydrometeorological system. Tentative analysis suggests that the energy availability of surface water in Sweden exhibits significant decadal long fluctuations from 115 TWh/year up to 180 TWh/year, which follow several different time scales and periodicities, ranging from century-long trends to fluctuations occurring on time scales of a decade and shorter. In addition, recent investigations show that land-use changes and hydropower regulation has caused significant changes in the annual runoff periodicity in Swedish rivers during the 20th century. Those changes in the annual periodicities are caused by structural alterations in river basins affected by intense agriculture and hydropower regulation.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region is both highly variable and rapidly changing. In the Palmer Station region, the ice season duration has decreased by 92 days since 1978. The sea-ice changes affect ocean stratification and freshwater balance; and in turn impact every component of the polar marine ecosystem. Long-term observations from the WAP shelf region show a pattern of chlorophyll (Chl) variability with three to five years of negative Chl anomalies interrupted by one or two years of positive anomalies. Observations and results from an inverse food-web model show that these low and high Chl regimes differed significantly from each other, with high primary productivity and net community production (NCP) associated with the high Chl years and vice-versa. Gross primary production averaged 40 mmolC m-2 d-1 in the low Chl years and 100 mmolC m-2 d-1 in the high Chl years, with 30-40% going to NCP across regimes. Only the food web in the southern region in high Chl years was dominated by large phytoplankton and krill, whereas in in all other cases, foodwebs were dominated by small phytoplankton and microzooplankton. These contrasts were strongest between the northern, low Chl years and southern, high Chl years, consistent with earlier north to south observations of sea ice and ecosystem change along the WAP. The relative importance of major bulk carbon flows did not differ substantially between high and low Chl years. Both the northern/low Chl and southern/high Chl regimes had roughly equal proportions of NCP, although its composition reflected shifts in dominance by large versus small plankton. These results suggest that food webs dominated by smaller phytoplankton and grazers have pathways that funnel production into NCP, and likely, export.",

            "abstract": "To date, a majority of studies relating serpentinization to microbial activities have focused upon the aqueous alteration of ophiolites, or upon hydrothermal systems near mid-ocean ridges. The alteration of ultramafic intrusions in continental settings represents an additional, distinct type of environment that may sustain biogeochemical process related to serpentinization and play important roles in controlling the exchange of carbon and reducing power between the deep Earth and the surface biosphere. Serpentinizing diamondiferous kimberlite intrusions represent a geographically and contextually distinct system to explore the relationship between serpentinization, carbon, and life. A series of deep, ultrabasic wells were sampled near Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Canada in 2012 and 2013 for coupled geochemical and microbiological analyses. The wells were high pH (between 9 and 12) and contained elevated concentrations of H2 and hydrocarbon gases. However, the wells exhibited methane isotopic signatures distinct from one another, which reflect different sources and/or processing mechanisms for the resulting gas. Parallel analyses of microbial abundances and community composition provided insight into the biogeochemistry of these ecosystems. While hydrogen-driven chemolithoautotrophy appeared to be common across all of the wells, based upon the predominance of Betaproteobacteria in tag sequencing analyses of 16S rRNA genes, sequences associated with known methanogens and anaerobic methanotrophs were partitioned between the wells. These results are in stark contrast to existing data on continental serpentinites, which harbor relatively scant evidence for biological methane cycling. Putative biogeochemical roles for the subsurface microbial communities will be discussed and compared in a biogeographic sense to other known serpentinizing ecosystems.",

Pattern formation is commonly linked to competition and facilitation among plants, and variation in runoff and infiltration capacity in the landscape. Based on previous studies, we expect that climate, soil type, and slope to a large degree influence the type of vegetation pattern found at a specific site. We have analyzed to what extent vegetation patterns on the African continent can be predicted based on available climatic, topographic, and soil data. Our focus is not restricted to periodic patterns in drylands, but encompasses a range of tropical ecosystems from arid to humid. Vegetation patterns observed in remote sensing data can be informative regarding the underlying ecological processes that shape the landscape, not only in strikingly periodic vegetation but also in savannas with randomly located or dispersed vegetation. We use high-resolution multispectral and panchromatic remote sensing data classified into woody, herbaceous, and bare ground components. From these images we extract spatial statistical metrics that define type and degree of vegetation patterning. We then relate variables from climate, soil and topographic datasets to the observed patterns in order to determine how well we can predict vegetation patterning and which climatic and edaphic variables are most informative. We discuss the results and the possible sources of uncertainty in the relationships.",

            "abstract": "Goals and objectives for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems often focus on species recovery, but often the primary tools available to managers involve the manipulation of flow regime and physical habitat. Management decisions thus rely on hypotheses about the links between management actions, the response of physical habitat, and the assumed response of a target organism. Ongoing efforts to inform management of the Missouri River as part of Missouri River Restoration Project are focused on the recovery of three endangered species, including the pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus), which is endemic to the Mississippi River basin. Recovery of the pallid sturgeon is hampered by uncertainties surrounding the definition and dynamics of ecologically significant habitats for the fish across a range of life stages. Of special interest are constructed side-channel chutes. Construction of these features has emerged as one of the primary restoration techniques used on the Lower Missouri River, yet much remains to be learned about the effectiveness of these chutes in the effort to recover pallid sturgeon. It remains unclear whether these constructed features provide habitat that may be beneficial to the species and for which life stages. Biologists hypothesize that these areas may be critical for larval retention, refugia, food production, foraging, or spawning. We present the integration of a suite of data – high-resolution hydroacoustic data, hydrodynamic modeling, biotic inventories, and laboratory experiments – designed to refine our understanding of habitat dynamics critical during the early life stages of the pallid sturgeon. We present our findings in the context of ongoing restoration activities in the basin and describe how fundamental science exploring habitat dynamics may be incorporated within the existing adaptive management framework.",
